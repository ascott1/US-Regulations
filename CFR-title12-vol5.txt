                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 1998), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

    (a) The Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision (referred to in 
this chapter as ``Director'' or ``Office'') is responsible for the

may prescribe to provide for the organization, incorporation, 
examination, operation, and regulation of Federal savings associations. 
Under this authority, the Office's functions include, but are not 
limited to, regulation of the corporate structure of such associations, 
regulation of the distribution of their earnings, regulation of their 
lending and other investment powers, acting upon their applications for 
facility offices (including branch offices, limited facilities, mobile 
facilities and satellite offices), the regulation of mergers, 
conversions, and dissolutions involving such associations, the 
appointment of conservators and receivers for such associations, and the 
enforcement of laws, regulations, or conditions against such

<R05>
Sec. 500.6  General statement concerning gender-related terminology.

    The statutes administered by the Office and the rules, regulations, 
policies, practices, publications, directives, and guidelines 
promulgated pursuant to such statutes that prescribe the course and 
methods to be followed by the Office that inadvertently use or contain 
gender-related terminology are to be interpreted as equally applicable 
to either sex.

<R05>
Sec. 500.10  The OTS or The Office.

    The Office of Thrift Supervision (referred to as ``OTS'' or 
``Office'') is an office of the Department of the Treasury. Its 
functions are to charter, supervise, regulate and examine Federal 
savings associations and to supervise, regulate and examine all savings 
associations. It is directed by a Director, who

[[Page 6]]

is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate to a five-year 
term. The Director directs and carries out the mission of the OTS with 
the assistance of offices reporting directly to him. One of these 
offices oversees the direct examination and supervision of savings 
associations by regulatory staff to ensure the safety and soundness of 
the industry.

<R05>
Sec. 500.30  General statement concerning procedures and forms.

    (a) Rules and procedures of the Office are published in chapter V of 
title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations and in supplementary 
material published in the Federal Register. The statutes administered by 
the Office and the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to such 
statutes prescribe the course and method of the formal procedures to be 
followed in proceedings of the Office. These are supplemented where 
practicable by informal procedures designed to aid the public and 
facilitate the execution of the Office's functions. The informal 
procedures of the Office consist principally in the rendering of advice 
and assistance to members of the public dealing with the Office. 
Opinions expressed by members of the staff do not constitute an official 
expression of the views of the Office, but do represent views of persons 
working with the provisions of the statute or regulation involved. The 
Director may, for good cause and to the extent permitted by statute, 
waive the applicability of any provision of this chapter.
    (b) Information with respect to procedures, forms, and instructions 
of the Office is available to the public at the headquarters of the 
Office. Forms of concern to the public consist principally of periodic 
financial reports and of applications to the Office. The Office may from 
time to time require the completion by individuals or savings 
associations of miscellaneous forms, questionnaires, reports, or other 
papers. In each instance, the individual or savings association is given 
actual and timely notice of the scope and contents of the papers in 
question.

    (a) Assessment overview. Each savings association shall pay to the 
Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision an asset-based assessment 
on all of its assets as reported on its most recent consolidated Thrift 
Financial Report available at the time of the billing notice sent in 
accordance with Sec. 502.6(a) of this part, except as provided in 
paragraph (h) of this section. A troubled savings association as defined 
in paragraph (f) of this section shall pay a premium assessment at a 
rate no higher than that specified in paragraph (d) of this section; all 
other institutions shall pay a general assessment at a rate no higher 
than that specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) Computation of assessment. Assessments due pursuant to this 
section shall be computed in the following manner: Each savings 
association falls into one of the seven asset-size brackets denoted by 
columns A and B. A savings association's assessment is composed of two 
parts. The first portion is an assessment on assets up to the lower 
endpoint (column A) of the bracket in which it falls; this portion of 
the assessment is shown in column C. The second portion is an assessment 
on the remaining assets, which are assessed at the rate shown in column 
D. This rate is applied only to the amount in excess of the lower 
endpoint of the bracket. The total assessment is the sum of the assests 
in column C plus the product of the assets in excess of column E times

[[Page 7]]

the rate in column D. Each assessment is based upon the total 
consolidated assets shown in the savings association's most recent 
Thrift Financial Report preceding the payment date. Each savings 
association subject to the supervision of the Office on the date of the 
applicable Thrift Financial Report is subject to the full assessment for 
the next three-month period without proration for any reason.
    (c) General assessment. The amount of the assessment paid by savings 
associations subject to this assessment schedule pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section is computed as follows:

    (e) Frequency. Assessments under this section shall be assessed 
either quarterly or semiannually as determined on an annual basis by the 
Director. Notice of any change in the frequency of the assessment shall 
be published in a Thrift Bulletin at least thirty days before the 
beginning of the next calendar year. If assessments for a particular 
year are on a quarterly basis, such assessments shall be due on January 
31, April 30, July 31, and October 31, representing the three month 
period beginning 30 days before such payment date. If assessments for a 
particular year are semiannual, such assessments shall be due on January 
31 and July 31, representing the six month period beginning 30 days 
before such payment date. For calendar year 1990, assessments shall be 
paid quarterly, beginning with the October 31 assessment. If assessments 
for a later period are semiannual, those assessments shall be at rates 
published in the Thrift Bulletin announcing the change in the frequency 
of the assessment.
    (f) Definition. For purposes of this section only, a troubled 
savings association shall be defined as a savings association with a 
composite rating of 4 or 5, as defined in Sec. 516.3(c) of this chapter. 
A troubled savings institution also includes a savings association in 
conservatorship so long as the association requires increased 
supervision and examination by the Office.
    (g) Director's authority to adjust rates. The Director or his or her 
designee, may, in his or her sole discretion, reduce the assessment 
rates charged under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section if he or she 
determines that the income generated by assessing savings associations 
at the rate set forth in those sections would generate revenues in 
excess of the Office's needs, including both its direct and indirect 
costs and the maintenance of an adequate working capital fund. If the 
Director so determines, he or she shall set uniformly lower rates for 
all savings associations at a level he determines appropriate. Those 
lower rates, and the period for which they shall be in effect, will be 
published as set forth in Sec. 502.6 of this part at least thirty days 
before such lower assessment rates will be charged, except that for 1990 
any lower rates shall be effective upon publication in the Thrift 
Bulletin as set forth in Sec. 502.6 of this part.
    (h) Exception to use of consolidated report for October 31, 1990 
assessment. For the October 31, 1990 assessment only, each savings 
association shall pay to the Director an asset-based assessment on all 
of its assets as reported on its

[[Page 8]]

most recent quarterly Thrift Financial Report.

<R05>
Sec. 502.2  Examination fees for affiliates.

    (a) The Office shall assess a fee to recover the costs of 
examinations of affiliates of savings associations, as defined in 
paragraph (d) of this section completed on or after this rule goes into 
effect.
    (b) For calendar year 1990, a daily fee of $480 shall be charged. 
The fee assessed under paragraph (a) of this section shall be determined 
by multiplying the daily fee by the number of days or portions thereof 
that employees of the Office devote to the examination or investigation 
of affiliates of savings associations as defined in paragraph (d) of 
this section including on-site and off-site examinations and related 
supervisory activities covering time spent after the examination in 
preparing the examination report among other items.
    (c) The daily fee established in paragraph (b) of this section will 
be reviewed not less frequently than annually and published in a Thrift 
Bulletin as set forth in Sec. 502.6 of this part. It shall be no higher 
than the amount determined by dividing the total budget for the expense 
of conducting examinations and investigations of affiliates of savings 
associations by the total number of days projected to be spent 
conducting such examinations and investigations as set forth in 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) The term ``affiliate'' means an affiliate as defined in 12 
U.S.C. 1462(9) (1989), except that for purposes of this part only, the 
term ``affiliate'' does not include any entity that is consolidated with 
a savings association for purposes of the Consolidated Statement of 
Condition of the Thrift Financial Report.


<R05>
Sec. 502.3  Applications processing fees.

    (a) Fees must accompany certain applications, filings, notices, and 
requests (hereafter collectively referred to as ``applications'') before 
such applications will be accepted for processing by the Office. Except 
as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, such fees will be 
determined by the Office according to the method set forth in paragraph 
(b) of this section, will be announced at least annually, and will be 
established at rates calculated to recover the Office's total direct and 
indirect costs of processing such applications during the ensuing 
calendar year after such fees are announced.
    (b) The Office will determine fees for processing applications by:
    (1) Calculating, based on historical data, the average time 
necessary to process each type of application;
    (2) Identifying for the upcoming year the amount to be budgeted for 
processing applications;
    (3) Dividing the amount identified in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section by the total number of hours available for applications 
processing in the ensuing year to yield the average hourly cost for 
processing applications; and
    (4) Multiplying the average hourly cost identified in paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section by the number of hours spent processing each type 
of application identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and 
rounding the result to the nearest increment of $100, with a minimum fee 
of $100. This will yield the amount of the application fee required to 
recover the cost of processing each type of application;
    (5)(i) The Director, or his or her designee, may reduce any fees 
calculated as set forth above to adjust for any inequities or any 
efficiencies or changes in procedure which are projected to result in 
reduced processing costs and which have not been taken into account as a 
result of application of the formula set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) 
through (b)(4) of this section. The Director, or his or her disignee, 
also may adjust downward any fees calculated pursuant to paragraphs 
(b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section if, in the Director's discretion, 
he or she determines that the amount of such fee will unduly or 
unjustifiably discourage applications of a particular type or 
applications for particular categories of transactions.
    (ii) In the event the Office develops a new type of application, and 
thus has no historical basis on which to establish an application fee, 
the Director

[[Page 9]]

may establish such fee based on a comparison with fees charged for 
processing similar types of applications or applications involving 
analysis of similar information, policies, and legal issues.
    (c) The fees determined pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section 
will be published as set forth in Sec. 502.6 of this part at least 
thirty days before such fees are effective, except that in 1990, such 
fees shall be effective ten days after publication in the Thrift 
Bulletin as set forth in Sec. 502.6 of this part.
    (d) The Director shall also charge fees to recover the Office's 
costs of processing filings with the Office made pursuant to 12 CFR 
parts 563b, 563d, and 563g. These fees will be published as set forth in 
Sec. 502.6 of this part at least thirty days before such fees are 
effective, except that in 1990, such fees shall be effective ten days 
after publication in the Thrift Bulletin as set forth in Sec. 502.6 of 
this part.
    (e) In the event that the Office cannot complete its review of an 
application because it is found to be materially deficient and the 
Office accordingly refuses to accept the application for processing, the 
applicant must pay a new application fee at the time of filing any 
revised application.
    (f) All application fees must be paid at the time of filing by check 
payable to the Office of Thrift Supervision. No part of a filing fee is 
refundable.
    (g) When a transaction involves the filing of a number of different 
applications, the appropriate filing fees must be paid for each type of 
application filed, except as otherwise specifically provided in the 
Thrift Bulletin published pursuant to Sec. 502.6 of this part.
    (h) Each submission must be accompanied by a statement of the amount 
of the fee for each application and filing submitted and how the fee was 
calculated.


<R05>
Sec. 502.4  Collection of fees and assessments.

    (a) Debit at Federal Home Loan Banks. Each institution that is 
subject to fees and assessments under Secs. 502.1 and 502.2 of this part 
and a member of a Federal Home Loan Bank, shall establish at its Federal 
Home Loan Bank a demand deposit account for the purpose of paying such 
fees and assessments. Each institution shall maintain funds in such 
account in sufficient amount to pay its obligations to the Office. Each 
Federal Home Loan Bank shall debit such account directly to effectuate 
payment of assessments and fees to the Office. The Director shall mail a 
payment notice to each such institution at least seven days prior to the 
date that any such account is to be debited to pay the member 
institution's obligations to the Office, which notice shall specify the 
date on which the debit is to occur. The Director shall also notify each 
Federal Home Loan Bank that such accounts are to be debited.
    (b) Direct billing of institutions. As an alternative to the payment 
mechanism described in paragraph (a) of this section, the Director may 
collect assessments and fees by sending notice and demand for direct 
payment thereof to an assessed institution. In such case, the 
institution shall pay the assessment or fee not later than the date 
specified in the notice which shall be at least seven days after the 
date of such notice. This payment procedure shall be used to collect 
assessments and fees from assessed institutions that are not members of 
a Federal Home Loan Bank or are affiliates that are not savings 
associations.
    (c) Failure to Pay. If any holding company, affiliate, or subsidiary 
of a savings association fails to pay any fee before the end of the 60-
day period beginning on the date such fee is imposed, following the end 
of the 60-day period, the Director may assess such fee, including 
interest, against and collect it from such savings association. If any 
such entity is a holding company, subsidiary, or affiliate of more than 
one savings association, the fee may be levied against each such savings 
association in such proportion as the Director may prescribe.
    (d) In the case of any savings association for which the Office has 
determined to appoint the Resolution Trust Corporation as conservator or 
receiver, the Office may obtain payment from such savings association 
for fees or assessments due and outstanding under Sec. 502.1, 502.2 or 
502.3 of this part by debiting its account at its local Federal Home 
Loan Bank or by direct billing

[[Page 10]]

pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 502.5  Interest.

    For all institutions, overdue examination fees and asset-based 
assessments shall bear interest. Such interest shall be calculated at a 
rate (to be determined quarterly) equal to 150 percent of the average of 
the bond-equivalent rates of 13-week Treasury bills auctioned during the 
preceding calendar quarter. Asset-based assessment payments shall be 
considered delinquent if received after the time for payment specified 
in Sec. 502.1 of this part as updated by the most recent applicable 
Thrift Bulletin issues pursuant to Sec. 502.6 of this part. Examination 
and investigation fees will be considered delinquent if not received 
within 30 days of the invoice date.


<R05>
Sec. 502.6  Notice of fees.

    (a) A Thrift Bulletin shall be published in the last quarter of each 
year setting forth all fees to be charged by the Office for the next 
calendar year. Thrift Bulletins, providing updated fee schedules, in the 
Director's discretion, may be published from time to time throughout the 
year as necessary. Such Thrift Bulletins may set forth application fees 
to be charged by the Office for new types of applications developed by 
the Office in the period between publication of the annual Thrift 
Bulletins setting forth the fee schedule for the ensuing year.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, fees to cover the 
costs of processing applications received by this Office beginning ten 
days following the publication of the first Thrift Bulletin in 1990 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall be payable immediately.


<R05>
Sec. 502.7  Other charges.

    The Director, or his or her designee, may impose additional charges 
to cover the cost of providing various services, including, but not 
necessarily limited to, publications, seminars, certifications for 
official copies of agency documents and records and services performed 
at the request of other agencies.

<R05>
Sec. 503.2  Exemptions of records containing investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes.

    (a) Scope. The Office has established a system of records, entitled 
the ``Confidential Individual Information System.'' The purpose of this 
system is to assist the Office in the accomplishment of its statutory 
and regulatory responsibilities in connection with supervision of 
savings associations. This system will be exempt from certain provisions 
of the Privacy Act of 1974 for the reasons set forth in paragraph (c) of 
this section.
    (b) Exemptions Under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). (1) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
552a(k)(2), the head of an agency may issue rules to exempt any system 
of records within the agency from certain provisions of the Privacy Act 
of 1974 if the system contains investigatory material compiled for law 
enforcement purposes.
    (2) Provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 from which exemptions will 
be made under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) are as follows:
    (i) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3);
    (ii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1), (d)(2), (d)(3), and (d)(4);
    (iii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1);
    (iv) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(G), (e)(4)(H), and (e)(4)(I); and
    (v) 5 U.S.C. 552a(f).
    (c) Reasons for exemptions under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). (1) 5 U.S.C. 
552a(c)(3) requires that an agency make accountings of disclosures of 
records available to individuals named in the records at their request. 
These accountings must state the date, nature, and purpose of each 
disclosure of a record and the name and address of the recipient. The 
application of this provision would make known to subjects of an 
investigation that an investigation is taking place and that they are 
the subjects of it. Release of such information could result in the 
alteration or destruction

[[Page 12]]

of documentary evidence, improper influencing of witnesses, and 
reluctance of witnesses to offer information, and could otherwise impede 
or compromise an investigation.
    (2) 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1), (d)(2), (d)(3), and (d)(4), (e)(4)(G) and 
(e)(4)(H), and (f), relate to an individual's right to be notified of 
the existence of, and the right to examine, records pertaining to such 
individual. Notifying an individual at the individual's request of the 
existence of records and allowing the individual to examine an 
investigative file pertaining to such individual, or granting access to 
an investigative file, could:
    (i) Interfere with investigations and enforcement proceedings;
    (ii) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of 
others;
    (iii) Disclose the identity of confidential sources and reveal 
confidential information supplied by those sources; or
    (iv) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures.
    (3) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(I) requires the publication of the 
categories of sources of records in each system. Application of this 
provision could disclose investigative techniques and procedures and 
cause sources to refrain from giving such information because of fear of 
reprisal, or fear of breach of promises of anonymity and 
confidentiality, thus compromising the agency's ability to conduct 
investigations and to identify, detect, and apprehend violators.
    (4) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) requires each agency to maintain in its 
records only information about an individual that is relevant and 
necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required by statute or 
Executive Order. Limiting the system as described would impede 
enforcement activities because:
    (i) It is not always possible to determine the relevance or 
necessity of specific information in the early stages of an 
investigation; and
    (ii) In any investigation the Office may obtain information 
concerning violations of laws other than those within the scope of its 
jurisdiction. In the interest of effective law enforcement, the Office 
should retain this information to aid in establishing patterns of 
criminal activity, and to provide leads for those law enforcement 
agencies charged with enforcing criminal or civil laws.
    (d) Documents exempted. Exemptions will be applied only when 
appropriate under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k).

of the powers enumerated in Sec. 509.5 of this chapter.
    (b) Witnesses may be presented, within time limits specified by the 
presiding officer, provided that at least 10 days prior to the hearing 
date, the party presenting the witnesses furnishes the presiding officer 
and the opposing party with a list of such witnesses and a summary of 
the proposed testimony. However, the requirement for furnishing such a 
witness list and summary of testimony shall not apply to the 
presentation of rebuttal witnesses. The presiding officer may ask 
questions of any witness, and each party shall have an opportunity to 
cross-examine any witness presented by an opposing party.
    (c) Upon the request of either the petitioner or a representative of 
the Office of Enforcement, the record shall remain open for a period of

    (d) Following the introduction of all evidence, the petitioner and

opportunity for oral argument; however, the parties may jointly waive 
the right to oral argument, and, in lieu thereof, elect to submit 
written argument.
    (e) All oral testimony and oral argument shall be recorded, and 
transcripts made available to the petitioner upon payment of the cost 
thereof. A copy of the transcript shall be sent directly to the 
presiding officer, who shall have authority to correct the record sua 
sponte or upon the motion of any party.
    (f) The parties may, in writing, jointly waive an oral hearing and 
instead elect a hearing upon a written record in which all evidence and 
argument would be submitted to the presiding officer in documentary form 
and statements of individuals would be made by affidavit.
[54 FR 49444, Nov. 30, 1989, as amended at 56 FR 38306, Aug. 12, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 508.8  Default.

    If the subject individual fails to file a petition for a hearing, or 
fails to appear at a hearing, either in person or by attorney, or fails 
to submit a written argument where oral argument has been waived 
pursuant to Sec. 508.7(d) or (f) of this part, the Notice shall remain 
in effect until the information, indictment, or complaint is finally 
disposed of and the Order shall remain in effect until terminated by the

<R05>
Sec. 508.10  Burden of persuasion.

    The petitioner has the burden of showing, by a preponderance of the 
evidence, that his or her continued service to or participation in the 
conduct of the affairs of the association does not, or is not likely to, 
pose a threat to the interests of the association's depositors or 
threaten to impair public confidence in the association.


<R05>
Sec. 508.11  Relevant considerations.

    (a) In determining whether the petitioner has shown that his or her 
continued service to or participation in

[[Page 17]]

the conduct of the affairs of the association would not, or is not 
likely to, pose a threat to the interests of the association's 
depositors or threaten to impair public confidence in the association, 
in order to decide whether the Notice or Order should be continued, 
terminated, or otherwise modified, the Office will consider:
    (1) The nature and extent of the petitioner's participation in the 
affairs of the association;
    (2) The nature of the offense with which the petitioner has been 
charged;
    (3) The extent of the publicity accorded the indictment and trial; 
and
    (4) Such other relevant factors as may be entered on the record.
    (b) When considering a request for the termination or modification 
of a Notice, the Office will not consider the ultimate guilt or 
innocence of the petitioner with respect to the criminal charge that is 
outstanding.
    (c) When considering a request for the termination or modification 
of an Order which has been issued following a final judgment of 
conviction against a subject individual, the Office will not 
collaterally review such final judgment of conviction.


<R05>
Sec. 508.12  Proposed findings and conclusions and recommended decision.

    (a) Within 30 days after completion of oral argument or the 
submission of written argument where oral argument has been waived, the 
presiding officer shall file with the Secretary and certify to the 
Office for decision the entire record of the hearing, which shall 
include a recommended decision, the Notice or Order, and all other 
documents filed in connection with the hearing.

By attorneys. Any member in good standing of the bar of the highest 
court of any state, commonwealth, possession, territory of the United 
States, or the District of Columbia may represent others before the 
Office if such attorney is not currently suspended or debarred from 
practice before the Office.
    (2) By non-attorneys. An individual may appear on his or her own 
behalf; a member of a partnership may represent the partnership; a duly 
authorized officer, director, or employee of any government unit, 
agency, institution, corporation or authority may represent that unit, 
agency, institution, corporation or authority if such officer, director, 
or employee is not currently suspended or debarred from practice before 
the Office.
    (3) Notice of appearance. Any individual acting as counsel on behalf 
of a party, including the Director, shall file a notice of appearance 
with OFIA at or before the time that individual submits papers or 
otherwise appears on behalf of a party in the adjudicatory proceeding. 
The notice of appearance must include a written declaration that the 
individual is currently qualified as provided in paragraph (a)(1) or 
(a)(2) of this section and is authorized to represent the particular 
party. By filing a notice of appearance on behalf of a party in an 
adjudicatory proceeding, the counsel agrees and represents that

[[Page 21]]

he or she is authorized to accept service on behalf of the represented 
party and that, in the event of withdrawal from representation, he or 
she will, if required by the administrative law judge, continue to 
accept service until new counsel has filed a notice of appearance or 
until the represented party indicates that he or she will proceed on a 
pro se basis.
    (b) Sanctions. Dilatory, obstructionist, egregious, contemptuous or 
contumacious conduct at any phase of any adjudicatory proceeding may be 
grounds for exclusion or suspension of counsel from the proceeding.

<R05>
Sec. 509.7  Good faith certification.

    (a) General requirement. Every filing or submission of record 
following the issuance of a notice shall be signed by at least one 
counsel of record in his or her individual name and shall state that 
counsel's address and telephone number. A party who acts as his or her 
own counsel shall sign his or her individual name and state his or her 
address and telephone number on every filing or submission of record.
    (b) Effect of signature. (1) The signature of counsel or a party 
shall constitute a certification that: the counsel or party has read the 
filing or submission of record; to the best of his or her knowledge, 
information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the filing or 
submission of record is well-grounded in fact and is warranted by 
existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, 
or reversal of existing law; and the filing or submission of record is 
not made for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause 
unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.
    (2) If a filing or submission of record is not signed, the 
administrative law judge shall strike the filing or submission of 
record, unless it is signed promptly after the omission is called to the 
attention of the pleader or movant.
    (c) Effect of making oral motion or argument. The act of making any 
oral motion or oral argument by any counsel or party constitutes a 
certification that to the best of his or her knowledge, information, and 
belief formed after reasonable inquiry, his or her statements are well-
grounded in fact and are warranted by existing law or a good faith 
argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law, 
and are not made for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause 
unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.


<R05>
Sec. 509.8  Conflicts of interest.

    (a) Conflict of interest in representation. No person shall appear 
as counsel for another person in an adjudicatory proceeding if it 
reasonably appears that such representation may be materially limited by 
that counsel's responsibilities to a third person or by the counsel's 
own interests. The administrative law judge may take corrective measures 
at any stage of a proceeding to cure a conflict of interest in 
representation, including the issuance of an order limiting the scope of 
representation or disqualifying an individual from appearing in a 
representative capacity for the duration of the proceeding.
    (b) Certification and waiver. If any person appearing as counsel 
represents two or more parties to an adjudicatory proceeding or also 
represents a non-party on a matter relevant to an issue in the 
proceeding, counsel must certify in writing at the time of filing the 
notice of appearance required by Sec. 509.6(a):
    (1) That the counsel has personally and fully discussed the 
possibility of conflicts of interest with each such party and non-party; 
and
    (2) That each such party and non-party waives any right it might 
otherwise have had to assert any known conflicts of interest or to 
assert any non-material conflicts of interest during the course of the 
proceeding.
[56 FR 38306, Aug. 12, 1991, as amended at 61 FR 20354, May 6, 1996]

Sec. 509.9  Ex parte communications.

    (a) Definition--(1) Ex parte communication means any material oral

proceeding that was neither on the record nor on reasonable prior notice 
to all parties that takes place between:

    (i) An interested person outside the Office (including such person's 
counsel); and
    (ii) The administrative law judge handling that proceeding, the 
Director, or a decisional employee.
    (2) Exception. A request for status of the proceeding does not 
constitute an ex parte communication.
    (b) Prohibition of ex parte communications. From the time the notice 
is issued by the Director until the date that the Director issues the 
final decision pursuant to Sec. 509.40(c) of this subpart:
    (1) No interested person outside the Office shall make or knowingly 
cause to be made an ex parte communication to the Director, the 
administrative law judge, or a decisional employee; and
    (2) The Director, administrative law judge, or decisional employee 
shall not make or knowingly cause to be made to any interested person 
outside the Office any ex parte communication.
    (c) Procedure upon occurrence of ex parte communication. If an ex 
parte communication is received by the administrative law judge, the 
Director or other person identified in paragraph (a) of this section, 
that person shall cause all such written communications (or, if the 
communication is oral, a memorandum stating the substance of the 
communication) to be placed on the record of the proceeding and served 
on all parties. All other parties to the proceeding shall have an 
opportunity, within ten days of receipt of service of the ex parte 
communication to file responses thereto and to recommend any sanctions, 
in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, that they believe to 
be appropriate under the circumstances.
    (d) Sanctions. Any party or his or her counsel who makes a 
prohibited ex parte communication, or who encourages or solicits another 
to make any such communication, may be subject to any appropriate 
sanction or sanctions imposed by the Director or the administrative law 
judge including, but not limited to, exclusion from the proceedings and 
an adverse ruling on the issue which is the subject of the prohibited 
communication.
    (e) Separation-of-functions. Except to the extent required for the 
disposition of ex parte matters as authorized by law, the administrative 
law judge may not consult a person or party on any matter relevant to 
the merits of the adjudication, unless on notice and opportunity for all 
parties to participate. An employee or agent engaged in the performance 
of investigative or prosecuting functions for the Office in a case may 
not, in that or a factually related case, participate or advise in the 
decision, recommended decision, or agency review of the recommended 
decision under Sec. 509.40 of this subpart, except as witness or counsel 
in public proceedings.

unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday. When the last day 
is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the period runs until the end 
of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday. 
Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays are included in 
the computation of time. However, when the time period within which an 
act is to be performed is ten days or less, not including any additional 
time allowed for in paragraph (c) of this section, intermediate 
Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays are not included.
    (b) When papers are deemed to be filed or served. (1) Filing and 
service are deemed to be effective:
    (i) In the case of personal service or same day commercial courier 
delivery, upon actual service;
    (ii) In the case of overnight commercial delivery service, U.S. 
Express mail delivery, or first class, registered, or certified mail, 
upon deposit in or delivery to an appropriate point of collection; or
    (iii) In the case of transmission by electronic media, as specified 
by the authority receiving the filing, in the case of filing, and as 
agreed among the parties, in the case of service.
    (2) The effective filing and service dates specified in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section may be modified by the Director or administrative 
law judge in the case of filing or by agreement of the parties in the 
case of service.
    (c) Calculation of time for service and filing of responsive papers. 
Whenever a time limit is measured by a prescribed period from the 
service of any notice or paper, the applicable time limits are 
calculated as follows:
    (1) If service is made by first class, registered, or certified 
mail, add three calendar days to the prescribed period;
    (2) If service is made by express mail or overnight delivery 
service, add one calendar day to the prescribed period; or
    (3) If service is made by electronic media transmission, add one 
calendar day to the prescribed period, unless otherwise determined by 
the Director or the administrative law judge in the case of filing, or 
by agreement among the parties in the case of service.

<R05>
Sec. 509.13  Change of time limits.

    Except as otherwise provided by law, the administrative law judge 
may, for good cause shown, extend the time limits prescribed by the 
Uniform Rules or any notice or order issued in the proceedings. After 
the referral of the case to the Director pursuant to Sec. 509.38 of this 
subpart, the Director may grant extensions of the time limits for good 
cause shown. Extensions may be granted at the motion of a party or on 
the Director's or the administrative law judge's own motion after notice 
and opportunity to respond is afforded all non-moving parties.


<R05>
Sec. 509.14  Witness fees and expenses.

    Witnesses subpoenaed for testimony or deposition shall be paid the 
same fees for attendance and mileage as are paid in the United States 
district courts in proceedings in which the United States is a party, 
provided that, in the case of a discovery subpoena addressed to a party, 
no witness fees or mileage need be paid. Fees for witnesses shall be 
tendered in advance by the party requesting the subpoena, except that 
fees and mileage need not be tendered in advance where the Office is the 
party requesting the subpoena. The Office shall not be required to pay 
any fees to, or expenses of, any witness not subpoenaed by the Office.


<R05>
Sec. 509.15  Opportunity for informal settlement.

    Any respondent may, at any time in the proceeding, unilaterally 
submit to Enforcement Counsel written offers or proposals for settlement 
of a proceeding, without prejudice to the rights of any of the parties. 
No such offer or proposal shall be made to any Office representative 
other than Enforcement Counsel. Submission of a written settlement offer 
does not provide a basis for adjourning or otherwise delaying all or any 
portion of a proceeding under this part. No settlement offer or

[[Page 25]]

proposal, or any subsequent negotiation or resolution, is admissible as 
evidence in any proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 509.16  Office's right to conduct examination.

    Nothing contained in this subpart limits in any manner the right of 
the Office to conduct any examination, inspection, or visitation of any 
institution or institution-affiliated party, or the right of the Office 
to conduct or continue any form of investigation authorized by law.


<R05>
Sec. 509.17  Collateral attacks on adjudicatory proceeding.

    If an interlocutory appeal or collateral attack is brought in any 
court concerning all or any part of an adjudicatory proceeding, the 
challenged adjudicatory proceeding shall continue without regard to the 
pendency of that court proceeding. No default or other failure to act as 
directed in the adjudicatory proceeding within the times prescribed in 
this subpart shall be excused based on the pendency before any court of 
any interlocutory appeal or collateral attack.


<R05>
Sec. 509.18  Commencement of proceeding and contents of notice.

    (a) Commencement of proceeding. (1)(i) Except for change-in-control 
proceedings under section 7(j)(4) of the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1817(j)(4)), a 
proceeding governed by this subpart is commenced by issuance of a notice 
by the Director.
    (ii) The notice must be served by the Director upon the respondent 
and given to any other appropriate financial institution supervisory 
authority where required by law.
    (iii) The notice must be filed with the OFIA.
    (2) Change-in control proceedings under section 7(j)(4) of the FDIA 
(12 U.S.C. 1817(j)(4)) commence with the issuance of an order by the 
Director.
    (b) Contents of notice. The notice must set forth:
    (1) The legal authority for the proceeding and for the Office's 
jurisdiction over the proceeding;
    (2) A statement of the matters of fact or law showing that the 
Office is entitled to relief;
    (3) A proposed order or prayer for an order granting the requested 
relief;
    (4) The time, place, and nature of the hearing as required by law or 
regulation;
    (5) The time within which to file an answer as required by law or 
regulation;
    (6) The time within which to request a hearing as required by law or 
regulation; and
    (7) The answer and/or request for a hearing shall be filed with 
OFIA.


<R05>
Sec. 509.19  Answer.

    (a) When. Within 20 days of service of the notice, respondent shall 
file an answer as designated in the notice. In a civil money penalty 
proceeding, respondent shall also file a request for a hearing within 20 
days of service of the notice.
    (b) Content of answer. An answer must specifically respond to each 
paragraph or allegation of fact contained in the notice and must admit, 
deny, or state that the party lacks sufficient information to admit or 
deny each allegation of fact. A statement of lack of information has the 
effect of a denial. Denials must fairly meet the substance of each 
allegation of fact denied; general denials are not permitted. When a 
respondent denies part of an allegation, that part must be denied and 
the remainder specifically admitted. Any allegation of fact in the 
notice which is not denied in the answer must be deemed admitted for 
purposes of the proceeding. A respondent is not required to respond to 
the portion of a notice that constitutes the prayer for relief or 
proposed order. The answer must set forth affirmative defenses, if any, 
asserted by the respondent.
    (c) Default--(1) Effect of failure to answer. Failure of a 
respondent to file an answer required by this section within the time 
provided constitutes a waiver of his or her right to appear and contest 
the allegations in the notice. If no timely answer is filed, the 
administrative law judge, upon motion of the Enforcement Counsel, shall 
file with the Director a recommended decision containing the findings 
and the relief sought in the notice. Any final order

[[Page 26]]

issued by the Director based upon a respondent's failure to answer is 
deemed to be an order issued upon consent.
    (2) Effect of failure to request a hearing in civil money penalty 
proceedings. If respondent fails to request a hearing as required by law 
within the time provided, the notice of assessment constitutes a final 
and unappealable order.


<R05>
Sec. 509.20  Amended pleadings.

    (a) Amendments. The notice or answer may be amended or supplemented 
at any stage of the proceeding. The respondent must answer an amended 
notice within the time remaining for the respondent's answer to the 
original notice, or within ten days after service of the amended notice, 
whichever period is longer, unless the Director or administrative law 
judge orders otherwise for good cause.
    (b) Amendments to conform to the evidence. When issues not raised in 
the notice or answer are tried at the hearing by express or implied 
consent of the parties, they will be treated in all respects as if they 
had been raised in the notice or answer, and no formal amendments are 
required. If evidence is objected to at the hearing on the ground that 
it is not within the issues raised by the notice or answer, the 
administrative law judge may admit the evidence when admission is likely 
to assist in adjudicating the merits of the action and the objecting 
party fails to satisfy the administrative law judge that the admission 
of such evidence would unfairly prejudice that party's action or defense 
upon the merits. The administrative law judge may grant a continuance to 
enable the objecting party to meet such evidence.
[61 FR 20354, May 6, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 509.21  Failure to appear.

    Failure of a respondent to appear in person at the hearing or by a 
duly authorized counsel constitutes a waiver of respondent's right to a 
hearing and is deemed an admission of the facts as alleged and consent 
to the relief sought in the notice. Without further proceedings or 
notice to the respondent, the administrative law judge shall file with 
the Director a recommended decision containing the findings and the 
relief sought in the notice.


<R05>
Sec. 509.22  Consolidation and severance of actions.

    (a) Consolidation. (1) On the motion of any party, or on the 
administrative law judge's own motion, the administrative law judge may 
consolidate, for some or all purposes, any two or more proceedings, if 
each such proceeding involves or arises out of the same transaction, 
occurrence or series of transactions or occurrences, or involves at 
least one common respondent or a material common question of law or 
fact, unless such consolidation would cause unreasonable delay or 
injustice.
    (2) In the event of consolidation under paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, appropriate adjustment to the prehearing schedule must be made 
to avoid unnecessary expense, inconvenience, or delay.
    (b) Severance. The administrative law judge may, upon the motion of 
any party, sever the proceeding for separate resolution of the matter as 
to any respondent only if the administrative law judge finds that:
    (1) Undue prejudice or injustice to the moving party would result 
from not severing the proceeding; and
    (2) Such undue prejudice or injustice would outweigh the interests 
of judicial economy and expedition in the complete and final resolution 
of the proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 509.23  Motions.

    (a) In writing. (1) Except as otherwise provided herein, an 
application or request for an order or ruling must be made by written 
motion.
    (2) All written motions must state with particularity the relief 
sought and must be accompanied by a proposed order.
    (3) No oral argument may be held on written motions except as 
otherwise directed by the administrative law judge. Written memoranda, 
briefs, affidavits or other relevant material or documents may be filed 
in support of or in opposition to a motion.
    (b) Oral motions. A motion may be made orally on the record unless 
the administrative law judge directs that such motion be reduced to 
writing.
    (c) Filing of motions. Motions must be filed with the administrative 
law

[[Page 27]]

judge, but upon the filing of the recommended decision, motions must be 
filed with the Director.
    (d) Responses. (1) Except as otherwise provided herein, within ten 
days after service of any written motion, or within such other period of 
time as may be established by the administrative law judge or the 
Director, any party may file a written response to a motion. The 
administrative law judge shall not rule on any oral or written motion 
before each party has had an opportunity to file a response.
    (2) The failure of a party to oppose a written motion or an oral 
motion made on the record is deemed a consent by that party to the entry 
of an order substantially in the form of the order accompanying the 
motion.
    (e) Dilatory motions. Frivolous, dilatory or repetitive motions are 
prohibited. The filing of such motions may form the basis for sanctions.
    (f) Dispositive motions. Dispositive motions are governed by 
Secs. 509.29 and 509.30 of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 509.24  Scope of document discovery.

    (a) Limits on discovery. (1) Subject to the limitations set out in 
paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, a party to a proceeding 
under this subpart may obtain document discovery by serving a written 
request to produce documents. For purposes of a request to produce 
documents, the term ``documents'' may be defined to include drawings, 
graphs, charts, photographs, recordings, data stored in electronic form, 
and other data compilations from which information can be obtained, or 
translated, if necessary, by the parties through detection devices into 
reasonably usable form, as well as written material of all kinds.
    (2) Discovery by use of deposition is governed by Sec. 509.102 of 
this part.
    (3) Discovery by use of interrogatories is not permitted.
    (b) Relevance. A party may obtain document discovery regarding any 
matter, not privileged, that has material relevance to the merits of the 
pending action. Any request to produce documents that calls for 
irrelevant material, that is unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in 
scope, unduly burdensome, or repetitive of previous requests, or that 
seeks to obtain privileged documents will be denied or modified. A 
request is unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope or unduly 
burdensome if, among other things, it fails to include justifiable 
limitations on the time period covered and the geographic locations to 
be searched, the time provided to respond in the request is inadequate, 
or the request calls for copies of documents to be delivered to the 
requesting party and fails to include the requestor's written agreement 
to pay in advance for the copying, in accordance with Sec. 509.25 of 
this subpart.
    (c) Privileged matter. Privileged documents are not discoverable. 
Privileges include the attorney-client privilege, work-product 
privilege, any government's or government agency's deliberative-process 
privilege, and any other privileges the Constitution, any applicable act 
of Congress, or the principles of common law provide.
    (d) Time limits. All discovery, including all responses to discovery 
requests, shall be completed at least 20 days prior to the date 
scheduled for the commencement of the hearing, except as provided in the 
Local Rules. No exceptions to this time limit shall be permitted, unless 
the administrative law judge finds on the record that good cause exists 
for waiving the requirements of this paragraph.
[56 FR 38306, Aug. 12, 1991, as amended at 61 FR 20354, May 6, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 509.25  Request for document discovery from parties.

    (a) General rule. Any party may serve on any other party a request 
to produce for inspection any discoverable documents that are in the 
possession, custody, or control of the party upon whom the request is 
served. The request must identify the documents to be produced either by 
individual item or by category, and must describe each item and category 
with reasonable particularity. Documents must be produced as they are 
kept in the usual course of business or must be organized to correspond 
with the categories in the request.
    (b) Production or copying. The request must specify a reasonable 
time, place,

[[Page 28]]

and manner for production and performing any related acts. In lieu of 
inspecting the documents, the requesting party may specify that all or 
some of the responsive documents be copied and the copies delivered to 
the requesting party. If copying of fewer than 250 pages is requested, 
the party to whom the request is addressed shall bear the cost of 
copying and shipping charges. If a party requests 250 pages or more of 
copying, the requesting party shall pay for the copying and shipping 
charges. Copying charges are the current per-page copying rate imposed 
under 12 CFR 502.7 for requests under the Freedom of Information Act (5 
U.S.C. 552). The party to whom the request is addressed may require 
payment in advance before producing the documents.
    (c) Obligation to update responses. A party who has responded to a 
discovery request with a response that was complete when made is not 
required to supplement the response to include documents thereafter 
acquired, unless the responding party learns that:
    (1) The response was materially incorrect when made; or
    (2) The response, though correct when made, is no longer true and a 
failure to amend the response is, in substance, a knowing concealment.
    (d) Motions to limit discovery. (1) Any party that objects to a 
discovery request may, within ten days of being served with such 
request, file a motion in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 509.23 
of this subpart to revoke or otherwise limit the request. If an 
objection is made to only a portion of an item or category in a request, 
the portion objected to shall be specified. Any objections not made in 
accordance with this paragraph and Sec. 509.23 of this subpart are 
waived.
    (2) The party who served the request that is the subject of a motion 
to revoke or limit may file a written response within five days of 
service of the motion. No other party may file a response.
    (e) Privilege. At the time other documents are produced, the 
producing party must reasonably identify all documents withheld on the 
grounds of privilege and must produce a statement of the basis for the 
assertion of privilege. When similar documents that are protected by 
deliberative process, attorney-work-product, or attorney-client 
privilege are voluminous, these documents may be identified by category 
instead of by individual document. The administrative law judge retains 
discretion to determine when the identification by category is 
insufficient.
    (f) Motions to compel production. (1) If a party withholds any 
documents as privileged or fails to comply fully with a discovery 
request, the requesting party may, within ten days of the assertion of 
privilege or of the time the failure to comply becomes known to the 
requesting party, file a motion in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 509.23 of this subpart for the issuance of a subpoena compelling 
production.
    (2) The party who asserted the privilege or failed to comply with 
the request may file a written response to a motion to compel within 
five days of service of the motion. No other party may file a response.
    (g) Ruling on motions. After the time for filing responses pursuant 
to this section has expired, the administrative law judge shall rule 
promptly on all motions filed pursuant to this section. If the 
administrative law judge determines that a discovery request, or any of 
its terms, calls for irrelevant material, is unreasonable, oppressive, 
excessive in scope, unduly burdensome, or repetitive of previous 
requests, or seeks to obtain privileged documents, he or she may deny or 
modify the request, and may issue appropriate protective orders, upon 
such conditions as justice may require. The pendency of a motion to 
strike or limit discovery or to compel production is not a basis for 
staying or continuing the proceeding, unless otherwise ordered by the 
administrative law judge. Notwithstanding any other provision in this 
part, the administrative law judge may not release, or order a party to 
produce, documents withheld on grounds of privilege if the party has 
stated to the administrative law judge its intention to file a timely 
motion for interlocutory review of the administrative law judge's order 
to produce the documents, and until the motion for interlocutory review 
has been decided.

[[Page 29]]

    (h) Enforcing discovery subpoenas. If the administrative law judge 
issues a subpoena compelling production of documents by a party, the 
subpoenaing party may, in the event of noncompliance and to the extent 
authorized by applicable law, apply to any appropriate United States 
district court for an order requiring compliance with the subpoena. A 
party's right to seek court enforcement of a subpoena shall not in any 
manner limit the sanctions that may be imposed by the administrative law 
judge against a party who fails to produce subpoenaed documents.
[56 FR 38306, Aug. 12, 1991, as amended at 61 FR 20355, May 6, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 509.26  Document subpoenas to nonparties.

    (a) General rules. (1) Any party may apply to the administrative law 
judge for the issuance of a document discovery subpoena addressed to any 
person who is not a party to the proceeding. The application must 
contain a proposed document subpoena and a brief statement showing the 
general relevance and reasonableness of the scope of documents sought. 
The subpoenaing party shall specify a reasonable time, place, and manner 
for making production in response to the document subpoena.
    (2) A party shall only apply for a document subpoena under this 
section within the time period during which such party could serve a 
discovery request under Sec. 509.24(d) of this subpart. The party 
obtaining the document subpoena is responsible for serving it on the 
subpoenaed person and for serving copies on all parties. Document 
subpoenas may be served in any state, territory, or possession of the 
United States, the District of Columbia, or as otherwise provided by 
law.
    (3) The administrative law judge shall promptly issue any document 
subpoena requested pursuant to this section. If the administrative law 
judge determines that the application does not set forth a valid basis 
for the issuance of the subpoena, or that any of its terms are 
unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, he 
or she may refuse to issue the subpoena or may issue it in a modified 
form upon such conditions as may be consistent with the Uniform Rules.
    (b) Motion to quash or modify. (1) Any person to whom a document 
subpoena is directed may file a motion to quash or modify such subpoena, 
accompanied by a statement of the basis for quashing or modifying the 
subpoena. The movant shall serve the motion on all parties, and any 
party may respond to such motion within ten days of service of the 
motion.
    (2) Any motion to quash or modify a document subpoena must be filed 
on the same basis, including the assertion of privilege, upon which a 
party could object to a discovery request under Sec. 509.25(d) of this 
subpart, and during the same time limits during which such an objection 
could be filed.
    (c) Enforcing document subpoenas. If a subpoenaed person fails to 
comply with any subpoena issued pursuant to this section or any order of 
the administrative law judge which directs compliance with all or any 
portion of a document subpoena, the subpoenaing party or any other 
aggrieved party may, to the extent authorized by applicable law, apply 
to an appropriate United States district court for an order requiring 
compliance with so much of the document subpoena as the administrative 
law judge has not quashed or modified. A party's right to seek court 
enforcement of a document subpoena shall in no way limit the sanctions 
that may be imposed by the administrative law judge on a party who 
induces a failure to comply with subpoenas issued under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 509.27  Deposition of witness unavailable for hearing.

    (a) General rules. (1) If a witness will not be available for the 
hearing, a party may apply in accordance with the procedures set forth 
in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, to the administrative law judge for 
the issuance of a subpoena, including a subpoena duces tecum, requiring 
the attendance of the witness at a deposition. The administrative law 
judge may issue a deposition subpoena under this section upon showing 
that:

[[Page 30]]

    (i) The witness will be unable to attend or may be prevented from 
attending the hearing because of age, sickness or infirmity, or will 
otherwise be unavailable;
    (ii) The witness' unavailability was not procured or caused by the 
subpoenaing party;
    (iii) The testimony is reasonably expected to be material; and
    (iv) Taking the deposition will not result in any undue burden to 
any other party and will not cause undue delay of the proceeding.
    (2) The application must contain a proposed deposition subpoena and 
a brief statement of the reasons for the issuance of the subpoena. The 
subpoena must name the witness whose deposition is to be taken and 
specify the time and place for taking the deposition. A deposition 
subpoena may require the witness to be deposed at any place within the 
country in which that witness resides or has a regular place of 
employment or such other convenient place as the administrative law 
judge shall fix.
    (3) Any requested subpoena that sets forth a valid basis for its 
issuance must be promptly issued, unless the administrative law judge on 
his or her own motion, requires a written response or requires 
attendance at a conference concerning whether the requested subpoena 
should be issued.
    (4) The party obtaining a deposition subpoena is responsible for 
serving it on the witness and for serving copies on all parties. Unless 
the administrative law judge orders otherwise, no deposition under this 
section shall be taken on fewer than ten days' notice to the witness and 
all parties. Deposition subpoenas may be served in any state, territory, 
possession of the United States, or the District of Columbia, on any 
person or company doing business in any state, territory, possession of 
the United States, or the District of Columbia, or as otherwise 
permitted by law.
    (b) Objections to deposition subpoenas. (1) The witness and any 
party who has not had an opportunity to oppose a deposition subpoena 
issued under this section may file a motion with the administrative law 
judge to quash or modify the subpoena prior to the time for compliance 
specified in the subpoena, but not more than ten days after service of 
the subpoena.
    (2) A statement of the basis for the motion to quash or modify a 
subpoena issued under this section must accompany the motion. The motion 
must be served on all parties.
    (c) Procedure upon deposition. (1) Each witness testifying pursuant 
to a deposition subpoena must be duly sworn, and each party shall have 
the right to examine the witness. Objections to questions or documents 
must be in short form, stating the grounds for the objection. Failure to 
object to questions or documents is not deemed a waiver except where the 
ground for the objection might have been avoided if the objection had 
been timely presented. All questions, answers, and objections must be 
recorded.
    (2) Any party may move before the administrative law judge for an 
order compelling the witness to answer any questions the witness has 
refused to answer or submit any evidence the witness has refused to 
submit during the deposition.
    (3) The deposition must be subscribed by the witness, unless the 
parties and the witness, by stipulation, have waived the signing, or the 
witness is ill, cannot be found, or has refused to sign. If the 
deposition is not subscribed by the witness, the court reporter taking 
the deposition shall certify that the transcript is a true and complete 
transcript of the deposition.
    (d) Enforcing subpoenas. If a subpoenaed person fails to comply with 
any order of the administrative law judge which directs compliance with 
all or any portion of a deposition subpoena under paragraph (b) or 
(c)(2) of this section, the subpoenaing party or other aggrieved party 
may, to the extent authorized by applicable law, apply to an appropriate 
United States district court for an order requiring compliance with the 
portions of the subpoena that the administrative law judge has ordered 
enforced. A party's right to seek court enforcement of a deposition 
subpoena in no way limits the sanctions that may be imposed by the 
administrative law judge on a party who fails to comply with or procures 
a failure to

[[Page 31]]

comply with, a subpoena issued under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 509.28  Interlocutory review.

    (a) General rule. The Director may review a ruling of the 
administrative law judge prior to the certification of the record to the 
Director only in accordance with the procedures set forth in this 
section and Sec. 509.23 of this subpart.
    (b) Scope of review. The Director may exercise interlocutory review 
of a ruling of the administrative law judge if the Director finds that:
    (1) The ruling involves a controlling question of law or policy as 
to which substantial grounds exist for a difference of opinion;
    (2) Immediate review of the ruling may materially advance the 
ultimate termination of the proceeding;
    (3) Subsequent modification of the ruling at the conclusion of the 
proceeding would be an inadequate remedy; or
    (4) Subsequent modification of the ruling would cause unusual delay 
or expense.
    (c) Procedure. Any request for interlocutory review shall be filed 
by a party with the administrative law judge within ten days of his or 
her ruling and shall otherwise comply with Sec. 509.23 of this subpart. 
Any party may file a response to a request for interlocutory review in 
accordance with Sec. 509.23(d) of this subpart. Upon the expiration of 
the time for filing all responses, the administrative law judge shall 
refer the matter to the Director for final disposition.
    (d) Suspension of proceeding. Neither a request for interlocutory 
review nor any disposition of such a request by the Director under this 
section suspends or stays the proceeding unless otherwise ordered by the 
administrative law judge or the Director.


<R05>
Sec. 509.29  Summary disposition.

    (a) In general. The administrative law judge shall recommend that 
the Director issue a final order granting a motion for summary 
disposition if the undisputed pleaded facts, admissions, affidavits, 
stipulations, documentary evidence, matters as to which official notice 
may be taken, and any other evidentiary materials properly submitted in 
connection with a motion for summary disposition show that:
    (1) There is no genuine issue as to any material fact; and
    (2) The moving party is entitled to a decision in its favor as a 
matter of law.
    (b) Biling of motions and responses. (1) Any party who believes that 
there is no genuine issue of material fact to be determined and that he 
or she is entitled to a decision as a matter of law may move at any time 
for summary disposition in its favor of all or any part of the 
proceeding. Any party, within 20 days after service of such a motion, or 
within such time period as allowed by the administrative law judge, may 
file a response to such motion.
    (2) A motion for summary disposition must be accompanied by a 
statement of the material facts as to which the moving party contends 
there is no genuine issue. Such motion must be supported by documentary 
evidence, which may take the form of admissions in pleadings, 
stipulations, depositions, investigatory depositions, transcripts, 
affidavits and any other evidentiary materials that the moving party 
contends support his or her position. The motion must also be 
accompanied by a brief containing the points and authorities in support 
of the contention of the moving party. Any party opposing a motion for 
summary disposition must file a statement setting forth those material 
facts as to which he or she contends a genuine dispute exists. Such 
opposition must be supported by evidence of the same type as that 
submitted with the motion for summary disposition and a brief containing 
the points and authorities in support of the contention that summary 
disposition would be inappropriate.
    (c) Hearing on motion. At the request of any party or on his or her 
own motion, the administrative law judge may hear oral argument on the 
motion for summary disposition.
    (d) Decision on motion. Following receipt of a motion for summary 
disposition and all responses thereto, the administrative law judge 
shall determine whether the moving party is entitled to summary 
disposition. If the administrative law judge determines that summary 
disposition is warranted, the administrative law judge shall submit

[[Page 32]]

a recommended decision to that effect to the Director. If the 
administrative law judge finds that no party is entitled to summary 
disposition, he or she shall make a ruling denying the motion.


<R05>
Sec. 509.30  Partial summary disposition.

    If the administrative law judge determines that a party is entitled 
to summary disposition as to certain claims only, he or she shall defer 
submitting a recommended decision as to those claims. A hearing on the 
remaining issues must be ordered. Those claims for which the 
administrative law judge has determined that summary disposition is 
warranted will be addressed in the recommended decision filed at the 
conclusion of the hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 509.31  Scheduling and prehearing conferences.

    (a) Scheduling conference. Within 30 days of service of the notice 
or order commencing a proceeding or such other time as parties may 
agree, the administrative law judge shall direct counsel for all parties 
to meet with him or her in person at a specified time and place prior to 
the hearing or to confer by telephone for the purpose of scheduling the 
course and conduct of the proceeding. This meeting or telephone 
conference is called a ``scheduling conference.'' The identification of 
potential witnesses, the time for and manner of discovery, and the 
exchange of any prehearing materials including witness lists, statements 
of issues, stipulations, exhibits and any other materials may also be 
determined at the scheduling conference.
    (b) Prehearing conferences. The administrative law judge may, in 
addition to the scheduling conference, on his or her own motion or at 
the request of any party, direct counsel for the parties to meet with 
him or her (in person or by telephone) at a prehearing conference to 
address any or all of the following:
    (1) Simplification and clarification of the issues;
    (2) Stipulations, admissions of fact, and the contents, authenticity 
and admissibility into evidence of documents;
    (3) Matters of which office notice may be taken;
    (4) Limitation of the number of witnesses;
    (5) Summary disposition of any or all issues;
    (6) Resolution of discovery issues or disputes;
    (7) Amendments to pleadings; and
    (8) Such other matters as may aid in the orderly disposition of the 
proceeding.
    (c) Transcript. The administrative law judge, in his or her 
discretion, may require that a scheduling or prehearing conference be 
recorded by a court reporter. A transcript of the conference and any 
materials filed, including orders, becomes part of the record of the 
proceeding. A party may obtain a copy of the transcript at its expense.
    (d) Scheduling or prehearing orders. At or within a reasonable time 
following the conclusion of the scheduling conference or any prehearing 
conference, the administrative law judge shall serve on each party an 
order setting forth any agreements reached and any procedural 
determinations made.


<R05>
Sec. 509.32  Prehearing submissions.

    (a) Within the time set by the administrative law judge, but in no 
case later than 14 days before the start of the hearing, each party 
shall serve on every other party, his or her:
    (1) Prehearing statement;
    (2) Final list of witnesses to be called to testify at the hearing, 
including name and address of each witness and a short summary of the 
expected testimony of each witness;
    (3) List of the exhibits to be introduced at the hearing along with 
a copy of each exhibit; and
    (4) Stipulations of fact, if any.
    (b) Effect of failure to comply. No witness may testify and no 
exhibits may be introduced at the hearing if such witness or exhibit is 
not listed in the prehearing submissions pursuant to paragraph (a) of 
this section, except for good cause shown.


<R05>
Sec. 509.33  Public hearings.

    (a) General rule. All hearings shall be open to the public, unless 
the Director, in the Director's discretion, determines that holding an 
open hearing would be contrary to the public interest. Within 20 days of 
service of the notice or, in

[[Page 33]]

the case of change-in-control proceedings under section 7(j)(4) of the 
FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1817(j)(4)), within 20 days from service of the hearing 
order, any respondent may file with the Director a request for a private 
hearing, and any party may file a reply to such a request. A party must 
serve on the administrative law judge a copy of any request or reply the 
party files with the Director. The form of, and procedure for, these 
requests and replies are governed by Sec. 509.23 of this subpart. A 
party's failure to file a request or a reply constitutes a waiver of any 
objections regarding whether the hearing will be public or private.
    (b) Filing document under seal. Enforcement Counsel, in his or her 
discretion, may file any document or part of a document under seal if 
disclosure of the document would be contrary to the public interest. The 
administrative law judge shall take all appropriate steps to preserve 
the confidentiality of such documents or parts thereof, including 
closing portions of the hearing to the public.

Sec. 509.34  Hearing subpoenas.

    (a) Issuance. (1) Upon application of a party showing general 
relevance and reasonableness of scope of the testimony or other evidence 
sought, the administrative law judge may issue a subpoena or a subpoena 
duces tecum requiring the attendance of a witness at the hearing or the 
production of documentary or physical evidence at the hearing. The 
application for a hearing subpoena must also contain a proposed subpoena 
specifying the attendance of a witness or the production of evidence 
from any state, territory, or possession of the United States, the 
District of Columbia, or as otherwise provided by law at any designated 
place where the hearing is being conducted. The party making the 
application shall serve a copy of the application and the proposed 
subpoena on every other party.
    (2) A party may apply for a hearing subpoena at any time before the 
commencement of a hearing. During a hearing, a party may make an 
application for a subpoena orally on the record before the 
administrative law judge.
    (3) The administrative law judge shall promptly issue any hearing 
subpoena requested pursuant to this section. If the administrative law 
judge determines that the application does not set forth a valid basis 
for the issuance of the subpoena, or that any of its terms are 
unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, he 
or she may refuse to issue the subpoena or may issue it in a modified 
form upon any conditions consistent with this subpart. Upon issuance by 
the administrative law judge, the party making the application shall 
serve the subpoena on the person named in the subpoena and on each 
party.
    (b) Motion to quash or modify. (1) Any person to whom a hearing 
subpoena is directed or any party may file a motion to quash or modify 
the subpoena, accompanied by a statement of the basis for quashing or 
modifying the subpoena. The movant must serve the motion on each party 
and on the person named in the subpoena. Any party may respond to the 
motion within ten days of service of the motion.
    (2) Any motion to quash or modify a hearing subpoena must be filed 
prior to the time specified in the subpoena for compliance, but not more 
than ten days after the date of service of the subpoena upon the movant.
    (c) Enforcing subpoenas. If a subpoenaed person fails to comply with 
any subpoena issued pursuant to this section or any order of the 
administrative law judge which directs compliance with all or any 
portion of a document subpoena, the subpoenaing party or any other 
aggrieved party may seek enforcement of the subpoena pursuant to section 
Sec. 509.26(c) of this subpart.

<R05>
Sec. 509.35  Conduct of hearings.

    (a) General rules. (1) Hearings shall be conducted so as to provide 
a fair and expeditious presentation of the relevant disputed issues. 
Each party has the right to present its case or defense by oral and 
documentary evidence and to conduct such cross examination as may be 
required for full disclosure of the facts.

[[Page 34]]

    (2) Order of hearing. Enforcement Counsel shall present its case-in-
chief first, unless otherwise ordered by the administrative law judge, 
or unless otherwise expressly specified by law or regulation. 
Enforcement Counsel shall be the first party to present an opening 
statement and a closing statement, and may make a rebuttal statement 
after the respondent's closing statement. If there are multiple 
respondents, respondents may agree among themselves as to their order of 
presentation of their cases, but if they do not agree the administrative 
law judge shall fix the order.
    (3) Examination of witnesses. Only one counsel for each party may 
conduct an examination of a witness, except that in the case of 
extensive direct examination, the administrative law judge may permit 
more than one counsel for the party presenting the witness to conduct 
the examination. A party may have one counsel conduct the direct 
examination and another counsel conduct re-direct examination of a 
witness, or may have one counsel conduct the cross examination of a 
witness and another counsel conduct the re-cross examination of a 
witness.
    (4) Stipulations. Unless the administrative law judge directs 
otherwise, all stipulations of fact and law previously agreed upon by 
the parties, and all documents, the admissibility of which have been 
previously stipulated, will be admitted into evidence upon commencement 
of the hearing.
    (b) Transcript. The hearing must be recorded and transcribed. The 
reporter will make the transcript available to any party upon payment by 
that party to the reporter of the cost of the transcript. The 
administrative law judge may order the record corrected, either upon 
motion to correct, upon stipulation of the parties, or following notice 
to the parties upon the administrative law judge's own motion.

Sec. 509.36  Evidence.

    (a) Admissibility. (1) Except as is otherwise set forth in this 
section, relevant, material, and reliable evidence that is not unduly 
repetitive is admissible to the fullest extent authorized by the APA and 
other applicable law.
    (2) Evidence that would be admissible under the Federal Rules of 
Evidence is admissible in a proceeding conducted pursuant to this 
subpart.
    (3) Evidence that would be inadmissible under the Federal Rules of 
Evidence may not deemed or ruled to be inadmissible in a proceeding 
conducted pursuant to this subpart if such evidence is relevant, 
material, reliable and not unduly repetitive.
    (b) Official notice. (1) Official notice may be taken of any 
material fact which may be judicially noticed by a United States 
district court and any material information in the official public 
records of any Federal or state government agency.
    (2) All matters officially noticed by the administrative law judge 
or Director shall appear on the record.
    (3) If official notice is requested or taken of any material fact, 
the parties, upon timely request, shall be afforded an opportunity to 
object.
    (c) Documents. (1) A duplicate copy of a document is admissible to 
the same extent as the original, unless a genuine issue is raised as to 
whether the copy is in some material respect not a true and legible copy 
of the original.
    (2) Subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, 
any document, including a report of examination, supervisory activity, 
inspection or visitation, prepared by the appropriate Office or state 
regulatory agency, is admissible either with or without a sponsoring 
witness.
    (3) Witnesses may use existing or newly created charts, exhibits, 
calendars, calculations, outlines or other graphic material to 
summarize, illustrate, or simplify the presentation of testimony. Such 
materials may, subject to the administrative law judge's discretion, be 
used with or without being admitted into evidence.
    (d) Objections. (1) Objections to the admissibility of evidence must 
be timely made and rulings on all objections must appear on the record.
    (2) When an objection to a question or line of questioning 
propounded to a witness is sustained, the examining counsel may make a 
specific proffer on the record of what he or she expected

[[Page 35]]

to prove by the expected testimony of the witness, either by 
representation of counsel or by direct interrogation of the witness.
    (3) The administrative law judge shall retain rejected exhibits, 
adequately marked for identification, for the record, and transmit such 
exhibits to the Director.
    (4) Failure to object to admission of evidence or to any ruling 
constitutes a waiver of the objection.
    (e) Stipulations. The parties may stipulate as to any relevant 
matters of fact or the authentication of any relevant documents. Such 
stipulations must be received in evidence at a hearing, and are binding 
on the parties with respect to the matters therein stipulated.
    (f) Depositions of unavailable witnesses. (1) If a witness is 
unavailable to testify at a hearing, and that witness has testified in a 
deposition to which all parties in a proceeding had notice and an 
opportunity to participate, a party may offer as evidence all or any 
part of the transcript of the deposition, including deposition exhibits, 
if any.
    (2) Such deposition transcript is admissible to the same extent that 
testimony would have been admissible had that person testified at the 
hearing, provided that if a witness refused to answer proper questions 
during the depositions, the administrative law judge may, on that basis, 
limit the admissibility of the deposition in any manner that justice 
requires.
    (3) Only those portions of a deposition received in evidence at the 
hearing constitute a part of the record.


<R05>
Sec. 509.37  Post-hearing filings.

    (a) Proposed findings and conclusions and supporting briefs. (1) 
Using the same method of service for each party, the administrative law 
judge shall serve notice upon each party, that the certified transcript, 
together with all hearing exhibits and exhibits introduced but not 
admitted into evidence at the hearing, has been filed. Any party may 
file with the administrative law judge proposed findings of fact, 
proposed conclusions of law, and a proposed order within 30 days 
following service of this notice by the administrative law judge or 
within such longer period as may be ordered by the administrative law 
judge.
    (2) Proposed findings and conclusions must be supported by citation 
to any relevant authorities and by page references to any relevant 
portions of the record. A post-hearing brief may be filed in support of 
proposed findings and conclusions, either as part of the same document 
or in a separate document. Any party who fails to file timely with the 
administrative law judge any proposed finding or conclusion is deemed to 
have waived the right to raise in any subsequent filing or submission 
any issue not addressed in such party's proposed finding or conclusion.
    (b) Reply briefs. Reply briefs may be filed within 15 days after the 
date on which the parties' proposed findings, conclusions, and order are 
due. Reply briefs must be strictly limited to responding to new matters, 
issues, or arguments raised in another party's papers. A party who has 
not filed proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law or a post-
hearing brief may not file a reply brief.
    (c) Simultaneous filing required. The administrative law judge shall 
not order the filing by any party of any brief or reply brief in advance 
of the other party's filing of its brief.

expiration of the time allowed for filing reply briefs under

recommended decision, recommended findings of fact, recommended 
conclusions of law, and proposed order; all prehearing and hearing

files with and certifies to the Director for final determination the 
record of the proceeding, the administrative law judge shall furnish to 
the Director a certified index of the entire record of the proceeding. 
The certified index shall include, at a minimum, an entry for each 
paper, document or motion filed with the administrative law judge in the

each exhibit introduced but not admitted into evidence at the hearing; 
each exhibit introduced and admitted into evidence after the completion 
of the hearing; and each exhibit introduced but not admitted into 
evidence after the completion of the hearing.

    (a) Filing exceptions. Within 30 days after service of the 
recommended decision, findings, conclusions, and proposed order under 
Sec. 509.38 of this subpart, a party may file with the Director written 
exceptions to the administrative law judge's recommended decision, 
findings, conclusions or proposed order, to the admission or exclusion 
of evidence, or to the failure of the administrative law judge to make a 
ruling proposed by a party. A supporting brief may be filed at the time 
the exceptions are filed, either as part of the same document or in a 
separate document.
    (b) Effect of failure to file or raise exceptions. (1) Failure of a 
party to file exceptions to those matters specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section within the time prescribed is deemed a waiver of objection 
thereto.
    (2) No exception need be considered by the Director if the party 
taking exception had an opportunity to raise the same objection, issue, 
or argument before the administrative law judge and failed to do so.
    (c) Contents. (1) All exceptions and briefs in support of such 
exceptions must be confined to the particular matters in, or omissions 
from, the administrative law judge's recommendations to which that party 
takes exception.

submitted to the Director for final decision.
    (b) Oral argument before the Director. Upon the initiative of the 
Director or on the written request of any party filed with the Director 
within the time for filing exceptions, the Director may order and hear 
oral argument on the recommended findings, conclusions, decision, and 
order of the administrative law judge. A written request by a party must 
show good cause for oral argument and state reasons why arguments cannot 
be presented adequately in writing. A denial of a request for oral 
argument may be set forth in the Director's final decision. Oral 
argument before the Director must be on the record.
    (c) Director's final decision. (1) Decisional employees may advise 
and assist the Director in the consideration and disposition of the 
case. The final decision of the Director will be based upon review of 
the entire record of the proceeding, except that the director may limit 
the issues to be reviewed to those findings and conclusions to which 
opposing arguments or exceptions have been filed by the parties.
    (2) The Director shall render a final decision within 90 days after 
notification of the parties that the case has been submitted for final 
decision, or 90 days after oral argument, whichever is

[[Page 37]]

later, unless the Director orders that the action or any aspect thereof 
be remanded to the administrative law judge for further proceedings. 
Copies of the final decision and order of the Director shall be served 
upon each party to the proceeding, upon other persons required by 
statute, and, if directed by the Director or required by statute, upon 
any appropriate state or Federal supervisory authority.

    The commencement of proceedings for judicial review of a final 
decision and order of the Office may not, unless specifically ordered by

as it finds just, stay the effectiveness of all or any part of its order 
pending a final decision on a petition for review of the order.

    (d) Conduct of the deposition. The witness must be duly sworn, and 
each party shall have the right to examine the witness with respect to 
all non-privileged, relevant and material matters of which the witness 
has factual, direct and personal knowledge. Objections to questions or 
exhibits shall be in short form, stating the grounds for objection. 
Failure to object to questions or exhibits is not a waiver except where 
the grounds for the objection might have been avoided if the objection 
had been timely presented. The court reporter shall transcribe or 
otherwise record the witness's testimony, as agreed among the parties.
    (e) Protective orders. At any time after notice of a deposition has 
been given, a party may file a motion for the

[[Page 38]]

issuance of a protective order. Such protective order may prohibit, 
terminate, or limit the scope or manner of the taking of a deposition. 
The administrative law judge shall grant such protective order upon a 
showing of sufficient grounds, including that the deposition:
    (1) Is unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly 
burdensome;
    (2) Involves privileged, investigative, trial preparation,

paid the same expenses in the same manner as are paid witnesses in the 
district courts of the United States in proceedings in which the United 
States Government is a party. Expenses in accordance with this paragraph

    (g) Deposition subpoenas--(1) Issuance. At the request of a party, 
the administrative law judge shall issue a subpoena requiring the 
attendance of a witness at a deposition. The attendance of a witness may 
be required from any place in any state or territory that is subject to 
the jurisdiction of the United States or as otherwise permitted by law.
    (2) Service. The party requesting the subpoena must serve it on the 
person named therein or upon that person's counsel, by any of the 
methods identified in Sec. 509.11(d) of this part. The party serving the 
subpoena must file proof of service with the administrative law judge.

file a motion to quash or modify the subpoena. A statement of the 
reasons for the motion must accompany it and a copy of the motion must

made prior to the time for compliance specified in the subpoena and not 
more than ten days after the date of service of the subpoena, or if the 
subpoena is served within 15 days of the hearing, within five days after

Sec. 509.103  Civil money penalties.

    (a) Assessment. In the event of consent, or if upon the record 
developed at the hearing the Office finds that any of the grounds 
specified in the notice issued pursuant to Sec. 509.18 of this part have 
been established, the Office may serve an order of assessment of civil 
money penalty upon the party concerned. The assessment order shall be 
effective immediately upon service or upon such other date as may be 
specified therein and shall remain effective and enforceable until it is 
stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside by the Office or by a 
reviewing court.
    (b) Payment. (1) Civil penalties assessed pursuant to subpart A of 
this part and this subpart B are payable and to be collected within 60 
days after the issuance of the notice of assessment, unless the Office 
fixes a different time for payment where it determines that the purpose 
of the civil money penalty would be better served thereby; however, if a 
party has made a timely request for a hearing to challenge the 
assessment of the penalty, the party may not be required to pay such 
penalty until the Office has issued a final order of assessment 
following the hearing. In such instances, the penalty shall be paid 
within 60 days of service of such order unless the Office fixes a 
different time for payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Office 
may seek to attach the party's assets or to have a receiver appointed to 
secure payment of the potential civil money penalty or other obligation 
in advance of the hearing in accordance with section 8(i)(4) of the FDIA 
(12 U.S.C. 1818(i)(4)).
    (2) Checks in payment of civil penalties shall be made payable to 
the Treasurer of the United States and sent to the Controller's Division 
of the Office. Upon receipt, the Office shall forward the check to the 
Treasury of the United States.

<R05>
Sec. 510.5  Release of unpublished OTS information.

    (a) Scope. (1) This section applies to requests by the public for 
unpublished OTS information, such as requests for records or testimony 
from parties to lawsuits in which the OTS is not a party.
    (2) Unpublished OTS information includes records created or obtained 
in connection with the OTS's performance of its responsibilities, such 
as records concerning supervision, regulation, and examination of 
savings associations, their holding companies, and affiliates, and 
records compiled in connection with the OTS's enforcement 
responsibilities. Unpublished OTS information also includes information 
that current and former employees, officers, and agents obtained in 
their official capacities. Examples of unpublished information include:
    (i) Information in the memory of a current or former employee, 
officer, or agent of the OTS (or the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the 
predecessor agency of the OTS), by testimony or informal interview, that 
was acquired in the course of performing official duties or because of 
the employee's, officer's or agent's official status;
    (ii) Reports of examination, supervisory correspondence, internal 
agency memoranda and investigatory files compiled in connection with an 
investigation, whether such records are in the possession of the OTS or 
some other individual or entity; and
    (iii) Unpublished OTS records obtained by or in the possession of 
third parties, including other government agencies.
    (3) This section does not apply to:
    (i) Requests for records or testimony in proceedings in which the 
OTS is a party;
    (ii) Requests for information by other government agencies, except 
when specifically provided; and
    (iii) Requests for records that are required to be disclosed under 
the Freedom of Information Act, see 5 U.S.C. 552, and 31 CFR 1.1-1.6.
    (b) Purpose. The purposes of this section are:
    (1) To afford an orderly mechanism for the OTS to expeditiously 
process requests for unpublished OTS information and, where appropriate, 
for the OTS to assert evidentiary privileges in litigation;
    (2) To balance the need for confidentiality of unpublished OTS 
information

[[Page 41]]

with the private party's interest in obtaining disclosure of that 
information;
    (3) To ensure that the time of OTS employees is utilized in the most 
efficient manner consistent with the OTS's statutory mission;
    (4) To prevent undue burdens on the OTS;
    (5) To limit the expenditure of the OTS's funds for private 
purposes; and
    (6) To maintain the impartiality of the OTS among private litigants.
    (c) Procedure.--(1) Requests for records and testimony in general. A 
request for unpublished OTS information must be in writing, furnish the 
caption of the lawsuit if the request arises in the course of 
litigation, and support the requester's claim that the information 
sought is highly relevant to the purpose for which it is sought. In 
demonstrating that the information is highly relevant, the requester 
must explain in detail how the requested OTS information relates to the 
issues in the case or the matter.
    (i) For requests arising in lawsuits, the submission also must 
include:
    (A) A copy of the complaint or equivalent document in the case and 
any other pleadings necessary to show relevance;
    (B) A description of any prior decisions or pending motions in the 
case that may bear on the asserted relevance of the information being 
sought from the OTS; and
    (C) The names, addresses and phone numbers of counsel to all other 
parties in the case.
    (ii) In all instances, in addition to demonstrating that the 
information sought is highly relevant to the purpose for which it is 
sought, the requester must:
    (A) Demonstrate that the information sought is not available from 
any other source; and
    (B) Demonstrate that the need for the information clearly outweighs 
the need to maintain the confidentiality of the OTS information and the 
burden on the OTS to produce the information.
    (iii) If a request seeks a response in fewer than 30 days, it must 
include an explanation of why the requester was unable to submit the 
request earlier and why expediting the request is required.
    (2) Additional provisions relating to requests for records. In 
addition to the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the 
provisions in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (c)(2)(ii) of this section apply 
to requests for disclosure of records.
    (i) A request for records must list the categories of records sought 
and describe the specific information sought, including the relevant 
time period.
    (ii) When the OTS believes that another person has a claim of 
privilege regarding the information in the records and the records are 
in the possession or control of that person, such as reports prepared by 
a savings association's attorneys that are shared with the OTS, the OTS 
may respond to the request by authorizing that person to release the 
records pursuant to an appropriate confidentiality order rather than by 
the OTS releasing the records directly to the requesting party. This 
will enable the person possessing or controlling the records to argue 
any issues of privilege to the appropriate court.
    (3) Additional provisions relating to requests for testimony from 
OTS employees. In addition to the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section, the provisions in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (c)(3)(iv) 
of this section apply to requests that current or former OTS employees 
be authorized to give testimony.
    (i) The request must specifically describe the substance of the 
testimony sought and show a compelling need for the testimony. A showing 
of compelling need should include a demonstration that the requested 
information is not available from any other source, such as the books 
and records of other persons or entities, OTS records that have been or 
might be released, or the testimony of other non-OTS persons, including 
retained experts.
    (ii) OTS employees will not be authorized to provide expert or 
opinion testimony for private parties.
    (iii) The OTS expects litigants to anticipate their need for OTS 
testimony in sufficient time to request and obtain that testimony in 
deposition form. A request for testimony at a trial or hearing may not 
be granted unless the

[[Page 42]]

requester shows that properly developed deposition testimony could not 
be used or would not be adequate at the trial or hearing.
    (iv) The OTS shall specify the scope of any authorized testimony and 
may take steps to ensure that the scope of testimony taken adheres to 
the scope authorized. Parties to the case who did not join in the 
request and who wish to question the witness beyond the authorized scope 
should request expanded authorization pursuant to this regulation. The 
OTS will attempt to render decisions on such requests in an expedited 
manner.
    (4) Information available to savings associations, holding 
companies, state and Federal agencies and requesters. (i) The regular 
report of examination of a savings association, savings and loan holding 
company, or other affiliate of a savings association is made available 
by the appropriate Regional Office to the entity examined.
    (ii) A subsidiary savings association of a savings and loan holding 
company may reproduce and furnish a copy of its report of examination 
and related supervisory correspondence of the savings association to its 
parent holding company(ies) without prior approval of the OTS. A savings 
and loan holding company may reproduce and furnish a copy of its report 
of examination and related supervisory correspondence to another 
affiliated savings and loan holding company that controls the same 
savings association or its subsidiary savings association(s) without 
prior approval of the OTS. This paragraph does not require such 
disclosure by a parent savings and loan holding company or subsidiary 
savings association.
    (iii) Reports of examination and other information relating to 
state-chartered savings associations and affiliates are made available, 
upon request, by the OTS to the state governmental authority having 
general supervision of such state-chartered savings associations.
    (iv) Reports of examination and other information may be made 
available by the OTS to other agencies of the United States, a state 
agency, or to the Federal Home Loan Banks, for use where necessary in 
the performance of their official duties.
    (v) All reports or other information made available to savings 
associations, holding companies, affiliates, other governmental agencies 
or requesters shall remain the property of the OTS and, except as 
permitted by this section or otherwise by the Director or his delegate, 
no person, company, agency, or authority to whom the information is made 
available, or any officer, director, employee or agent thereof, shall 
disclose any such information except published statistical material that 
would not disclose the identity of any individual or corporation.
    (5) Where to submit requests. In all matters covered by this 
section, notification of the issuance of subpoenas or compulsory process 
and requests for records or testimony covered by this section must be 
sent to the OTS at 1700 G Street NW., Washington, DC 20552, to the 
attention of the Corporate Secretary, and should be labelled ``Request 
for Release of Unpublished Information Under Section 510.5.'' Requesters 
may furnish copies of the request or subpoenas simultaneously to the 
appropriate OTS Regional Office, but the furnishing of such copies does 
not constitute service on the OTS.
    (d) Consideration of requests--(1) In general. The OTS will 
generally process requests in the order in which they are received. The 
OTS will endeavor to respond to requests within 30 days, but this may 
vary depending on the scope and precision of the request. The OTS will 
weigh requests for processing in less than 30 days against the burden to 
the OTS of expedited processing and the unfairness to other parties 
whose pending requests may be delayed.
    (2) Consultation with requester. The OTS may consult with the 
requester to:
    (i) Refine and limit the scope of the request so as to reduce the 
burden and expense on the OTS; or
    (ii) Obtain additional information necessary for the OTS to make an 
informed determination on the request. To the extent necessary to reach 
an informed determination on the request, the OTS may inquire into the 
circumstances of the underlying matter

[[Page 43]]

and rely on sources of information beyond the requester, including other 
interested parties.
    (3) Final determinations. Final determinations on requests will be 
made by the Director or his delegate. All such determinations are the 
sole discretion of the Director or his delegate. Requesters will be 
notified in writing of the disposition of the request.
    (4) Denial of requests. (i) The OTS may deny requests for records or 
testimony that seek information that the OTS deems to be:
    (A) Not highly relevant;
    (B) Privileged;
    (C) Available from other sources; or
    (D) Information that should not be disclosed for reasons that 
warrant restriction of discovery under the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure (28 U.S.C. appendix).
    (ii) The OTS may also deny a records or testimony request when it 
considers production of the information to be overly burdensome or 
contrary to the public interest, or where OTS determines that the need 
for the information does not clearly outweigh the need to maintain the 
confidentiality of the information, or where the requester seeks 
testimony and has not shown a compelling need for the testimony.
    (5) Confidentiality Orders and Agreements. As is set forth in 
paragraph (f) of this section, the OTS may condition release of 
information on the entry by the relevant tribunal of an order 
satisfactory to the OTS or, in a non-litigated matter, the execution of 
a confidentiality agreement that limits access of third parties to the 
unpublished OTS information. It shall be the duty of the requesting 
party to obtain such an order or to execute a confidentiality agreement.
    (e) Parties with access to OTS information; restriction on 
dissemination--(1) Current and former employees. Except as authorized by 
this section or as otherwise authorized by the Director or his delegate, 
no current or former employee, officer or agent of the OTS or a 
predecessor agency shall disclose or permit the disclosure of any 
unpublished information of the OTS to anyone (other than an employee, 
officer or agent of the OTS properly entitled to such information for 
the performance of their official duties), whether by giving out or 
furnishing such information or a copy thereof or by allowing any person 
to inspect, examine, or copy such information or copy thereof, or 
otherwise.
    (2) Duty of person served. If any person, whether or not a current 
or former employee, officer or agent of the OTS, has information of the 
OTS that may not be disclosed under the regulations of the OTS or other 
applicable law, and in connection therewith is served with a subpoena, 
order, or other process requiring personal attendance as a witness or 
production of records or information in any proceeding, that person 
shall promptly advise the OTS of such service or request for 
information. Upon such notice the OTS will take appropriate action to 
advise the court or tribunal that issued the process and the attorney 
for the party at whose instance the process was issued, if known, of the 
substance of this section. Such notice to the OTS shall be made by 
contacting the Litigation Division, Office of Chief Counsel, Office of 
Thrift Supervision, 1700 G Street NW., Washington, DC 20552. As provided 
in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, a person so served with process may 
not disclose OTS information without OTS authorization. To obtain OTS 
authorization, a request must be sent to the OTS in Washington, DC, in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
    (3) Appearance by person served. Except as the OTS has authorized 
disclosure of the relevant information, or except as authorized by law, 
any person who has information of the OTS that may not be disclosed 
under this section and is required to respond to a subpoena or other 
legal process shall attend at the time and place therein mentioned and 
respectfully decline to produce such records or give any testimony with 
respect thereto, basing such refusal on this part. If, notwithstanding, 
the court or other body orders the disclosure of such records or the 
giving of such testimony, the person having such information of the OTS 
shall continue respectfully to decline to produce such information and 
shall promptly advise the Litigation Division of the Chief Counsel's 
Office, Office of Thrift Supervision. Upon such notice the OTS

[[Page 44]]

will take appropriate action to advise the court or tribunal which 
issued the order, of the substance of this section.
    (4) Non-waiver of privilege. The possession by any entity or 
individual described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section of OTS records 
covered by this section shall not waive any privilege of the OTS or the 
OTS's right to supervise the further dissemination of these records.
    (f) Orders and agreements protecting the confidentiality of 
unpublished OTS information--(1) Records. Unless otherwise permitted by 
the OTS, release of records authorized pursuant to this section will be 
conditioned by the OTS upon entry of an acceptable protective order by 
the court or administrative tribunal presiding in the particular case, 
or, in non-litigated matters, upon execution of an acceptable 
confidentiality agreement. In cases where protective orders have already 
been entered, the OTS reserves the right to condition approval for 
release of information upon the inclusion of additional or amended 
provisions.
    (2) Testimony. The OTS may condition its authorization of deposition 
testimony on an agreement of the parties that the transcript of the 
testimony will be kept under seal, or will be made available only to the 
parties, the court and the jury, except to the extent that the OTS may 
allow use of the transcript in related litigation. The party who 
requested the testimony shall, at its expense, furnish to the OTS a copy 
of the transcript of testimony of the OTS employee or former employee.
    (g) Limitation of burden on the OTS in connection with released 
records--(1) Authentication for use as evidence. The OTS will 
authenticate released records to facilitate their use as evidence. 
Requesters who require authenticated records should request certified 
copies at least 30 days prior to the date they will be needed. The 
request should be sent to the OTS Public Disclosure Branch and shall 
identify the records, giving the office or record depository where they 
are located (if known) and include copies of the records and payment of 
the certification fee.
    (2) Responsibility of litigants to share released records. The party 
who has sought and obtained OTS records has the responsibility of:
    (i) Notifying other parties to the case of the release and, after 
entry of a protective order, providing copies of the records to the 
other parties who are subject to the protective order; and
    (ii) Retrieving any records from the court's file as soon as the 
records are no longer required by the court and returning them to the 
OTS. Where a party may be involved in related litigation, the OTS may, 
upon a request made to it pursuant to this section, authorize such party 
to transfer the records for use in that related case.
    (h) Fees--(1) Fees for records searches, copying and certifications. 
Requesters shall be charged fees in accordance with Treasury Department 
regulations, 31 CFR 1.7. With certain exceptions, the regulations in 31 
CFR 1.7 provide for recovery of the full direct costs of searching, 
reviewing, certifying and duplicating the records sought. An estimate of 
the statement of charges will be sent to requesters, and fees shall be 
remitted by check payable to the OTS prior to release of the requested 
records. Where it deems appropriate, the OTS may contract with 
commercial copying concerns to copy the records, with the cost billed to 
the requester.
    (2) Witness fees and allowances. (i) Litigants whose requests for 
testimony of current OTS employees are approved shall, upon completion 
of the testimonial appearance, promptly tender a check payable to the 
OTS for witness fees and allowances in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1821.
    (ii) All litigants whose requests for testimony of former OTS 
employees are approved, shall also promptly tender witness fees and 
allowances to the witness in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1821.

Sec. 512.1  Scope of part.

    This part prescribes rules of practice and procedure applicable to 
the conduct of investigative proceedings under section 10(g)(2) of the

Deposit Insurance Act, as amended, 12 U.S.C. 1817(j)(15) (``FDIA''), 
section 8(n) of the FDIA, 12 U.S.C. 1818(n), or section 10(c) of the 
FDIA, 12 U.S.C. 1820(c). This part does not apply to adjudicatory 
proceedings as to which hearings are required by statute, the rules for 
which are contained in part 509 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 512.2  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    (a) Office means the Office of Thrift Supervision;
    (b) Investigative proceeding means an investigation conducted under 
section 10(g)(2) of the HOLA;
    (c) Formal examination proceeding means the administration of oaths 
and affirmations, taking and preserving of testimony, requiring the 
production of books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, and all other 
records, the issuance of subpoenas, and all related activities in 
connection with examination of savings associations and their affiliates 
conducted pursuant to section 5(d)(1)(B) of the HOLA, section 7(j)(15) 
of the FDIA, section 8(n) of the FDIA or section 10(c) of the FDIA; and
    (d) Designated representative means the person or persons empowered 
by the Office to conduct an investigative proceeding or a formal 
examination proceeding.

[[Page 46]]


<R05>
Sec. 512.3  Confidentiality of proceedings.

    All formal examination proceedings shall be private and, unless 
otherwise ordered by the Office, all investigative proceedings shall 
also be private. Unless otherwise ordered or permitted by the Office, or 
required by law, and except as provided in Secs. 512.4 and 512.5, the 
entire record of any investigative proceeding or formal examination 
proceeding, including the resolution of the Office or its delegate(s) 
authorizing the proceeding, the transcript of such proceeding, and all 
documents and information obtained by the designated representative(s) 
during the course of said proceedings shall be confidential.


<R05>
Sec. 512.4  Transcripts.

    Transcripts or other recordings, if any, of investigative 
proceedings or formal examination proceedings shall be prepared solely 
by an official reporter or by any other person or means authorized by 
the designated representative. A person who has submitted documentary 
evidence or given testimony in an investigative proceeding or formal 
examination proceeding may procure a copy of his own documentary 
evidence or transcript of his own testimony upon payment of the cost 
thereof; provided, that a person seeking a transcript of his own 
testimony must file a written request with the Deputy Chief Counsel for 
Enforcement or the appropriate Regional Counsel for Enforcement stating 
the reason he desires to procure such transcript, and said persons may 
for good cause deny such request. In any event, any witness (or his 
counsel) shall have the right to inspect the transcript of the witness' 
own testimony.
[54 FR 49457, Nov. 30, 1989, as amended at 60 FR 66717, Dec. 26, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 512.5  Rights of witnesses.

    (a) Any person who is compelled or requested to furnish documentary 
evidence or give testimony at an investigative proceeding or formal 
examination proceeding shall have the right to examine, upon request, 
the Office resolution authorizing such proceeding. Copies of such 
resolution shall be furnished, for their retention, to such persons only 
with the written approval of the Deputy Chief Counsel for Enforcement or 
the appropriate Regional Counsel for Enforcement.
    (b) Any witness at an investigative proceeding or formal examination 
proceeding may be accompanied and advised by an attorney personally 
representing that witness.
    (1) Such attorney shall be a member in good standing of the bar of 
the highest court of any state, Commonwealth, possession, territory, or 
the District of Columbia, who has not been suspended or debarred from 
practice by the bar of any such political entity or before the Office in 
accordance with the provisions of part 513 of this chapter and has not 
been excluded from the particular investigative proceeding or formal 
examination proceeding in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section.
    (2) Such attorney may advise the witness before, during, and after 
the taking of his testimony and may briefly question the witness, on the 
record, at the conclusion of his testimony, for the sole purpose of 
clarifying any of the answers the witness has given. During the taking 
of the testimony of a witness, such attorney may make summary notes 
solely for his use in representing his client. All witnesses shall be 
sequestered, and, unless permitted in the discretion of the designated 
representative, no witness or accompanying attorney may be permitted to 
be present during the taking of testimony of any other witness called in 
such proceeding. Neither attorney(s) for the association(s) that are the 
subjects of the investigative proceedings or formal examination 
proceedings, nor attorneys for any other interested persons, shall have 
any right to be present during the testimony of any witness not 
personally being represented by such attorney.
    (3) The Office, for good cause, may exclude a particular attorney 
from further participation in any investigation in which the Office has 
found the attorney to have engaged in dilatory, obstructionist, 
egregious, contemptuous or contumacious conduct. The person conducting 
an investigation may report to the Office instances of apparently 
dilatory, obstructionist, egregious, contemptuous or contumacious 
conduct on the part of an attorney.

[[Page 47]]

After due notice to the attorney, the Office may take such action as the 
circumstances warrant based upon a written record evidencing the conduct 
of the attorney in that investigation or such other or additional 
written or oral presentation as the Office may permit or direct.
[54 FR 49457, Nov. 30, 1989, as amended at 60 FR 66717, Dec. 26, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 512.6  Obstruction of the proceedings.

    The designated representative shall report to the Office any 
instances where any witness or counsel has engaged in dilatory, 
obstructionist, or contumacious conduct or has otherwise violated any 
provision of this part during the course of an investigative proceeding 
or formal examination proceeding; and the Office may take such action as 
the circumstances warrant, including the exclusion of counsel from 
further participation in such proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 512.7  Subpoenas.

    (a) Service. Service of a subpoena in connection with any 
investigative proceeding or formal examination proceeding shall be 
effected in the following manner:
    (1) Service upon a natural person. Service of a subpoena upon a 
natural person may be effected by handing it to such person; by leaving 
it at his office with the person in charge thereof, or, if there is no 
one in charge, by leaving it in a conspicuous place therein; by leaving 
it at his dwelling place or usual place of abode with some person of 
suitable age and discretion then residing therein; by mailing it to him 
by registered or certified mail or by an express delivery service at his 
last known address; or by any method whereby actual notice is given to 
him.
    (2) Service upon other persons. When the person to be served is not 
a natural person, service of the subpoena may be effected by handing the 
subpoena to a registered agent for service, or to any officer, director, 
or agent in charge of any office of such person; by mailing it to any 
such representative by registered or certified mail or by an express 
delivery service at his last known address; or by any method whereby 
actual notice is given to such person.
    (b) Motions to quash. Any person to whom a subpoena is directed may, 
prior to the time specified therein for compliance, but in no event more 
than 10 days after the date of service of such subpoena, apply to the 
Chief Counsel or his designee to quash or modify such subpoena, 
accompanying such application with a statement of the reasons therefor. 
The Chief Counsel or his designee, as appropriate, may:
    (1) Deny the application;
    (2) Quash or revoke the subpoena;
    (3) Modify the subpoena; or
    (4) Condition the granting of the application on such terms as the 
Chief Counsel or his designee determines to be just, reasonable, and 
proper.
    (c) Attendance of witnesses. Subpoenas issued in connection with an 
investigative proceeding or formal examination proceeding may require 
the attendance and/or testimony of witnesses from any State or territory 
of the United States and the production by such witnesses of documentary 
or other tangible evidence at any designated place where the proceeding 
is being (or is to be) conducted. Foreign nationals are subject to such 
subpoenas if such service is made upon a duly authorized agent located 
in the United States.
    (d) Witness fees and mileage. Witnesses summoned in any proceeding 
under this part shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid 
witnesses in the district courts of the United States. Such fees and 
mileage need not be tendered when the subpoena is issued on behalf of 
the Office by any of its designated representatives.

    (c) Temporary suspension. (1) The Office, with due regard to the 
public interest and without preliminary hearing, by order, may

    (i) Permanently enjoined (whether by consent, default or summary 
judgment or after trial) by any court of competent jurisdiction or by 
the Office itself in a final administrative order, by reason of his 
misconduct in any action brought by the Office based upon violations of, 
or aiding and abetting the violation of, the Home Owners, Loan Act of 
1933, as amended, 12 U.S.C. 1461 et seq., the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Act, as amended, 12 U.S.C. 1811 et seq. or any provision of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 78a, et seq., 
which is administered by the Office, or of any rule or regulation 
promulgated thereunder; or
    (ii) Found by any court of competent jurisdiction (whether by 
consent, default, or summary judgment, or after trial) in any action 
brought by the Office to which he is a party or found by the Office 
(whether by consent, default, upon summary judgment or after hearing) in 
any administrative proceeding in which the Office is a complainant and 
he is a party, to have willfully committed, caused or aided or abetted a 
violation of any provision of the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933, as 
amended, 12 U.S.C. 1461 et seq., the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as 
amended, 12 U.S.C. 1811 et seq. or any provision of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 78a, et seq., which is 
administered by the Office, or of any rule or regulation promulgated 
thereunder.
    (2) An order of temporary suspension shall become effective when 
served by certified or registered mail directed to

[[Page 50]]

the last known business or residential address of the person involved. 
No order of temporary suspension shall be entered by the Office pursuant 
to paragraph (c)(1) of this section more than three months after the 
final judgment or order entered in a judicial or administrative 
proceeding described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) or (c)(1)(ii) of this 
section has become effective and all review or appeal procedures have 
been completed or are no longer available.
    (3) Any person temporarily suspended from appearing and practicing 
before the Office in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
may, within 30 days after service upon him of the order of temporary 
suspension, petition the Office to lift such suspension. If no petition 
is received by the Office within those 30 days, the suspension shall 
become permanent.
    (4) Within 30 days after the filing of a petition in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the Office shall either lift the 
temporary suspension or set the matter down for hearing at a time and 
place to be designated by the Office, or both. After opportunity for 
hearing, the Office may censure the petitioner or may suspend the 
petitioner from appearing or practicing before the Office temporarily or 
permanently. In every case in which the temporary suspension has not 
been lifted, the hearing and any other action taken pursuant to this 
paragraph (c)(4) shall be expedited by the Office in order to ensure the 
petitioner's right to address the allegations against him.
    (5) In any hearing held on a petition filed in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a showing that the petitioner has been 
enjoined or has been found to have committed, caused or aided or abetted 
violations as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, without 
more, may be a basis for suspension or debarment; that showing having 
been made, the burden shall then be on the petitioner to show why he 
should not be censured or be temporarily or permanently suspended or 
debarred. A petitioner will not be permitted to contest any findings 
against him or any admissions made by him in the judicial or 
administrative proceedings upon which the proposed censure, suspension 
or debarment is based. A petitioner who has consented to the entry of a 
permanent injunction or order as described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of 
this section, without admitting the facts set forth in the complaint, 
shall nevertheless be presumed for all purposes under this section to 
have been enjoined or ordered by reason of the misconduct alleged in the 
complaint.


<R05>
Sec. 513.5  Reinstatement.

    (a) Any person who is suspended from practicing before the Office 
under paragraph (a) or (c) of Sec. 513.4 of this part may file an 
application for reinstatement at any time. Denial of the privilege of 
practicing before the Office shall continue unless and until the 
applicant has been reinstated by order of the Office for good cause 
shown.
    (b) Any person suspended under paragraph (b) of Sec. 513.4 shall be 
reinstated by the Office, upon appropriate application, if all of the 
grounds for application of the provisions of paragraph (b) of Sec. 513.4 
subsequently are removed by a reversal of the conviction or termination 
of the suspension, disbarment or revocation. An application for 
reinstatement on any other grounds by any person suspended under 
paragraph (b) of Sec. 513.4 may be filed at any time. Such application 
shall state with particularity the relief desired and the grounds 
therefor and shall include supporting evidence, when available. The 
applicant shall be accorded an opportunity for an informal hearing in 
the matter, unless the applicant has waived a hearing in the application 
and, instead, has elected to have the matter determined on the basis of 
written submissions. Such hearing shall utilize the procedures 
established in Sec. 508.3 and paragraph (a) of Sec. 508.7 of this 
chapter. However, such suspension shall continue unless and until the 
applicant has been reinstated by order of the Office for good cause 
shown.

is the subject of a conviction, suspension, debarment, license

[[Page 51]]

or other finding of the kind described in Sec. 513.4 (b) or (c) of this 
part in an action not instituted by the Office shall promptly file a 
copy of the relevant order, judgment or decree with the Secretary to the 
Office together with any related opinion or statement of the agency or 
tribunal involved. Any person who fails to so file a copy of the order, 
judgment or decree within 30 days after the later of June 15, 1984, the 
entry of the order, judgment or decree, or the date such person 
initiates practice before the Office, for that reason alone may be 
disqualified from practicing before the Office until such time as the 
appropriate filing shall be made, but neither the filing of these 
documents nor the failure of a person to file them shall in any way 
impair the operation of any other provision of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 513.7  Proceeding under this part.

    (a) All hearings required or permitted to be held under paragraphs 
(a) and (c) of Sec. 513.4 of this part shall be held before a presiding 
officer utilizing the procedures established in the rules of practice

<R05>
Sec. 516.2  Applications processing guidelines.

    (a) General. (1) To ensure the timely processing of applications and 
notices, the OTS hereby sets forth guidelines for the processing of 
completed applications and notices (hereinafter collectively referred to 
as ``applications'') filed with the OTS. This section does not apply to 
applications or requests related to transactions pursuant to section 13 
(c) or (k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1823 (c), 
(k); or requests submitted in connection with cease-and-desist orders, 
temporary cease-and-desist orders, removal and/or prohibition orders, 
temporary suspension orders, supervisory agreements or directives, 
consent merger agreements, or documents negotiated in settlement of 
litigation (including requests for termination or modification of, or 
for approval pursuant to, such orders, agreements, or documents), or 
similar litigation or enforcement matters. Requests submitted in 
connection with cease-and-desist orders, removal and/or prohibition 
orders, supervisory agreements or directives, consent merger agreements, 
and other documents negotiated in settlement of litigation 
(``enforcement documents'') are not covered by this section. However, 
the fact that a regulation involving an application may be mentioned in 
an enforcement document does not mean that this section does not apply 
to that application. Requests to engage in activities that are 
specifically restricted by enforcement

[[Page 53]]

documents and requests for termination or modification of such documents 
are not covered by this section. Applications submitted pursuant to a 
regulatory requirement that the prior approval of the OTS be obtained 
before engaging in a proposed activity, however, are covered, whether or 
not mentioned in an enforcement document. If the application or request 
is unique to the enforcement document, then it is not covered by this 
section.
    (2) Requests for reconsideration, modification, or appeal of final 
agency actions of the OTS are not covered by this section. In addition, 
where other regulations of the OTS establish specific procedures for 
processing of applications or set forth specific time periods for 
automatic approval of applications unless such applications are 
disapproved or objections are raised, the provisions of those 
regulations are controlling with respect to the matters to which they 
pertain. Where a regulation sets forth a procedure for processing an 
application but does not contain a time period pursuant to which such 
application is to be processed, the application will be processed under 
the procedure established by the regulation, but will be subject to the 
time periods contained in this section.
    (b) Applications submitted for review. An application submitted to 
the OTS for processing shall be submitted on the designated form and 
shall comply with all applicable regulations and guidelines governing 
the filing of such applications. The OTS is required to notify an 
applicant in writing within 5 business days of receipt of an 
application.
    (c) Accepting applications for processing. (1) Within 30 calendar 
days of receipt of a properly submitted application for processing, the 
OTS shall:
    (i) Request in writing any additional information necessary to 
complete the application;
    (ii) Deem the application to be complete; or
    (iii) Decline to further process the application if it is deemed by 
the OTS to be materially deficient and/or substantially incomplete.

Failure by the OTS to act as described in paragraph (c)(1)(i), 
(c)(1)(ii), or (c)(1)(iii) of this section within 30 calendar days of 
receipt of an application for processing shall result in the filed 
application's being deemed complete, thereby commencing the period for 
review. If an application includes a request for a waiver of an 
application requirement that certain information be supplied, the waiver 
request shall be deemed granted, unless within 30 calendar days of 
receipt of a properly submitted application for processing, the OTS 
requests in writing additional information about the waiver request, or 
denies the waiver request in writing.
    (2) Failure by an applicant to respond fully to a written request by 
the OTS for additional information within 30 calendar days of the date 
of such request may be deemed to constitute withdrawal of the 
application or may be treated as grounds for denial or disapproval of 
the application. If an application is deemed withdrawn, the application 
may be resubmitted for processing, but it will be deemed a new filing 
under the applicable statute or regulation.
    (3) An applicant may request in writing a brief extension of the 30-
day period for responding to a request for additional information 
described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section prior to the expiration of 
the 30-day time period. The OTS, at its option, may grant an applicant a 
limited extension of time in writing. Failure by an applicant to respond 
fully to a written request for additional information by the expiration 
of the extended period permitted by the OTS may be deemed to constitute 
withdrawal of the application or may be treated as grounds for denial or 
disapproval of the application.
    (4) The period for review by the OTS of an application will commence 
on the date that the application is deemed complete. The OTS shall 
notify an applicant in writing as to whether the application is deemed 
complete within 15 calendar days after the timely filing of any 
additional information furnished in response to any initial or 
subsequent request by the OTS for additional information. If the OTS 
fails to notify an applicant in writing within such time, the 
application shall be deemed to be complete as of the expiration of such 
15-day period. If additional information

[[Page 54]]

furnished in response to a written request by the OTS for additional 
information includes a request for a waiver of an application 
requirement that certain information be supplied, the waiver request 
shall be deemed granted, unless within 15 calendar days after the timely 
filing of such additional information the OTS:
    (i) Request in writing additional information about the waiver 
request; or
    (ii) Denies the waiver request in writing.
    (5) After additional information has been requested and supplied, 
the OTS may request additional information only with respect to matters 
derived from or prompted by information already furnished, or 
information of a material nature that was not reasonably available from 
the applicant at the time of the application, was concealed, or pertains 
to developments subsequent to the time of the OTS's initial request for 
additional information. With regard to information of a material nature 
that was not reasonably available from the applicant, was concealed at 
the time an application was deemed to be complete, or pertains to 
developments subsequent to the time an application was deemed to be 
complete, the OTS may request in writing such additional information as 
it considers necessary and, at its option, may deem the application not 
to be complete until such additional information is furnished. Upon 
receipt of such additional information, the OTS shall:
    (i) Request in writing further additional information to complete 
the application;
    (ii) Deem the application to be complete and commence a new review 
period of the completed application; or
    (iii) Deem the application to be materially deficient and/or 
substantially incomplete and return it to the applicant. In the case of 
an application that raises a significant issue of policy or law, actions 
taken by the Region shall not commence any of the periods for review of 
a completed application described in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (6) [Reserved]
    (7) The OTS, at its discretion, may deem an application to be 
materially deficient and/or substantially incomplete in the event that 
the applicant or an affiliate of the applicant is or becomes subject to 
an investigation, examination, administrative proceeding by a federal or 
state or municipal court, department, agency or commission or other 
governmental entity, or a self-regulatory trade or professional 
organization, or intra-governmental inquiry, that is pertinent to the 
standards applicable to the OTS's evaluation of the application or 
relates to a determination the OTS is required to make in connection 
with the application under the applicable statute or regulation.
    (d) Failure by the OTS to approve or deny an application or to 
disapprove a notice. (1) If, upon expiration of the applicable period 
for review of any complete application to which this section applies, or 
any extension of such period, the OTS has failed to approve or deny such 
application (or, in the case of a notice, to disapprove such notice), 
the application shall, without further action, be deemed to be approved, 
or, in the case of a notice, not disapproved by the OTS. For purposes of 
the previous sentence, the period for review of all applications shall 
be 60 calendar days beginning from the application's deemed complete 
date, including any application or notice submitted pursuant to 
Sec. 575.3(b) or part 574 of this chapter.
    (2) In the event that more than one application is being submitted 
in connection with a proposed transaction or other action, the 
applicable period for review of all such applications shall be the 
review period for the application having the longest period for review, 
subject to any applicable statutory periods.
    (e) Extension of time for review. The period for review of an 
application deemed to be complete may be extended by the OTS for 30 days 
beyond the time period for review set forth in paragraph (d) of this 
section. The OTS shall notify an applicant at least 10 days prior to the 
expiration of the period for review of a complete application that such 
review period is being extended for 30 days and shall state the general 
reason(s) therefor.
    (f) Extension of time for OTS's review of applications raising 
significant issues of

[[Page 55]]

law or policy. In those situations in which an application presents a 
significant issue of law or policy, the applicable period for review of 
such application also may be extended by the OTS beyond the time period 
for review set forth in paragraph (d) of this section or any extension 
thereof pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section until such time as the 
OTS acts upon the application. In such cases, written notice shall be 
provided to an applicant not later than the expiration of the time 
period set forth in paragraph (d) of this section or any extension 
thereof pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section that the period for 
review is being extended in accordance with this paragraph (f), which 
notice shall also state the general reason(s) therefor.

62 FR 64143, Dec. 4, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 516.3  Definitions.

    (a) Expedited treatment. (1) A savings association is eligible for 
expedited treatment by the OTS if all of the following conditions exist:
    (i) The savings association has a composite rating of 1 or 2;
    (ii) The savings association has a Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) 
rating of satisfactory or better;
    (iii) The savings association has a Compliance rating of 1 or 2;
    (iv) The savings association is meeting all of its capital 
requirements under part 567 of this chapter; and
    (v) The savings association has not been notified by supervisory 
personnel that it is a problem association or an association in troubled 
condition.
    (2) Where specified by regulation, a savings association that 
qualifies for expedited treatment under paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
may engage in activities upon filing a notice with the OTS together with 
any necessary certifications. For these activities, a notice will be all 
that is required and an association may engage in the activity unless 
the OTS objects within 30 days. Such notices are deemed to be 
applications for purposes of statutory and regulatory references to 
``applications.''
    (3) The OTS may require complete applications from savings 
associations that otherwise qualify for expedited treatment in 
situations raising supervisory concern or a significant issue of law or 
policy and may request additional information from such associations 
when necessary. In these circumstances, the OTS may determine that such 
applications no longer qualify for expedited treatment.
    (b) Standard treatment. (1) A savings association will receive 
standard treatment if any of the following conditions exist:
    (i) The savings association has a composite rating of 3, 4 or 5;
    (ii) The savings association has a less than satisfactory CRA 
rating;
    (iii) The savings association has a Compliance rating of 3, 4, or 5;
    (iv) The savings association has inadequate capital, including 
failing any one of its capital requirements under part 567 of this 
chapter; or
    (v) The savings association has otherwise been notified by 
supervisory personnel as being a problem association or an association 
in troubled condition.
    (2) Savings associations receiving standard treatment shall be 
required to file complete applications under the applicable regulations 
of this chapter with the OTS. Such applications will be denied unless 
the association affirmatively demonstrates how the application will 
clearly improve its financial and/or managerial condition or improve its 
compliance with the CRA or other consumer-related statutes without 
adversely affecting its financial or managerial resources.
    (c) Composite rating. Composite rating means the composite numerical 
rating assigned to the savings association by the OTS under the Uniform 
Financial Institutions Rating System\1\ or an equivalent rating under a 
comparable rating system adopted by the OTS, and refers to the most 
recent rating (as determined either on-site or off-site by the most 
recent examination) of which the savings association has been notified 
in writing.

this part.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) CRA rating. Through June 30, 1989, savings associations received 
one of five CRA ratings: Outstanding (1), Good

[[Page 56]]

(2), Satisfactory (3), Needs Improvement (4), or Unsatisfactory (5). For 
examinations begun between July 1, 1989 and June 30, 1990, savings 
associations received numerical ratings of 1 through 5. During this 
period, ratings of 1 and 2 were considered satisfactory or better and 3, 
4, and 5 were less than satisfactory. Savings associations examined for 
CRA performance after July 1, 1990 receive one of four ratings: 
Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve, or Substantial 
Noncompliance.
    (e) Compliance rating. A savings association's Compliance rating is 
determined pursuant to the OTS Compliance Rating System which measures 
an association's compliance with civil rights, consumer protection, and 
public interest regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act, Bank 
Protection Act, Equal Employment Opportunity, Economic Sanctions, and 
Advertising.

    Source: 62 FR 64144, Dec. 4, 1997, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 516.160  What does this subpart do?

    This subpart contains informal and formal meeting procedures. It 
applies whenever a regulation incorporates the procedures in this 
subpart, or when otherwise required by the OTS.


<R05>
Sec. 516.170  What procedures govern informal meetings on applications?

    (a) When will the OTS arrange an informal meeting? The OTS may 
arrange an informal meeting with the applicant, commenters, or any other 
interested persons to clarify and narrow the issues and to facilitate 
the resolution of the issues. If a commenter has filed a written request 
for an informal meeting containing the information described at 
Sec. 516.120(b), the OTS will arrange an informal meeting. The OTS also 
may arrange an informal meeting on its own initiative.
    (b) What action will the OTS take on an informal meeting request? 
The OTS will inform the applicant and commenters requesting an informal 
meeting of the OTS decision on a request for an informal meeting, or of 
its decision to hold an informal meeting on its own initiative.
    (c) How will the OTS inform the informal meeting participants of the 
date, time, location and format for the informal meeting? The OTS will 
invite the applicant and the commenter filing the request for the 
informal meeting. The OTS may also invite any other interested persons 
to attend. The OTS will inform the participants of the date, time, 
location, and format for the informal meeting a reasonable time in 
advance of the informal meeting.
    (d) What procedures will govern the conduct of the informal meeting? 
The OTS may hold informal meetings in any format, including a telephone 
conference or face-to-face meeting.
    (e) Will there be an additional opportunity to discuss the 
application? Within three days after the informal meeting, any 
participant in the informal meeting may request the OTS to hold a formal 
meeting under Sec. 516.180. The participant should describe the nature 
of the issues or facts to be presented and the reasons why a formal 
meeting is necessary to make an adequate presentation of the facts or 
issues. The participant must file the request with the OTS and send 
copies of the request to other participants in the informal meeting.


<R05>
Sec. 516.180  What procedures govern formal meetings on applications?

    (a) When will the OTS hold a formal meeting? The OTS will not grant 
a request for a formal meeting unless an informal meeting has been 
conducted under Sec. 516.170. The OTS will grant all requests for a 
formal meeting filed under Sec. 516.170(e). The OTS may also hold a 
formal meeting on its own initiative, if it determines that written 
submissions and informal meetings are

[[Page 58]]

insufficient to adequately present issues or facts to the OTS, or that a 
formal meeting would otherwise benefit the decisionmaking process. The 
OTS may limit the issues considered at the formal meeting to issues that 
the OTS deems relevant or material.
    (b) How will the OTS announce the formal meeting? The OTS will issue 
a Notice of Formal Meeting that will state the subject and date of the 
filing, the time and place of the formal meeting and the issues to be 
addressed. The OTS will send the Notice to the applicant and any person 
requesting a formal meeting under Sec. 516.170(e). The OTS may also 
invite other interested persons to participate in the formal meeting by 
sending the Notice to such persons.
    (c) Who may participate in the formal meeting? A person receiving a 
Notice must notify the OTS of its intent to participate within ten days 
after the OTS issues the Notice. At least five days before the formal 
meeting, all participants in the formal meeting must provide the names 
of their witnesses and copies of proposed exhibits to the OTS, the 
applicant, and any other person designated by the OTS.
    (d) Will the formal meeting be transcribed? The OTS will arrange for 
a transcript. Each participant must bear the cost of any copies of the 
transcript it requests for its use.
    (e) What procedures govern the conduct of the formal meeting? (1) 
The OTS will appoint a presiding officer to conduct the formal meeting.

    (a) In connection with the extension of credit to consumers after 
January 1, 1986, it is an unfair act or practice within the meaning of 
section 5 of the Act for a savings association directly or indirectly to 
enter into a consumer credit obligation that constitutes or contains, or

association, any of the following provisions:
    (1) A cognovit or confession of judgment (for purposes other than

other waiver of the right to notice and the opportunity to be heard in 
the event of suit or process thereon;

to property subject to a security interest executed in connection with 
the obligation;
    (3) An assignment of wages or other earnings, unless:
    (i) The assignment by its terms is revocable at the will of the 
debtor,
    (ii) The assignment is a payroll deduction plan or preauthorized 
payment plan, commencing at the time of the transaction, in which the 
consumer authorizes a series of wage deductions as a method of making 
each payment, or
    (iii) The assignment applies only to wages or other earnings already 
earned at the time of the assignment.
    (4) A nonpossessory security interest in household goods other than 
a purchase-money security interest.


<R05>
Sec. 535.3  Unfair or deceptive cosigner practices.

    (a) General. In connection with the extension of credit to consumers 
after January 1, 1986, it is:
    (1) A deceptive act or practice within the meaning of section 5 of 
the Act for a savings association, directly or indirectly, to 
misrepresent the nature or extent of cosigner liability to any person.
    (2) An unfair act or practice within the meaning of section 5 of the 
Act for a savings association, directly or indirectly, to obligate a 
cosigner unless the cosigner is informed, prior to becoming obligated, 
of the nature of his or her liability as cosigner.
    (b) Disclosure requirement. (1) A clear and conspicuous document 
that shall contain the following statement or one which is substantially 
equivalent, shall be given to the consigner prior to becoming obligated 
(which, in the case of open-end credit, shall mean prior to the time 
that the cosigner becomes obligated for any fees or transaction on the 
account):

                           Notice of Cosigner

    You are being asked to guarantee this debt. Think carefully before 
you do. If the borrower doesn't pay the debt, you will have to. Be sure 
you can afford to pay if you have to, and that you want to accept this 
responsibility.
    You may have to pay up to the full amount of the debt if the 
borrower does not pay. You may also have to pay late fees or collection 
costs, which increase this amount.

[[Page 65]]

    The creditor can collect this debt from you without first trying to 
collect from the borrower. The creditor can use the same collection 
methods against you that can be used against the borrower, such as suing 
you, garnishing your wages, etc. If this debt is ever in default, that 
fact may become a part of your credit record.

    (2) Compliance with the disclosure requirement under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section shall constitute compliance with the consumer 
information requirement of paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (3) If the notice is a separate document, nothing other than the 
following times may appear with the notice:
    (i) The name and address of the savings association;
    (ii) An identification of the debt to be cosigned (e.g., a loan 
identification number);
    (iii) The date; and
    (iv) The statement, ``This notice is not the contract that makes you 
liable for the debt.''


<R05>
Sec. 535.4  Late charges.

    (a) In connection with collecting a debt arising out of an extension 
of credit to a consumer after January 1, 1986, it is an unfair act or 
practice within the meaning of section 5 of the Act for a savings 
association, directly or indirectly, to levy or collect any delinquency 
charge on a payment, which payment is otherwise a full payment for the

<R05>
Sec. 543.3  ``De novo'' applications for a Federal savings association charter.

    (a) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the term ``de novo 
association'' means any Federal savings association chartered by the 
Office, the business of which has not been conducted previously under 
any charter or conducted in the previous three years in substantially 
the same form as is proposed by the de novo association. A ``de novo 
applicant'' means any person or persons who apply to establish a de novo 
association.
    (b) Minimum initial capitalization. (1) A de novo association must 
have at least two million dollars in initial capital stock (stock 
institutions) or initial pledged savings or cash (mutual institutions), 
except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The minimum 
initial capitalization is the amount of proceeds net of all incurred and 
anticipated securities issuance expenses, organization expenses, pre-
opening expenses, or any expenses paid (or funds advanced) by organizers 
that are to be reimbursed from the proceeds of a securities offering. In 
securities offerings for a de novo association, all securities of a 
particular class in the initial offering shall be sold at the same 
price.
    (2) On a case by case basis, the Director may, for good cause, 
approve a de novo association that has less than two million dollars in 
initial capital or may require a de novo association to have more than 
two million dollars in initial capital.
    (c) Business and investment plans of de novo associations. (1) To 
assist the Office in making the determinations required under section 
5(e) of the Home Owners' Loan Act, a de novo applicant shall submit a 
business plan describing, for the first three years of operation of the 
de novo association, the major areas of operation, including:
    (i) Lending, leasing and investment activity, including plans for 
meeting Qualified Thrift Lender requirements;

[[Page 70]]

    (ii) Deposit, savings and borrowing activity;
    (iii) Interest-rate risk management;
    (iv) Internal controls and procedures;
    (v) Plans for meeting the credit needs of the proposed de novo 
association's community (including low- and moderate-income 
neighborhoods);
    (vi) Projected statements of condition;
    (vii) Projected statements of operations; and
    (viii) Any other information requested by the Office.
    (2) The business plan shall:
    (i) Provide for the continuation or succession of competent 
management subject to the approval of the Regional Director;
    (ii) Provide that any material change in, or deviation from, the 
business plan must receive the prior approval of the Regional Director;
    (iii) Demonstrate the de novo association's ability to maintain 
required minimum regulatory capital under 12 CFR parts 565 and 567 for 
the duration of the plan.
    (d) Composition of the board of directors. (1) A majority of a de 
novo association's board of directors must be representative of the 
state in which the savings association is located. The Office generally 
will consider a director to be representative of the state if the 
director resides, works or maintains a place of business in the state in 
which the savings association is located. If the association is located 
in a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), Primary Metropolitan 
Statistical Area (PMSA) or Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area 
(CMSA) that incorporates portions of more than one state, a director 
will be considered representative of the association's state if he or 
she resides, works or maintains a place of business in the MSA, PMSA or 
CMSA in which the association is located.
    (2) The de novo association's board of directors must be diversified 
and composed of individuals with varied business and professional 
experience. In addition, except in the case of a de novo association 
that is wholly-owned by a holding company, no more than one-third of a 
board of directors may be in closely related businesses. The background 
of each director must reflect a history of responsibility and personal 
integrity, and must show a level of competence and experience sufficient 
to demonstrate that such individual has the ability to direct the 
policies of the association in a safe and sound manner. Where a de novo 
association is owned by a holding company that does not have substantial 
independent economic substance, the foregoing standards will be applied 
to the board of directors of the holding company.
    (e) Management Officials. Proposed stockholders of ten percent or 
more of the stock of a de novo association will be considered management 
officials of the association for the purpose of the Office's evaluation 
of the character and qualifications of the management of the 
association. In connection with the Office's consideration of an 
application for permission to organize and subsequent to issuance of a 
Federal savings association charter to the association by the Office, 
any individual or group of individuals acting in concert under 12 CFR 
part 574, who owns or proposes to acquire, directly or indirectly, ten 
percent or more of the stock of an association subject to this section, 
shall submit a Biographical and Financial Report, on forms prescribed by 
the Office, to the Regional Director.
    (f) Supervisory transactions. This section does not apply to any 
application for a Federal savings association charter submitted in 
connection with a transfer or an acquisition of the business or accounts 
of a savings association if the Office determines that such transfer or 
acquisition is instituted for supervisory purposes, or in connection 
with applications for Federal charters for interim de novo associations 
chartered for the purpose of facilitating mergers, holding company 
reorganizations, or similar transactions.

<R05>
Sec. 543.5  Issuance of charter.

    Approval by the Office of the organization of a Federal savings 
association or the conversion of an insured association to Federal 
savings association form shall constitute issuance of a charter and 
shall be final, provided that the association complies with the

[[Page 71]]

procedures set out at Sec. 544.2(a) of this chapter. The charter shall 
conform with the requirements of Sec. 544.1 of this chapter, the 
permissible provisions of Sec. 544.2, or other provisions specifically 
approved by the Office.

    (a)(1) Temporary officers. When the Office approves an application 
for permission to organize a Federal savings association, the applicants 
shall constitute the organization committee and elect a chairperson, 
vice-chairperson, and a secretary, who shall act as the temporary 
officers of the association until their successors are duly elected and 
qualified. The temporary officers may effect compliance with any 
conditions prescribed by the Office.
    (2) Organization meeting. Promptly upon receipt of a charter, the 
temporary officers shall call a meeting of the association's capital 
subscribers; notice of such meeting shall be mailed to each subscriber 
at least 5 days before the meeting day. Subscribers who have subscribed 
for a majority of the association's capital, present in person or by 
proxy, shall constitute a quorum. At such meeting, directors of the 
association shall be elected according to the association's charter and 
bylaws, and any other action permitted by such charter and bylaws may be 
taken; any such action shall be considered an acceptance by the 
association of such charter and of such bylaws, which shall be in the 
form provided in parts 544 and 552 of this chapter.
    (b) First meeting of directors. Upon election, the association's 
board of directors shall hold a meeting to elect officers of the 
association as provided by its charter and bylaws and to take any other 
action necessary to permit operation of the association in accordance 
with law, the association's charter and bylaws, and these rules and 
regulations. When such officers have been bonded under Sec. 563.190 of 
this chapter, they shall immediately collect the sums due on 
subscriptions to the association's capital.
    (c) Membership in Federal Home Loan Bank and insurance of accounts. 
When a Federal savings association's charter is issued it must promptly 
qualify as a member of a Federal Home Loan Bank and meet all 
requirements necessary to obtain insurance of its accounts by the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
    (d) Failure to complete. Organization of a Federal savings 
association is completed when the organization meeting and the first 
meeting of its directors have been held, permanent officers have been 
bonded, the association holds the cash required to be paid on 
subscriptions to its capital, if required, Federal Home Loan Bank 
membership has been obtained and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
insurance of accounts has been confirmed and any conditions imposed by 
the Office in connection with approval of the application have been met. 
If organization is not so completed within six months after issuance of 
a charter, or within such additional period as the Director or his or 
her designee may for good cause grant, and in the case of an interim 
Federal savings association, if a merger, or other transaction 
facilitated by the existence of an interim association, has not been 
approved, the charter shall become void and all cash collected on 
subscriptions shall thereupon be returned.


<R05>
Sec. 543.7  Limitations on transaction of business.

    No person may organize a Federal savings association, collect money 
from others for such purpose, or represent himself or herself as 
authorized to do so, and no Federal savings association shall transact 
any business prior to completion of its organization, except as provided 
in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 543.7-1  Federal savings association created in connection with an association in default or in danger of default.

the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1441A), or is otherwise

in danger of default. Incorporation and organization of such 
associations are

complete when the Director or his or her designee so determines.

<R05>
Sec. 543.11-1  Grandfathered authority.

    (a) A Federal savings bank formerly chartered or designated as a 
mutual savings bank under state law may exercise any authority it was 
authorized to exercise as a mutual savings bank under state law at the 
time of its conversion from a state mutual savings bank to a Federal or 
other state charter. Except to the extent such authority may be 
exercised by Federal savings associations not enjoying grandfathered 
rights hereunder, such authority may be exercised only to the degree 
authorized under state law at the time of such conversion. Unless 
otherwise determined by the Director, an association, in the exercise of 
grandfathered authority, may continue to follow applicable state laws 
and regulations in effect at the time of such conversion.
    (b) A Federal savings association that acquires, or has acquired, a 
Federal savings bank by merger or consolidation may itself exercise any 
grandfathered rights enjoyed by the disappearing institution, whether 
such rights were obtained directly through conversion or through merger 
or consolidation. The extent of the grandfathered rights of a Federal 
savings association that disappeared prior to the effective date of this 
section shall be determined exclusively pursuant to this section.
    (c) This section shall not be construed to prevent the exercise by a 
Federal savings association enjoying grandfathered rights hereunder of 
authority that is available under the applicable state law only upon the 
occurrence of specific preconditions, such as the attainment of a 
particular future date or specified level of regulatory capital, which 
have not occurred at the time of conversion from a state mutual savings 
bank, provided they occur thereafter.
    (d) This section shall not be construed to permit the exercise of 
any particular authority on a more liberal basis than is allowable under 
the most liberal construction of either state or Federal law or 
regulation.


<R05>
Sec. 543.14  Continuity of existence.

    The corporate existence of an association converting under this part 
shall continue in its successor. Each savings or demand accountholder

                                 Bylaws


<R05>
Sec. 544.5  Federal mutual savings association bylaws.

    (a) General. A Federal mutual savings association shall operate 
under bylaws that contain provisions that comply with all requirements 
specified by the OTS in this section and that are not otherwise 
inconsistent with the provisions of this section, the association's 
charter, and all other applicable laws, rules, and regulations provided 
that, a bylaw provision inconsistent with the provisions of this section 
may be adopted with the approval of the OTS. Bylaws may be adopted, 
amended or repealed by a majority of the votes cast by the members at a 
legal meeting or a majority of the association's board of directors. The 
bylaws for a Federal mutual savings bank shall substitute the term 
``savings bank'' for ``association''. The term ``trustee'' may be 
substituted for the term ``director''.
    (b) The following requirements are applicable to Federal mutual 
savings associations:
    (1) Annual meetings of members. An association shall provide for and 
conduct an annual meeting of its members for the election of directors 
and at which any other business of the association may be conducted. 
Such meeting shall be held, as designated by its board of directors, at 
a location within the state that constitutes the principal place of 
business of the association, or at any other convenient place the board 
of directors may designate, and at a date and time within 150 days after 
the end of the association's fiscal year. At each annual meeting, the 
officers shall make a full report of the financial condition of the 
association and of its progress for the preceding year and shall outline 
a program for the succeeding year.
    (2) Special meetings of members. Procedures for calling any special 
meeting of the members and for conducting such a meeting shall be set 
forth in the bylaws. The subject matter of such special meeting must be 
established in the notice for such meeting. The board of directors of 
the association or the holders of 10 percent or more of the voting 
capital shall be entitled to call a special meeting. For purposes of 
this section, ``voting capital'' means FDIC-insured deposits as of the 
voting record date.
    (3) Notice of meeting of members. Notice specifying the date, time, 
and place of the annual or any special meeting and adequately describing 
any business to be conducted shall be published for two successive weeks 
immediately prior to the week in which such meeting shall convene in a 
newspaper of general circulation in the city or county in which the 
principal place of business of the association is located, or mailed 
postage prepaid at least 15 days and not more than 45 days prior to the 
date on which such meeting shall convene to each of its members of 
record at the last address appearing on the books of the association. A 
similar notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place in each of the 
offices of the association during the 14 days immediately preceding the 
date on which such meeting shall convene. The bylaws may permit a member 
to waive in writing any right to receive personal delivery of the 
notice. When any meeting is adjourned for 30 days or more, notice of the 
adjournment and reconvening of the meeting shall be given as in the case 
of the original meeting.
    (4) Fixing of record date. For the purpose of determining members 
entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of members or any 
adjournment thereof, or in order to make a determination of members for 
any other proper purpose, the bylaws shall provide for the fixing of a 
record date and a method for determining from the books of the 
association the members entitled to vote. Such date shall be not more 
than 60 days nor fewer than 10 days prior to the date on which the 
action, requiring such determination of members, is to be taken. The 
same determination shall apply to any adjourned meeting.
    (5) Member quorum. Any number of members present and voting, 
represented in person or by proxy, at a regular or special meeting of 
the members shall constitute a quorum. A majority of all votes cast at 
any meeting of the members shall determine any question, unless 
otherwise required by regulation. At any adjourned meeting, any business 
may be transacted that might have been transacted at the

[[Page 78]]

meeting as originally called. Members present at a duly constituted 
meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment.
    (6) Voting by proxy. Procedures shall be established for voting at 
any annual or special meeting of the members by proxy pursuant to the 
rules and regulations of the Office, including the placing of such 
proxies on file with the secretary of the association, for verification, 
prior to the convening of such meeting. Proxies may be given 
telephonically or electronically as long as the holder uses a procedure 
for verifying the identity of the member. All proxies with a term 
greater than eleven months or solicited at the expense of the 
association must run to the board of directors as a whole, or to a 
committee appointed by a majority of such board.
    (7) Communications between members. Provisions relating to 
communications between members shall be consistent with Sec. 544.8 of 
this part. No member, however, shall have the right to inspect or copy 
any portion of any books or records of a Federal mutual savings 
association containing:
    (i) A list of depositors in or borrowers from such association;
    (ii) Their addresses;
    (iii) Individual deposit or loan balances or records; or
    (iv) Any data from which such information could be reasonably 
constructed.
    (8) Number of directors, membership. The bylaws shall set forth a 
specific number of directors, not a range. The number of directors shall 
be not fewer than five nor more than fifteen, unless a higher or lower 
number has been authorized by the Director of the Office or his or her 
designee. Each director of the association shall be a member of the 
association. Directors may be elected for periods of one to three years 
and until their successors are elected and qualified, but if a staggered 
board is chosen, provision shall be made for the election of 
approximately one-third or one-half of the board each year, as 
appropriate. State-chartered savings banks converting to Federal savings 
banks may include alternative provisions for the election and term of 
office of directors so long as such provisions are authorized by the 
Office, and provide for compliance with the standard provisions of this 
section no later than six years after the conversion to a Federal 
savings association.
    (9) Meetings of the board. The board of directors shall determine 
the place, frequency, time, procedure for notice, which shall be at 
least 24 hours unless waived by the directors, and waiver of notice for 
all regular and special meetings. The meetings shall be under the 
direction of a chairman, appointed annually by the board; or in the 
absence of the chairman, the meetings shall be under the direction of 
the president. The board also may permit telephonic participation at 
meetings. The bylaws may provide for action to be taken without a 
meeting if unanimous written consent is obtained for such action. A 
majority of the authorized directors shall constitute a quorum for the 
transaction of business. The act of a majority of the directors present 
at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the board.
    (10) Officers, employees. and agents. (i) The bylaws shall contain 
provisions regarding the officers of the association, their functions, 
duties, and powers. The officers of the association shall consist of a 
president, one or more vice presidents, a secretary, and a treasurer or 
comptroller, each of whom shall be elected annually by the board of 
directors. Such other officers and assistant officers and agents as may 
be deemed necessary may be elected or appointed by the board of 
directors or chosen in such other manner as may be prescribed in the 
bylaws. Any two or more offices may be held by the same person, except 
the offices of president and secretary.
    (ii) All officers and agents of the association, as between 
themselves and the association, shall have such authority and perform 
such duties in the management of the association as may be provided in 
the bylaws, or as may be determined by resolution of the board of 
directors not inconsistent with the bylaws. In the absence of any such 
provision, officers shall have such powers and duties as generally 
pertain to their respective offices. Any officer may be removed by the 
board of directors with or without cause, but such removal,

[[Page 79]]

other than for cause, shall be without prejudice to the contractual 
rights, if any, of the person so removed.
    (iii) Any indemnification provision must provide that any 
indemnification is subject to applicable Federal law, rules, and 
regulations.
    (11) Vacancies, resignation or removal of directors. Members of the 
association shall elect directors by ballot: Provided, that in the event 
of a vacancy on the board, the board of directors may, by their 
affirmative vote, fill such vacancy, even if the remaining directors 
constitute less than a quorum. A director elected to fill a vacancy 
shall be elected to serve only until the next election of directors by 
the members. The bylaws shall set out the procedure for the resignation 
of a director, which shall be by written notice or by any other 
procedure established in the bylaws. Directors may be removed only for 
cause as defined in Sec. 563.39 of this chapter, by a vote of the 
holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election 
of directors.
    (12) Powers of the board. The board of directors shall have the 
power:
    (i) By resolution, to appoint from among its members and remove an

shall have and may exercise all the powers of the board between the 
meetings or the board; but no such committee shall have the authority of 
the board to amend the charter or bylaws, adopt a plan of merger, 
consolidation, dissolution, or provide for the disposition of all or 
substantially all the property and assets of the association. Such 
committee shall not operate to relieve the board, or any member thereof, 
of any responsibility imposed by law;
    (ii) To fix the compensation of directors, officers, and employees;

member and shall be voted upon, except, however, the bylaws may require 
that nominations by a member must be submitted to the secretary and then 
prominently posted in the principal place of business, at least 10 days 
prior to the date of the annual meeting. However, if such provision is 
made for prior submission of nominations by a member, then the bylaws 
must provide for a nominating committee, which, except in the case of a 
nominee substituted as a result of death or other incapacity, must 
submit nominations to the secretary and have such nominations similarly 
posted at least 15 days prior to the date of the annual meeting.

require that such new business be stated in writing and filed with the 
secretary prior to the annual meeting at least 30 days prior to the date 
of the annual meeting.
    (15) Amendment. Bylaws may include any provision for their amendment 
that would be consistent with applicable law, rules, and regulations and 
adequately addresses its subject and purpose.
    (i) Amendments shall be effective:
    (A) After approval by a majority vote of the authorized board, or by 
a majority of the vote cast by the members of the association at a legal 
meeting; and
    (B) After receipt of any applicable regulatory approval.
    (ii) When an association fails to meet its quorum requirement, 
solely due to vacancies on the board, the bylaws may be amended by an 
affirmative vote of a majority of the sitting board.
    (16) Miscellaneous. The bylaws may also address the subject of age 
limitations for directors or officers as long as they are consistent 
with applicable Federal law, rules or regulations, and any other 
subjects necessary or appropriate for effective operation of the 
association.
    (c) Form of filing--(1) Application requirement. (i) Any bylaw 
amendment shall be submitted to the OTS if it would:

assumption of control by a mutual account holder of the association, or 
the removal of incumbent management;

[[Page 80]]

    (B) Involve a significant issue of law or policy, including 
indemnification, conflicts of interest, and limitations on director or 
officer liability; or
    (C) Be inconsistent with the requirements of this section or with 
applicable laws, rules, regulations, or the association's charter.

    (iii) For purposes of this paragraph (c), bylaw provisions that 
adopt the language of the model bylaws set forth in OTS's Application 
Processing Handbook, if adopted without change, and filed within 30 days 
after adoption, are effective upon adoption.
    (2) Filing requirement. If the proposed bylaw amendment does not 
involve a provision that would be covered by paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(3) 
of this section, then the association shall submit the amendment to the 
OTS at least 30 days prior to the date the bylaw amendment is to be 
adopted by the association.
    (3) Corporate governance procedures. A Federal mutual association 
may elect to follow the corporate governance procedures of the laws of 
the state where the main office of the institution is located, provided 
that such procedures may be elected only to the extent not inconsistent 
with applicable Federal statutes, regulations, and safety and soundness, 
and such procedures are not of the type described in paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section. If this election is selected, a Federal mutual association 
shall designate in its bylaws the provision or provisions from the body 
of law selected for its corporate governance procedures, and shall file 
a copy of such bylaws, which are effective upon adoption, within 30 days 
after adoption. The submission shall indicate, where not obvious, why 
the bylaw provisions meet the requirements stated in paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section.
    (d) Effectiveness. Any bylaw amendment filed pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section shall automatically be effective 30 days from the 
date of filing of such amendment, provided that the association follows 
the requirements of its charter and bylaws in adopting such amendment. 
This automatic effective date does not apply if, prior to the expiration

Sec. 545.16  Public deposits, depositaries, and fiscal agents.

    (a) Definitions. As used in this section--
    (1) Moneys includes monies and has the meaning it has in applicable 
state law;
    (2) State law includes actions by a governmental body which has a 
charter adopted under the constitution of the state with provisions 
respecting deposits of public money of that body;
    (3) Surety means surety under real and/or personal suretyship, and 
includes guarantor; and
    (4) Terms in paragraph (b) of this section have the meanings they 
have under applicable state law.
    (b) Authority to act as surety for public deposits. (1) A Federal 
savings association that is a deposit association may give bond or 
security for deposit in it of public moneys or investment in it by a 
governmental unit if required to do so by state law, either as an 
alternative condition or otherwise, regardless of the amount required. 
Any bond or security may be given and any substitution or increase 
thereof may be made under this section at any time.
    (2) If state law requires as a condition of such deposit or 
investment that the Federal savings association or its bond or security, 
or any combination thereof, be surety for or with respect to other 
deposits or instruments, whether of that depositor or investor or of any 
other(s), and whether in the Federal savings association or in any other 
institution(s) having, when the investments or deposits were made, 
insurance by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the same shall 
become, or if the state law is self-executing shall be, such surety.
    (c) Depositaries and fiscal agents. Subject to regulation of the 
United States Treasury Department, a Federal savings association may 
serve as a depositary for Federal taxes, as a Treasury tax and loan 
depositary, or as a depositary of public money and fiscal agent of the 
Government or any other instrumentality thereof when designated for that 
purpose by such instrumentality and approved by the Office, and may 
satisfy any requirement in connection therewith, including maintaining 
accounts described in Secs. 561.33, 561.52, 561.53, and 561.54 of this 
chapter; pledging collateral; and performing the services outlined in 31

    (a) A service corporation may execute securities transactions on an 
agency or riskless principal basis solely upon the order of and for the 
account of customers, and may provide standardized and individualized 
investment advice to individuals or entities, provided that the service 
corporation:
    (1) Conducts securities brokerage and investment advisory activities 
in an area that is clearly identified and distinguished from the areas 
where the association's depository functions are performed;
    (2) Distinguishes advertising by the service corporation from that 
of the association, such that advertising does not confuse securities 
transactions executed, securities purchased, or investment advice 
provided by the service corporation with federally-insured deposits; 
that the advertising indicates that the service corporation and broker-
dealer, and not the association, is providing the securities brokerage 
or investment advisory services, identifies the broker-dealer in 
advertising, and does not use the logo of the parent association in the 
text of any advertisement prepared or distributed by the service 
corporation or the broker-dealer or in the text of any advertisement for 
specific securities products;
    (3) Where the service corporation contracts with a third-party 
broker-dealer, has a written contract with the broker-dealer that 
provides that the broker-dealer agrees to indemnify fully the service 
corporation and the association for any liability arising from the 
negligence, recklessness, or intentional conduct of the broker-dealer or 
its employees, and that sets forth operating, marketing, compensation, 
and other relevant terms;
    (4) Provides to the OTS an initial opinion of counsel or an opinion 
from the senior securities principal responsible for overseeing the 
subject brokerage program that the program has been established pursuant 
to operational procedures that are intended to ensure that the program 
is conducted in conformity with applicable securities laws and 
regulations and that such procedures include internal controls and 
supervisory systems that have been established and are to be applied to 
detect and prevent violations of federal securities statutes, the rules 
adopted thereunder, and the rules of self-regulatory organizations 
applicable to broker-dealers, including but not limited to those 
provisions designed to prevent churning, unsuitable recommendations, 
charging excessive prices, and the making of fraudulent representations 
in connection with the offer, sale, or purchase of securities (``the 
regulations''); and on an annual basis thereunder provides a 
certification by the senior securities principal responsible for 
supervising and overseeing the subject brokerage program that he or she 
has discharged the obligations incumbent upon him or her by reason of 
such procedures and systems previously described and has no reasonable 
belief or cause to believe that such procedures and systems have not 
been and are not being complied with or that a violation of the 
regulations has occurred;
    (5) Does not condition the provision of securities services to a 
customer on the customer's utilizing services of any affiliate of the 
association, the service corporation, or a broker-dealer.
    (b) Service corporation activities authorized under this paragraph 
(b) may not include the following activities:
    (1) Execution of securities transactions on a principal basis, 
including market-making and underwriting, except on a riskless principal 
basis, and except as permitted under Sec. 559.4 of this chapter;

[[Page 84]]

    (2) Payment to any employee of the association of a referral fee, 
bonus, or any incentive compensation, in cash or in kind, for referring 
any customer to the service corporation except as may be consistent with 
a ``no-action'' letter received by the association from the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC''), stating that the SEC will 
not recommend enforcement section if association employees receive the 
planned referral fee but do not register with a broker-dealer and the 
association does not register as a broker-dealer;
    (3) Solicitation of a person to execute a transaction in a specific 
security by any registered representative;
    (4) Indemnification by the service corporation to a degree greater 
than the indemnification provided to it by the third-party broker-
dealer; and the association is prohibited from indemnifying a third 
party broker-dealer;
    (5) Extension of margin credit by the association to customers of 
the service corporation or broker-dealer;
    (6) Non-registered representatives who are dual or sole employees of 
the association performing tasks other than clerical for ministerial 
tasks; prohibited activities include accepting or delivering money or 
securities and taking orders to execute securities transactions.
    (c) Any association that intends to acquire or establish a service 
corporation to engage in preapproved securities brokerage activities 
shall furnish to the OTS at least 30 days prior to the commencement of 
operations, written notice containing a full description of the 
brokerage services to be provided and a certification from the board of 
directors of such association that such services will be in compliance 
with all of the requirements of this section. In addition, the 
association shall retain complete records of all executed contractual 
agreements and memoranda between the service corporation and broker-
dealers, investment advisors, the parent savings association, and their 
affiliates, pro forma income statements for a three year period, any 
required professional opinions, and a reasoned legal opinion from 
counsel that the securities brokerage services qualify as preapproved 
under this section.
    (d) The Regional Director may request additional information at any 
time regarding the operations of the service corporation if there are 
supervisory concerns about the activity, has evidence that the activity 
may not be in the best interest of the association or service 
corporation, or has questions as to whether the activities are being 
conducted in a manner that is preapproved.

    (e) Approval of branch application. (1) The OTS shall approve an 
application only if the overall policies, condition, and operation of 
the applicant afford no basis for supervisory objection and the proposed 
branch will open within twelve months of approval unless otherwise 
allowed by the OTS. In considering whether to approve an application, 
the OTS will assess and take into account an association's record of 
helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- 
and moderate-income neighborhoods, pursuant to part 563e of this 
chapter; assessment of an association's record of performance may be the 
basis for denying an application.
    (2) An application shall be deemed to be approved 30 days after 
notification that the application is complete, unless the OTS suspends 
the applicable processing time frames under Sec. 516.190 of this 
chapter, or the OTS objects to the application on the grounds set forth 
under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (f) Approval of branch notice. A notice filed by a Federal savings

approved 30 days after its filing with the OTS, unless the OTS suspends 
the applicable processing time frames under Sec. 516.190 of this 
chapter; the OTS objects to the application on the grounds set forth in 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section; or the OTS determines to process the

OTS suspends the applicable processing time frames, the savings 
association may not open a branch until the OTS provides a notification 
of its approval.
    (g) Offices not requiring prior written approval. A Federal savings 
association may establish without prior approval a drive-in and/or 
pedestrian office opened in conjunction with an approved branch or home 
office of the association, located within 500 feet of a public entrance 
of that office and closer to that entrance than to a public entrance of 
any other SAIF-insured association, and the functions of which are 
limited to the ordinary functions performed at a teller-window.
    (h) Maintenance of branch office after conversion, consolidation, 
purchase of bulk assets, merger or purchase from receiver. (1) An 
existing association which converts to a Federal savings association may 
maintain an existing office, and a Federal savings association that 
acquires offices through consolidation, purchase of bulk assets, merger 
or purchase from the receiver of an association may maintain any 
acquired office, except to the extent the approval by the OTS of the 
conversion, consolidation, merger, or purchase specifies otherwise.
    (2) A Federal savings association may not file a branch application 
after having filed an application to merge or otherwise surrender its 
Federal charter, unless the merger or conversion application has been

be served by the new office, and the community where the office is to be 
closed or the home office is to be redesignated as a branch; and
    (ii) The applicant shall post notice of the application for 25 days 
from the date of first publication in a prominent location in the office 
to be closed or redesignated.
    (2) The OTS may approve an amendment to an association's charter in

under this section.
    (c) Short-distance relocations. (1) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of 
this section, an association may change the permanent location of a home 
or branch office, without applying for approval by the OTS, to a site 
within the market area and short-distance relocation area of the office 
site that has been approved in accordance with Sec. 545.92 of this part 
or paragraph (a) of this section. The short-distance relocation area of 
an office site is:
    (i) The area within a 1,000-foot radius of the site if it is located 
within a central city of a Metropolitan Statistical Area (``MSA'') 
designated by the U.S. Department of Commerce;
    (ii) The area within a one-mile radius of the site if it is located 
within an MSA designated by the U.S. Department of Commerce but not 
within a central city; or
    (iii) The area within a two-mile radius of the site if it is not 
located within a MSA.
    (2) An association shall notify the OTS in writing at least 30 days 
before such an office relocation and may proceed with the relocation 
unless, within 30 days of receipt of the notice, the OTS notifies the 
association that the relocation does not satisfy the criteria set forth 
in the first sentence of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, in which case 
the association must file an application and obtain approval by the OTS 
in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

    (a) General. A Federal savings association may, without approval of

establish or maintain agencies that only service and originate (but do 
not approve) loans and contracts or manage or sell real estate owned by 
the Federal savings association.

Sec. 545.101  Fiscal agency.

    A Federal savings association designated fiscal agent by the

reasonable duties and exercise only such powers and privileges as the 
Secretary of the Treasury or such instrumentality may prescribe.


<R05>
Sec. 545.103  Suretyship.

    Pursuant to the authority given to the Office under section 5(b)(2) 
of the Act, a Federal savings association is

[[Page 87]]

authorized to enter into an agreement to act as surety subject to the 
following provisions:
    (a) A savings association may enter into a suretyship agreement only 
if performance under the agreement would create an obligation authorized 
for investment by a savings association. A savings association's 
obligation under the suretyship agreement will be treated as a loan to 
its principal for purposes of the requirements of Secs. 563.93 and 
563.43 of this chapter.
    (b) A savings association must take and maintain a security interest 
in real estate or marketable securities of its principal having a market 
value of at least 110 percent of the savings association's suretyship 
obligation. If real estate, the value must be established by a signed 
appraisal consistent with the requirements of part 564 of this chapter. 
In determining compliance with the 110 percent requirement, the savings 
association must consider the value of prior mortgages, liens or other 
encumbrances on the property, except those held by the party for whose 
protection the suretyship agreement is made. If marketable securities, 
such securities must be of a type in which the savings association is 
authorized to invest, and the savings association must provide for 
maintenance of the security at the required level during the term of the 
suretyship agreement.
    (c) To the extent a savings association is required to meet its 
obligation under a suretyship agreement, the amount expended shall be 
treated as an extension of credit subject to percentage-of-assets limits 
in accordance with the obligation thereby created to the savings 
association.

<R05>
Sec. 545.121  Indemnification of directors, officers and employees.

    A Federal savings association shall indemnify its directors, 
officers, and employees in accordance with the following requirements:
    (a) Definitions and rules of construction. (1) Definitions for 
purposes of this section.
    (i) Action. The term ``action'' means any judicial or administrative 
proceeding, or threatened proceeding, whether civil, criminal, or 
otherwise, including any appeal or other proceeding for review;
    (ii) Court. The term ``court'' includes, without limitation, any 
court to which or in which any appeal or any proceeding for review is 
brought.
    (iii) Final judgment. The term ``final judgment'' means a judgment, 
decree, or order which is not appealable or as to which the period for 
appeal has expired with no appeal taken.
    (iv) Settlement. The term ``settlement'' includes entry of a 
judgment by consent or confession or a plea of guilty or nolo 
contendere.
    (2) References in this section to any individual or other person, 
including any association, shall include legal representatives, 
successors, and assigns thereof.
    (b) General. Subject to paragraphs (c) and (g) of this section, a 
savings association shall indemnify any person against whom an action is 
brought or threatened because that person is or was a director, officer, 
or employee of the association, for:
    (1) Any amount for which that person becomes liable under a judgment 
if such action; and
    (2) Reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney's 
fees, actually paid or incurred by that person in defending or settling 
such action, or in enforcing his or her rights under this section if he 
or she attains a favorable judgment in such enforcement action.
    (c) Requirements. Indemnification shall be made to such period under 
paragraph (b) of this section only if:
    (1) Final judgment on the merits is in his or her favor; or
    (2) In case of:
    (i) Settlement,
    (ii) Final judgment against him or her, or
    (iii) Final judgment in his or her favor, other than on the merits, 
if a majority of the disinterested directors of the savings association 
determine that he or she was acting in good faith within the scope of 
his or her employment or authority as he or she could reasonably have 
perceived it under the

[[Page 88]]

circumstances and for a purpose he or she could reasonably have believed 
under the circumstances was in the best interests of the savings 
association or its members.

However, no indemnification shall be made unless the association gives 
the Office at least 60 days' notice of its intention to make such 
indemnification. Such notice shall state the facts on which the action 
arose, the terms of any settlement, and any disposition of the action by 
a court. Such notice, a copy thereof, and a certified copy of the 
resolution containing the required determination by the board of 
directors shall be sent to the Regional Director, who shall promptly 
acknowledge receipt thereof. The notice period shall run from the date 
of such receipt. No such indemnification shall be made if the OTS 
advises the association in writing, within such notice period, of his or 
her objection thereto.
    (d) Insurance. A savings association may obtain insurance to protect 
it and its directors, officers, and employees from potential losses 
arising from claims against any of them for alleged wrongful acts, or 
wrongful acts, committed in their capacity as directors, officers, or 
employees. However, no savings association may obtain insurance which 
provides for payment of losses of any person incurred as a consequence 
of his or her willful or criminal misconduct.
    (e) Payment of expenses. If a majority of the directors of a savings 
association concludes that, in connection with an action, any person 
ultimately may become entitled to indemnification under this section, 
the directors may authorize payment of reasonable costs and expenses, 
including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising from the defense or 
settlement of such action. Nothing in this paragraph (e) shall prevent 
the directors of a savings association from imposing such conditions on 
a payment of expenses as they deem warranted and in the interests of the 
savings association. Before making advance payment of expenses under 
this paragraph (e), the savings association shall obtain an agreement 
that the savings association will be repaid if the person on whose 
behalf payment is made is later determined not to be entitled to such 
indemnification.
    (f) Exclusiveness of provisions. No savings association shall 
indemnify any person referred to in paragraph (b) of this section or 
obtain insurance referred to in paragraph (d) of the section other than 
in accordance with this section. However, an association which has a 
bylaw in effect relating to indemnification of its personnel shall be 
governed solely by that bylaw, except that its authority to obtain 
insurance shall be governed by paragraph (d) of this section.
    (g) The indemnification provided for in paragraph (b) of this 
section is subject to and qualified by 12 U.S.C. 1821(k).

Sec. 545.138  Data-processing services.

    (a) Authorization. A Federal savings association may engage in any 
permissible activity or service by using data processing equipment or 
technology, and may provide data processing and data transmission 
services to others on a for-profit basis as permitted by this section. 
An association may establish and maintain an office to provide such 
services to others without observing the application and approval 
procedures for branch offices set forth in this part.
    (b)(1) Permissible data. The data to be processed or transmitted by 
a Federal savings association pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section 
must be financial, economic, or related to thrift, home financing, or 
the activities of depository institutions.
    (2) Customer restrictions. A Federal savings association must 
provide data processing and transmission services primarily for itself, 
other depository institutions (including the parent or a subsidiary of 
either), and persons with whom the Federal savings association has 
established a loan or deposit relationship. A Federal savings 
association may also provide such services to other

[[Page 89]]

persons if the services constitute less than one half of the data 
processing services provided under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section.
    (3) Facilities. In conjunction with providing services pursuant to 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a Federal savings association 
may supply data processing software, documentation, and operating 
personnel. Any such facilities, as well as those used by the Federal 
savings association, must be designed and operated for the processing or 
transmission of permissible data.
    (c) By-products and excess capacity. As an incident to providing 
data processing and data transmission services pursuant to paragraph (b) 
of this section, a Federal savings association may:
    (1) Market by-products of such services (including software and 
compilations of data) to any person, only if the by-products are not 
designed, created, or substantially enhanced primarily for the purpose 
of such marketability, and
    (2) Market excess capacity of its data processing facilities, 
provided that the involvement of the Federal savings association is 
limited to furnishing access to its facilities and providing the 
necessary operating personnel, and that the Federal savings association 
has not artificially created excess capacity by acquiring equipment or 
facilities whose capacity is substantially greater than that necessary 
to accommodate its present or expected future needs for providing 
permissible data processing services.
    (d) Controls. A Federal savings association providing data 
processing services or marketing excess capacity to any person under 
this section shall establish internal and system controls for both 
hardware and software such that the integrity of its records and those 
of its depositors and customers are adequately protected. At a minimum, 
the controls shall be consistent with Generally Accepted Auditing 
Standards. Any agreement pursuant to which the Federal savings 
association provides data processing services shall contain a provision 
that generally describes the security measures so taken.
    (e) Contract and tying restrictions. Any contract for data 
processing services authorized by this section shall incorporate the 
relevant limitations specified herein and state that the Federal savings 
association's facilities are to be used only for the processing and 
transmission of permissible data. A Federal savings association 
providing such services under this section shall comply with the anti-
tying provisions of section 5(q) of the Act.
    (f) Participation. A Federal savings association may participate 
with others in establishing or maintaining a data processing office: 
Provided, That the Federal savings association may participate in 
establishing or maintaining a data processing office controlled by an 
entity not subject to examination by a Federal agency regulating 
financial institutions only if such entity has agreed in writing with 
the Office that it will permit and pay for such examination of the 
office as the Office deems necessary, and that it will make available 
for such purposes any records in its possession relating to the 
operation of the Office.

Sec. 545.141  Remote Service Units (RSUs).

    (a) Definitions. As used in this section--
    (1) Generic data means statistical information which does not 
identify any individual accountholder.
    (2) Personal security identifier (PSI) means any word, number, or 
other security identifier essential for an accountholder to gain access 
to an account.
    (3) Remote service unit (RSU) means an information processing 
device, including associated equipment, structures and systems, by which 
information relating to financial services rendered to the public is 
stored and transmitted, instantaneously or otherwise, to a financial 
institution. Any such device not on the premises of a Federal savings 
association that, for activation and account access, requires use of a 
machine-readable instrument and PSI in the possession and control of an 
accountholder, is an RSU. The term includes, without limitation, point-
of-sale terminals, merchant-operated terminals, cash-dispensing 
machines, and automated teller machines. It excludes automated teller 
machines on the

[[Page 90]]

premises of a Federal savings association, unless shared with other 
financial institutions. An RSU is not a branch, satellite, or other type 
of facility or agency of a Federal savings association under Sec. 545.92 
et seq. of this part.
    (4) RSU account means a savings or loan account or demand account 
that may be accessed through use of an RSU.
    (b) General. Subject to the requirements of the Electronic Funds 
Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693 et seq.) and Regulation E of the Federal 
Reserve Board (12 CFR 205.2), a Federal savings association may 
establish or use RSUs and participate with others in RSU operations, on 
an unrestricted geographic basis. No RSU may be used to open a savings 
account, a demand account or establish a loan account.
    (c) RSU access techniques. A Federal savings association shall 
provide a PSI to each accountholder and require its use when accessing 
an RSU; it may not employ RSU access techniques that require the 
accountholder to disclose a PSI to another person. The savings 
association must inform each accountholder that the PSI is for security 
purposes and shall not be disclosed to third parties. Any device used to 
activitate an RSU shall bear the words ``Not transferable'' or their 
equivalent. A passbook may not be such a device.
    (d)  [Reserved]
    (e) Security. A Federal savings association shall protect electronic 
data against fraudulent alterations or disclosure. All RSUs shall meet 
the minimum security devices requirements of part 568 of this chapter.
    (f) Office supervision. A Federal savings association may share an 
RSU controlled by a financial institution or another party not subject 
to examination by a Federal regulatory agency only if such financial 
institution or other party has agreed in writing that the RSU is subject 
to such examination by the Office as it deems necessary.

Sec. 545.142  Home banking services.

    A Federal savings association may utilize any electronic technology

initiated by a customer by means of an electronic home terminal, such as 
a telephone, a home computer terminal, or a television set that is 
linked to a Federal savings association's computer by telephone or cable 
television lines. A Federal savings association providing services 
authorized by this section shall adopt security measures adequate to 
prevent unauthorized access to its records or those of its customers or 
the use of a home terminal to defraud the Federal savings association or 
any of its customers.

Sec. 546.2  Procedure; effective date.

    (a) A Federal mutual savings association may combine with any 
depository institution, provided that:
    (1) The combination is in compliance with, and receives all 
approvals required under, any applicable statutes and regulations;
    (2) Any resulting Federal savings association meets the requirements 
for

[[Page 91]]

Federal Home Loan Bank membership and insurance of accounts;
    (3) In the case of a combination with a bank that is a member of the 
Bank Insurance Fund, any resulting Federal savings association conforms 
to the requirements of sections 5(c) and 10(m) of the Home Owners' Loan 
Act under the standards set forth in section 5(c)(5) of the Home Owners' 
Loan Act, and in the case of a combination with any other depository 
institution, any resulting Federal savings association conforms within 
the time prescribed by the OTS, to the requirements of section 5(c) of 
the Home Owners' Loan Act; and
    (4) The resulting institution shall be a mutually held savings 
association, unless:
    (i) The transaction involves a supervisory merger;
    (ii) The transaction is approved under part 563b of this chapter; or
    (iii) The transaction involves a transfer in the context of a mutual 
holding company reorganization under section 10(o) of the Home Owners' 
Loan Act.
    (b) Each Federal mutual savings association, by a two-thirds vote of 
its board of directors, shall approve a plan of combination evidenced by 
a combination agreement. The agreement shall state:
    (1) That the combination shall not be effective unless and until the 
combination receives any necessary approval from the Office pursuant to 
Sec. 563.22 (a) or (c), or in the case of a transaction requiring a 
notice pursuant to Sec. 563.22(c), the notice has been filed, and the 
appropriate period of time has passed or the OTS has advised the parties 
that it will not disapprove the transaction;
    (2) Which constituent institution is to be the resulting 
institution;
    (3) The name of the resulting institution;
    (4) The location of the home office and any other offices of the 
resulting institution;
    (5) The terms and conditions of the combination and the method of

directors;
    (9) The effect upon and assumption of any liquidation account of a 
disappearing institution by the resulting institution; and
    (10) Such other provisions, agreements, or understandings as relate 
to the combination.
    (c) Prior written notification to, notice to, or prior written 
approval of, the Office pursuant to Sec. 563.22 of this chapter is 
required for every combination. In the case of applications and notices 
pursuant to 563.22 (a) or (c), the Office shall apply the criteria set 
out in Sec. 563.22 of this chapter and shall impose any conditions it 
deems necessary or appropriate to ensure compliance with those criteria 
and the requirements of this chapter.
    (d) Where the resulting institution is a Federal mutual savings 
association, the Office may approve a temporary increase in the number 
of directors of the resulting institution provided that the association 
submits a plan for bringing the board of directors into compliance with 
the requirements of Sec. 544.1 of this chapter within a reasonable 
period of time.
    (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the Office may 
require that a plan of combination be submitted to the voting members of 
any of the mutual savings associations that are constituent institutions 
at a duly called meeting(s), and that the plan, to be effective, be 
approved by such voting members.
    (f) A conservator or receiver for a Federal mutual savings 
association may combine the association with another insured depository 
institution without submitting the plan to the association's board of 
directors or members for their approval.
    (g) If a plan of combination provides for a resulting Federal mutual 
savings association's name or location to be changed, its charter shall 
be amended accordingly. If the resulting institution is a Federal mutual 
savings association, the effective date of the combination shall be the 
date specified in

[[Page 92]]

the approval; if the resulting institution is not a Federal savings 
association, the effective date shall be that prescribed under 
applicable law. Approval of a merger automatically cancels the Federal 
charter of a Federal association that is a disappearing institution as 
of the effective date of merger, and the association shall, on that 
date, surrender its charter to the Office.

<R05>
Sec. 546.3  Transfer of assets upon merger or consolidation.

    On the effective date of a merger or consolidation in which the 
resulting institution is a Federal association, all assets and property 
of the disappearing institutions shall immediately, without any further 
act, become the property of the resulting institution to the same extent 
as they were the property of the disappearing institutions, and the 
resulting institution shall be a continuation of the entity which 
absorbed the disappearing institutions. All rights and obligations of 
the disappearing institutions shall remain unimpaired, and the resulting 
institution shall, on the effective date of the merger or consolidation, 
succeed to all those rights and obligations, subject to the Home Owners' 
Loan Act and other applicable statutes.
[59 FR 44623, Aug. 30, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 546.4  Voluntary dissolution.

    A Federal savings association's board of directors may propose a 
plan for dissolution of the association. The plan may provide for 
either:
    (a) Appointment of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the 
Resolution Trust Corporation (under section 5 of the Act and section 11 
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended or section 21A of the 
Federal Home Loan Bank Act, as amended) as receiver for the purpose of 
liquidation;
    (b) Transfer of all the association's assets to another association 
and home-financing institution under Federal or State charter either for 
cash sufficient to pay all obligations of the association and retire all 
outstanding accounts or in exchange for that association's payment of 
all the association's outstanding obligations and issuance of share 
accounts or other evidence of interest to the association's members on a 
pro rata basis; or
    (c) Dissolution in a manner proposed by the directors which they 
consider best for all concerned.

The plan, and a statement of reasons for proposing dissolution and for 
proposing the plan, shall be submitted to the OTS for approval. The OTS 
will approve the plan if the OTS believes dissolution is advisable and 
the plan best for all concerned, but if the OTS considers the plan 
inadvisable, the OTS may either make recommendations to the association 
concerning the plan or disapprove it. When the plan is approved by the 
association's board of directors and by the OTS, it shall be submitted 
to the association's members at a duly called meeting and, when approved 
by a majority of votes cast at that meeting, shall become effective. 
After dissolution in accordance with the plan, a certificate evidencing 
dissolution, supported by such evidence as the OTS may require, shall 
immediately be filed with the OTS. When the OTS receives such evidence 
satisfactory to the OTS, it will terminate the corporate existence of 
the dissolved association and the association's charter shall thereby be 
canceled. A Federal savings association is not required to obtain 
approval under this section where the Federal savings association 
transfers all of its assets and liabilities to a bank in a transaction 
that is subject to Sec. 563.22(b) of this chapter.

    Fiduciary powers are the authority that the OTS permits you to

grants to competing fiduciaries in that State.

    (a) Your officers and officers of an affiliate who participate 
significantly in administering your fiduciary activities may not serve 
on the audit committee.
    (b) A majority of the members of the audit committee may not serve 
on any committee to which the board of directors has delegated power to 
manage and control your fiduciary activities.

[[Page 100]]

the audit) in the minutes of the board of directors.
    (b) Continuous audit. If you adopt a continuous audit system, you 
must note the results of all discrete audits conducted since the last 
audit report (including significant actions taken as a result of the 
audits) in the minutes of the board of directors at least once during

pursue any or all of the lawful objectives of a Federal savings 
association chartered under section 5 of the Home Owners' Loan Act and 
to exercise all of the express, implied, and incidental powers conferred 
thereby and by all acts amendatory thereof and supplemental thereto, 
subject to the Constitution and laws of the United States as they are 
now in effect, or as they may hereafter be amended, and subject to all 
lawful and applicable rules, regulations, and orders of the Office of 
Thrift Supervision (``Office'').
    Section 5. Capital stock. The total number of shares of all classes

provided in this Section 5 or to the extent that such approval is 
required by governing law, rule, or regulation. The consideration for 
the issuance of the shares shall be paid in full before their issuance 
and shall not be less than the par [or stated] value. Neither promissory

[[Page 105]]

labor, or services actually performed for the association, or any 
combination of the foregoing. In the absence of actual fraud in the 
transaction, the value of such property, labor, or services, as 
determined by the board of directors of the association, shall be

the mutual to stock form of capitalization, no shares of capital stock 
(including shares issuable upon conversion, exchange, or exercise of 
other securities) shall be issued, directly or indirectly, to officers, 
directors, or controlling persons of the association other than as part 
of a general public offering or as qualifying shares to a director, 
unless the issuance or the plan under which they would be issued has 
been approved by a majority of the total votes eligible to be cast at a 
legal meeting.
    The holders of the common stock shall exclusively possess all voting 
power. Each holder of shares of common stock shall be entitled to one 
vote for each share held by such holder, except as to the cumulation of 
votes for the election of directors, unless the charter provides that 
there shall be no such cumulative voting. Subject to any provision for a 
liquidation account, in the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or 
winding up of the association, the holders of the common stock shall be 
entitled, after payment or provision for payment of all debts and 
liabilities of the association, to receive the remaining assets of the 
association available for distribution, in cash or in kind. Each share 
of common stock shall have the same relative rights as and be identical 
in all respects with all the other shares of common stock.
    Section 6. Preemptive rights. Holders of the capital stock of the 
association shall not be entitled to preemptive rights with respect to 
any shares of the association which may be issued.

    (1) Board of directors approval. The board of directors of the 
association must adopt a resolution proposing the charter amendment that 
states the text of such amendment.
    (2) Form of filing--(i) Application requirement. If the proposed 
charter amendment would render more difficult or discourage a merger, 
tender offer, or proxy contest, the assumption of control by a holder of 
a block of the association's stock, the removal of incumbent management, 
or involve a significant issue of law or policy, the association shall 
file the proposed amendment and shall obtain the prior approval of the 
OTS; and
    (ii) Notice requirement. If the proposed charter amendment does not 
involve a provision that would be covered by paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this 
section and such amendment is permissible under all applicable laws, 
rules or regulations, then the association shall submit the proposed 
amendments to the OTS, at least 30 days prior to the date the proposed 
charter amendment is to be mailed for consideration by the association's 
shareholders.
    (b) Approval. Any charter amendment filed pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii) of this section shall automatically be approved 30 days from 
the date of filing of

[[Page 106]]

such amendment, provided that the association follows the requirements 
of its charter in adopting such amendment, unless prior to the 
expiration of such 30-day period the OTS notifies the association that 
such amendment is rejected or that such amendment is deemed to be filed 
under the provisions of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. In 
addition, the following charter amendments, including the adoption of 
the Federal stock charter as set forth in Sec. 552.3 of this part, shall 
be approved at the time of adoption, if adopted without change and filed 
with OTS within 30 days after adoption, provided the association follows 
the requirements of its charter in adopting such amendments:
    (1) Title change. A Federal stock association that has complied with 
Sec. 543.1(b) of this chapter may amend its charter by substituting a 
new corporate title in section 1.
    (2) Home office. A Federal stock association that has complied with 
Sec. 545.95 of this chapter may amend its charter by substituting a new 
home office in section 2.
    (3) Number of shares of stock and par value. A Federal stock 
association may amend Section 5 of its charter to change the number of 
authorized shares of stock, the number of shares within each class of 
stock, and the par or stated value of such shares.
    (4) Capital stock. A Federal stock association may amend its charter 
by revising Section 5 to read as follows:

    Section 5. Capital stock. The total number of shares of all classes 
of capital stock that the association has the authority to issue is 
______, of which ______ shall be common stock of par [or if no par value 
is specified the stated] value of ______ per share and of which [list 
the number of each class of preferred and the par or if no par value is 
specified the stated value per share of each such class]. The shares may 
be issued from time to time as authorized by the board of directors 
without further approval of shareholders, except as otherwise provided 
in this Section 5 or to the extent that such approval is required by 
governing law, rule, or regulation. The consideration for the issuance 
of the shares shall be paid in full before their issuance and shall not 
be less than the par [or stated] value. Neither promissory notes nor 
future services shall constitute payment or part payment for the 
issuance of shares of the association. The consideration for the shares 
shall be cash, tangible or intangible property (to the extent direct 
investment in such property would be permitted), labor, or services 
actually performed for the association, or any combination of the 
foregoing. In the absence of actual fraud in the transaction, the value 
of such property, labor, or services, as determined by the board of 
directors of the association, shall be conclusive. Upon payment of such 
consideration, such shares shall be deemed to be fully paid and 
nonassessable. In the case of a stock dividend, that part of the 
retained earnings of the association that is transferred to common stock 
or paid-in capital accounts upon the issuance of shares as a stock 
dividend shall be deemed to be the consideration for their issuance.
    Except for shares issued in the initial organization of the 
association or in connection with the conversion of the association from 
the mutual to the stock form of capitalization, no shares of capital 
stock (including shares issuable upon conversion, exchange, or exercise 
of other securities) shall be issued, directly or indirectly, to 
officers, directors, or controlling persons of the association other 
than as part of a general public offering or as qualifying shares to a 
director, unless their issuance or the plan under which they would be 
issued has been approved by a majority of the total votes eligible to be 
cast at a legal meeting.
    Nothing contained in this Section 5 (or in any supplementary 
sections hereto) shall entitle the holders of any class of a series of 
capital stock to vote as a separate class or series or to more than one 
vote per share, except as to the cumulation of votes for the election of 
directors, unless the charter otherwise provides that there shall be no 
such cumulative voting: Provided, That this restriction on voting 
separately by class or series shall not apply:
    (i) To any provision which would authorize the holders of preferred 
stock, voting as a class or series, to elect some members of the board 
of directors, less than a majority thereof, in the event of default in 
the payment of dividends on any class or series of preferred stock;
    (ii) To any provision that would require the holders of preferred 
stock, voting as a class or series, to approve the merger or 
consolidation of the association with another corporation or the sale, 
lease, or conveyance (other than by mortgage or pledge) of properties or 
business in exchange for securities of a corporation other than the 
association if the preferred stock is exchanged for securities of such 
other corporation: Provided, That no provision may require such approval 
for transactions undertaken with the assistance or pursuant to the 
direction of the Office or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation;
    (iii) To any amendment which would adversely change the specific 
terms of any

[[Page 107]]

class or series of capital stock as set forth in this Section 5 (or in 
any supplementary sections hereto), including any amendment which would 
create or enlarge any class or series ranking prior thereto in rights 
and preferences. An amendment which increases the number of authorized 
shares of any class or series of capital stock, or substitutes the 
surviving association in a merger or consolidation for the association, 
shall not be considered to be such an adverse change.
    A description of the different classes and series (if any) of the 
association's capital stock and a statement of the designations, and the 
relative rights, preferences, and limitations of the shares of each 
class of and series (if any) of capital stock are as follows:
    A. Common stock. Except as provided in this Section 5 (or in any 
supplementary sections thereto) the holders of the common stock shall 
exclusively possess all voting power. Each holder of shares of the 
common stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share held by each 
holder, except as to the cumulation of votes for the election of 
directors, unless the charter otherwise provides that there shall be no 
such cumulative voting.
    Whenever there shall have been paid, or declared and set aside for 
payment, to the holders of the outstanding shares of any class of stock 
having preference over the common stock as to the payment of dividends, 
the full amount of dividends and of sinking fund, retirement fund, or 
other retirement payments, if any, to which such holders are 
respectively entitled in preference to the common stock, then dividends 
may be paid on the common stock and on any class or series of stock 
entitled to participate therewith as to dividends out of any assets 
legally available for the payment of dividends.
    In the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the 
association, the holders of the common stock (and the holders of any 
class or series of stock entitled to participate with the common stock 
in the distribution of assets) shall be entitled to receive, in cash or 
in kind, the assets of the association available for distribution 
remaining after: (i) Payment or provision for payment of the 
association's debts and liabilities; (ii) distributions or provision for 
distributions in settlement of its liquidation account; and (iii) 
distributions or provision for distributions to holders of any class or 
series of stock having preference over the common stock in the 
liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the association. Each share 
of common stock shall have the same relative rights as and be identical 
in all respects with all the other shares of common stock.
    B. Preferred stock. The association may provide in supplementary 
sections to its charter for one or more classes of preferred stock, 
which shall be separately identified. The shares of any class may be 
divided into and issued in series, with each series separately 
designated so as to distinguish the shares thereof from the shares of 
all other series and classes. The terms of each series shall be set 
forth in a supplementary section to the charter. All shares of the same 
class shall be identical except as to the following relative rights and 
preferences, as to which there may be variations between different 
series:
    (a) The distinctive serial designation and the number of shares 
constituting such series;
    (b) The dividend rate or the amount of dividends to be paid on the 
shares of such series, whether dividends shall be cumulative and, if so, 
from which date(s), the payment date(s) for dividends, and the 
participating or other special rights, if any, with respect to 
dividends;
    (c) The voting powers, full or limited, if any, of shares of such 
series;
    (d) Whether the shares of such series shall be redeemable and, if 
so, the price(s) at which, and the terms and conditions on which, such 
shares may be redeemed;
    (e) The amount(s) payable upon the shares of such series in the 
event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding 
up of the association;
    (f) Whether the shares of such series shall be entitled to the 
benefit of a sinking or retirement fund to be applied to the purchase or 
redemption of such shares, and if so entitled, the amount of such fund 
and the manner of its application, including the price(s) at which such 
shares may be redeemed or purchased through the application of such 
fund;
    (g) Whether the shares of such series shall be convertible into, or 
exchangeable for, shares of any other class or classes of stock of the 
association and, if so, the conversion price(s) or the rate(s) of 
exchange, and the adjustments thereof, if any, at which such conversion 
or exchange may be made, and any other terms and conditions of such 
conversion or exchange.
    (h) The price or other consideration for which the shares of such 
series shall be issued; and
    (i) Whether the shares of such series which are redeemed or 
converted shall have the status of authorized but unissued shares of 
serial preferred stock and whether such shares may be reissued as shares 
of the same or any other series of serial preferred stock.
    Each share of each series of serial preferred stock shall have the 
same relative rights as and be identical in all respects with all the 
other shares of the same series.
    The board of directors shall have authority to divide, by the 
adoption of supplementary charter sections, any authorized class of 
preferred stock into series, and, within the limitations set forth in 
this section and the remainder of this charter, fix and determine

[[Page 108]]

the relative rights and preferences of the shares of any series so 
established.
    Prior to the issuance of any preferred shares of a series 
established by a supplementary charter section adopted by the board of 
directors, the association shall file with the Secretary to the Office a 
dated copy of that supplementary section of this charter established and 
designating the series and fixing and determining the relative rights 
and preferences thereof.

    (5) Limitations on subsequent issuances. A Federal stock association 
may amend its charter to require shareholder approval of the issuance or 
reservation of common stock or securities convertible into common stock 
under circumstances which would require shareholder approval under the 
rules of the New York or American Stock Exchange if the shares were then 
listed on the New York or American Stock Exchange.
    (6) Cumulative voting. A Federal stock association may amend its 
charter by substituting the following sentence for the second sentence 
in the third paragraph of Section 5: ``Each holder of shares of common 
stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share held by such holder 
and there shall be no right to cumulate votes in an election of 
directors.''
    (7) [Reserved]
    (8) Anti-takeover provisions following mutual to stock conversion. 
Notwithstanding the law of the state in which the association is 
located, a Federal stock association may amend its charter by 
renumbering existing sections as appropriate and adding a new section 8 
as follows:

    Section 8. Certain Provisions Applicable for Five Years. 
Notwithstanding anything contained in the Association's charter or 
bylaws to the contrary, for a period of [specify number of years up to 
five] years from the date of completion of the conversion of the 
Association from mutual to stock form, the following provisions shall 
apply:
    A. Beneficial Ownership Limitation. No person shall directly or 
indirectly offer to acquire or acquire the beneficial ownership of more 
than 10 percent of any class of an equity security of the association. 
This limitation shall not apply to a transaction in which the 
association forms a holding company without change in the respective 
beneficial ownership interests of its stockholders other than pursuant 
to the exercise of any dissenter and appraisal rights, the purchase of 
shares by underwriters in connection with a public offering, or the 
purchase of shares by a tax-qualified employee stock benefit plan which 
is exempt from the approval requirements under Sec. 574.3(c)(1)(vi) of 
the Office's regulations.
    In the event shares are acquired in violation of this section 8, all 
shares beneficially owned by any person in excess of 10% shall be 
considered ``excess shares'' and shall not be counted as shares entitled 
to vote and shall not be voted by any person or counted as voting shares 
in connection with any matters submitted to the stockholders for a vote.
    For purposes of this section 8, the following definitions apply:
    (1) The term ``person'' includes an individual, a group acting in 
concert, a corporation, a partnership, an association, a joint stock 
company, a trust, an unincorporated organization or similar company, a 
syndicate or any other group formed for the purpose of acquiring, 
holding or disposing of the equity securities of the association.
    (2) The term ``offer'' includes every offer to buy or otherwise 
acquire, solicitation of an offer to sell, tender offer for, or request 
or invitation for tenders of, a security or interest in a security for 
value.
    (3) The term ``acquire'' includes every type of acquisition, whether 
effected by purchase, exchange, operation of law or otherwise.
    (4) The term ``acting in concert'' means (a) knowing participation 
in a joint activity or conscious parallel action towards a common goal 
whether or not pursuant to an express agreement, or (b) a combination or 
pooling of voting or other interests in the securities of an issuer for 
a common purpose pursuant to any contract, understanding, relationship, 
agreement or other arrangements, whether written or otherwise.
    B. Cumulative Voting Limitation. Stockholders shall not be permitted 
to cumulate their votes for election of directors.
    C. Call for Special Meetings. Special meetings of stockholders 
relating to changes in control of the association or amendments to its 
charter shall be called only upon direction of the board of directors.

    (c) Anti-takeover provisions. The Office may grant approval to a 
charter amendment not listed in paragraph (b) of this section regarding 
the acquisition by any person or persons of its equity securities 
provided that the association shall file as part of its application for 
approval an opinion, acceptable to the OTS, of counsel independent from 
the association that the proposed charter provision would be permitted 
to be adopted by a corporation chartered by the state in which the

[[Page 109]]

principal office of the association is located. Any such provision must 
be consistent with applicable statutes, regulations, and OTS policies. 
Further, any such provision that would have the effect of rendering more 
difficult a change in control of the association and would require for 
any corporate action (other than the removal of directors) the 
affirmative vote of a larger percentage of shareholders than is required 
by this Part, shall not be effective unless adopted by a percentage of 
shareholder vote at least equal to the highest percentage that would be 
required to take any action under such provision.
    (d) Reissuance of charter. A Federal stock association that has 
amended its charter may apply to have its charter, including the 
amendments, reissued by the Office. Such requests for reissuance should 
be filed in accordance with Sec. 516.1(c) of this chapter and contain 
signatures required under Sec. 552.3 of this part, together with such 
supporting documents as needed to demonstrate that the amendments were 
properly adopted.

<R05>
Sec. 552.5  Bylaws.

    (a) General. At its first organizational meeting, the board of 
directors of a Federal stock association shall adopt a set of bylaws for 
the administration and regulation of its affairs. Bylaws may be adopted, 
amended or repealed by either a majority of the votes cast by the 
shareholders at a legal meeting or a majority of the board of directors. 
The bylaws shall contain sufficient provisions to govern the association 
in accordance with the requirements of Secs. 552.6, 552.6-1, 552.6-2, 
and 552.6-3 of this part and shall not contain any provision that is 
inconsistent with those sections or with applicable laws, rules, 
regulations or the association's charter, except that a bylaw provision 
inconsistent with Secs. 552.6, 552.6-1, 552.6-3, and 552.6-4 of this 
part may be adopted with the approval of the OTS.
    (b) Form of Filing--(1) Application requirement. (i) Any bylaw 
amendment shall be submitted to the OTS for approval if it would:
    (A) Render more difficult or discourage a merger, tender offer, or 
proxy contest, the assumption of control by a holder of a large block of 
the association's stock, or the removal of incumbent management; or
    (B) Be inconsistent with Secs. 552.6, 552.6-1, 552.6-2, and 552.6-3 
of this part, with applicable laws, rules, regulations or the 
association's charter or involve a significant issue of law or policy, 
including indemnification, conflicts of interest, and limitations on 
director or officer liability.
    (ii) Applications submitted under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section shall be subject to the applications processing procedures set 
forth at Sec. 516.2 of this chapter.
    (iii) Bylaw provisions that adopt the language of the model bylaws 
set forth in the OTS's Application Processing Handbook, if adopted 
without change, and filed with OTS within 30 days after adoption, are 
effective upon adoption.

    (2) Filing requirement. If the proposed bylaw amendment does not 
involve a provision that would be covered by paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(3) 
of this section and is permissible under all applicable laws, rules, or 
regulations, then the association shall submit the amendment to the OTS 
at least 30 days prior to the date the bylaw amendment is to be adopted 
by the association.
    (3) Corporate governance procedures. A Federal stock association may 
elect to follow the corporate governance procedures of: The laws of the 
state where the main office of the association is located; the laws of 
the state where the association's holding company, if any, is 
incorporated or chartered; Delaware General Corporation law; or The 
Model Business Corporation Act, provided that such procedures may be 
elected to the extent not inconsistent with applicable Federal statutes 
and regulations and safety and soundness, and such procedures are not of 
the type described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If this election 
is selected, a Federal stock association shall designate in its bylaws 
the provision or provisions from the body or bodies of law selected for 
its corporate governance procedures, and shall file a copy of such

[[Page 110]]

bylaws, which are effective upon adoption, within 30 days after 
adoption. The submission shall indicate, where not obvious, why the 
bylaw provisions meet the requirements stated in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section.
    (c) Effectiveness. Any bylaw amendment filed pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section shall automatically be effective 30 days from the 
date of filing of such amendment, provided that the association follows 
the requirements of its charter and bylaws in adopting such amendment, 
unless prior to the expiration of such 30-day period the OTS notifies 
the association that such amendment is rejected or that such amendment 
requires an application to be filed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section.
    (d) Effect of subsequent charter or bylaw change. Notwithstanding 
any subsequent change to its charter or bylaws, the authority of a 
Federal stock association to engage in any transaction shall be 
determined only by the association's charter or bylaws then in effect, 
unless otherwise provided by Federal law or regulation.
[57 FR 14343, Apr. 20, 1992, as amended at 60 FR 66718, Dec. 26, 1995; 
61 FR 64019, Dec. 3, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 552.6  Shareholders.

    (a) Shareholder meetings. An annual meeting of the shareholders of 
the association for the election of directors and for the transaction of 
any other business of the association shall be held annually within 150 
days after the end of the association's fiscal year. Unless otherwise 
provided in the association's charter, special meetings of the 
shareholders may be called by the board of directors or on the request 
of the holders of 10 percent or more of the shares entitled to vote at 
the meeting, or by such other persons as may be specified in the bylaws 
of the association. All annual and special meetings of shareholders 
shall be held at such place as the board of directors may determine in 
the state in which the association has its principal place of business, 
or at any other convenient place the board of directors may designate.
    (b) Notice of shareholder meetings. Written notice stating the 
place, day, and hour of the meeting and the purpose or purposes for 
which the meeting is called shall be delivered not fewer than 20 nor 
more than 50 days before the date of the meeting, either personally or 
by mail, by or at the direction of the chairman of the board, the 
president, the secretary, or the directors, or other persons calling the 
meeting, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. 
If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in 
the mail, addressed to the shareholder at the address appearing on the 
stock transfer books or records of the association as of the record date 
prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, with postage thereon 
prepaid. When any shareholders' meeting, either annual or special, is 
adjourned for 30 days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be 
given as in the case of an original meeting. Notwithstanding anything in 
this section, however, a Federal stock association that is wholly owned 
shall not be subject to the shareholder notice requirement.
    (c) Fixing of record date. For the purpose of determining 
shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of 
shareholders or any adjournment thereof, or shareholders entitled to 
receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of 
shareholders for any other proper purpose, the board of directors shall 
fix in advance a date as the record date for any such determination of 
shareholders. Such date in any case shall be not more than 60 days and, 
in case of a meeting of shareholders, not less than 10 days prior to the 
date on which the particular action, requiring such determination of 
shareholders, is to be taken. When a determination of shareholders 
entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders has been made as 
provided in this section, such determination shall apply to any 
adjournment thereof.
    (d) Voting lists. (1) At least 20 days before each meeting of the 
shareholders, the officer or agent having charge of the stock transfer 
books for the shares of the association shall make a complete list of 
the stockholders of record entitled to vote at such meeting, or any 
adjournments thereof, arranged in alphabetical order, with the address

[[Page 111]]

and the number of shares held by each. This list of shareholders shall 
be kept on file at the home office of the association and shall be 
subject to inspection by any shareholder of record or the stockholder's 
agent during the entire time of the meeting. The original stock transfer 
book shall constitute prima facie evidence of the stockholders entitled 
to examine such list or transfer books or to vote at any meeting of 
stockholders. Notwithstanding anything in this section, however, a 
Federal stock association that is wholly owned shall not be subject to 
the voting list requirements.
    (2) In lieu of making the shareholders list available for inspection 
by any shareholders as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the 
board of directors may perform such acts as required by paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of Rule 14a-7 of the General Rules and Regulations under the 
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (17 CFR 240.14a-7) as may be duly 
requested in writing, with respect to any matter which may be properly 
considered at a meeting of shareholders, by any shareholder who is 
entitled to vote on such matter and who shall defray the reasonable 
expenses to be incurred by the association in performance of the act or 
acts required.
    (e) Shareholder quorum. A majority of the outstanding shares of the 
association entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall 
constitute a quorum at a meeting of shareholders. The shareholders 
present at a duly organized meeting may continue to transact business 
until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders 
to leave less than a quorum. If a quorum is present, the affirmative 
vote of the majority of the shares represented at the meeting and 
entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the 
stockholders, unless the vote of a greater number of stockholders voting 
together or voting by classes is required by law or the charter. 
Directors, however, are elected by a plurality of the votes cast at an 
election of directors.
    (f) Shareholder voting--(1) Proxies. Unless otherwise provided in 
the association's charter, at all meetings of shareholders, a 
shareholder may vote in person or by proxy executed in writing by the 
shareholder or by a duly authorized attorney in fact. Proxies may be 
given telephonically or electronically as long as the holder uses a 
procedure for verifying the identity of the shareholder. A proxy may 
designate as holder a corporation, partnership or company as defined in 
Part 574 of this chapter, or other person. Proxies solicited on behalf 
of the management shall be voted as directed by the shareholder or, in 
the absence of such direction, as determined by a majority of the board 
of directors. No proxy shall be valid more than eleven months from the 
date of its execution except for a proxy coupled with an interest.
    (2) Shares controlled by association. Neither treasury shares of its 
own stock held by the association nor shares held by another 
corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote for the 
election of directors of such other corporation are held by the 
association, shall be voted at any meeting or counted in determining the 
total number of outstanding shares at any given time for purposes of any 
meeting.
    (g) Nominations and new business submitted by shareholders. 
Nominations for directors and new business submitted by shareholders 
shall be voted upon at the annual meeting if such nominations or new 
business are submitted in writing and delivered to the secretary of the 
association at least five days prior to the date of the annual meeting. 
Ballots bearing the names of all the persons nominated shall be provided 
for use at the annual meeting.
    (h) Informal action by stockholders. If the bylaws of the 
association so provide, any action required to be taken at a meeting of 
the stockholders, or any other action that may be taken at a meeting of 
the stockholders, may be taken without a meeting if consent in writing 
has been given by all the stockholders entitled to vote with respect to 
the subject matter.
[54 FR 49523, Nov. 30, 1989, as amended at 59 FR 18476, Apr. 19, 1994; 
61 FR 64019, Dec. 3, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 552.6-1  Board of directors.

    (a) General powers and duties. The business and affairs of the 
association shall be under the direction of its board of directors. The 
board of directors

[[Page 112]]

shall annually elect a chairman of the board from among its members and 
shall designate the chairman of the board, when present, to preside at 
its meeting. Directors need not be stockholders unless the bylaws so 
require.
    (b) Number and term. The bylaws shall set forth a specific number of 
directors, not a range. The number of directors shall be not fewer than 
five nor more than fifteen, unless a higher or lower number has been 
authorized by the Director of the Office or his or her delegate. 
Directors shall be elected for a term of one to three years and until 
their successors are elected and qualified. If a staggered board is 
chosen, the directors shall be divided into two or three classes as 
nearly equal in number as possible and one class shall be elected by 
ballot annually. In the case of a converting or newly chartered 
association where all directors shall be elected at the first election 
of directors, if a staggered board is chosen, the terms shall be 
staggered in length from one to three years.
    (c) Regular meetings. A regular meeting of the board of directors 
shall be held immediately after, and at the same place as, the annual 
meeting of shareholders. The board of directors shall determine the 
place, frequency, time and procedure for notice of regular meetings.
    (d) Quorum. A majority of the number of directors shall constitute a 
quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the board of 
directors. The act of the majority of the directors present at a meeting 
at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the board of directors, 
unless a greater number is prescribed by regulation of the Office.
    (e) Vacancies. Any vacancy occurring in the board of directors may 
be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining 
directors although less than a quorum of the board of directors. A 
director elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected to serve only until 
the next election of directors by the shareholders. Any directorship to 
be filled by reason of an increase in the number of directors may be 
filled by election by the board of directors for a term of office 
continuing only until the next election of directors by the 
shareholders.
    (f) Removal or resignation of directors. (1) At a meeting of 
shareholders called expressly for that purpose, any director may be 
removed only for cause, as defined in Sec. 563.39 of this chapter, by a 
vote of the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at 
an election of directors. Associations may provide for procedures 
regarding resignations in the bylaws.
    (2) If less than the entire board is to be removed, no one of the 
directors may be removed if the votes cast against the removal would be 
sufficient to elect a director if then cumulatively voted at an election 
of the class of directors of which such director is a part.
    (3) Whenever the holders of the shares of any class are entitled to 
elect one or more directors by the provisions of the charter or 
supplemental sections thereto, the provisions of this section shall 
apply, in respect to the removal of a director or directors so elected, 
to the vote of the holders of the outstanding shares of that class and 
not to the vote of the outstanding shares as a whole.
    (g) Executive and other committees. The board of directors, by 
resolution adopted by a majority of the full board, may designate from 
among its members an executive committee and one or more other 
committees each of which, to the extent provided in the resolution or 
bylaws of the association, shall have and may exercise all of the 
authority of the board of directors, except no committee shall have the 
authority of the board of directors with reference to: the declaration 
of dividends; the amendment of the charter or bylaws of the association; 
recommending to the stockholders a plan of merger, consolidation, or 
conversion; the sale, lease, or other disposition of all, or 
substantially all, of the property and assets of the association 
otherwise than in the usual and regular course of its business; a 
voluntary dissolution of the association; a revocation of any of the 
foregoing; or the approval of a transaction in which any member of the 
executive committee, directly or indirectly, has any material beneficial 
interest. The designation of any committee and the delegation of 
authority

[[Page 113]]

thereto shall not operate to relieve the board of directors, or any 
director, of any responsibility imposed by law or regulation.
    (h) Notice of special meetings. Written notice of at least 24 hours 
regarding any special meeting of the board of directors or of any 
committee designated thereby shall be given to each director in 
accordance with the bylaws, although such notice may be waived by the 
director. The attendance of a director at a meeting shall constitute a 
waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a director attends a 
meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any 
business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither 
the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any meeting need 
be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of such meeting. The 
bylaws may provide for telephonic participation at a meeting.
    (i) Action without a meeting. Any action required or permitted to be 
taken by the board of directors at a meeting may be taken without a 
meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the actions so taken, 
shall be signed by all of the directors.
    (j) Presumption of assent. A director of the association who is 
present at a meeting of the board of directors at which action on any 
association matter is taken shall be presumed to have assented to the 
action taken unless his or her dissent or abstention shall be entered in 
the minutes of the meeting or unless a written dissent to such action 
shall be filed with the person acting as the secretary of the meeting 
before the adjournment thereof or shall be forwarded by registered mail 
to the secretary of the association within five days after the date on 
which a copy of the minutes of the meeting is received. Such right to 
dissent shall not apply to a director who voted in favor of such action.
    (k) Age limitation on directors. A Federal association may provide a 
bylaw on age limitation for directors. Bylaws on age limitations must 
comply with all Federal laws, rules and regulations.
[54 FR 49523, Nov. 30, 1989, as amended at 58 FR 4312, Jan. 14, 1993; 61

<R05>
Sec. 552.6-2  Officers.

    (a) Positions. The officers of the association shall be a president, 
one or more vice presidents, a secretary, and a treasurer or 
comptroller, each of whom shall be elected by the board of directors. 
The board of directors may also designate the chairman of the board as 
an officer. The offices of the secretary and treasurer or comptroller 
may be held by the same person and the vice president may also be either 
the secretary or the treasurer or comptroller. The board of directors 
may designate one or more vice presidents as executive vice president or 
senior vice president. The board of directors may also elect or 
authorize the appointment of such other officers as the business of the 
association may require. The officers shall have such authority and 
perform such duties as the board of directors may from time to time 
authorize or determine. In the absence of action by the board of 
directors, the officers shall have such powers and duties as generally 
pertain to their respective offices.
    (b) Removal. Any officer may be removed by the board of directors 
whenever in its judgment the best interests of the association will be 
served thereby; but such removal, other than for cause, shall be without 
prejudice to the contractual rights, if any, of the person so removed. 
Employment contracts shall conform with Sec. 563.39 of this chapter.
    (c) Age limitation on officers. A Federal association may provide a 
bylaw on age limitation for officers. Bylaws on age limitations must

Sec. 552.6-3  Certificates for shares and their transfer.

    (a) Certificates for shares. Certificates representing shares of 
capital stock of the association shall be in such form as shall be 
determined by the board of directors and approved by the OTS. The 
certificates shall be signed by the chief executive officer or by any 
other officer of the association authorized by the board of directors, 
attested by the secretary or an assistant secretary, and

[[Page 114]]

sealed with the corporate seal or a facsimile thereof. The signatures of 
such officers upon a certificate may be facsimiles if the certificate is 
manually signed on behalf of a transfer agent or a registrar other than 
the association itself or one of its employees. Each certificate for 
shares of capital stock shall be consecutively numbered or otherwise 
identified. The name and address of the person to whom the shares are 
issued, with the number of shares and date of issue, shall be entered on 
the stock transfer books of the association. All certificates 
surrendered to the association for transfer shall be cancelled and no 
new certificate shall be issued until the former certificate for a like 
number of shares shall have been surrendered and cancelled, except that 
in the case of a lost or destroyed certificate a new certificate may be 
issued upon such terms and indemnity to the association as the board of 
directors may prescribe.
    (b) Transfer of shares. Transfer of shares of capital stock of the 
association shall be made only on its stock transfer books. Authority 
for such transfer shall be given only by the holder of record or by a 
legal representative, who shall furnish proper evidence of such 
authority, or by an attorney authorized by a duly executed power of 
attorney and filed with the association. The transfer shall be made only 
on surrender for cancellation of the certificate for the shares. The 
person in whose name shares of capital stock stand on the books of the 
association shall be deemed by the association to be the owner for all 
purposes.

Sec. 552.11  Books and records.

    (a) Each Federal stock association shall keep correct and complete 
books and records of account; shall keep minutes of the proceedings of 
its stockholders, board of directors, and committees of directors; and 
shall keep at its home office or at the office of its transfer agent or 
registrar, a record of its stockholders, giving the names and addresses 
of all stockholders, and the number, class and series, if any, of the 
shares held by each.
    (b) Any stockholder or group of stockholders of a Federal stock 
association, holding of record the number of voting shares of such 
association specified below, upon making written demand stating a proper 
purpose, shall have the right to examine, in person or by agent or 
attorney, at any reasonable time or times, nonconfidential portions of 
its books and records of account, minutes and record of stockholders and 
to make extracts therefrom. Such right of examination is limited to a 
stockholder or group of stockholders holding of record:
    (1) Voting shares having a cost of not less than $100,000 or 
constituting not less than one percent of the total outstanding voting 
shares, provided in either case such stockholder or group of 
stockholders have held of record such voting shares for a period of at 
least six months before making such written demand, or
    (2) Not less than five percent of the total outstanding voting 
shares.

No stockholder or group of stockholders of a Federal stock association 
shall have any other right under this section or common law to examine 
its books and records of account, minutes and record of stockholders, 
except as provided in its bylaws with respect to inspection of a list of 
stockholders.

[[Page 115]]

    (c) The right to examination authorized by paragraph (b) of this 
section and the right to inspect the list of stockholders provided by a 
Federal stock association's bylaws may be denied to any stockholder or 
group of stockholders upon the refusal of any such stockholder or group 
of stockholders to furnish such association, its transfer agent or 
registrar an affidavit that such examination or inspection is not 
desired for any purpose which is in the interest of a business or object 
other than the business of the association, that such stockholder has 
not within the five years preceding the date of the affidavit sold or 
offered for sale, and does not now intend to sell or offer for sale, any 
list of stockholders of the association or of any other corporation, and 
that such stockholder has not within said five-year period aided or 
abetted any other person in procuring any list of stockholders for 
purposes of selling or offering for sale such list.
    (d) Notwithstanding any provision of this section or common law, no 
stockholder or group of stockholders shall have the right to obtain, 
inspect or copy any portion of any books or records of a Federal stock 
association containing:
    (1) A list of depositors in or borrowers from such association;
    (2) Their addresses;
    (3) Individual deposit or loan balances or records; or
    (4) Any data from which such information could be reasonably 
constructed.

provided in this section, an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the 
outstanding voting stock of any constituent Federal savings association 
shall be required for

[[Page 117]]

approval of the combination agreement. If any class of shares is 
entitled to vote as a class pursuant to Sec. 552.4 of this part, an 
affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of each voting class and 
two-thirds of the total voting shares shall be required. The required 
vote shall be taken at a meeting of the savings association.
    (2) General exception. Stockholders of the resulting Federal stock 
association need not authorize a combination agreement if:
    (i) It does not involve an interim Federal savings association or an 
interim state savings association;
    (ii) The association's charter is not changed;
    (iii) Each share of stock outstanding immediately prior to the 
effective date of the combination is to be an identical outstanding 
share or a treasury share of the resulting Federal stock association 
after such effective date; and
    (iv) Either:
    (A) No shares of voting stock of the resulting Federal stock 
association and no securities convertible into such stock are to be 
issued or delivered under the plan of combination, or
    (B) The authorized unissued shares or the treasury shares of voting 
stock of the resulting Federal stock association to be issued or 
delivered under the plan of combination, plus those initially issuable 
upon conversion of any securities to be issued or delivered under such 
plan, do not exceed 15% of the total shares of voting stock of such 
association outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the 
combination.
    (3) Exceptions for certain combinations involving an interim 
association. Stockholders of a Federal stock association need not 
authorize by a two-thirds affirmative vote combinations involving an 
interim Federal savings association or interim state savings association 
when the resulting Federal stock association is acquired pursuant to 
Sec. 574.7(a)(2) of this chapter. In those cases, an affirmative vote of 
50 percent of the shares of the outstanding voting stock of the Federal 
stock association plus one affirmative vote shall be required. If any 
class of shares is entitled to vote as a class pursuant to Sec. 552.4 of 
this part, an affirmative vote of 50 percent of the shares of each 
voting class plus one affirmative vote shall be required. The required 
votes shall be taken at a meeting of the association.
    (i) Disclosure. The OTS may require, in connection with a 
combination under this section, such disclosure of information as the 
OTS deems necessary or desirable for the protection of investors in any 
of the constituent associations.
    (j) Articles of combination. (1) Following stockholder approval of 
any combination in which a Federal savings association is the resulting 
institution, articles of combination shall be executed in duplicate by 
each constituent institution, by its chief executive officer or 
executive vice president and by its secretary or an assistant secretary, 
and verified by one of the officers of each institution signing such 
articles, and shall set forth:
    (i) The plan of combination;
    (ii) The number of shares outstanding in each depository 
institution; and
    (iii) The number of shares in each depository institution voted for 
and against such plan.
    (2) Both sets of articles of combination shall be filed with the 
Office. If the Office determines that such articles conform to the 
requirements of this section, the Office shall endorse the articles and 
return one set to the resulting institution.
    (k) Effective date. No combination under this section shall be 
effective until receipt of any approvals required by the Office. The 
effective date of a combination in which the resulting institution is a 
Federal stock association shall be the date of consummation of the 
transaction or such other later date specified on the endorsement of the 
articles of combination by the Office. If a disappearing institution 
combining under this section is a Federal stock association, its charter 
shall be deemed to be cancelled as of the effective date of the 
combination and such charter must be surrendered to the Office as soon 
as practicable after the effective date.
    (l) Mergers and consolidations: transfer of assets and liabilities 
to the resulting institution. Upon the effective date of a merger or 
consolidation under this section, if the resulting institution is a

[[Page 118]]

Federal savings association, all assets and property (real, personal and 
mixed, tangible and intangible, choses in action, rights, and credits) 
then owned by each constituent institution or which would inure to any 
of them, shall, immediately by operation of law and without any 
conveyance, transfer, or further action, become the property of the 
resulting Federal savings association. The resulting Federal savings 
association shall be deemed to be a continuation of the entity of each 
constituent institution, the rights and obligations of which shall 
succeed to such rights and obligations and the duties and liabilities 
connected therewith, subject to the Home Owners' Loan Act and other 
applicable statutes.

Sec. 552.14  Dissenter and appraisal rights.

    (a) Right to demand payment of fair or appraised value. Except as 
provided in paragraph (b) of this section, any stockholder of a Federal 
stock association combining in accordance with Sec. 552.13 of this part 
shall have the right to demand payment of the fair or appraised value of 
his stock: Provided, That such stockholder has not voted in favor of the 
combination and complies with the provisions of paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (b) Exceptions. No stockholder required to accept only qualified 
consideration for his or her stock shall have the right under this 
section to demand payment of the stock's fair or appraised value, if 
such stock was listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on the 
National Association of Securities Dealers' Automated Quotation System 
(``NASDAQ'') on the date of the meeting at which the combination was 
acted upon or stockholder action is not required for a combination made 
pursuant to Sec. 552.13(h)(2) of this part. ``Qualified consideration'' 
means cash, shares of stock of any association or corporation which at 
the effective date of the combination will be listed on a national 
securities exchange or quoted on NASDAQ, or any combination of such 
shares of stock and cash.
    (c) Procedure--(1) Notice. Each constituent Federal stock 
association shall notify all stockholders entitled to rights under this 
section, not less than twenty days prior to the meeting at which the 
combination agreement is to be submitted for stockholder approval, of 
the right to demand payment of appraised value of shares, and shall 
include in such notice a copy of this section. Such written notice shall 
be mailed to stockholders of record and may be part of management's 
proxy solicitation for such meeting.
    (2) Demand for appraisal and payment. Each stockholder electing to 
make a demand under this section shall deliver to the Federal stock 
association, before voting on the combination, a writing identifying 
himself or herself and stating his or her intention thereby to demand 
appraisal of and payment for his or her shares. Such demand must be in 
addition to and separate from any proxy or vote against the combination 
by the stockholder.
    (3) Notification of effective date and written offer. Within ten 
days after the effective date of the combination, the resulting 
association shall:
    (i) Give written notice by mail to stockholders of constituent 
Federal stock associations who have complied with the provisions of 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section and have not voted in favor of the 
combination, of the effective date of the combination;
    (ii) Make a written offer to each stockholder to pay for dissenting 
shares at a specified price deemed by the resulting association to be 
the fair value thereof; and
    (iii) Inform them that, within sixty days of such date, the 
respective requirements of paragraphs (c)(5) and (c)(6) of this section 
(set out in the notice) must be satisfied.

The notice and offer shall be accompanied by a balance sheet and 
statement of income of the association the shares of which the 
dissenting stockholder holds, for a fiscal year ending not more than 
sixteen months before the date of notice and offer, together with the 
latest available interim financial statements.
    (4) Acceptance of offer. If within sixty days of the effective date 
of the combination the fair value is agreed upon

[[Page 119]]

between the resulting association and any stockholder who has complied 
with the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, payment 
therefor shall be made within ninety days of the effective date of the 
combination.
    (5) Petition to be filed if offer not accepted. If within sixty days 
of the effective date of the combination the resulting association and 
any stockholder who has complied with the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) 
of this section do not agree as to the fair value, then any such 
stockholder may file a petition with the Office, with a copy by 
registered or certified mail to the resulting association, demanding a 
determination of the fair market value of the stock of all such 
stockholders. A stockholder entitled to file a petition under this 
section who fails to file such petition within sixty days of the 
effective date of the combination shall be deemed to have accepted the 
terms offered under the combination.
    (6) Stock certificates to be noted. Within sixty days of the 
effective date of the combination, each stockholder demanding appraisal 
and payment under this section shall submit to the transfer agent his 
certificates of stock for notation thereon that an appraisal and payment 
have been demanded with respect to such stock and that appraisal 
proceedings are pending. Any stockholder who fails to submit his or her 
stock certificates for such notation shall no longer be entitled to 
appraisal rights under this section and shall be deemed to have accepted 
the terms offered under the combination.
    (7) Withdrawal of demand. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time 
within sixty days after the effective date of the combination, any 
stockholder shall have the right to withdraw his or her demand for 
appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the combination.
    (8) Valuation and payment. The Director shall, as he or she may 
elect, either appoint one or more independent persons or direct 
appropriate staff of the Office to appraise the shares to determine 
their fair market value, as of the effective date of the combination, 
exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or 
expectation of the combination. Appropriate staff of the Office shall 
review and provide an opinion on appraisals prepared by independent 
persons as to the suitability of the appraisal methodology and the 
adequacy of the analysis and supportive data. The Director after 
consideration of the appraisal report and the advice of the appropriate 
staff shall, if he or she concurs in the valuation of the shares, direct 
payment by the resulting association of the appraised fair market value 
of the shares, upon surrender of the certificates representing such 
stock. Payment shall be made, together with interest from the effective 
date of the combination, at a rate deemed equitable by the Director.
    (9) Costs and expenses. The costs and expenses of any proceeding 
under this section may be apportioned and assessed by the Director as he 
or she may deem equitable against all or some of the parties. In making 
this determination the Director shall consider whether any party has 
acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith in respect to the 
rights provided by this section.
    (10) Voting and distribution. Any stockholder who has demanded 
appraisal rights as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall 
thereafter neither be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose nor be 
entitled to the payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock 
(except dividends or other distribution payable to, or a vote to be 
taken by stockholders of record at a date which is on or prior to, the 
effective date of the combination): Provided, That if any stockholder 
becomes unentitled to appraisal and payment of appraised value with 
respect to such stock and accepts or is deemed to have accepted the 
terms offered upon the combination, such stockholder shall thereupon be 
entitled to vote and receive the distributions described above.
    (11) Status. Shares of the resulting association into which shares 
of the stockholders demanding appraisal rights would have been converted 
or exchanged, had they assented to the combination, shall have the 
status of authorized and unissued shares of the resulting association.

1693-1693r.

<R05>
Sec. 556.5  Branching by Federal savings associations.

    (a) General. A Federal association may branch in any state or states 
of the United States and its territories, except as provided in 
paragraph (b) of this section, subject to the requirements of paragraph 
(c) of this section.
    (b) Limitations. No branching will be permitted under paragraph (a) 
of this section that will result in the following:
    (1) Establishment or operation of a branch outside the state in 
which the association has its home office in violation of section 5(r) 
of the Home Owners' Loan Act;
    (2) Formation by any company of a multiple savings and loan holding 
company controlling savings associations in more than one state in 
violation of section 10(e)(3) of the Home Owners' Loan Act; or
    (3) Acquisition of a savings association and the establishment and 
operation of new branches by such savings association in violation of 
section 13(k)(4) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.
    (c) Branching applications. (1) General. Prior to opening a branch, 
an association must obtain approval of a branching application pursuant 
to Sec. 545.92 of this chapter. The Office may approve or deny an 
application based on information available from any source and 
supervisory objection may be interposed at any point during the 
processing of the application. In granting supervisory clearance to an 
applicant, the Office will consider whether the policies, condition, and 
operation of the applicant are satisfactory and afford no basis for 
supervisory objection.
    (2) Regulatory capital. For supervisory clearance, an association's 
regulatory capital should meet or exceed the minimum requirements 
established by law and applicable regulations of the Office upon 
acquisition or establishment of the proposed branch or branches, except 
as otherwise permitted under section 38(e)(4) of the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Act.
    (3) Community reinvestment. Pursuant to the Community Reinvestment 
Act of 1977 (12 U.S.C. 2901), the Office encourages savings associations 
to help meet in an affirmative and continuing manner the credit needs of 
all communities in which they do business, including low- and moderate-
income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operation. The 
Office will evaluate an applicant's record under part 563e of this 
chapter, may deny an application based on the assessment of the 
association's CRA record, and may approve a branch application on the 
condition that the association improve specific aspects of its community 
investment-related practices and performance to the satisfaction of the 
Office. However, in most cases, commitments by an applicant to improve 
its record of compliance with the CRA shall not be regarded as 
sufficient to overcome a seriously deficient CRA record at the time of 
application.
    (4) Comment procedures. Comments on applications for branches must 
be submitted in writing and factually documented. Comment procedures are 
set forth in subpart C of part 516 of this chapter, Sec. 563e.29 (c) and 
(d) of this chapter, the OTS Application Processing Handbook, and other 
supervisory guidance issued by the OTS.

[[Page 121]]

    (5) Expiration of approvals. If an association does not open a 
branch within the time specified in the approval, and the Director or 
his or her designee finds that the association is not making a good-
faith effort to open the branch promptly, the approval will be deemed to 
have expired and the association will be required to reapply if it wants 
to branch in that location.
    (d) Federal preemption. This exercise of the OTS's authority is 
preemptive of any state law purporting to address the subject of 
branching by a Federal savings association.

    (a) With limited exceptions, Federal savings associations lack the 
statutory authority to acquire an equity interest either in real estate 
or in a corporation. Accordingly, Federal savings associations cannot, 
as part of a loan transaction, acquire an ownership interest in the 
security property or in a corporate borrower. The issue has arisen as to 
whether the receipt of a share of the income generated by the security 
property or of a corporate borrower, or any similar participation with 
the borrower in the loan project, necessarily constitutes an 
unauthorized acquisition of an equity interest.
    (b) The Office has determined that the receipt of such income or the 
right to receive income should not be considered an equity interest if 
it in substance constitutes no more than a part of the compensation 
received for the use of the Federal savings association's funds. 
Accordingly, if the borrower has an unconditional obligation to repay 
the loan principal, and if a Federal savings association receives a 
substantial payment of interest calculated periodically as a percentage 
of the outstanding principal loan balance, it may receive additional 
interest calculated on the basis of the income from or the appreciation 
of the security property, the income of a corporate borrower, or some 
other measure of a venture's success. The means by which a Federal 
savings association calculates its share of the income is not a material 
consideration in determining whether the share constitutes an equity 
interest in the property.

<R05>
Sec. 557.11  To what extent does federal law preempt state deposit-related law?

    (a) Under sections 4(a) and 5(b) of the HOLA, 12 U.S.C. 1463(a), 
1464(b), OTS is authorized to promulgate regulations that preempt state 
laws affecting the operations of federal savings associations when 
appropriate to:
    (1) Facilitate the safe and sound operations of federal savings 
associations;
    (2) Enable federal savings associations to operate according to the 
best thrift institutions practices in the United States; or
    (3) Further other purposes of HOLA.
    (b) To further these purposes without undue regulatory duplication 
and burden, OTS hereby occupies the entire field of federal savings 
associations' deposit-related regulations. OTS intends to give federal 
savings associations maximum flexibility to exercise deposit-related 
powers according to a uniform federal scheme of regulation. Federal 
savings associations may exercise deposit-related powers as authorized 
under federal law, including this part, without regard to state laws 
purporting to regulate or otherwise effect deposit activities, except to 
the extent provided in Sec. 557.13. State law includes any statute, 
regulation, ruling, order, or judicial decision.


<R05>
Sec. 557.12  What are some examples of preempted state laws affecting deposits?

    The OTS preempts state laws that purport to impose requirements 
governing the following:
    (a) Abandoned and dormant accounts;
    (b) Checking accounts;
    (c) Disclosure requirements;
    (d) Funds availability;
    (e) Savings account orders of withdrawal;
    (f) Service charges and fees;
    (g) State licensing or registration requirements; and
    (h) Special purpose savings services.


<R05>
Sec. 557.13  What state laws affecting deposits are not preempted?

the extent that the law only incidentally affects your deposit-related 
activities or is otherwise consistent with the purposes of Sec. 557.11:
    (1) Contract and commercial law;
    (2) Tort law; and
    (3) Criminal law.
    (b) The OTS will not preempt any other state law if the OTS, upon 
review, finds that the law:
    (1) Furthers a vital state interest; and
    (2) Either only incidentally affects your deposit-related activities 
or is not otherwise contrary to the purposes expressed in Sec. 557.11.


<R05>
Sec. 557.14  What interest rate may I pay on savings accounts?

    (a) You may pay interest at any rate or anticipated rate of return 
on savings accounts, either in deposit or in share form, as provided in 
your charter and the account's terms.
    (b) You may pay fixed or variable rates. If you pay a variable rate, 
you must base it on a schedule, index, or formula that you specify in 
the account's terms.


<R05>

        Subpart C--Deposit Activities of All Savings Associations


<R05>
Sec. 557.20  What records should I maintain on deposit activities?

    All federal and state chartered savings associations (``you'') 
should establish and maintain deposit documentation practices and 
records that demonstrate that you appropriately administer and monitor 
deposit-related activities. Your records should adequately evidence 
ownership, balances, and all transactions involving each account. You 
may maintain records on deposit activities in any format that is 
consistent with standard business practices.

Sec. 559.1  What does this part cover?

    (a) OTS is issuing this part 559 pursuant to its general rulemaking

1462 et seq., and its specific authority under section 18(m) of the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1828(m). Subpart A of this part 
559 applies to subordinate organizations of federal savings 
associations. Subpart B of this part applies to subordinate 
organizations of all savings associations. OTS may, at any time, limit a 
savings association's investment in any of these entities, or may limit 
or refuse to permit any activities of any of these entities for 
supervisory, legal, or safety and soundness reasons.
    (b) Notices under this part are applications for purposes of 
statutory and regulatory references to ``applications.'' Any conditions 
that OTS imposes in approving any application are enforceable as a

<R05>
Sec. 559.2  Definitions.

    For purposes of this part:
    Control has the same meaning as in part 574 of this chapter.
    GAAP-consolidated subsidiary means an entity in which a savings 
association has a direct or indirect ownership interest and whose assets 
are consolidated with those of the savings association for purposes of 
reporting under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). 
Generally, these are entities in which a savings association has a 
majority ownership interest.
    Lower-tier entity includes any company in which an operating 
subsidiary or a service corporation has a direct or indirect ownership 
interest.
    Operating subsidiary means any entity that satisfies all of the 
requirements for an operating subsidiary set forth in Sec. 559.3 of this 
part and that is designated by the parent savings association as an 
operating subsidiary pursuant to Sec. 559.3 of this part. More than 50% 
of the voting shares of an operating subsidiary must be owned, directly 
or indirectly, by a federal savings association and no other person or 
entity may exercise effective operating control. An operating subsidiary 
may only engage in activities permissible for a federal savings 
association.
    Ownership interest means any equity interest in a business 
organization, including stock, limited or general partnership interests, 
or shares in a limited liability company.
    Service corporation means any entity that satisfies all of the 
requirements for service corporations in 12 U.S.C. 1464(c)(4)(B) and 
Sec. 559.3 of this part and that is designated by the investing savings 
association as a service corporation pursuant to Sec. 559.3 of this 
part. A service corporation must be organized under the laws of the 
state where the federal savings association's home office is located, 
may only be owned by savings associations with home offices in that 
state, and may engage in the activities identified in Secs. 559.3(e)(2) 
and 559.4 of this part.
    Subordinate organization means any corporation, partnership, 
business trust, association, joint venture, pool, syndicate, or other 
similar business organization in which a savings association has a 
direct or indirect ownership interest, unless that ownership interest 
qualifies as a pass-through investment pursuant to Sec. 560.32 of this 
chapter and is so designated by the investing savings association.
    Subsidiary means any subordinate organization directly or indirectly 
controlled by a savings association.

Sec. 559.5  How much may a savings association invest in service corporations or lower-tier entities?

    The amount that a federal savings association (``you'') may invest 
in a service corporation or any lower-tier entity depends upon several 
factors. These include your total assets, your capital, the purpose of 
the investment, and your ownership interest in the service corporation 
or entity.
    (a) Under section 5(c)(4)(B) of the HOLA, you may invest up to 3% of 
your assets in the capital stock, obligations, and other securities of 
service corporations. Any investment you make under this paragraph that 
would cause your investment, in the aggregate, to exceed 2% of your 
assets must serve primarily community, inner city, or community 
development purposes. You must designate the investments serving those 
purposes, which include:
    (1) Investments in governmentally insured, guaranteed, subsidized or 
otherwise sponsored programs for housing, small farms, or businesses 
that are local in character;
    (2) Investments for the preservation or revitalization of either 
urban or rural communities;
    (3) Investments designed to meet the community development needs of, 
and primarily benefit, low- and moderate-income communities; or
    (4) Other community, inner city, or community development-related 
investments approved by OTS.
    (b) In addition to the amounts you may invest under paragraph (a) of 
this section, and to the extent that you have authority under other 
provisions of section 5(c) of the HOLA and part 560 of this chapter, and 
available capacity within any applicable investment limits, you may make 
loans to any service corporation and any lower-tier entity, subject to 
the following conditions:
    (1) You and your GAAP-consolidated subsidiaries may, in the 
aggregate, make loans of up to 15% of your capital as defined in 
Sec. 567.5(c) of this chapter to each subordinate organization that does 
not qualify as a GAAP-consolidated subsidiary. All loans made under this 
paragraph (b)(1) may not, in the aggregate, exceed 50% of your total 
capital, as defined in Sec. 567.5(c) of this chapter.
    (2) The Regional Director may limit the amount of loans to a GAAP-
consolidated subsidiary, or may adjust the limits set forth in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section where safety and soundness considerations warrant 
such action.
    (c) For purposes of this section, the terms ``loans'' and 
``obligations'' include all loans and other debt instruments (except 
accounts payable incurred in the ordinary course of business and paid 
within 60 days) and all guarantees or take-out commitments of such loans 
or debt instruments.


<R04>
      Subpart B--Regulations Applicable to All Savings Associations


<R05>
Sec. 559.10  How must separate corporate identities be maintained?

    (a) Each savings association and subordinate organization thereof 
must be operated in a manner that demonstrates to the public that each 
maintains a separate corporate existence. Each must operate so that:
    (1) Their respective business transactions, accounts, and records 
are not intermingled;
    (2) Each observes the formalities of their separate corporate 
procedures;
    (3) Each is adequately financed as a separate unit in light of 
normal obligations reasonably foreseeable in a business of its size and 
character;
    (4) Each is held out to the public as a separate enterprise; and
    (5) Unless the parent savings association has guaranteed a loan to 
the subordinate organization, all borrowings by the subordinate 
organization indicate that the parent is not liable.
    (b) OTS regulations that apply both to savings associations and 
subordinate organizations shall not be construed as requiring a savings 
association and its subordinate organizations to operate as a single 
entity.


<R05>
Sec. 559.11  What notices are required to establish or acquire a new subsidiary or engage in new activities through an existing subsidiary?

    When required by section 18(m) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 
a savings association (``you'') must file a notice (``Notice'') in 
accordance with Sec. 516.1(c) of this chapter at least 30 days

[[Page 135]]

before establishing or acquiring a subsidiary or engaging in new 
activities in a subsidiary. The Notice must contain all of the 
information the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) requires 
pursuant to 12 CFR 303.13. Providing OTS with a copy of the notice you 
file with the FDIC will satisfy this requirement. If OTS notifies you 
within 30 days that the Notice presents supervisory concerns, or raises 
significant issues of law or policy, you must apply for and receive 
OTS's prior written approval in accordance with Sec. 516.1(c) of this 
chapter before establishing or acquiring the subsidiary or engaging in 
new activities in the subsidiary.


<R05>
Sec. 559.12  How may a subsidiary of a savings association issue securities?

    (a) A subsidiary may issue, either directly or through a third party 
intermediary, any securities that its parent savings association 
(``you'') may issue. The subsidiary must not state or imply that the 
securities it issues are covered by federal deposit insurance. A 
subsidiary may not issue any security the payment, maturity, or 
redemption of which may be accelerated upon the condition that you are 
insolvent or have been placed into receivership.
    (b) You must file a notice with OTS in accordance with Sec. 559.11 
of this part at least 30 days before your first issuance of any 
securities through an existing subsidiary or in conjunction with 
establishing or acquiring a new subsidiary. If OTS notifies you within 
30 days that the notice presents supervisory concerns or raises 
significant issues of law or policy, you must receive OTS's prior 
written approval before issuing securities through your subsidiary.
    (c) For as long as any securities are outstanding, you must maintain 
all records generated through each securities issuance in the ordinary 
course of business, including a copy of any prospectus, offering 
circular, or similar document concerning such issuance, and make such 
records available for examination by OTS. Such records must include, but 
are not limited to:
    (1) The amount of your assets or liabilities (including any 
guarantees you make with respect to the securities issuance) that have 
been transferred or made available to the subsidiary; the percentage 
that such amount represents of the current book value of your assets on 
an unconsolidated basis; and the current book value of all such assets 
of the subsidiary;
    (2) The terms of any guarantee(s) issued by you or any third party;
    (3) A description of the securities the subsidiary issued;
    (4) The net proceeds from the issuance of securities (or the pro 
rata portion of the net proceeds from securities issued through a 
jointly owned subsidiary); the gross proceeds of the securities 
issuance; and the market value of assets collateralizing the securities 
issuance (any assets of the subsidiary, including any guarantees of its 
securities issuance you have made);
    (5) The interest or dividend rates and yields, or the range thereof, 
and the frequency of payments on the subsidiary's securities;
    (6) The minimum denomination of the subsidiary's securities; and
    (7) Where the subsidiary marketed or intends to market the 
securities.
    (d) Sales of the subsidiary's securities to retail customers must 
comply with Sec. 545.74 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 559.13  How may a savings association exercise its salvage power in connection with a service corporation or lower-tier entities?

    (a) In accordance with this section, a savings association (``you'') 
may exercise your salvage power to make a contribution or a loan 
(including a guarantee of a loan made by any other person) to your 
service corporation or lower-tier entity (``salvage investment'') that 
exceeds the maximum amount otherwise permitted under law or regulation. 
You must notify OTS at least 30 days before making such a salvage 
investment. This notice must demonstrate that:
    (1) The salvage investment protects your interest in the service 
corporation or lower-tier entity;
    (2) The salvage investment is consistent with safety and soundness; 
and
    (3) You considered alternatives to the salvage investment and 
determined that such alternatives would not adequately satisfy 
paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.

[[Page 136]]

    (b) If OTS notifies you within 30 days that the Notice presents 
supervisory concerns, or raises significant issues of law or policy, you 
must apply for and receive OTS's prior written approval in accordance 
with Sec. 516.1(c) of this chapter before making a salvage investment.
    (c) If your service corporation or lower-tier entity is a GAAP-
consolidated subsidiary, your salvage investment under this section will 
be considered an investment in a subsidiary for purposes of part 567 of 
this chapter.

Sec. 560.1  General.

    (a) Authority and scope. This part is being issued by OTS under its 
general rulemaking and supervisory authority under the Home Owners' Loan 
Act (HOLA), 12 U.S.C. 1462 et seq. Subpart A of this part sets forth the 
lending and investment powers of Federal savings associations. Subpart B 
of this part contains safety-and-soundness based lending and investment 
provisions applicable to all savings associations. Subpart C of this 
part addresses alternative mortgages and applies to all savings 
associations.
    (b) General lending standards. Each savings association is expected 
to conduct its lending and investment activities prudently. Each 
association should use lending and investment standards that are 
consistent with safety and soundness, ensure adequate portfolio 
diversification and are appropriate for the size and condition of the 
institution, the nature and scope of its operations, and conditions in 
its lending market. Each association should adequately monitor the 
condition of its portfolio and the adequacy of any collateral securing 
its loans.


<R05>
Sec. 560.2  Applicability of law.

    (a) Occupation of field. Pursuant to sections 4(a) and 5(a) of the 
HOLA, 12 U.S.C. 1463(a), 1464(a), OTS is authorized to promulgate 
regulations that preempt state laws affecting the operations of federal 
savings associations when deemed appropriate to facilitate the safe and 
sound operation of federal savings associations, to enable federal 
savings associations to conduct their operations in accordance with the 
best practices of thrift institutions in the United States, or to 
further other purposes of the HOLA. To enhance safety

[[Page 137]]

and soundness and to enable federal savings associations to conduct 
their operations in accordance with best practices (by efficiently 
delivering low-cost credit to the public free from undue regulatory 
duplication and burden), OTS hereby occupies the entire field of lending 
regulation for federal savings associations. OTS intends to give federal 
savings associations maximum flexibility to exercise their lending 
powers in accordance with a uniform federal scheme of regulation. 
Accordingly, federal savings associations may extend credit as 
authorized under federal law, including this part, without regard to 
state laws purporting to regulate or otherwise affect their credit 
activities, except to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section or Sec. 560.110 of this part. For purposes of this section, 
``state law'' includes any state statute, regulation, ruling, order or 
judicial decision.
    (b) Illustrative examples. Except as provided in Sec. 560.110 of 
this part, the types of state laws preempted by paragraph (a) of this 
section include, without limitation, state laws purporting to impose 
requirements regarding:
    (1) Licensing, registration, filings, or reports by creditors;
    (2) The ability of a creditor to require or obtain private mortgage 
insurance, insurance for other collateral, or other credit enhancements;
    (3) Loan-to-value ratios;
    (4) The terms of credit, including amortization of loans and the 
deferral and capitalization of interest and adjustments to the interest 
rate, balance, payments due, or term to maturity of the loan, including 
the circumstances under which a loan may be called due and payable upon 
the passage of time or a specified event external to the loan;
    (5) Loan-related fees, including without limitation, initial 
charges, late charges, prepayment penalties, servicing fees, and 
overlimit fees;
    (6) Escrow accounts, impound accounts, and similar accounts;
    (7) Security property, including leaseholds;
    (8) Access to and use of credit reports;
    (9) Disclosure and advertising, including laws requiring specific 
statements, information, or other content to be included in credit 
application forms, credit solicitations, billing statements, credit 
contracts, or other credit-related documents and laws requiring 
creditors to supply copies of credit reports to borrowers or applicants;
    (10) Processing, origination, servicing, sale or purchase of, or 
investment or participation in, mortgages;
    (11) Disbursements and repayments;
    (12) Usury and interest rate ceilings to the extent provided in 12 
U.S.C. 1735f-7a and part 590 of this chapter and 12 U.S.C. 1463(g) and 
Sec. 560.110 of this part; and
    (13) Due-on-sale clauses to the extent provided in 12 U.S.C. 1701j-3 
and part 591 of this chapter.
    (c) State laws that are not preempted. State laws of the following 
types are not preempted to the extent that they only incidentally affect 
the lending operations of Federal savings associations or are otherwise 
consistent with the purposes of paragraph (a) of this section:
    (1) Contract and commercial law;
    (2) Real property law;
    (3) Homestead laws specified in 12 U.S.C. 1462a(f);
    (4) Tort law;
    (5) Criminal law; and
    (6) Any other law that OTS, upon review, finds:
    (i) Furthers a vital state interest; and
    (ii) Either has only an incidental effect on lending operations or 
is not otherwise contrary to the purposes expressed in paragraph (a) of 
this section.

association for a term of at least five years following the maturity of 
the loan.

Notes:                                                                  
<SUP>1 For purposes of determining a Federal savings association's percentage
  of assets limitation, investment in commercial paper and corporate    
  debt securities must be aggregated with the Federal savings           
  association's investment in consumer loans.                           
<SUP>2 A Federal savings association may invest in commercial paper and      
  corporate debt securities, which includes corporate debt securities   
  convertible into stock, subject to the provisions of Sec.  560.40.    
  Amounts in excess of 30% of assets, in the aggregate, may be invested 
  only in obligations purchased by the association directly from the    
  original obligor and for which no finder's or referral fees have been 
  paid.                                                                 
<SUP>3 The 2% of assets limitation is a sublimit for investments within the  
  overall 5% of assets limitation on community development loans and    
  investments. The qualitative standards for such loans and investments 
  are set forth in HOLA section 5(c)(3)(B), as explained in an opinion  
  of the OTS Chief Counsel dated May 10, 1995 (available upon request at
  the address set forth in Sec.  516.1(a) of this chapter).             
<SUP>4 Amounts in excess of 30% of assets, in aggregate, may be invested only
  in loans made by the association directly to the original obligor and 
  for which no finder's or referral fees have been paid. A Federal      
  savings association may include loans to dealers in consumer goods to 
  finance inventory and floor planning in the total investment made     
  under this section.                                                   
<SUP>5 While there is no statutory limit on certain categories of loans and  
  investments, including credit card loans, home improvement loans,     
  education loans, and deposit account loans, OTS may establish an      
  individual limit on such loans or investments if the association's    
  concentration in such loans or investments presents a safety and      
  soundness concern.                                                    
<SUP>6 A Federal savings association may engage in leasing activities subject
  to the provisions of Sec.  560.41.                                    
<SUP>7 This 1% of assets limitation applies to the aggregate outstanding     
  investments made under the Foreign Assistance Act and in the capital  
  of the Inter-American Savings and Loan Bank. Such investments may be  
  made subject to the provisions of Sec.  560.43.                       
<SUP>8 A home (or residential) loan includes loans secured by one-to-four    
  family dwellings, multi-family residential property and loans secured 
  by a unit or units of a condominium or housing cooperative.           
<SUP>9 A Federal savings association may make home loans subject to the      
  provisions of Secs.  560.33, 560.34 and 560.35.                       
<SUP>10 The assets qualifying as liquidity investments are described in Sec. 
  566.1(g) of this chapter. The maturity limitations (except those for  
  bankers acceptances) of Sec.  566.1(g) of this chapter do not apply   
  for purposes of this section.                                         
<SUP>11 Loans secured by savings accounts and other time deposits may be made
  without limitation, provided the Federal savings association obtains a
  lien on, or a pledge of, such accounts. Such loans may not exceed the 
  withdrawable amount of the account.                                   
<SUP>12 A Federal savings association may only invest in these loans if they 
  are secured by obligations of, or by obligations fully guaranteed as  
  to principal and interest by, the United States or any of its agencies
  or instrumentalities, the borrower is a financial institution insured 
  by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or is a broker or dealer 
  registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the market
  value of the securities for each loan at least equals the amount of   
  the loan at the time it is made.

<SUP>13 If the wheels and axles of the manufactured home have been removed   
  and it is permanently affixed to a foundation, a loan secured by a    
  combination of a manufactured home and developed residential lot on   
  which it sits may be treated as a home loan.                          
<SUP>14 Without regard to any limitations of this part, a Federal savings    
  association may make or invest in the fully insured or guaranteed     
  portion of nonresidential real estate loans insured or guaranteed by  
  the Economic Development Administration, the Farmers Home             
  Administration, or the Small Business Administration. Unguaranteed    
  portions of guaranteed loans must be aggregated with uninsured loans  
  when determining an association's compliance with the 400% of capital 
  limitation for other real estate loans.                               
<SUP>15 This authority is limited to investments in open-end management      
  investment companies that are registered with the Securities and      
  Exchange Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The     
  portfolio of the investment company must be restricted by the         
  company's investment policy (changeable only if authorized by         
  shareholder vote) solely to investments that a Federal savings        
  association may, without limitation as to percentage of assets, invest
  in, sell, redeem, hold, or otherwise deal in. Separate and apart from 
  this authority, a Federal savings association may make pass-through   
  investments to the extent authorized by Sec.  560.32.                 
<SUP>16 A Federal savings association may invest in service corporations     
  subject to the provisions of part 559 of this chapter.                
<SUP>17 A Federal savings association may only invest in small business      
  investment companies formed pursuant to section 301(d) of the Small   
  Business Investment Act of 1958.                                      
<SUP>18 This category includes obligations issued by any state, territory, or
  possession of the United States or political subdivision thereof      
  (including any agency, corporation, or instrumentality of a state or  
  political subdivision), subject to Sec.  560.42.                      
<SUP>19 A Federal savings association may invest in state housing            
  corporations subject to the provisions of Sec.  560.121.              
<SUP>20 Payments on accounts in excess of the account balance (overdrafts) on
  commercial deposit or transaction accounts shall be considered        
  commercial loans for purposes of determining the association's        
  percentage of assets limitation.

Sec. 560.31  Election regarding categorization of loans or investments and related calculations.

    (a) If a loan or other investment is authorized under more than one 
section of the HOLA, as amended, or this part, a Federal savings 
association may designate under which section the loan or investment has 
been made. Such a loan or investment may be apportioned among 
appropriate categories, and may be moved, in whole or part, from one 
category to another. A loan commitment shall be counted as an investment 
and included in total assets of a Federal savings association for 
purposes of calculating compliance with HOLA section 5(c)'s investment 
limitations only to the extent that funds have been advanced and not 
repaid pursuant to the commitment.
    (b) Loans or portions of loans sold to a third party shall be 
included in the calculation of a percentage-of-assets or percentage-of-
capital investment limitation only to the extent they are sold with 
recourse.
    (c) A Federal savings association may make a loan secured by an 
assignment of loans to the extent that it could, under applicable law 
and regulations, make or purchase the underlying assigned loans.


<R05>
Sec. 560.32  Pass-through investments.

    (a) A federal savings association (``you'') may make pass-through 
investments. A pass-through investment occurs when you invest in an 
entity (``company'') that engages only in activities that you may 
conduct directly and the investment meets the requirements of this 
section. If an investment is authorized under both this section and some 
other provision of law, you may designate under which authority or 
authorities the investment is made. When making a pass-through 
investment, you must comply with all the statutes and regulations that 
would apply if you were engaging in the activity directly. For example, 
your proportionate share of the company's assets will be aggregated with 
the assets you hold directly in calculating investment limits (e.g., no 
more than 400% of total capital may be invested in nonresidential real 
property loans).
    (b) You may make a pass-through investment without prior notice to 
OTS if all of the following conditions are met:
    (1) You do not invest more than 15% of your total capital in one 
company;
    (2) The book value of your aggregate pass-through investments does 
not exceed 50% of your total capital after making the investment;
    (3) Your investment would not give you direct or indirect control of 
the company;
    (4) Your liability is limited to the amount of your investment; and
    (5) The company falls into one of the following categories:
    (i) A limited partnership;
    (ii) An open-end mutual fund;
    (iii) A closed-end investment trust;
    (iv) A limited liability company; or
    (v) An entity in which you are investing primarily to use the 
company's services (e.g., data processing).
    (c) If you want to make other pass-through investments, you must 
provide

[[Page 141]]

OTS with 30 days' advance notice. If within that 30-day period OTS 
notifies you that an investment presents supervisory, legal, or safety 
and soundness concerns, you must file an application with OTS in 
accordance with Sec. 516.1 of this chapter and may not make the 
investment without first receiving OTS's prior written approval. Notices 
under this section are deemed to be applications for purposes of 
statutory and regulatory references to ``applications.'' Any conditions 
that OTS imposes on any pass-through investment shall be enforceable as 
a condition imposed in writing by the OTS in connection with the 
granting of a request by a savings association within the meaning of 12 
U.S.C. 1818(b) or 1818(i).
[61 FR 66578, Dec. 18, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 560.33  Late charges.

    A Federal savings association may include in a home loan contract a 
provision authorizing the imposition of a late charge with respect to 
the payment of any delinquent periodic payment. With respect to any loan 
made after July 31, 1976, on the security of a home occupied or to be 
occupied by the borrower, no late charge, regardless of form, shall be 
assessed or collected by a Federal savings association, unless any 
billing, coupon, or notice the Federal savings association may provide 
regarding installment payments due on the loan discloses the date after 
which the charge may be assessed. A Federal savings association may not 
impose a late charge more than one time for late payment of the same 
installment, and any installment payment made by the borrower shall be 
applied to the longest outstanding installment due. A Federal savings 
association shall not assess a late charge as to any payment received by 
it within fifteen days after the due date of such payment. No form of 
such late charge permitted by this paragraph shall be considered as 
interest to the Federal savings association and the Federal savings 
association shall not deduct late charges from the regular periodic 
installment payments on the loan, but must collect them as such from the 
borrower.


<R05>
Sec. 560.34  Prepayments.

    Any prepayment on a real estate loan must be applied directly to 
reduce the principal balance on the loan unless the loan contract or the 
borrower specifies otherwise. Subject to the terms of the loan contract, 
a Federal savings association may impose a fee for any prepayment of a 
loan.


<R05>
Sec. 560.35  Adjustments to home loans.

    (a) For any home loan secured by borrower-occupied property, or 
property to be occupied by the borrower, adjustments to the interest 
rate, payment, balance, or term to maturity must comply with the 
limitations of this section and the disclosure and notice requirements 
of Sec. 560.210 of this part.
    (b) Adjustments to the interest rate shall correspond directly to 
the movement of an index satisfying the requirements of paragraph (d) of 
this section. A Federal savings association also may increase the 
interest rate pursuant to a formula or schedule that specifies the 
amount of the increase, the time at which it may be made, and which is 
set forth in the loan contract. A Federal savings association may 
decrease the interest rate at any time.
    (c) Adjustments to the payment and the loan balance that do not 
reflect an interest-rate adjustment may be made if:
    (1) The adjustments reflect a change in an index that may be used 
pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section;
    (2) In the case of a payment adjustment, the adjustment reflects a 
change in the loan balance or is made pursuant to a formula, or to a 
schedule specifying the percentage or dollar change in the payment as 
set forth in the loan contract; or
    (3) In the case of an open-end line-of-credit loan, the adjustment 
reflects an advance taken by the borrower under the line-of-credit and 
is permitted by the loan contract.
    (d)(1) Any index used must be readily available and independently 
verifiable. If set forth in the loan contract, an association may use 
any combination of indices, a moving average of index values, or more 
than one index during the term of a loan.

[[Page 142]]

    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, any 
index used must be a national or regional index.
    (3) A Federal savings association may use an index not satisfying 
the requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section 30 days after 
filing a notice in accordance with Sec. 516.1(c) of this chapter unless, 
within that 30-day period, OTS has notified the association that the 
notice presents supervisory concerns or raises significant issues of law 
or policy. If OTS does notify the association of such concerns or 
issues, the Federal savings association may not use such an index unless 
and until it applies for and receives OTS's prior written approval in 
accordance with Sec. 516.1(c) of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 560.36  De minimis investments.

    A federal savings association may invest in the aggregate up to the 
greater of one-fourth of 1% of its total capital or $100,000 in 
community development investments of the type permitted for a national 
bank under 12 CFR Part 24.
[61 FR 66579, Dec. 18, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 560.37  Real estate for office and related facilities.

    A federal savings association may invest in real estate (improved or 
unimproved) to be used for office and related facilities of the 
association, or for such office and related facilities and for rental or 
sale, if such investment is made and maintained under a prudent program 
of property acquisition to meet the federal savings association's 
present needs or its reasonable future needs for office and related 
facilities. A federal savings association may not make an investment 
that would cause the outstanding book value of all such investments 
(including investments under Sec. 559.4(e)(2) of this chapter) to exceed 
its total capital.

<R05>
Sec. 560.40  Commercial paper and corporate debt securities.

    Pursuant to HOLA section 5(c)(2)(D), a Federal savings association 
may invest in, sell, or hold commercial paper and corporate debt 
securities subject to the provisions of this section.
    (a) Limitations. (1) Commercial paper must be:
    (i) As of the date of purchase, rated in either one of the two 
highest categories by at least two nationally recognized investment 
ratings services as shown by the most recently published rating made of 
such investments; or
    (ii) If unrated, guaranteed by a company having outstanding paper 
that is rated as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.
    (2) Corporate debt securities must be:
    (i) Securities that may be sold with reasonable promptness at a 
price that corresponds reasonably to their fair value; and
    (ii) Rated in one of the four highest categories by a nationally 
recognized investment ratings service at its most recently published 
rating before the date of purchase of the security.
    (3) A Federal savings association's total investment in the 
commercial paper and corporate debt securities of any one issuer, or 
issued by any one person or entity affiliated with such issuer, together 
with other loans, shall not exceed the general lending limitations 
contained in Sec. 560.93(c) of this part.
    (4) Investments in corporate debt securities convertible into stock 
are subject to the following additional limitations:
    (i) The purchase of securities convertible into stock at the option 
of the issuer is prohibited;
    (ii) At the time of purchase, the cost of such securities must be 
written down to an amount that represents the investment value of the 
securities considered independently of the conversion feature; and
    (iii) Federal savings associations are prohibited from exercising 
the conversion feature.
    (5) A Federal savings association shall maintain information in its 
files adequate to demonstrate that it has exercised prudent judgment in 
making investments under this section.
    (b) Notwithstanding the limitations contained in this section, the 
Office may permit investment in corporate debt securities of another 
savings association in connection with the purchase or sale of a branch 
office or in

[[Page 143]]

connection with a supervisory merger or acquisition.

Sec. 560.41  Leasing.

    (a) Permissible activities. Subject to the limitations of this 
section, a Federal savings association may engage in leasing activities. 
These activities include becoming the legal or beneficial owner of 
tangible personal property or real property for the purpose of leasing 
such property, obtaining an assignment of a lessor's interest in a lease 
of such property, and incurring obligations incidental to its position 
as the legal or beneficial owner and lessor of the leased property.
    (b) Definitions. For the purposes of this section:
    (1) The term net lease means a lease under which the Federal savings 
association will not, directly or indirectly, provide or be obligated to 
provide for:
    (i) The servicing, repair or maintenance of the leased property 
during the lease term;
    (ii) The purchasing of parts and accessories for the leased 
property, except that improvements and additions to the leased property 
may be leased to the lessee upon its request in accordance with the 
full-payout requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section;
    (iii) The loan of replacement or substitute property while the 
leased property is being serviced;
    (iv) The purchasing of insurance for the lessee, except where the 
lessee has failed to discharge a contractual obligation to purchase or 
maintain insurance; or
    (v) The renewal of any license, registration, or filing for the 
property unless such action by the Federal savings association is 
necessary to protect its interest as an owner or financier of the 
property.
    (2) The term full-payout lease means a lease transaction in which 
any unguaranteed portion of the estimated residual value relied on by 
the association to yield the return of its full investment in the leased 
property, plus the estimated cost of financing the property over the 
term of the lease, does not exceed 25% of the original cost of the 
property to the lessor. In general, a lease will qualify as a full-
payout lease if the scheduled payments provide at least 75% of the 
principal and interest payments that a lessor would receive if the 
finance lease were structured as a market-rate loan.
    (3) The term realization of investment means that a Federal savings 
association that enters into a lease financing transaction must 
reasonably expect to realize the return of its full investment in the 
leased property, plus the estimated cost of financing the property over 
the term of the lease from:
    (i) Rentals;
    (ii) Estimated tax benefits, if any; and
    (iii) The estimated residual value of the property at the expiration 
of the term of the lease.
    (c) Finance leasing--(1) Investment limits. A Federal savings 
association may exercise its authority under HOLA sections 5(c)(1)(B) 
(residential real estate loans), 5(c)(2)(A) (commercial, business, 
corporate or agricultural loans), 5(c)(2)(B) (nonresidential real estate 
loans), and 5(c)(2)(D) (consumer loans) by conducting leasing activities 
that are the functional equivalent of loans made under those HOLA 
sections. These activities are commonly referred to as financing leases. 
Such financing leases are subject to the same investment limits that 
apply to loans made under those sections. For example, a financing lease 
of tangible personal property made to a natural person for personal, 
family or household purposes is subject to all limitations applicable to 
the amount of a Federal savings association's investment in consumer 
loans. A financing lease made for commercial, corporate, business, or 
agricultural purposes is subject to all limitations applicable to the 
amount of a Federal savings association's investment in commercial 
loans. A financing lease of residential or nonresidential real property 
is subject to all limitations applicable to the amount of a Federal 
savings association's investment in these types of real estate loans.
    (2) Functional equivalent of lending. To qualify as the functional 
equivalent of a loan:
    (i) The lease must be a net, full-payout lease representing a non-
cancelable

[[Page 144]]

obligation of the lessee, notwithstanding the possible early termination 
of the lease;
    (ii) The portion of the estimated residual value of the property 
relied upon by the lessor to satisfy the requirements of a full-payout 
lease must be reasonable in light of the nature of the leased property 
and all relevant circumstances so that realization of the lessor's full 
investment plus the cost of financing the property depends primarily on 
the creditworthiness of the lessee, and not on the residual market value 
of the leased property; and
    (iii) At the termination of a financing lease, either by expiration 
or default, property acquired must be liquidated or released on a net 
basis as soon as practicable. Any property held in anticipation of re-
leasing must be reevaluated and recorded at the lower of fair market 
value or book value.
    (d) General leasing. Pursuant to section 5(c)(2)(C) of the HOLA, a 
Federal savings association may invest in tangible personal property, 
including vehicles, manufactured homes, machinery, equipment, or 
furniture, for the purpose of leasing that property. In contrast to 
financing leases, lease investments made under this authority need not 
be the functional equivalent of loans.
    (e) Leasing salvage powers. If, in good faith, a Federal savings 
association believes that there has been an unanticipated change in 
conditions that threatens its financial position by significantly 
increasing its exposure to loss, it may:
    (1) As the owner and lessor, take reasonable and appropriate action 
to salvage or protect the value of the property or its interest arising 
under the lease;
    (2) As the assignee of a lessor's interest in a lease, become the 
owner and lessor of the leased property pursuant to its contractual 
right, or take any reasonable and appropriate action to salvage or 
protect the value of the property or its interest arising under the 
lease; or
    (3) Include any provisions in a lease, or make any additional 
agreements, to protect its financial position or investment in the 
circumstances set forth in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 560.42  State and local government obligations.

    Pursuant to HOLA section 5(c)(1)(H), a Federal savings association 
may invest in obligations issued by any state, territory, possession, or 
political subdivision thereof, subject to the following conditions:
    (a) A Federal savings association may not invest more than 10% of 
its total capital in obligations of any one issuer, exclusive of general 
obligations of the issuer.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the 
obligations must:
    (1) Continue to hold one of the four highest national investment 
grade ratings; or
    (2) Must be issued by a public housing agency and backed by the full 
faith and credit of the United States.
    (c) Notwithstanding the limitations in paragraph (b) of this 
section, a Federal savings association may invest:
    (1) In the aggregate, up to one percent of its assets in the 
obligations of a state, territory, possession, or political subdivision 
in which the association's home office or a branch office is located; or
    (2) In any obligations approved by the Office.


<R05>
Sec. 560.43  Foreign assistance investments.

    Pursuant to HOLA section 5(c)(4)(C), a Federal savings association 
may make foreign assistance investments in an aggregate amount not to 
exceed one percent of its assets, subject to the following conditions:
    (a) For any investment made under the Foreign Assistance Act, the 
loan agreement shall specify what constitutes an event of default, and 
provide that upon default in payment of principal or interest under such 
agreement, the entire amount of outstanding indebtedness thereunder 
shall become immediately due and payable, at the lender's option. 
Additionally, the contract of guarantee shall cover 100% of any loss of 
investment thereunder, except for any portion of the loan arising out of 
fraud or misrepresentation

[[Page 145]]

for which the party seeking payment is responsible, and provide that the 
guarantor shall pay for any such loss in U.S. dollars within a specified 
reasonable time after the date of application for payment.
    (b) To make any investments in the share capital and capital reserve 
of the Inter-American Savings and Loan Bank, a Federal savings 
association must be adequately capitalized and have adequate allowances 
for loan and lease losses. The Federal savings association's aggregate 
investment in such capital or capital reserve, including the amount of 
any obligations undertaken to provide said Bank with reserve capital in 
the future (call-able capital), must not, as a result of such 
investment, exceed the lesser of one-quarter of 1% of its assets or 
$100,000.


<R04>
 Subpart B--Lending and Investment Provisions Applicable to all Savings 
                              Associations


<R05>
Sec. 560.93  Lending limitations.

    (a) Scope. This section applies to all loans and extensions of 
credit to third parties made by a savings association and its 
subsidiaries. This section does not apply to loans made by a savings 
association or a GAAP-consolidated subsidiary to subordinate 
organizations or affiliates of the savings association. The terms 
subsidiary, GAAP-consolidated subsidiary, and subordinate organization 
have the same meanings as specified in Sec. 559.2 of this chapter. The 
term affiliate has the same meaning as specified in Sec. 563.41 of this 
chapter.
    (b) Definitions. In applying these lending limitations, savings 
associations shall apply the definitions and interpretations promulgated 
by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency consistent with 12 
U.S.C. 84. See 12 CFR part 32. In applying these definitions, pursuant 
to 12 U.S.C. 1464, savings associations shall use the terms savings 
association, savings associations, and savings association's in place of 
the terms national bank and bank, banks, and bank's, respectively. For 
purposes of this section:
    (1) The term one borrower has the same meaning as the term person 
set forth at 12 CFR part 32. It also includes, in addition to the 
definition cited therein, a financial institution as defined at 
Sec. 561.19 of this chapter.
    (2) The term company means a corporation, partnership, business 
trust, association, or similar organization and, unless specifically 
excluded, the term company includes a savings association and a bank.
    (3) Contractual commitment to advance funds has the meaning set 
forth in 12 CFR part 32.
    (4) Loans and extensions of credit has the meaning set forth in 12 
CFR part 32, and includes investments in commercial paper and corporate 
debt securities. The Office expressly reserves its authority to deem 
other arrangements that are, in substance, loans and extensions of 
credit to be encompassed by this term.
    (5) The term loans as used in the phrase Loans to one borrower to 
finance the sale of real property acquired in satisfaction of debts 
previously contracted for in good faith does not include an 
association's taking of a purchase money mortgage note from the 
purchaser provided that:
    (i) No new funds are advanced by the association to the borrower; 
and
    (ii) The association is not placed in a more detrimental position as 
a result of the sale.
    (6) [Reserved]
    (7) Readily marketable collateral has the meaning set forth in 12 
CFR part 32.
    (8) Residential housing units has the same meaning as the term 
residential real estate set forth in Sec. 541.23 of this chapter. The 
term to develop includes the various phases necessary to produce housing 
units as an end product, to include: acquisition, development and 
construction; development and construction; construction; 
rehabilitation; or conversion. The term domestic includes units within 
the fifty states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin 
Islands, Guam, and the Pacific Islands.
    (9) Single family dwelling unit has the meaning set forth in 
Sec. 541.20 of this chapter.
    (10) A standby letter of credit has the meaning set forth in 12 CFR 
part 32.
    (11) Unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus means--

[[Page 146]]

    (i) A savings association's core capital and supplementary capital 
included in its total capital under part 567 of this chapter; plus
    (ii) The balance of a savings association's allowance for loan and 
lease losses not included in supplementary capital under part 567 of 
this chapter; plus
    (iii) The amount of a savings association's loans to, investments 
in, and advances to subsidiaries not included in calculating core 
capital under part 567 of this chapter.
    (c) General limitation. Section 5200 of the Revised Statutes (12 
U.S.C. 84) shall apply to savings associations in the same manner and to 
the same extent as it applies to national banks. This statutory 
provision and lending limit regulations and interpretations promulgated 
by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency pursuant to a 
rulemaking conducted in accordance with the provisions of the 
Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553 et seq. (including the 
regulations appearing at 12 CFR part 32) shall apply to savings 
associations in the same manner and to the same extent as these 
provisions apply to national banks:
    (1) The total loans and extensions of credit by a savings 
association to one borrower outstanding at one time and not fully 
secured, as determined in the same manner as determined under 12 U.S.C. 
84(a)(2), by collateral having a market value at least equal to the 
amount of the loan or extension of credit shall not exceed 15 percent of 
the unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus of the association.
    (2) The total loans and extensions of credit by a savings 
association to one borrower outstanding at one time and fully secured by 
readily marketable collateral having a market value, as determined by 
reliable and continuously available price quotations, at least equal to 
the amount of the funds outstanding shall not exceed 10 per centum of 
the unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus of the association. This 
limitation shall be separate from and in addition to the limitation 
contained in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (d) Exceptions to the general limitation--(1) $500,000 exception. If 
a savings association's aggregate lending limitation calculated under 
paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section is less than $500,000, 
notwithstanding this aggregate limitation in paragraphs (c)(1) and 
(c)(2) of this section, such savings association may have total loans 
and extensions of credit, for any purpose, to one borrower outstanding 
at one time not to exceed $500,000.
    (2) Statutory exceptions. The exceptions to the lending limits set 
forth in 12 U.S.C. 84 and 12 CFR part 32 are applicable to savings 
associations in the same manner and to the extent as they apply to 
national banks.
    (3) Loans to develop domestic residential housing units. Subject to 
paragraph (d)(4) of this section, a savings association may make loans 
to one borrower to develop domestic residential housing units, not to 
exceed the lesser of $30,000,000 or 30 percent of the savings 
association's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, including all 
amounts loaned under the authority of the General Limitation set forth 
under paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, provided that:
    (i) The final purchase price of each single family dwelling unit the 
development of which is financed under this paragraph (d)(3) does not 
exceed $500,000;
    (ii) The savings association is, and continues to be, in compliance 
with its capital requirements under part 567 of this chapter.
    (iii) OTS permits, subject to conditions it may impose, the savings 
association to use the higher limit set forth under this paragraph 
(d)(3). A savings association that meets the requirements of paragraphs 
(d)(3) (i), (ii), (iv) and (v) of this section and that meets the 
requirements for ``expedited treatment'' under Sec. 516.3(a) of this 
chapter may use the higher limit set forth under this paragraph (d)(3) 
if the savings association has filed a notice with OTS that it intends 
to use the higher limit at least 30 days prior to the proposed use. A 
savings association that meets the requirements of paragraphs (d)(3) 
(i), (ii), (iv) and (v) of this section and that meets the requirements 
for ``standard treatment'' under Sec. 516.3(b) of this chapter may use 
the higher limit set forth under this paragraph

[[Page 147]]

(d)(3) if the savings association has filed a notice with OTS and an 
order has been issued permitting the savings association to use the 
higher limit;
    (iv) Loans made under this paragraph (d)(3) to all borrowers do not, 
in aggregate, exceed 150 percent of the savings association's unimpaired 
capital and unimpaired surplus; and
    (v) Such loans comply with the applicable loan-to-value requirements 
that apply to Federal savings associations.
    (4) The authority of a savings association to make a loan or 
extension of credit under the exception in paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section ceases immediately upon the association's failure to comply with 
any one of the requirements set forth in paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section or any condition(s) set forth in a Director's order under 
paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section.
    (5) Notwithstanding the limit set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) and 
(c)(2) of this section, a savings association may invest up to 10 
percent of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus in the obligations 
of one issuer evidenced by:
    (i) Commercial paper rated, as of the date of purchase, as shown by 
the most recently published rating by at least two nationally recognized 
investment rating services in the highest category; or
    (ii) Corporate debt securities that may be sold with reasonable 
promptness at a price that corresponds reasonably to their fair value, 
and that are rated in one of the two highest categories by a nationally 
recognized investment rating service in its most recently published 
ratings before the date of purchase of the security.
    (e) Loans to finance the sale of REO. A savings association's loans 
to one borrower to finance the sale of real property acquired in 
satisfaction of debts previously contracted for in good faith shall not, 
when aggregated with all other loans to such borrower, exceed the 
General Limitation in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (f) Calculating compliance and recordkeeping. (1) The amount of an 
association's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(11) of this section shall be calculated as of the 
association's most recent periodic report required to be filed with OTS 
prior to the date of granting or purchasing the loan or otherwise 
creating the obligation to repay funds, unless the association knows, or 
has reason to know, based on transactions or events actually completed, 
that such level has changed significantly, upward or downward, 
subsequent to filing of such report.
    (2) If a savings association or subsidiary thereof makes a loan or 
extension of credit to any one borrower, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section, in an amount that, when added to the total balances of 
all outstanding loans owed to such association and its subsidiary by 
such borrower, exceeds the greater of $500,000 or 5 percent of 
unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, the records of such 
association or its subsidiary with respect to such loan shall include 
documentation showing that such loan was made within the limitations of 
paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section; for the purpose of such 
documentation such association or subsidiary may require, and may accept 
in good faith, a certification by the borrower identifying the persons, 
entities, and interests described in the definition of one borrower in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (g) [Reserved]
    (h) More stringent restrictions. The Director may impose more 
stringent restrictions on a savings association's loans to one borrower 
if the Director determines that such restrictions are necessary to 
protect the safety and soundness of the savings association.

                Appendix to Sec. 560.93--Interpretations

 Section 560.93-100  Interrelation of General Limitation With Exception 
         for Loans To Develop Domestic Residential Housing Units

    1. The Sec. 560.93(d)(3) exception for loans to one person to 
develop domestic residential housing units is characterized in the 
regulation as an ``alternative'' limit. This exceptional $30,000,000 or 
30 percent limitation does not operate in addition to the 15 percent 
General Limitation or the 10 percent additional amount an association 
may loan to one borrower secured by readily marketable collateral, but 
serves as the uppermost limitation on a savings association's lending to 
any one person once an association employs this exception. An example 
will illustrate the Office's interpretation of the application of this 
rule:

[[Page 148]]

    Example: Savings Associations A's lending limitation as calculated 
under the 15 percent General Limitation is $800,000. If Association A 
lends Y $800,000 for commercial purposes, Association A cannot lend Y an 
additional $1,600,000, or 30 percent of capital and surplus, to develop 
residential housing units under the paragraph (d)(3) exception. The 
(d)(3) exception operates as the uppermost limitation on all lending to 
one borrower (for associations that may employ this exception) and 
includes any amounts loaned to the same borrower under the General 
Limitation. Association A, therefore, may lend only an additional 
$800,000 to Y, provided the paragraph (d)(3) prerequisites have been 
met. The amount loaned under the authority of the General Limitation 
($800,000), when added to the amount loaned under the exception 
($800,000), yields a sum that does not exceed the 30 percent uppermost 
limitation ($1,600,000).
    2. This result does not change even if the facts are altered to 
assume that some or all of the $800,000 amount of lending permissible 
under the General Limitation's 15 percent basket is not used, or is 
devoted to the development of domestic residential housing units.
    In other words, using the above example, if Association A lends Y 
$400,000 for commercial purposes and $300,000 for residential purposes--
both of which would be permitted under the Association's $800,000 
General Limitation--Association A's remaining permissible lending to Y 
would be: first, an additional $100,000 under the General Limitation, 
and then another $800,000 to develop domestic residential housing units 
if the Association meets the paragraph (d)(3) prerequisites. (The latter 
is $800,000 because in no event may the total lending to Y exceed 30 
percent of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus). If Association A 
did not lend Y the remaining $100,000 permissible under the General 
Limitation, its permissible loans to develop domestic residential 
housing units under paragraph (d)(3) would be $900,000 instead of 
$800,000 (the total loans to Y would still equal $1,600,000).
    3. In short, under the paragraph (d)(3) exception, the 30 percent or 
$30,000,000 limit will always operate as the uppermost limitation, 
unless of course the association does not avail itself of the exception 
and merely relies upon its General Limitation.

Section 560.93-101  Interrelationship Between the General Limitation and 
  the 150 Percent Aggregate Limit on Loans to all Borrowers To Develop 
                   Domestic Residential Housing Units

    1. The Office has already received numerous questions regarding the 
allocation of loans between the different lending limit ``baskets,'' 
i.e., the 15 percent General Limitation basket and the 30 percent 
Residential Development basket. In general, the inquiries concern the 
manner in which an association may ``move'' a loan from the General 
Limitation basket to the Residential Development basket. The following 
example is intended to provide guidance:
    Example: Association A's General Limitation under section 5(u)(1) is 
$15 million. In January, Association A makes a $10 million loan to 
Borrower to develop domestic residential housing units. At the time the 
loan was made, Association A had not received approval under a Director 
order to avail itself of the residential development exception to 
lending limits. Therefore, the $10 million loan is made under 
Association A's General Limitation.
    2. In June, Association A receives authorization to lend under the 
Residential Development exception. In July, Association A lends $3 
million to Borrower to develop domestic residential housing units. In 
August, Borrower seeks an additional $12 million commercial loan from 
Association A. Association A cannot make the loan to Borrower, however, 
because it already has an outstanding $10 million loan to Borrower that 
counts against Association A's General Limitation of $15 million. Thus, 
Association A may lend only up to an additional $5 million to Borrower 
under the General Limitation.
    3. However, Association A may be able to reallocate the $10 million 
loan it made to Borrower in January to its Residential Development 
basket provided that: (1) Association A has obtained authority under a 
Director's order to avail itself of the additional lending authority for 
residential development and maintains compliance with all prerequisites 
to such lending authority; (2) the original $10 million loan made in 
January constitutes a loan to develop domestic residential housing units 
as defined; and (3) the housing unit(s) constructed with the funds from 
the January loan remain in a stage of ``development'' at the time 
Association A reallocates the loan to the domestic residential housing 
basket. The project must be in a stage of acquisition, development, 
construction, rehabilitation, or conversion in order for the loan to be 
reallocated.
    4. If Association A is able to reallocate the $10 million loan made 
to Borrower in January to its Residential Development basket, it may 
make the $12 million commercial loan requested by Borrower in August. 
Once the January loan is reallocated to the Residential Development 
basket, however, the $10 million loan counts towards Association's 150 
percent aggregate limitation on loans to all borrowers under the 
residential development basket (section 5(u)(2)(A)(ii)(IV)).
    5. If Association A reallocates the January loan to its domestic 
residential housing basket and makes an additional $12 million 
commercial loan to Borrower, Association A's totals under the respective 
limitations

[[Page 149]]

would be: $12 million under the General Limitation; and $13 million 
under the Residential Development limitation. The full $13 million 
residential development loan counts toward Association A's aggregate 150 
percent limitation.

Sec. 560.100  Real estate lending standards; purpose and scope.

    This section, and Sec. 560.101 of this subpart, issued pursuant to 
section 304 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act 
of 1991, 12 U.S.C. 1828(o), prescribe standards for real estate lending 
to be used by savings associations and all their includable 
subsidiaries, as defined in 12 CFR 567.1, over which the savings 
associations exercise control, in adopting internal real estate lending 
policies.
[61 FR 50971, Sept. 30, 1996, as amended at 62 FR 66262, Dec. 18, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 560.101  Real estate lending standards.

    (a) Each savings association shall adopt and maintain written 
policies that establish appropriate limits and standards for extensions 
of credit that are secured by liens on or interests in real estate, or 
that are made for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to 
real estate.
    (b)(1) Real estate lending policies adopted pursuant to this section 
must:
    (i) Be consistent with safe and sound banking practices;
    (ii) Be appropriate to the size of the institution and the nature 
and scope of its operations; and
    (iii) Be reviewed and approved by the savings association's board of 
directors at least annually.
    (2) The lending policies must establish:
    (i) Loan portfolio diversification standards;
    (ii) Prudent underwriting standards, including loan-to-value limits, 
that are clear and measurable;
    (iii) Loan administration procedures for the savings association's 
real estate portfolio; and
    (iv) Documentation, approval, and reporting requirements to monitor 
compliance with the savings association's real estate lending policies.
    (c) Each savings association must monitor conditions in the real 
estate market in its lending area to ensure that its real estate lending 
policies continue to be appropriate for current market conditions.
    (d) The real estate lending policies adopted pursuant to this 
section should reflect consideration of the Interagency Guidelines for 
Real Estate Lending Policies established by the Federal bank and thrift 
supervisory agencies.

Appendix to Sec. 560.101--Interagency Guidelines for Real Estate Lending 
                                Policies

    The agencies' regulations require that each insured depository 
institution adopt and maintain a written policy that establishes 
appropriate limits and standards for all extensions of credit that are 
secured by liens on or interests in real estate or made for the purpose 
of financing the construction of a building or other 
improvements.<SUP>1</SUP> These guidelines are intended to assist 
institutions in the formulation and maintenance of a real estate lending 
policy that is appropriate to the size of the institution and the nature 
and scope of its individual operations, as well as satisfies the 
requirements of the regulation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\  The agencies have adopted a uniform rule on real estate 
lending. See 12 CFR Part 365 (FDIC); 12 CFR Part 208, Subpart C (FRB); 
12 CFR Part 34, Subpart D (OCC); and 12 CFR 560.100-560.101 (OTS).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Each institution's policies must be comprehensive, and consistent 
with safe and sound lending practices, and must ensure that the 
institution operates within limits and according to standards that are 
reviewed and approved at least annually by the board of directors. Real 
estate lending is an integral part of many institutions' business plans 
and, when undertaken in a prudent manner, will not be subject to 
examiner criticism.

                Loan Portfolio Management Considerations

    The lending policy should contain a general outline of the scope and 
distribution of the institution's credit facilities and the manner in 
which real estate loans are made, serviced, and collected. In 
particular, the institution's policies on real estate lending should:
    <bullet> Identify the geographic areas in which the institution will 
consider lending.
    <bullet> Establish a loan portfolio diversification policy and set 
limits for real estate loans by type and geographic market (e.g., limits 
on higher risk loans).

[[Page 150]]

    <bullet> Identify appropriate terms and conditions by type of real 
estate loan.
    <bullet> Establish loan origination and approval procedures, both 
generally and by size and type of loan.
    <bullet> Establish prudent underwriting standards that are clear and 
measurable, including loan-to-value limits, that are consistent with 
these supervisory guidelines.
    <bullet> Establish review and approval procedures for exception 
loans, including loans with loan-to-value percentages in excess of 
supervisory limits.
    <bullet> Establish loan administration procedures, including 
documentation, disbursement, collateral inspection, collection, and loan 
review.
    <bullet> Establish real estate appraisal and evaluation programs.
    <bullet> Require that management monitor the loan portfolio and 
provide timely and adequate reports to the board of directors.
    The institution should consider both internal and external factors 
in the formulation of its loan policies and strategic plan. Factors that 
should be considered include:
    <bullet> The size and financial condition of the institution.
    <bullet> The expertise and size of the lending staff.
    <bullet> The need to avoid undue concentrations of risk.
    <bullet> Compliance with all real estate related laws and 
regulations, including the Community Reinvestment Act, anti-
discrimination laws, and for savings associations, the Qualified Thrift 
Lender test.
    <bullet> Market conditions.
    The institution should monitor conditions in the real estate markets 
in its lending area so that it can react quickly to changes in market 
conditions that are relevant to its lending decisions. Market supply and 
demand factors that should be considered include:
    <bullet> Demographic indicators, including population and employment 
trends.
    <bullet> Zoning requirements.
    <bullet> Current and projected vacancy, construction, and absorption 
rates.
    <bullet> Current and projected lease terms, rental rates, and sales 
prices, including concessions.
    <bullet> Current and projected operating expenses for different 
types of projects.
    <bullet> Economic indicators, including trends and diversification 
of the lending area.
    <bullet> Valuation trends, including discount and direct 
capitalization rates.

                         Underwriting Standards

    Prudently underwritten real estate loans should reflect all relevant 
credit factors, including:
    <bullet> The capacity of the borrower, or income from the underlying 
property, to adequately service the debt.
    <bullet> The value of the mortgaged property.
    <bullet> The overall creditworthiness of the borrower.
    <bullet> The level of equity invested in the property.
    <bullet> Any secondary sources of repayment.
    <bullet> Any additional collateral or credit enhancements (such as 
guarantees, mortgage insurance or takeout commitments).
    The lending policies should reflect the level of risk that is 
acceptable to the board of directors and provide clear and measurable 
underwriting standards that enable the institution's lending staff to 
evaluate these credit factors. The underwriting standards should 
address:
    <bullet> The maximum loan amount by type of property.
    <bullet> Maximum loan maturities by type of property.
    <bullet> Amortization schedules.
    <bullet> Pricing structure for different types of real estate loans.
    <bullet> Loan-to-value limits by type of property.
    For development and construction projects, and completed commercial 
properties, the policy should also establish, commensurate with the size 
and type of the project or property:
    <bullet> Requirements for feasibility studies and sensitivity and 
risk analyses (e.g., sensitivity of income projections to changes in 
economic variables such as interest rates, vacancy rates, or operating 
expenses).
    <bullet> Minimum requirements for initial investment and maintenance 
of hard equity by the borrower (e.g., cash or unencumbered investment in 
the underlying property).
    <bullet> Minimum standards for net worth, cash flow, and debt 
service coverage of the borrower or underlying property.
    <bullet> Standards for the acceptability of and limits on non-
amortizing loans.
    <bullet> Standards for the acceptability of and limits on the use of 
interest reserves.
    <bullet> Pre-leasing and pre-sale requirements for income-producing 
property.
    <bullet> Pre-sale and minimum unit release requirements for non-
income-producing property loans.
    <bullet> Limits on partial recourse or nonrecourse loans and 
requirements for guarantor support.
    <bullet> Requirements for takeout commitments.
    <bullet> Minimum covenants for loan agreements.

                           Loan Administration

    The institution should also establish loan administration procedures 
for its real estate portfolio that address:
    <bullet> Documentation, including:
    Type and frequency of financial statements, including requirements 
for verification of information provided by the borrower;

[[Page 151]]

    Type and frequency of collateral evaluations (appraisals and other 
estimates of value).
    <bullet> Loan closing and disbursement.
    <bullet> Payment processing.
    <bullet> Escrow administration.
    <bullet> Collateral administration.
    <bullet> Loan payoffs.
    <bullet> Collections and foreclosure, including:
    Delinquency follow-up procedures;
    Foreclosure timing;
    Extensions and other forms of forbearance;
    Acceptance of deeds in lieu of foreclosure.
    <bullet> Claims processing (e.g., seeking recovery on a defaulted 
loan covered by a government guaranty or insurance program).
    <bullet> Servicing and participation agreements.

                    Supervisory Loan-to-Value Limits

    Institutions should establish their own internal loan-to-value 
limits for real estate loans. These internal limits should not exceed 
the following supervisory limits:

                                                                        
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               Loan-to- 
                       Loan category                         value limit
                                                               (percent)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Raw land...................................................           65
Land development...........................................           75
Construction:                                                           
  Commercial, multifamily,\1\ and other nonresidential.....           80
  1- to 4-family residential...............................           85
  Improved property........................................           85
  Owner-occupied 1- to 4-family and home equity............     ( \2\ ) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Multifamily construction includes condominiums and cooperatives.    
\2\ A loan-to-value limit has not been established for permanent        
  mortgage or home equity loans on owner-occupied, 1- to 4-family       
  residential property. However, for any such loan with a loan-to-value 
  ratio that equals or exceeds 90 percent at origination, an institution
  should require appropriate credit enhancement in the form of either   
  mortgage insurance or readily marketable collateral.                  

    The supervisory loan-to-value limits should be applied to the 
underlying property that collateralizes the loan. For loans that fund 
multiple phases of the same real estate project (e.g., a loan for both 
land development and construction of an office building), the 
appropriate loan-to-value limit is the limit applicable to the final 
phase of the project funded by the loan; however, loan disbursements 
should not exceed actual development or construction outlays. In 
situations where a loan is fully cross-collateralized by two or more 
properties or is secured by a collateral pool of two or more properties, 
the appropriate maximum loan amount under supervisory loan-to-value 
limits is the sum of the value of each property, less senior liens, 
multiplied by the appropriate loan-to-value limit for each property. To 
ensure that collateral margins remain within the supervisory limits, 
lenders should redetermine conformity whenever collateral substitutions 
are made to the collateral pool.
    In establishing internal loan-to-value limits, each lender is 
expected to carefully consider the institution-specific and market 
factors listed under ``Loan Portfolio Management Considerations,'' as 
well as any other relevant factors, such as the particular subcategory 
or type of loan. For any subcategory of loans that exhibits greater 
credit risk than the overall category, a lender should consider the 
establishment of an internal loan-to-value limit for that subcategory 
that is lower than the limit for the overall category.
    The loan-to-value ratio is only one of several pertinent credit 
factors to be considered when underwriting a real estate loan. Other 
credit factors to be taken into account are highlighted in the 
``Underwriting Standards'' section above. Because of these other 
factors, the establishment of these supervisory limits should not be 
interpreted to mean that loans at these levels will automatically be 
considered sound.

         Loans in Excess of the Supervisory Loan-to-Value Limits

    The agencies recognize that appropriate loan-to-value limits vary 
not only among categories of real estate loans but also among individual 
loans. Therefore, it may be appropriate in individual cases to originate 
or purchase loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of the supervisory 
loan-to-value limits, based on the support provided by other credit 
factors. Such loans should be identified in the institutions' records, 
and their aggregate amount reported at least quarterly to the 
institution's board of directors. (See additional reporting requirements 
described under ``Exceptions to the General Policy.'') The aggregate 
amount of all loans in excess of the supervisory loan-to-value limits 
should not exceed 100 percent of total capital.<SUP>2</SUP> Moreover, 
within the aggregate limit, total loans for all commercial, 
agricultural, multifamily or other non-1-to- 4 family residential 
properties should not exceed 30 percent of total capital. An institution 
will come under increased supervisory scrutiny as the total of such 
loans approaches these levels.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ For the state member banks, the term ``total capital'' means 
``total risk-based capital'' as defined in Appendix A to 12 CFR Part 
208. For insured state non-member banks, ``total capital'' refers to 
that term described in table I of Appendix A to 12 CFR Part 325. For 
national banks, the term ``total capital'' is defined at 12 CFR 3.2(e). 
For savings associations, the term ``total capital'' is defined at 12 
CFR 567.5(c).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In determining the aggregate amount of such loans, institutions 
should: (a) Include all loans secured by the same property if any one of 
those loans exceeds the supervisory

[[Page 152]]

loan-to-value limits; and (b) include the recourse obligation of any 
such loan sold with recourse. Conversely, a loan should no longer be 
reported to the directors as part of aggregate totals when reduction in 
principal or senior liens, or additional contribution of collateral or 
equity (e.g., improvements to the real property securing the loan), 
bring the loan-to-value ratio into compliance with supervisory limits.

                          Excluded Transactions

    The agencies also recognize that there are a number of lending 
situations in which other factors significantly outweigh the need to 
apply the supervisory loan-to-value limits.
    These include:
    <bullet> Loans guaranteed or insured by the U.S. government or its 
agencies, provided that the amount of the guaranty or insurance is at 
least equal to the portion of the loan that exceeds the supervisory 
loan-to-value limit.
    <bullet> Loans backed by the full faith and credit of a state 
government, provided that the amount of the assurance is at least equal 
to the portion of the loan that exceeds the supervisory loan-to-value 
limit.
    <bullet> Loans guaranteed or insured by a state, municipal or local 
government, or an agency thereof, provided that the amount of the 
guaranty or insurance is at least equal to the portion of the loan that 
exceeds the supervisory loan-to-value limit, and provided that the 
lender has determined that the guarantor or insurer has the financial 
capacity and willingness to perform under the terms of the guaranty or 
insurance agreement.
    <bullet> Loans that are to be sold promptly after origination, 
without recourse, to a financially responsible third party.
    <bullet> Loans that are renewed, refinanced, or restructured without 
the advancement of new funds or an increase in the line of credit 
(except for reasonable closing costs), or loans that are renewed, 
refinanced, or restructured in connection with a workout situation, 
either with or without the advancement of new funds, where consistent 
with safe and sound banking practices and part of a clearly defined and 
well-documented program to achieve orderly liquidation of the debt, 
reduce risk of loss, or maximize recovery on the loan.
    <bullet> Loans that facilitate the sale of real estate acquired by 
the lender in the ordinary course of collecting a debt previously 
contracted in good faith.
    <bullet> Loans for which a lien on or interest in real property is 
taken as additional collateral through an abundance of caution by the 
lender (e.g., the institution takes a blanket lien on all or 
substantially all of the assets of the borrower, and the value of the 
real property is low relative to the aggregate value of all other 
collateral).
    <bullet> Loans, such as working capital loans, where the lender does 
not rely principally on real estate as security and the extension of 
credit is not used to acquire, develop, or construct permanent 
improvements on real property.
    <bullet> Loans for the purpose of financing permanent improvements 
to real property, but not secured by the property, if such security 
interest is not required by prudent underwriting practice.

                Exceptions to the General Lending Policy

    Some provision should be made for the consideration of loan requests 
from creditworthy borrowers whose credit needs do not fit within the 
institution's general lending policy. An institution may provide for 
prudently underwritten exceptions to its lending policies, including 
loan-to-value limits, on a loan-by-loan basis. However, any exceptions 
from the supervisory loan-to-value limits should conform to the 
aggregate limits on such loans discussed above.
    The board of directors is responsible for establishing standards for 
the review and approval of exception loans. Each institution should 
establish an appropriate internal process for the review and approval of 
loans that do not conform to its own internal policy standards. The 
approval of any such loan should be supported by a written justification 
that clearly sets forth all of the relevant credit factors that support 
the underwriting decision. The justification and approval documents for 
such loans should be maintained as a part of the permanent loan file. 
Each institution should monitor compliance with its real estate lending 
policy and individually report exception loans of a significant size to 
its board of directors.

    Supervisory Review of Real Estate Lending Policies and Practices

    The real estate lending policies of institutions will be evaluated 
by examiners during the course of their examinations to determine if the 
policies are consistent with safe and sound lending practices, these 
guidelines, and the requirements of the regulation. In evaluating the 
adequacy of the institution's real estate lending policies and 
practices, examiners will take into consideration the following factors:
    <bullet> The nature and scope of the institution's real estate 
lending activities.
    <bullet> The size and financial condition of the institution.
    <bullet> The quality of the institution's management and internal 
controls.
    <bullet> The expertise and size of the lending and loan 
administration staff.
    <bullet> Market conditions.
    Lending policy exception reports will also be reviewed by examiners 
during the course of their examinations to determine whether

[[Page 153]]

the institutions' exceptions are adequately documented and appropriate 
in light of all of the relevant credit considerations. An excessive 
volume of exceptions to an institution's real estate lending policy may 
signal a weakening of its underwriting practices, or may suggest a need 
to revise the loan policy.

                               Definitions

    For the purposes of these Guidelines:
    Construction loan means an extension of credit for the purpose of 
erecting or rehabilitating buildings or other structures, including any 
infrastructure necessary for development.
    Extension of credit or loan means:
    (1) The total amount of any loan, line of credit, or other legally 
binding lending commitment with respect to real property; and
    (2) The total amount, based on the amount of consideration paid, of 
any loan, line of credit, or other legally binding lending commitment 
acquired by a lender by purchase, assignment, or otherwise.
    Improved property loan means an extension of credit secured by one 
of the following types of real property:
    (1) Farmland, ranchland or timberland committed to ongoing 
management and agricultural production;
    (2) 1- to 4-family residential property that is not owner-occupied;
    (3) Residential property containing five or more individual dwelling 
units;
    (4) Completed commercial property; or
    (5) Other income-producing property that has been completed and is 
available for occupancy and use, except income-producing owner-occupied 
1- to 4-family residential property.
    Land development loan means an extension of credit for the purpose 
of improving unimproved real property prior to the erection of 
structures. The improvement of unimproved real property may include the 
laying or placement of sewers, water pipes, utility cables, streets, and 
other infrastructure necessary for future development.
    Loan origination means the time of inception of the obligation to 
extend credit (i.e., when the last event or prerequisite, controllable 
by the lender, occurs causing the lender to become legally bound to fund 
an extension of credit).
    Loan-to-value or loan-to-value ratio means the percentage or ratio 
that is derived at the time of loan origination by dividing an extension 
of credit by the total value of the property(ies) securing or being 
improved by the extension of credit plus the amount of any readily 
marketable collateral and other acceptable collateral that secures the 
extension of credit. The total amount of all senior liens on or 
interests in such property(ies) should be included in determining the 
loan-to-value ratio. When mortgage insurance or collateral is used in 
the calculation of the loan-to-value ratio, and such credit enhancement 
is later released or replaced, the loan-to-value ratio should be 
recalculated.
    Other acceptable collateral means any collateral in which the lender 
has a perfected security interest, that has a quantifiable value, and is 
accepted by the lender in accordance with safe and sound lending 
practices. Other acceptable collateral should be appropriately 
discounted by the lender consistent with the lender's usual practices 
for making loans secured by such collateral. Other acceptable collateral 
includes, among other items, unconditional irrevocable standby letters 
of credit for the benefit of the lender.
    Owner-occupied, when used in conjunction with the term 1- to 4-
family residential property means that the owner of the underlying real 
property occupies at least one unit of the real property as a principal 
residence of the owner.
    Readily marketable collateral means insured deposits, financial 
instruments, and bullion in which the lender has a perfected interest. 
Financial instruments and bullion must be salable under ordinary 
circumstances with reasonable promptness at a fair market value 
determined by quotations based on actual transactions, on an auction or 
similarly available daily bid and ask price market. Readily marketable 
collateral should be appropriately discounted by the lender consistent 
with the lender's usual practices for making loans secured by such 
collateral.
    Value means an opinion or estimate, set forth in an appraisal or 
evaluation, whichever may be appropriate, of the market value of real 
property, prepared in accordance with the agency's appraisal regulations 
and guidance. For loans to purchase an existing property, the term 
``value'' means the lesser of the actual acquisition cost or the 
estimate of value.
    1- to 4-family residential property means property containing fewer 
than five individual dwelling units, including manufactured homes 
permanently affixed to the underlying property (when deemed to be real 
property under state law).


<R05>
Sec. 560.110  Most favored lender usury preemption.

    (a) Definition. The term ``interest'' as used in 12 U.S.C. 1463(g) 
includes any payment compensating a creditor or prospective creditor for 
an extension of credit, making available of a line of credit, or any 
default or breach by a borrower of a condition upon which credit was 
extended. It includes, among other things, the following fees connected 
with credit extension or availability: numerical periodic rates, late 
fees, not sufficient funds (NSF) fees,

[[Page 154]]

overlimit fees, annual fees, cash advance fees, and membership fees. It 
does not ordinarily include appraisal fees, premiums and commissions 
attributable to insurance guaranteeing repayment of any extension of 
credit, finders' fees, fees for document preparation or notarization, or 
fees incurred to obtain credit reports.
    (b) Authority. A savings association located in a state may charge 
interest at the maximum rate permitted to any state-chartered or 
licensed lending institution by the law of that state. If state law 
permits different interest charges on specified classes of loans, a 
federal savings association making such loans is subject only to the 
provisions of state law relating to that class of loans that are 
material to the determination of the permitted interest. For example, a 
federal savings association may lawfully charge the highest rate 
permitted to be charged by a state-licensed small loan company, without 
being so licensed, but subject to state law limitations on the size of 
loans made by small loan companies. Except as provided in this 
paragraph, the applicability of state law to Federal savings 
associations shall be determined in accordance with Sec. 560.2 of this 
part. State supervisors determine the degree to which state-chartered 
savings associations must comply with state laws other than those 
imposing restrictions on interest, as defined in paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (c) Effect on state definitions of interest. The Federal definition 
of the term ``interest'' in paragraph (a) of this section does not 
change how interest is defined by the individual states (nor how the 
state definition of interest is used) solely for purposes of state law. 
For example, if late fees are not ``interest'' under state law where a 
savings association is located but state law permits its most favored 
lender to charge late fees, then a savings association located in that 
state may charge late fees to its intrastate customers. The savings 
association may also charge late fees to its interstate customers 
because the fees are interest under the Federal definition of interest 
and an allowable charge under state law where the savings association is 
located. However, the late fees would not be treated as interest for 
purposes of evaluating compliance with state usury limitations because 
state law excludes late fees when calculating the maximum interest that 
lending institutions may charge under those limitations.


<R05>
Sec. 560.120  Letters of credit and other independent undertakings to pay against documents.

    (a) General authority. To the extent that it has legal authority to 
do so, a savings association may issue and commit to issue letters of 
credit within the scope of applicable laws or rules of practice 
recognized by law.<SUP>1</SUP> It may also issue other independent 
undertakings within the scope of such laws or rules of practice 
recognized by law, that have been approved by OTS (approved 
undertaking). Under such letters of credit and approved undertakings, 
the savings association's obligation to honor depends upon the 
presentation of specified documents and not upon nondocumentary 
conditions or resolution of questions of fact or law at issue between 
the account party and the beneficiary. A savings association may also 
confirm or otherwise undertake to honor or purchase specified documents 
upon their presentation under another person's independent undertaking 
within the scope of such laws or rules.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Samples of laws or rules of practice applicable to letters of 
credit and other independent undertakings include, but are not limited 
to: the applicable version of Article 5 of the Uniform Commercial Code 
(UCC) (1962, as amended 1990) or revised Article 5 of the UCC (as 
amended 1995) (available from West Publishing Co., 1/800/340-9378); the 
Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (International 
Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Publication No. 500) (available from ICC 
Publishing, Inc., 212/206-1150); the United Nations Commission on 
International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Convention on Independent Guarantees 
and Standby Letters of Credit (adopted by UNCITRAL 1995) (available from 
UNCITRAL, 212/963-5353); and the Uniform Rules for Bank-to-Bank 
Reimbursements Under Documentary Credits (ICC Publication No. 525) 
(available from ICC Publishing, Inc., 212/206-1150); as any of the 
foregoing may be amended from time to time.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Safety and soundness considerations.--(1) Terms. As a matter of 
safe

[[Page 155]]

and sound banking practice, savings associations that issue letters of 
credit or approved undertakings should not be exposed to undue risk. At 
a minimum, savings associations should consider the following:
    (i) The independent character of the letter of credit or approved 
undertaking should be apparent from its terms (such as terms that 
subject it to laws or rules providing for its independent character);
    (ii) The letter of credit or approved undertaking should be limited 
in amount;
    (iii) The letter of credit or approved undertaking should:
    (A) Be limited in duration; or
    (B) Permit the savings association to terminate the letter of credit 
or approved undertaking, either on a periodic basis (consistent with the 
savings association's ability to make any necessary credit assessments) 
or at will upon either notice or payment to the beneficiary; or
    (C) Entitle the savings association to cash collateral from the 
account party on demand (with a right to accelerate the customer's 
obligations, as appropriate); and
    (iv) The savings association either should be fully collateralized 
or have a post-honor right of reimbursement from its customer or from 
another issuer of a letter of credit or an independent undertaking. 
Alternatively, if the savings association's undertaking is to purchase 
documents of title, securities, or other valuable documents, it should 
obtain a first priority right to realize on the documents if the savings 
association is not otherwise to be reimbursed.
    (2) Additional considerations in special circumstances. Certain 
letters of credit and approved undertakings require particular 
protections against credit, operational, and market risk:
    (i) In the event that the undertaking is to honor by delivery of an 
item of value other than money, the savings association should ensure 
that market fluctuations that affect the value of the item will not 
cause the savings association to assume undue market risk;
    (ii) In the event that an undertaking provides for renewal, the 
terms for renewal should be consistent with the savings association's 
ability to make any necessary credit assessments prior to renewal; and
    (iii) In the event that a savings association issues an undertaking 
for its own account, the underlying transaction for which it is issued 
must be within the savings association's authority and comply with any 
safety and soundness requirements applicable to that transaction.
    (3) Operational expertise. The savings association should possess 
operational expertise that is commensurate with the sophistication of 
its letter of credit or independent undertaking activities.
    (4) Documentation. The savings association must accurately reflect 
its letters of credit or approved undertakings in its records, including 
any acceptance or deferred payment or other absolute obligation arising 
out of its contingent undertaking.


<R05>
Sec. 560.121  Investment in state housing corporations.

    (a) Any savings association to the extent it has legal authority to 
do so, may make investments in, commitments to invest in, loans to, or

    (a) Definitions. For purposes of this section:

[[Page 157]]

    (1) Adjustable-rate mortgage loan means a mortgage loan, secured by 
property occupied or to be occupied by the borrower, providing for 
adjustments to the interest rate which cause a change in balance, term 
to maturity, or payment levels other than those established by a fixed, 
predetermined schedule at the time of contracting for the loan.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (3) Applicant means a natural person (or persons) making a loan 
application.
    (4) Home means real estate as defined by Sec. 541.14 of this 
chapter, manufactured housing, combinations of homes and business 
property, and farm residences or combinations of farm residences and 
commercial farm real estate.
    (b) Initial disclosures for adjustable-rate mortgage loans. Savings 
associations offering adjustable-rate home loans, except open-end loans, 
with a term of more than one (1) year and secured by property occupied 
or to be occupied by the borrower, shall provide two types of written 
disclosure to prospective borrowers when an application form is provided 
or before the payment of a non-refundable fee, whichever is earlier:
    (1) The booklet titled Consumer Handbook on Adjustable Rate 
Mortgages published by the Office and the Federal Reserve Board, or a 
suitable substitute (Available at the address listed in Sec. 516.1 of 
this chapter.).
    (2) A loan program disclosure for each adjustable-rate home loan 
program in which the consumer expresses an interest. The following 
disclosures, as applicable, shall be provided: <SUP>2</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ A sample disclosure form may be found in the Federal Register 
issue of May 23, 1988 (53 FR 18262) or may be obtained from the Office 
at the address listed in Sec. 516.1 of this chapter.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) The fact that the interest rate, payment, or term of the loan 
can change.
    (ii) The index or formula used in making adjustments, and a source 
of information about the index or formula.
    (iii) An explanation of how the interest rate and payment will be 
determined, including an explanation of how the index is adjusted, such 
as by the use of a margin.
    (iv) A statement that the consumer should ask about the current 
margin value and current interest rate.
    (v) The fact that the interest rate will be discounted, and a 
statement that the consumer should ask about the amount of the interest 
rate discount.
    (vi) The frequency of interest rate and payment changes.
    (vii) Any rules relating to changes in the index, interest rate, 
payment amount, and outstanding loan balance including, for example, an 
explanation of interest rate or payment limitations, negative 
amortization, and interest rate carryover.
    (viii) An historical example, based on a $10,000 loan amount, 
illustrating how payments and the loan balance would have been affected 
by interest rate changes implemented according to the terms of the loan 
program. The example shall be based upon index values beginning in 1977 
and be updated annually until a 15-year history is shown. Thereafter, 
the example shall reflect the most recent 15 years of index values. The 
example shall reflect all significant loan program terms, such as 
negative amortization, interest rate carryover, interest rate discounts, 
and interest rate and payment limitations, that would have been affected 
by the index movement during the period.
    (ix) An explanation of how the consumer may calculate the payments 
for the loan amount to be borrowed based on the most recent payment 
shown in the historical example.
    (x) The maximum interest rate and payment for a $10,000 loan 
originated at the most recent interest rate shown in the historical 
example assuming the maximum periodic increases in rates and payments 
under the program; and the initial interest rate and payment for that 
loan.
    (xi) The fact that the loan program contains a demand feature.
    (xii) The type of information that will be provided in notices of 
adjustments and the timing of such notices.
    (xiii) A statement that disclosure forms are available for the 
creditor's other variable-rate loan programs.

[[Page 158]]

    (c) Adjustment notices. An adjustment to the interest rate with or 
without a corresponding adjustment to the payment in an adjustable-rate 
transaction subject to this section is an event requiring new 
disclosures to the consumer. At least once each year during which an 
interest rate adjustment is implemented without an accompanying payment 
change, and at least 25, but no more than 120, calendar days before a 
payment at a new level is due, the following written disclosures, as 
applicable, must be delivered or placed in the mail:
    (1) The current and prior interest rates.
    (2) The index values upon which the current and prior interest rates 
are based.
    (3) The extent to which the creditor has foregone any increase in 
the interest rate.
    (4) The contractual effects of the adjustment, including the payment 
due after the adjustment is made, and a statement of the loan balance.
    (5) The payment, if different from that referred to in paragraph 
(c)(4) of this section, that would be required to amortize fully the 
loan at the new interest rate over the remainder of the loan term.
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) Maximum interest rate caps. All savings associations making 
adjustable-rate loans, originated on or after December 8, 1987, whether

by specifying in their credit contracts the maximum interest rate that 
may be imposed during the term of the obligation.
    (f) Exception. The disclosures in paragraph (b) of this section are 
not required in connection with the extension of consumer credit as 
defined in Sec. 561.12 of this chapter even if it is secured by a 
borrower-occupied home as long as the home is not the primary security 
for the loan.
    (g) Exempt transactions. This section does not apply to an extension 
of credit primarily for a business, commercial, or agricultural purpose.

the loan is supported by a valid guarantee or insurance; or it is a loan 
where claims have been filed against a solvent estate--then such loan

Sec.
562.1  Regulatory reporting requirements.
562.2  Regulatory reports.
562.4  Audit of savings associations and savings association holding 
          companies.

    Authority:  12 U.S.C. 1463.

    Source:  57 FR 40090, Sept. 2, 1992, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 562.1  Regulatory reporting requirements.

    (a) Authority and scope. This part is issued by the Office of Thrift 
Supervision (OTS) pursuant to section 4(b) and 4(c) of the Home Owners' 
Loan Act (HOLA). It applies to all savings associations regulated by the 
OTS.
    (b) Records and reports--general--(1) Records. Each savings 
association and its affiliates shall maintain accurate and complete 
records of all business transactions. Such records shall support and be 
readily reconcilable to any regulatory reports submitted to the OTS and 
financial reports prepared in accordance with GAAP. The records shall be 
maintained in the United States and be readily accessible for 
examination and other supervisory purposes within 5 business days upon 
request by the OTS, at a location acceptable to the OTS.
    (2) Reports. For purposes of examination by and regulatory reports 
to the OTS and compliance with this chapter, all savings associations 
shall use such forms and follow such regulatory reporting requirements 
as the OTS may require by regulation or otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 562.2  Regulatory reports.

    (a) Definition and scope. This section applies to all regulatory 
reports, as defined herein. A regulatory report is any report that the 
OTS prepares, or is submitted to, or is used by the OTS, to determine 
compliance with its rules and regulations, and to evaluate the safe and 
sound condition and operation of savings associations. The Report of 
Examination and the Thrift Financial Report (TFR) are examples of 
regulatory reports. Regulatory reports are regulatory documents, not 
accounting documents.
    (b) Regulatory reporting requirements--(1) General. The instructions 
to regulatory reports are referred to as ``regulatory reporting 
requirements.'' Regulatory reporting requirements include, but are not 
limited to, the accounting instructions provided in the TFR, guidance 
contained in OTS regulations, bulletins, and examination handbooks, and 
safe and sound practices. Regulatory reporting requirements are not 
limited to the minimum requirements under generally accepted accounting 
principles (GAAP) because of the special supervisory, regulatory, and 
economic policy needs served by such reports. Regulatory reporting by 
savings associations that purports to comply with GAAP shall incorporate 
the GAAP that best reflects the underlying economic substance of the 
transaction at issue. Regulatory reporting requirements shall, at a 
minimum:
    (i) Incorporate GAAP whenever GAAP is the referenced accounting 
instruction for regulatory reports to the Federal banking agencies;
    (ii) Incorporate safe and sound practices contained in OTS 
regulations, bulletins, examination handbooks and instructions to 
regulatory reports. Such safety and soundness requirements shall be no 
less stringent than those applied by the Comptroller of the Currency for 
national banks; and
    (iii) Incorporate additional safety and soundness requirements more 
stringent than GAAP, as the Director may prescribe.
    (2) Exceptions. Regulatory reporting requirements that are not 
consistent with GAAP, if any, are not required to be reflected in 
audited financial statements, including financial statements contained 
in securities filings submitted to the OTS pursuant to the Securities 
and Exchange Act of 1934 or parts 563b, 563d, or 563g of this chapter.
    (3) Compliance. When the OTS determines that a savings association's 
regulatory reports did not conform to regulatory reporting requirements 
in previous reporting periods, the association shall correct its 
regulatory reports in

[[Page 169]]

accordance with the directions of the OTS.


<R05>
Sec. 562.4  Audit of savings associations and savings association holding companies.

    (a) General. The OTS may require, at any time, an independent audit 
of the financial statements of, or the application of procedures agreed 
upon by the OTS to a savings association, savings and loan holding 
company, or affiliate (as defined by 12 CFR 563.41(b)(1)) by qualified 
independent public accountants when needed for any safety and soundness 
reason identified by the Director.
    (b) Audits required for safety and soundness purposes. The OTS 
requires an independent audit for safety and soundness purposes:
    (1) If a savings association has received a composite rating of 3, 4 
or 5, as defined at Sec. 516.3(c) of this chapter; or
    (2) If, as of the beginning of its fiscal year, a savings and loan 
holding company controls savings association subsidiary(ies) with 
aggregate consolidated assets of $500 million or more.
    (c) Procedures. (1) When the OTS requires an independent audit 
because such an audit is needed for safety and soundness purposes, the 
Director shall determine whether the audit was conducted and filed in a 
manner satisfactory to the OTS.
    (2) The Director may waive the independent audit requirement 
described at paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if the Director 
determines that an audit would not provide further information on safety 
and soundness issues relevant to the examination rating.
    (d) Qualifications for independent public accountants. The audit 
shall be conducted by an independent public accountant who:
    (1) Is registered or licensed to practice as a public accountant, 
and is in good standing, under the laws of the state or other political 
subdivision of the United States in which the savings association's or 
holding company's principal office is located;
    (2) Agrees in the engagement letter to provide the OTS with access 
to and copies of any work papers, policies, and procedures relating to 
the services performed;
    (3) Is in compliance with the American Institute of Certified Public 
Accountants' (AICPA) Code of Professional Conduct and meets the 
independence requirements and interpretations of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission and its staff; and
    (4) Has received, or is enrolled in, a peer review program that 
meets guidelines acceptable to the OTS.
    (e) Voluntary audits. When a savings association, savings and loan 
holding company, or affiliate (as defined by 12 CFR 563.41(b)(1)) 
obtains an independent audit voluntarily, it shall be performed only by 
an independent public accountant who satisfies the requirements of 
paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), and (d)(3) of this section.

                   Subpart B--Operation and Structure


<R05>
Sec. 563.22  Merger, consolidation, purchase or sale of assets, or assumption of liabilities.

    (a) No savings association may, without application to and approval 
by the Office:
    (1) Combine with any insured depository institution, if the 
acquiring or resulting institution is to be a savings association; or
    (2) Assume liability to pay any deposit made in, any insured 
depository institution.
    (b)(1) No savings association may, without notifying the Office, as 
provided in paragraph (h)(1) of this section:
    (i) Combine with another insured depository institution where a 
savings association is not the resulting institution; or
    (ii) In the case of a savings association that meets the conditions 
for expedited treatment under Sec. 516.3(a) of this chapter, convert, 
directly or indirectly, to a national or state bank.
    (2) No savings association that does not meet the conditions for 
expedited treatment under Sec. 516.3(a) of this chapter may, directly or 
indirectly, convert to a national or state bank without prior 
application to and approval of the Office, as provided in paragraph 
(h)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (c) No savings association may make any transfer (excluding 
transfers subject to paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section) without 
notice or application to the Office, as provided in paragraph (h)(2) of 
this section. For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``transfer'' 
means purchases or sales of assets or

[[Page 171]]

liabilities in bulk not made in the ordinary course of business 
including, but not limited to, transfers of assets or savings account 
liabilities, purchases of assets, and assumptions of deposit accounts or 
other liabilities, and combinations with a depository institution other 
than an insured depository institution.
    (d)(1) In determining whether to confer approval for a transaction 
under paragraphs (a), (b)(2), or (c) of this section, the Office shall 
take into account the following:
    (i) The capital level of any resulting savings association;
    (ii) The financial and managerial resources of the constituent 
institutions;
    (iii) The future prospects of the constituent institutions;
    (iv) The convenience and needs of the communities to be served;
    (v) The conformity of the transaction to applicable law, regulation, 
and supervisory policies;
    (vi) Factors relating to the fairness of and disclosure concerning 
the transaction, including, but not limited to:
    (A) Equitable treatment. The transaction should be equitable to all 
concerned--savings account holders, borrowers, creditors and 
stockholders (if any) of each savings association--giving proper 
recognition of and protection to their respective legal rights and 
interests. The transaction will be closely reviewed for fairness where 
the transaction does not appear to be the result of arms' length 
bargaining or, in the case of a stock savings association, where 
controlling stockholders are receiving different consideration from 
other stockholders. No finder's or similar fee should be paid to any 
officer, director, or controlling person of a savings association which 
is a party to the transaction.
    (B) Full disclosure. The filing should make full disclosure of all 
written or oral agreements or understandings by which any person or 
company will receive, directly or indirectly, any money, property, 
service, release of pledges made, or other thing of value, whether 
tangible or intangible, in connection with the transaction.
    (C) Compensation to officers. Compensation, including deferred 
compensation, to officers, directors and controlling persons of the 
disappearing savings association by the resulting institution or an 
affiliate thereof should not be in excess of a reasonable amount, and 
should be commensurate with their duties and responsibilities. The 
filing should fully justify the compensation to be paid to such persons. 
The transaction will be particularly scrutinized where any of such 
persons is to receive a material increase in compensation above that 
paid by the disappearing savings association prior to the commencement 
of negotiations regarding the proposed transaction. An increase in 
compensation in excess of the greater of 15% or $10,000 gives rise to 
presumptions of unreasonableness and sale of control. In the case of 
such an increase, evidence sufficient to rebut such presumptions should 
be submitted.
    (D) Advisory boards. Advisory board members should be elected for a 
term not exceeding one year. No advisory board fees should be paid to 
salaried officers or employees of the resulting savings association. The 
filing should describe and justify the duties and responsibilities and 
any compensation paid to any advisory board of the resulting savings 
association that consists of officers, directors or controlling persons 
of the disappearing institution, particularly if the disappearing 
institution experienced significant supervisory problems prior to the 
transaction. No advisory board fees should exceed the director fees paid 
by the resulting savings association. Advisory board fees that are in 
excess of 115 percent of the director fees paid by the disappearing 
savings association prior to commencement of negotiations regarding the 
transaction give rise to presumptions of unreasonableness and sale of 
control unless sufficient evidence to rebut such presumptions is 
submitted. Rebuttal evidence is not required if:
    (1) The advisory board fees do not exceed the fee that advisory 
board members of the resulting institution receive for each monthly 
meeting attended or $150, whichever is greater; or
    (2) The advisory board fees do not exceed $100 per meeting attended 
for disappearing savings associations with assets greater than 
$10,000,000 or $50 per

[[Page 172]]

meeting attended for disappearing savings associations with assets of 
$10,000,000 or less, based on a schedule of 12 meetings per year.
    (E) The accounting and tax treatment of the transaction; and
    (F) Fees paid and professional services rendered in connection with 
the transaction.
    (2) In conferring approval of a transaction under paragraph (a) of 
this section, the Office also will consider the competitive impact of 
the transaction, including whether:
    (i) The transaction would result in a monopoly, or would be in 
furtherance of any monopoly or conspiracy to monopolize or to attempt to 
monopolize the savings association business in any part of the United 
States; or
    (ii) The effect of the transaction on any section of the country may 
be substantially to lessen competition, or tend to create a monopoly, or 
in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the Office 
finds that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are 
clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the 
transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the communities to 
be served.
    (3) Applications and notices filed under this section shall be upon 
forms prescribed by the Office.
    (4) Applications filed under section 5(d)(3) of the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1815(d)(3)) and paragraph (a) of this section 
shall be processed in accordance with the time frames set forth in 
Sec. 516.2 of this chapter, provided that the period for review may be 
extended only if the Office determines that the applicant has failed to 
furnish all requested information or that the information submitted is 
substantially inaccurate, in which case the review period may be 
extended for up to 30 days.
    (e)(1) Unless the OTS finds that it must act immediately in order to 
prevent the probable default of one of the savings associations 
involved, the applicant must publish a public notice of the application 
in accordance with the procedures specified in subpart B of part 516 of 
this chapter. In addition to initial publication, the applicant must 
publish on a weekly basis during the period allowed for furnishing 
reports under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (2) Unless the Office determines that action must be taken 
immediately in order to prevent the probable default of one of the 
savings associations involved, the Office shall request reports from the 
Attorney General, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation on the competitive factors involved in the 
transaction. The reports shall be furnished within thirty calendar days 
of the date on which they are requested, or within ten calendar days of 
such date if the Office advised the Attorney General and the other three 
banking agencies that an emergency exists requiring expeditious action. 
The Office shall immediately notify the Attorney General of any approval 
of a transaction pursuant to this section.
    (3) If the Office has found that it must act immediately to prevent 
the probable default of one of the savings associations involved and the 
reports on the competitive factors have been dispensed with, the 
transaction may be consummated immediately upon approval by the Office 
and any applicable state regulatory authorities. If the Office has 
advised the Attorney General and the other three banking agencies of the 
existence of an emergency requiring expeditious action and has requested 
reports on the competitive factors within ten days, the transaction may 
not be consummated before the fifth calendar day after the date of 
approval by the Office. In all other cases, the transaction may not be 
consummated before the thirtieth calendar day after the date of approval 
by the Office.
    (4) Commenters may submit comments on the application in accordance 
with the procedures set forth in subpart C of part 516 of this chapter, 
except that comments may be submitted at any time during the period 
described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. The OTS may arrange 
informal or formal meetings in accordance with the procedures set forth 
in subpart D of part 516 of this chapter.
    (5) Notice of a proposed account transfer and the option of 
retaining the

[[Page 173]]

account in the transferring savings association shall be furnished to an 
affected accountholder:
    (i) By a savings association transferring account liabilities to an 
institution the accounts of which are not insured by the Savings 
Association Insurance Fund, the Bank Insurance Fund, or the National 
Credit Union Share Insurance Fund; and
    (ii) By any mutual savings association transferring account 
liabilities to a stock form depository institution. The required notice 
shall allow affected accountholders at least 30 days to consider whether 
to retain their accounts in the transferring savings association.
    (f) Automatic approvals by the Office. Applications filed pursuant 
to paragraph (a) of this section shall be deemed to be approved 
automatically by the Office 30 calendar days after the Office sends 
written notice to the applicant that the application is complete, 
unless:
    (1) The acquiring savings association does not meet the criteria for 
expedited treatment under Sec. 516.3(a)(1) of this chapter;
    (2) The OTS recommends the imposition of non-standard conditions 
prior to approving the application;
    (3) The OTS suspends the applicable processing time frames under 
Sec. 516.190 of this chapter;
    (4) The OTS raises objections to the transaction;
    (5) The resulting savings association would be one of the 3 largest 
depository institutions competing in the relevant geographic area where 
before the transaction there were 5 or fewer depository institutions, 
the resulting savings association would have 25 percent or more of the 
total deposits held by depository institutions in the relevant 
geographic area, and the share of total deposits would have increased by 
5 percent or more;
    (6) The resulting savings association would be one of the 2 largest 
depository institutions competing in the relevant geographic area where 
before the transaction there were 6 to 11 depository institutions the 
resulting savings association would have 30 percent or more of the total 
deposits held by depositing institutions in the relevant geographic 
area, and the share of total deposits would have increased by 10 percent 
or more;
    (7) The resulting savings association would be one of the 2 largest 
depository institutions competing in the relevant geographic area where 
before the transaction there were 12 or more depository institutions, 
the resulting savings association would have 35 percent or more of the 
total deposits held by the depository institutions in the relevant 
geographic area, and the share of total deposits would have increased by 
15 percent or more;
    (8) The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) in the relevant geographic 
area was more than 1800 before the transaction, and the increase in the 
HHI used by the transaction would be 50 or more;
    (9) In a transaction involving potential competition, the OTS 
determines that the acquiring savings association is one of three or 
fewer potential entrants into the relevant geographic area;
    (10) The acquiring savings association has assets of $1 billion or 
more and proposes to acquire assets of $1 billion or more;
    (11) The savings association that will be the resulting savings 
association in the transaction has a composite Community Reinvestment 
Act rating of less than satisfactory, or is otherwise seriously 
deficient with respect to the Office's nondiscrimination regulations and 
the deficiencies have not been resolved to the satisfaction of the OTS;
    (12) The transaction involves any supervisory or assistance 
agreement with the Office, the Resolution Trust Corporation, or the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation;
    (13) The transaction is part of a conversion under part 563b of this 
chapter;
    (14) The transaction raises a significant issue of law or policy; or
    (15) The transaction is opposed by any constituent institution or 
contested by a competing acquiror.
    (g) Definitions. (1) The terms used in this section shall have the 
same meaning as set forth in Sec. 552.13(b) of this chapter.
    (2) Insured depository institution. Insured depository institution 
has the same

[[Page 174]]

meaning as defined in section 3(c)(2) of the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Act.
    (3) With regard to paragraph (f) of this section, the term relevant 
geographic area is used as a substitute for relevant geographic market, 
which means the area within which the competitive effects of a merger or 
other combination may be evaluated. The relevant geographic area shall 
be delineated as a county or similar political subdivision, an area 
smaller than a county, or an aggregation of counties within which the 
merging or combining insured depository institutions compete. In 
addition, the Office may consider commuting patterns, newspaper and 
other advertising activities, or other factors as the Office deems 
relevant.
    (h) Special requirements and procedures for transactions under 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section--(1) Certain transactions with no 
surviving savings association. The Office must be notified of any 
transaction under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Such notification 
must be submitted to the OTS at least 30 days prior to the effective 
date of the transaction, but not later than the date on which an 
application relating to the proposed transaction is filed with the 
primary regulator of the resulting institution; the Office may, upon 
request or on its own initiative, shorten the 30-day prior notification 
requirement. Notifications under this paragraph must demonstrate 
compliance with applicable stockholder or accountholder approval 
requirements. Where the savings association submitting the notification 
maintains a liquidation account established pursuant to part 563b of 
this chapter, the notification must state that the resulting institution 
will assume such liquidation account.
    The notification may be in the form of either a letter describing 
the material features of the transaction or a copy of a filing made with 
another Federal or state regulatory agency seeking approval from that 
agency for the transaction under the Bank Merger Act or other applicable 
statute. If the action contemplated by the notification is not completed 
within one year after the Office's receipt of the notification, a new 
notification must be submitted to the Office.
    (2) Other transfer transactions--(i) Expedited treatment. A notice 
in conformity with Sec. 516.3(a)(2) of this chapter may be submitted to 
the Office for any transaction under paragraph (c) of this section, 
provided all constituent savings associations meet the conditions for 
expedited treatment under Sec. 516.3(a) of this chapter. Notices 
submitted under this paragraph shall be deemed approved automatically by 
the Office 30 calendar days after receipt, unless the Office advises the 
applicant in writing prior to the expiration of such period that the 
proposed transaction may not be consummated without the Office's 
approval of an application under paragraphs (h)(2)(ii) or (h)(2)(iii) of 
this section.
    (ii) Standard treatment. An application in conformity with 
Sec. 516.3(b)(2) of this chapter and paragraph (d) of this section must 
be submitted to and approved by the Office by each savings association 
participating in a transaction under paragraph (b)(2) or (c) of this 
section, where any constituent savings association does not meet the 
conditions for expedited treatment under Sec. 516.3(a) of this chapter, 
except as provided in paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section. 
Applications under this paragraph shall be processed in accordance with 
the time frames set forth in Sec. 516.2 of this chapter.
    (iii) Standard treatment for transactions under section 5(d)(3) of 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. An application in conformity with 
Sec. 516.3(b)(2) of this chapter and paragraph (d) of this section must 
be submitted to and approved by the Office by each savings association 
which will survive any transaction under both Sec. 5(d)(3) of the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1815(d)(3)) and paragraph (c) 
of this section, where any constituent savings association does not meet 
the conditions for expedited treatment under Sec. 516.3(a) of this 
chapter. Applications under this paragraph shall be processed in 
accordance with the time frames set forth in Sec. 516.2 of this chapter, 
provided that the period for review may be extended only if the Office 
determines that the applicant has failed to furnish all requested 
information or that the information submitted is substantially 
inaccurate, in which case

[[Page 175]]

the review period may be extended for up to 30 days.

Sec. 563.27  Advertising.

    No savings association shall use advertising (which includes print 
or broadcast media, displays or signs, stationery, and all other 
promotional materials), or make any representation which is inaccurate 
in any particular or which in any way misrepresents its services, 
contracts, investments, or financial condition.

Sec. 563.33  Directors, officers, and employees.

    (a) Directors--(1) Requirements. The composition of the board of 
directors of a savings association must be in accordance with the 
following requirements:
    (i) A majority of the directors must not be salaried officers or 
employees of the savings association or of any subsidiary or (except in 
the case of a savings association having 80% or more of any class of 
voting shares owned by a holding company) any holding company affiliate 
thereof.
    (ii) Not more than two of the directors may be members of the same 
immediate family.
    (iii) Not more than one director may be an attorney with a 
particular law firm.
    (2) Prospective application. In the case of an association whose 
board of directors does not conform with any requirement set forth in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section as of October 5, 1983, this paragraph 
(a) shall not prohibit the uninterrupted service, including re-election 
and re-appointment, of any person serving on the board of directors at 
that date.
    (b) [Reserved]

<R05>
Sec. 563.36  Tying restriction exception.

    (a) Safe harbor for combined-balance discounts. A savings and loan 
holding company or any savings association or any affiliate of either 
may vary the consideration for any product or package of products based 
on a customer's maintaining a combined minimum balance in certain 
products specified by the company varying the consideration (eligible 
products), if:
    (1) That company (if it is a savings association) or a savings 
association affiliate of that company (if it is not a savings 
association) offers deposits, and all such deposits are eligible 
products; and
    (2) Balances in deposits count at least as much as non-deposit 
products toward the minimum balance.
    (b) Limitations on exception. This exception shall terminate upon a 
finding by the OTS that the arrangement is resulting in anti-competitive 
practices. The eligibility of a savings and loan holding company or 
savings association or affiliate of either to operate under this 
exception shall terminate upon a finding by the OTS that its exercise of 
this authority is resulting in anti-competitive practices.
[61 FR 60184, Nov. 27, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 563.39  Employment contracts.

    (a) General. A savings association may enter into an employment 
contract with its officers and other employees only in accordance with 
the requirements of this section. All employment contracts shall be in 
writing and shall be approved specifically by an association's board of 
directors. An association shall not enter into an employment contract 
with any of its officers or other employees if such contract would 
constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. The making of such an 
employment contract would be an unsafe or unsound practice if such 
contract could lead to material financial loss or damage to the 
association or could interfere materially with the exercise by the 
members of its board of directors of their duty or discretion provided 
by law, charter, bylaw or regulation as to the employment or termination 
of employment of an officer or employee of the association. This may 
occur, depending upon the circumstances of the case, where an employment 
contract provides for an excessive term.

[[Page 176]]

    (b) Required provisions. Each employment contract shall provide 
that:
    (1) The association's board of directors may terminate the officer 
or employee's employment at any time, but any termination by the 
association's board of directors other than termination for cause, shall 
not prejudice the officer or employee's right to compensation or other 
benefits under the contract. The officer or employee shall have no right 
to receive compensation or other benefits for any period after 
termination for cause. Termination for cause shall include termination 
because of the officer or employee's personal dishonesty, incompetence, 
willful misconduct, breach of fiduciary duty involving personal profit, 
intentional failure to perform stated duties, willful violation of any 
law, rule, or regulation (other than traffic violations or similar 
offenses) or final cease-and-desist order, or material breach of any 
provision of the contract.
    (2) If the officer or employee is suspended and/or temporarily 
prohibited from participating in the conduct of the association's 
affairs by a notice served under section 8 (e)(3) or (g)(1) of Federal 
Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1818 (e)(3) and (g)(1)) the 
association's obligations under the contract shall be suspended as of 
the date of service unless stayed by appropriate proceedings. If the 
charges in the notice are dismissed, the association may in its 
discretion (i) pay the officer or employee all or part of the 
compensation withheld while its contract obligations were suspended, and 
(ii) reinstate (in whole or in part) any of its obligations which were 
suspended.
    (3) If the officer or employee is removed and/or permanently 
prohibited from participating in the conduct of the association's 
affairs by an order issued under section 8 (e)(4) or (g)(1) of the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1818 (e)(4) or (g)(1)), all 
obligations of the association under the contract shall terminate as of 
the effective date of the order, but vested rights of the contracting 
parties shall not be affected.
    (4) If the savings association is in default (as defined in section 
3(x)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act), all obligations under the 
contract shall terminate as of the date of default, but this paragraph 
(b)(4) shall not affect any vested rights of the contracting parties: 
Provided, that this paragraph (b)(4) need not be included in an 
employment contract if prior written approval is secured from the 
Director or his or her designee.
    (5) All obligations under the contract shall be terminated, except 
to the extent determined that continuation of the contract is necessary 
of the continued operation of the association
    (i) By the Director or his or her designee, at the time the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation or Resolution Trust Corporation enters 
into an agreement to provide assistance to or on behalf of the 
association under the authority contained in 13(c) of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Act; or
    (ii) By the Director or his or her designee, at the time the 
Director or his or her designee approves a supervisory merger to resolve 
problems related to operation of the association or when the association 
is determined by the Director to be in an unsafe or unsound condition.

Any rights of the parties that have already vested, however, shall not 
be affected by such action.

1954, as amended, shall be used to determine plan funding.
    (c) Plan amendment. A plan may be amended to provide reasonable 
annual cost-of-living increases to retired participants: Provided, That
    (1) Any such increase shall be for a period and amount determined by 
the sponsor's board of directors, but in no event shall it exceed the 
annual increase in the Consumer Price Index published by the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics; and
    (2) No increase shall be granted unless (i) anticipated charges to 
net income for future periods have first been found by such board of 
directors to be reasonable and are documented by appropriate resolution 
and supporting analysis; and (ii) the increase will not reduce the 
association's regulatory capital below its regulatory capital 
requirement.
    (d) Termination. The plan shall permit the sponsor's board of 
directors and its successors to terminate such plan. Notice of intent to 
terminate shall be filed with the OTS at least 60 days prior to the 
proposed termination date.
    (e) Records. Each savings association or service corporation 
maintaining a plan not subject to recordkeeping and reporting 
requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, and 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, shall establish and 
maintain records containing the following:
    (1) Plan description;
    (2) Schedule of participants and beneficiaries;
    (3) Schedule of participants and beneficiaries' rights and 
obligations;
    (4) Plan's financial statements; and
    (5) Except for defined contribution plans, an opinion signed by an 
enrolled actuary (as defined by the Employee Retirement Income Security 
Act of 1974) affirming that actuarial assumptions in the aggregate are 
reasonable, take into account the plan's experience and expectations, 
and represent the actuary's best estimate of the plan's projected 
experiences.

application are in accordance with the provisions of this section.
    (b) Eligibility Requirements. The Office will consider and process 
an application for approval of the issuance of mutual capital

    (d) Charter amendment. No application for approval of the issuance 
of mutual capital certificates pursuant to this section may be filed 
unless the amendment to the mutual association's charter, constitution

otherwise be required by applicable law.

capital certificates shall be publicly filed with the OTS.
    (f) Supervisory objection. No application or approval of the

[[Page 184]]

opinion of the Office, the policies, condition, or operation of the 
applicant afford a basis for supervisory objection to the application.
    (g) Limitation on offering period. Following the date of the 
approval of the application by the Office, the association shall have an 
offering period of not more than one year in which to complete the sale 
of the mutual capital certificates issued pursuant to this section. The 
Office may in its discretion extend such offering period if a written 
request showing good cause for such extension is filed with it not later 
than 30 days before the expiration of such offering period or any 
extension thereof.
    (h) Reports. Within 30 days after completion of the sale of mutual 
capital certificates issued pursuant to this section, the association 
shall transmit to the OTS a written report stating the total dollar 
amount of securities sold, and the amount of net proceeds received by 
the association, and within 90 days it shall transmit a written report 
stating the number of purchasers.
    (i) Requirements as to mutual capital certificates--(1) Form of 
certificate. Each mutual capital certificate and any governing agreement 
evidencing a mutual capital certificate issued by an association 
pursuant to this section:
    (i) Shall bear on its face, in bold-face type, the following legend: 
``This security is not a savings account or a deposit and it is not 
insured by the United States or any agency or fund of the United 
States''; and
    (ii) Shall clearly state that the certificate is subject to the 
requirements of Sec. 563.74(i)(2).
    (2) Legal requirements. Mutual capital certificates issued pursuant 
to this section shall:
    (i) Be subordinate to all claims against the association having the 
same priority as savings accounts, savings certificates, debt 
obligations or any higher priority;
    (ii) Not be eligible for use as collateral for any loan made by the 
issuing association;
    (iii) Constitute a claim in liquidation not exceeding the face value 
plus accrued dividends of the certificates, on the general reserves, 
surplus and undivided profits of the association remaining after the 
payment in full of all savings accounts, savings certificates and debt 
obligations;
    (iv) Be entitled to the payment of dividends, which may be fixed, 
variable, participating, or cumulative, or any combination thereof, only 
if, when and as declared by the association's board of directors out of 
funds legally available for that purpose, provided that no dividend may 
be declared or paid without the approval of the Office if such payment 
would cause the association to fail to meet its regulatory capital 
requirement under Sec. 567.2 of this chapter, and provided further that 
no dividend may be paid if such payment would constitute a violation of 
12 U.S.C. 1828(b);
    (v) Not be redeemable, except: (A) Where the dollar weighted average 
term of each issue of mutual capital certificates to be redeemed is 
seven years or more and redemption is to be made pursuant to a 
redemption schedule; (B) in the event of a merger, consolidation or 
reorganization approved by the Office; or (C) where the funds for 
redemption are raised by the issuance of mutual capital certificates 
approved pursuant to this section, or in conjunction with the issuance 
of capital stock pursuant to part 563b of this chapter: Provided, that 
mandatory redemption shall not be required; that mutual capital 
certificates shall not be redeemable on the demand or at the option of 
the holder; and that mutual capital certificates shall not receive, 
benefit from, be credited with or otherwise be entitled to or due 
payments in or for redemption if such payments would cause the 
association to fail to meet its regulatory capital requirement under 
Sec. 567.2 of this chapter; And Provided further, for the purposes of 
this paragraph (i)(2)(v), the ``dollar weighted average term'' of an 
issue of mutual capital certificates shall be the sum of the products 
calculated for each year that the mutual capital certificates in the 
issue have been redeemed or are scheduled to be redeemed. Each product 
shall be calculated by multiplying the number of years of each mutual 
capital certificate of a given term by a fraction, the numerator of 
which shall be the total dollar amount of each mutual capital 
certificate in the issue with the same term and the denominator of

[[Page 185]]

which shall be the total dollar amount of mutual capital certificates in 
the entire issue;
    (vi) Not have preemptive rights;
    (vii) Not have voting rights, except that an association may provide 
for voting rights if:
    (A) The savings association fails to pay dividends for a minimum of 
three consecutive dividend periods, and then the holders of the class or 
classes of mutual capital certificates granted such voting rights, and 
voting as a single class, with one vote for each outstanding 
certificate, may elect by a majority vote a maximum of one-third of the 
association's board of directors, the directors so elected to serve 
until the next annual meeting of the association succeeding the payment 
of all current and past dividends;
    (B) Any merger, consolidation, or reorganization (except in a 
supervisory case) is sought to be authorized, where the issuing 
association is not the survivor, provided that the regulatory capital of 
the resulting association available for payment of any class of mutual 
capital certificate on liquidation is less than the regulatory capital 
available for such class prior to the merger, consolidation, or 
reorganization;
    (C) Action is sought to be authorized which would create any class 
of mutual capital certificates having a preference or priority over an 
outstanding class or classes of mutual capital certificates;
    (D) Any action is sought to be authorized which would adversely 
change the specific terms of any class of mutual capital certificates;
    (E) Action is sought to be authorized which would increase the 
number of a class of mutual capital certificates, or the number of a 
class of mutual capital certificates ranking prior to or on parity with 
another class of mutual capital certificates; or
    (F) Action is sought which would authorize the issuance of an 
additional class or classes of mutual capital certificates without the 
association having met specific financial standards;
    (viii) Not constitute an obligation of the association and shall 
confer no rights which would give rise to any claim of or action for 
default;
    (ix) Not be convertible into any account, security, or interest, 
except that mutual capital certificates may be surrendered in exchange 
for preferred stock issued in connection with the conversion of the 
issuing savings association to the stock form pursuant to part 563b of 
this chapter, provided that the preferred stock shall have substantially 
the same voting rights, designations, preferences and relative, 
participating optional, or other special rights, and qualifications, 
limitations, and restrictions, as the mutual capital certificates 
exchanged for the preferred stock.
    (x) Provide for charging of losses after the exhaustion of all other 
items in the regulatory capital account.

Sec. 563.81  Issuance of subordinated debt securities and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock.

    (a) General--(1) Savings associations receiving standard treatment. 
No savings association subject to standard treatment of its 
applications, as defined at Sec. 516.3(b) of this chapter, shall issue 
subordinated debt securities or mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 
includable in regulatory capital pursuant to this section or amend the 
terms of such securities unless it has obtained the written approval of 
the OTS. Approval of the issuance under this section, in order to meet 
the requirements of Sec. 567.5 of this chapter, may be obtained either 
before or after the securities are issued. No approval shall be granted 
unless issuance of the securities and the form and manner of filing of 
the application are in accordance with the provisions of this section.
    (2) Savings associations receiving expedited treatment. No savings 
association eligible for expedited treatment, as defined at 
Sec. 516.3(a) of this chapter, shall issue subordinated debt securities 
or mandatorily redeemable preferred stock pursuant to this section for 
inclusion in regulatory capital or amend the terms of such securities 
unless it provides notice to the OTS, and such notice contains a 
statement of the association's intent to include such securities in 
regulatory capital. Notice should be made 30 days in advance of an 
issuance of subordinated debt securities or mandatorily redeemable 
preferred stock under this section, if the association intends to 
qualify such securities or stock as supplementary capital under 
Sec. 567.5(b)(2) of this chapter. Notice may be made either before or 
after such securities are issued, but will only be includable in 
regulatory capital (to the extent permitted by Sec. 567.5(b) of this 
chapter) if the issuance of the securities and the filing of the notice 
are in accordance with the provisions of this section and the savings 
association certifies, in writing, to the Office that all regulatory 
requirements have been met. The Office reserves the right to determine 
after the 30-day notice period has expired that the issuance does not 
comply with the requirements of this section or those of Part 567 for 
inclusion in capital.
    (b) Eligibility requirements. In determining whether an issuance of 
subordinated debt securities or mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 
is includable in the regulatory capital of a savings association 
pursuant to this section, the OTS will consider the following factors:
    (1) Whether the issuance of such securities by the savings 
association is authorized by applicable law and regulation and is not 
inconsistent with any provision of the savings association's charter or 
bylaws. Proof of such provision shall be submitted with the notice or 
application;
    (2)(i) Whether, in the opinion of the OTS the overall policies, 
condition and operation of the savings association do not afford a basis 
for supervisory objection to the application or notice. The OTS shall 
establish guidelines that shall identify supervisory bases that may be 
used to object to the inclusion of specific subordinated debt and 
preferred stock issuances as regulatory capital. Such guidelines shall 
constitute illustrative but not exclusive

[[Page 188]]

bases for supervisory objection to subordinated debt and mandatorily 
redeemable preferred stock applications and notices. Such bases for 
supervisory objection may include, but are not limited to instances 
where:
    (A) Regulatory capital, without regard to the amount of any 
subordinated debt and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock to be 
included in regulatory capital, does not meet the requirements of 
Sec. 567.2 of this chapter;
    (B) Actual and expected losses have not been offset by specific and 
general valuation allowances to the extent required pursuant to 
Sec. 563.160 and Sec. 563.172 of this part; and
    (C) Actual and anticipated income from operations, after 
distribution of earnings to the holders of savings accounts, payment of 
dividends on outstanding equity securities and payment of interest on 
borrowings but before income taxes, is not demonstrably sufficient for 
payment of dividends and redemption price, discount and related expenses 
of the proposed issuance.
    (ii) The OTS may modify the guidelines in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of 
this section from time to time, as appropriate, and any such changes 
shall be effective for those applications and notices filed after the 
date of the changes to the guidelines and for those applications and 
notices submitted to the OTS but not yet deemed ``complete.''
    (3) Whether the issuance of such securities by the savings 
association in the transaction and any related transactions will result 
in a transfer of risk from the Savings Association Insurance Fund or the 
Bank Insurance Fund, as the case may be, to parties other than savings 
associations. In this connection, the issuance of subordinated debt 
securities shall not be deemed to result in a sufficient transfer of 
risk if such securities or any indenture or related agreement pursuant 
to which they are issued provides for events of default or includes 
other provisions that could result in a mandatory prepayment of 
principle by declaration or otherwise, other than events of default 
arising out of the obligor's failure to make timely payment of interest 
and principal, its failure to comply with reasonable financial, 
operating and maintenance covenants of a type that are customarily 
included in indentures relating to publicly offered issues of debt 
securities, and events of default relating to certain events of 
bankruptcy or insolvency, receivership and similar events.
    (c) Form of application or notice; supporting information. 
Applications subject to standard treatment under Sec. 516.3(b) of this 
chapter, or notices eligible for expedited treatment under Sec. 516.3(a) 
of this chapter, pursuant to this section, shall be in the form 
prescribed by the OTS. The form of application and instructions for a 
savings association subject to standard treatment, and instructions for 
a notice by a savings association subject to expedited treatment, may be 
obtained from the OTS. Information and exhibits shall be furnished in 
support of an application or notice in accordance with the applicable 
instructions, setting forth all of the terms and provisions relating to 
the proposed issuance and showing that all of the requirements of this 
section have been or will be met.
    (d) Requirements as to securities. Subordinated debt securities and 
mandatorily redeemable preferred stock issued pursuant to this section 
shall meet all of the following requirements unless one or more of such 
requirements, not including paragraphs (d)(1)(i)(A) and (d)(1)(ii) of 
this section which are not eligible for waiver, are waived by the OTS:
    (1) Form of certificate. Each certificate evidencing subordinated 
debt or mandatorily redeemable preferred stock issued by a savings 
association pursuant to this section shall:
    (i) Bear on its face, in bold-face type, the following legends:
    (A) ``This security is not a savings account or deposit and it is 
not insured by the United States or any agency or fund of the United 
States''; and
    (B) ``Absent prior written approval by the Office, this security is 
not eligible for purchase by any savings association or a corporate 
affiliate thereof, except that this security may be purchased by a 
corporate affiliate of the issuer or by any diversified savings and loan 
holding company and any non-savings association subsidiary thereof.''
    (ii) Clearly state that the security--

[[Page 189]]

    (A) Is subordinated on liquidation, as to principal, interest, and 
premium, if any, to all claims (including post-default interest) against 
the savings association having the same priority as savings account 
holders or any higher priority;
    (B) Is unsecured by the assets of the issuing association, or any of 
its affiliates; and
    (C) Is not eligible as collateral for any loan by the issuing 
association.
    (iii) In connection only with a certificate evidencing subordinated 
debt, state or refer to a document stating the terms under which the 
issuing savings association may prepay the obligation, which shall 
include at least the right to prepay without premium or other penalty 
during the fifteen months immediately prior to the maturity date;
    (iv) State or refer to a document stating that, in connection with a 
certificate evidencing subordinated debt, no voluntary prepayment of 
principal shall be made and that no payment of principal shall be 
accelerated and, in connection with a certificate evidencing mandatorily 
redeemable preferred stock, no voluntary redemption, other than 
scheduled redemptions, shall be made without the approval of the OTS if 
the savings association is failing to meet its regulatory capital 
requirements under part 567 of this chapter or, if after giving effect 
to such payment, the association would fail to meet such regulatory 
capital requirements;
    (v) State the limitations upon payment of interest or dividends, as 
appropriate imposed by 12 U.S.C. 1828(b); and
    (vi) In connection only with a certificate evidencing subordinated 
debt, set forth, in the certificate and the purchase agreement or 
indenture, precisely the following statement:

    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this certificate (or in 
any related document); (A) if the FDIC shall be appointed receiver for 
the issuer of this certificate (the ``issuer'') and in its capacity as 
such shall cause the issuer to merge with or into another financial 
institution, or in such capacity shall sell or otherwise convey part or 
all of the assets of the issuer to another financial institution or 
shall arrange for the assumption of less than all of the liabilities of 
the issuer by one or more other financial institutions, the FDIC shall 
have no obligation, either in its capacity as receiver or in its 
corporate capacity, to contract for or to otherwise arrange for the 
assumption of the obligation represented by this certificate in whole or 
in part by any financial institution or institutions which results from 
any such merger or which has purchased or otherwise acquired from the 
FDIC as receiver for the issuer, any of the assets of the issuer, or 
which, pursuant to any arrangement with the FDIC, has assumed less than 
all of the liabilities of the issuer. To the extent that obligations 
represented by this certificate have not been assumed in full by a 
financial institution with or into which the issuer may have been 
merged, as described in this paragraph (A), and/or by one or more 
financial institutions which have succeeded to all or a portion of the 
assets of the issuer, or which have assumed a portion but not all of the 
liabilities of the issuer as a result of one or more transactions 
entered into by the FDIC as receiver for the issuer, then the holder of 
this certificate shall be entitled to payments on this obligation in 
accordance with the procedures and priorities set forth in any 
applicable receivership regulations or in orders of the FDIC relating to 
such receivership.
    (B) In the event that the obligation represented by this certificate 
is assumed in full by another financial institution, which shall succeed 
by merger or otherwise to substantially all of the assets and the 
business of the issuer, or which shall by arrangement with the FDIC 
assume all or a portion of the liabilities of the issuer, and payment or 
provision for payment shall have been made in respect of all matured 
installments of interests upon the certificates together with all 
matured installments of principal on such certificates which shall have 
become due otherwise than by acceleration, then any default caused by 
the appointment of a receiver for the issuer shall be deemed to have 
been cured, and any declaration consequent upon such default declaring 
the principal and interest on the certificate to be immediately due and 
payable shall be deemed to have been rescinded.
    (C) This security is not eligible to be purchased or held by any 
savings association or corporate affiliate thereof except that this 
security may be purchased or held by a corporate affiliate of the issuer 
or by a diversified savings and loan holding company and its non-savings 
association subsidiaries. The issuer of this security may not recognize 
on its transfer books any transfer made to a savings association or any 
corporate affiliate thereof (except as provided in the preceding 
sentence) and will not be obligated to make any payments of principal or 
interest on this security if the owner of this security is a savings 
association or any corporate affiliate thereof (except as provided in 
the preceding sentence).


[[Page 190]]


    (2) Limitation as to term. No subordinated debt security or 
mandatorily redeemable preferred stock issued by a savings association 
pursuant to this section shall have an original period to maturity or 
required redemption of less than seven years. During the first six years 
that such a security is outstanding, the total of all required sinking 
fund payments, other required prepayments, required purchase-fund 
payments, required reserve allocations and required redemptions with 
respect to the portion of such six years as have elapsed shall at no 
time exceed the original principal amount or original redemption price, 
thereof multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number 
of years that have elapsed since the issuance of the security and the 
denominator of which is the number of years covered by the original 
period to maturity or required redemption.
    (3) Limitations on sale to certain associations. (i) No savings 
association may sell any subordinated debt securities issued pursuant to 
this section to a Federal Home Loan Bank or, except with prior written 
approval of the Office in a supervisory case, to the FDIC; and
    (ii) Without the prior written approval of the Office, no savings 
association may sell, either directly or indirectly through an 
underwriter or otherwise, any subordinated debt securities issued 
pursuant to this section to a savings association or any corporate 
affiliate thereof, except that a savings association may sell such 
securities to its corporate affiliates or to a diversified savings and 
loan holding company and its non-savings association subsidiaries.
    (4) Indenture. An issuer must use an indenture, as described herein, 
for subordinated debt securities offered pursuant to this section. Such 
an indenture must provide for the appointment of a trustee other than 
the obligor or an affiliate of the obligor (as defined in 12 CFR 583.2) 
and provide for the collective enforcement of the rights and remedies of 
the security holders, if the aggregate amount of debt securities 
``publicly offered'' (sales in a private non-public offering as defined 
in 12 CFR 563g.4 are excluded) and sold by a single obligor in any 
consecutive twelve month period exceeds $2,000,000 and/or $5,000,000 in 
any consecutive thirty-six month period.
    (e) [Reserved]
    (f) Additional requirements. The Office may impose on the savings 
association such requirements or conditions with regard to the 
securities or the offering or issuance thereof as it may deem necessary 
or desirable for the protection of purchasers, the savings association, 
the Office, or the Savings Association Insurance Fund or the Bank 
Insurance Fund, as the case may be.
    (g) Limitation on offering period. Following the date of approval of 
an application by a savings association subject to standard treatment by 
the OTS, or the earlier of the date of non-objection by the OTS of a 
notice by a savings association eligible for expedited treatment or 30 
days after submission of a notice by such a savings association, unless 
the OTS has rejected such notice or issued a request for additional 
information on such notice, the association shall have an offering 
period of not more than one year in which to complete the sale of the 
subordinated debt securities or mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 
issued pursuant to this section. The Office may in its discretion extend 
such offering period if a written request showing good cause for such 
extension is filed with it not later than 30 days before the expiration 
of such offering period or any previous extension thereof.
    (h) Reports. Within 30 days after completion of the sale of the 
subordinated debt securities or mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 
issued pursuant to this section, the savings association shall transmit 
a written report to the OTS stating the number of purchases, the total 
dollar amount of securities sold, and the amount of net proceeds 
received by the savings association. The association's report shall 
clearly state the amount of subordinated debt or mandatorily redeemable 
preferred stock, net of all expenses, that the association intends to be 
counted as regulatory capital.
    (i)--(j) [Reserved]
    (k) Conditions of approval and acceptance for subordinated debt and 
mandatorily redeemable preferred stock

redeemable preferred stock applications and notices shall be subject to

required to be filed with the OTS pursuant to 12 CFR 563g.2, and where 
such offering circular has not yet been declared effective prior to the 
date of approval of or nonobjection to the subordinated debt or 
preferred stock application or notice, the offering circular in the form 
declared effective shall not disclose any material adverse information 
concerning the savings association's business, operations, prospects, or 
financial condition not disclosed in the latest form of offering 
circular filed as an exhibit to the application or notice;
    (2) The savings association shall submit to the OTS no later than 30 
days from the completion of the sale of the securities, certification of 
compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in connection with 
the offering, issuance, and sale of the securities;

savings association that states that to the best of his or her 
knowledge, none of the securities issued pursuant to the subject 
application or notice were sold to any association whose accounts are 
insured by the Savings Association Insurance Fund, or a corporate 
affiliate thereof, except as permitted by 12 CFR 563.81;
    (4) That as of the date of approval or nonobjection, there have been

    (i) The proposed amendment modifies or is inconsistent with any 
provision of the securities, or the indenture that is required to be 
included therein by the OTS's regulations as may then be in effect or 
would result in a transfer of risk to the savings association or the 
Savings Association Insurance Fund or the Bank Insurance Fund, as 
appropriate; and
    (ii) All or a portion of the proceeds from the issuance and sale of 
the securities would continue to be included in the regulatory capital 
of the savings association following adoption of the amendment;
    (6) The savings association shall submit to the OTS promptly after

indenture, made after approval or nonobjection, and if prior approval of 
or nonobjection to such amendment was not obtained, shall also state the 
reason(s) such prior approval or nonobjection was not required; and
    (7) Before any offers or sales of the securities are made on the 
premises of the association or its affiliates, the savings association 
shall submit to the OTS a set of policies and procedures for such sale 
of the securities satisfactory to the OTS.

Sec. 563.84  Transfer and repurchase of government securities.

    (a) A savings association shall not issue repurchase agreement 
obligations in denominations under $100,000 with a maturity of 90 days 
or more evidencing an indebtedness arising from a transfer of direct 
obligations of, or obligations that are fully guaranteed as to principal 
and interest by, the United States or any agency thereof that the 
savings association is obligated to repurchase, unless such obligations 
are issued to financial institutions the accounts or deposits of which 
are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or to a broker 
or dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

[[Page 192]]

    (b) Any repurchase agreement obligation under $100,000 with a 
maturity of less than 90 days shall meet the following requirements.
    (1) Legend. Each repurchase agreement and all advertisements and 
offering documents relating to repurchase agreements shall state, on 
their face, in plainly legible form, the following legend:

    This obligation is not a savings account or a deposit and is not 
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

    (2) Prohibited representations. A savings association issuing 
repurchase agreements shall not use in its agreements, advertisements, 
or offering documents the terms ``guaranteed,'' ``no risk,'' 
``account,'' ``deposit,'' ``withdraw'' or other terms which imply that 
the repurchase agreement is insured or guaranteed by the United States 
government, an agency of the United States government, or any third 
party; or the term ``fund'' or other terms which imply that the 
repurchase agreement is an interest in an investment company.
    (3) Security interest. The interest of a repurchase agreement 
purchaser in the security or securities underlying the repurchase 
agreement shall constitute a perfected security interest under 
applicable state law.
    (4) Value of collateral. The market value of the security or 
securities underlying a repurchase agreement shall be at least equal to 
the principal amount of the issuing savings association's repurchase 
agreement obligation as of a date certain in each succeeding month of 
the original or renewed term of the repurchase agreement.
    (5) Disclosure. A savings association issuing repurchase agreements 
to the public shall provide each prospective repurchase agreement 
purchaser with an offering document which shall contain full and 
accurate disclosure of all material information regarding the repurchase 
agreement and the issuing savings association. Any material change in 
any of the material representations set forth in the offering document 
shall be reflected in a revised offering document that shall be provided 
to purchasers before any renewal or automatic renewal of a repurchase 
agreement may be effected. A savings association that has a regulatory 
capital deficiency under paragraph (b)(7) of this section shall be 
subject to the requirements of part 563g of this chapter, except that 
the following financial statements may be substituted for those required 
to be included in an offering circular required under part 563g of this 
chapter:
    (i) The savings association's audited statements of condition and 
operations for its last fiscal year prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of Sec. 563c.1 of this chapter;
    (ii) On a comparative basis, the savings association's latest 
unaudited statement of condition for the quarter ending within 135 days 
of any sale, renewal, or automatic renewal of a repurchase agreement, 
and an unaudited statement of operations for the period then ended, 
prepared in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 563c.1 of this 
chapter; and
    (iii) The savings association's latest monthly financial report 
filed with the Office.
    (6) Renewal; notice of applicable interest rates. The maximum term 
of a repurchase agreement shall be 89 days. Unless otherwise provided 
for by the terms of a repurchase agreement, automatic renewals effected 
within an 89-day period from the date of execution, renewal, or 
automatic renewal of a repurchase agreement shall not be deemed to 
constitute renewals or automatic renewals under paragraph (b) of this 
section. Repurchase agreements may be automatically renewed for any 
period not exceeding 89 days for each automatic renewal pursuant only to 
the written agreement between the purchaser and the issuing savings 
association that the repurchase agreement may be automatically renewed 
at the option of the issuing savings association in the absence of the 
oral or written instruction of the purchaser that the repurchase 
agreement shall not be renewed. Savings associations which provide for 
the automatic renewal of repurchase agreements shall provide and notify 
each retail repurchase agreement purchaser of a means to determine the 
current rates of interest. Repurchase agreements may not be

[[Page 193]]

automatically renewed by a savings association which has a regulatory 
capital deficiency under paragraph (b)(7) of this section.
    (7) Eligibility requirements. A savings association that issues or 
has outstanding repurchase agreements issued pursuant to paragraph (b) 
of this section shall calculate its total capital on a monthly basis in 
accordance with part 567 of this chapter. A savings association that 
does not have total capital equal to the sum of one percent of all 
liabilities of the savings association, plus an amount equal to 20 
percent of the savings association's assets classified under 
Sec. 563.160 of this part, shall not issue or renew repurchase 
agreements under paragraph (b) of this section unless it meets the 
following additional requirements:
    (i) Within 45 days after the determination of a regulatory capital 
deficiency under paragraph (b)(7) of this section, the savings 
association shall file with the OTS pursuant to Sec. 516.1 of this 
chapter and shall continue to file thereafter on a current basis for as 
long as the regulatory capital deficiency shall exist, the following:
    (A) Three copies of an opinion of independent legal counsel that the 
interest of repurchase agreement purchasers in the security or 
securities underlying the repurchase agreements constitutes a perfected 
security interest under applicable state law; and
    (B) The offering document required under paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section.
    (ii) Within 45 days after the determination of a regulatory capital 
deficiency under paragraph (b)(7) of this section, and thereafter on a 
date certain in each succeeding week of the original or renewed term of 
the repurchase agreement for as long as the regulatory capital 
deficiency shall exist, the market value of the savings association's 
security or securities underlying a repurchase agreement shall be at 
least equal to 105 percent of the principal amount of the issuing 
savings association's repurchase agreement obligation, plus accrued 
interest.
    (iii) A savings association which has a regulatory capital 
deficiency under paragraph (b)(7) of this section shall not renew an 
outstanding repurchase agreement unless it provides the purchaser with 
the disclosure document required under paragraph (b)(5) of this section 
and the purchaser thereafter affirmatively elects to renew the 
repurchase agreement.

<R05>
Sec. 563.133  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 563.134  Capital distributions.

    (a) Definitions--(1) Capital distribution means:
    (i) Any dividend paid or other distribution in cash or in kind 
(valued and accounted for in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles) made on or with respect to any shares of an 
association, but not including a dividend consisting of shares of the 
association;
    (ii) Any payment made by an association to repurchase, redeem, 
retire or otherwise acquire any of its shares;
    (iii) Other distributions charged against the capital accounts of an 
association;
    (iv) Any payments to shareholders of an association by an acquiring 
association to acquire ownership of the association, other than 
distributions of shares of the acquiring association; and
    (v) Other types of transactions determined by the Office to entail 
the payout of capital by an association.
    (2) Capital means total capital as defined under Sec. 567.5(c) of 
this chapter.
    (3) Capital requirement means an association's capital requirement 
under part 567 of this chapter.
    (4) Minimum capital requirement means an association's tangible 
capital, leverage ratio and risk-based capital requirements as required 
by Sec. 567.2 of this chapter, as modified to reflect any individual 
minimum capital requirement applicable to the association.
    (5) Net income means an association's net income computed in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

[[Page 194]]

    (6) Shares means common and preferred stock; and any options, 
warrants, or other rights for the acquisition of such stock. This term 
does not include convertible debt securities prior to their conversion 
into common or preferred stock or other securities that are not equity 
securities at the time of a capital distribution. The term ``share'' 
does include:
    (i) Convertible securities upon their conversion into common or 
preferred stock; and
    (ii) Securities structured for the purpose of evading the 
restrictions on capital distributions in this section.
    (7) Surplus capital ratio means the percentage by which an 
association's capital-to-assets ratio exceeds the ratio of its capital 
requirement to its assets.
    (8) Tier 1 association means an association that has capital 
immediately prior to, and on a pro forma basis after giving effect to, a 
proposed capital distribution that is equal to or greater than the 
amount of its capital requirement.
    (9) Tier 2 association means an association that has capital 
immediately prior to, and on a pro forma basis after giving effect to, a 
proposed capital distribution that is equal to or in excess of its 
minimum capital requirement, but that is less than the amount of its 
capital requirement.
    (10) Tier 3 association means an association that has capital 
immediately prior to, or on a pro forma basis after giving effect to, a 
proposed capital distribution that is less than the amount of its 
minimum capital requirement.
    (b) Limits on capital distributions--(1) Tier 1 Association. (i) A 
tier 1 association is authorized to make capital distributions during a 
calendar year up to the higher of:
    (A) 100 percent of its net income to date during the calendar year 
plus the amount that would reduce by one-half its surplus capital ratio 
at the beginning of the calendar year; or
    (B) 75 percent of its net income over the most recent four-quarter 
period.
    (ii) A tier 1 association shall not make capital distributions in 
excess of the foregoing limit except in accordance with the notice and 
opportunity for objection process provided by paragraph (e) of this 
section.
    (2) Tier 2 Association. A tier 2 association is authorized without 
the need for approval by the Office to make capital distributions in 
accordance with the following schedule:
    (i) If an association's current capital satisfies the risk-based 
capital standard that would be applicable to it as of January 1, 1993, 
computed based on its current portfolio, it may make capital 
distributions up to 75 percent of its net income over the most recent 
four-quarter period;
    (ii) If an association's current capital satisfies the risk-based 
capital standard that would be applicable to it on January 1, 1991, 
computed based on its current portfolio, it may make capital 
distributions up to 50 percent of its net income over the most recent 
four-quarter period;
    (iii) If an association's current capital satisfies its current 
risk-based capital requirement, the association may make capital 
distributions up to 25% of net income over the most recent four-quarter 
period; and
    (iv) In computing an association's current permissible amount of 
capital distributions, an association must deduct the amount of capital 
distributions that it has previously made during the most recent four-
quarter period.

A tier 2 association shall not make capital distributions in excess of 
these limits except in accordance with the prior written approval 
process provided in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (3) Tier 3 association. A tier 3 association is not authorized to 
make any capital distributions:
    (i) Unless it receives prior written approval granted pursuant to 
paragraph (e) of this section; or
    (ii) In the case of an association operating in compliance with an 
approved capital plan, the capital distribution is consistent with the 
association's capital plan. A tier 3 association may submit a separate 
request for authorization to make capital distributions, or may make 
such request as part of another request or application that is related 
to the capital distribution. In the case of such a combined filing, 
however, the request for authorization to make capital distribution must 
be clearly identified as such.

[[Page 195]]

    (4) The Office may prohibit any capital distribution otherwise 
permitted under this section upon a determination that the making of a 
capital distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. 
Among the circumstances posing such risk would be a capital distribution 
by a tier 1 or tier 2 association whose capital is decreasing because of 
substantial losses.
    (5) An association meeting the tier 1 capital criteria but that has 
been notified that it is in need of more than normal supervision shall 
be treated as a tier 2 or tier 3 association, unless the Office 
determines that such treatment is not necessary to ensure the 
association's safe and sound operation. The Regional Director shall have 
discretion to determine whether to treat the association as a tier 2 or 
tier 3 association for this purpose, and if treated as a tier 2 
association, to establish which subset of tier 2 standards will be 
applicable to that association.
    (6) No association may make a capital distribution prohibited by any 
statute or regulation, including but not limited to Sec. 563b.3(g) of 
this chapter, or prohibited by any agreement entered into by the 
association with the Office (or its predecessor agencies) or the FDIC, 
unless:
    (i) With respect to Sec. 563b.3(g) of this chapter, approval is 
granted under part 563b of this chapter; or
    (ii) With respect to other limitations, prior approval is granted 
pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.
    (c) Notice or approval of capital distributions. An association must 
provide OTS with 30-day advance written notice of all proposed capital 
distributions whether or not supervisory approval is required under this 
section. For capital distributions requiring approval under this 
section, an association shall provide this prior notification by 
submission of a written application to make such capital distributions. 
A separate notice or application is not necessary if a notice or 
application providing sufficient information to the Regional Director is 
required under other Office regulations for the making of the proposed 
capital distribution. In such instance, the standards of this section 
shall be used as part of the criteria for determining the 
appropriateness of and appropriate amount of capital distributions to 
permit in approving, not disapproving, or conditioning the other 
application. An association has the burden of stating clearly that the 
notice or application submitted for other purposes is also serving as 
its notice or application for purposes of this section. Associations may 
seek approval or provide notice of prospective capital distributions by 
submitting schedules of such prospective capital distributions in 
accordance with supervisory guidance on such procedures.
    (d) Corporate reorganizations. The tiered limits set forth above in 
paragraph (b) of this section shall be applicable to any direct or 
indirect distributions of capital to affiliates, including those in 
connection with corporate reorganizations.
    (e) Supervisory action. (1) In determining whether to object to 
capital distributions in excess of the safe-harbor amount under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Office will evaluate whether the 
exception would be inconsistent with the safe and sound operation of the 
tier 1 association. In determining whether to approve capital 
distributions in excess of the safe-harbor amounts under paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section, the Office will evaluate whether the exception 
would affirmatively promote the safe and sound operation of the tier 2 
association. The Office also may authorize a capital distribution by a 
tier 3 association under paragraph (b)(3) of this section upon a 
compelling showing that such a capital distribution would affirmatively 
promote the safe and sound operation of the tier 3 association. A factor 
that would be regarded favorably by the Office in deciding upon 
applications to make capital distributions above the limits set in 
paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section is whether an 
association will be making additional equity security issuances that 
would raise an association's capital level and, that overall with any 
attendant capital distributions, would have a beneficial effect on the 
safe and sound operation of the association. Such authorization may be 
granted separately, or in conjunction with approval of a related 
submission or application, such as a capital plan or

[[Page 196]]

acquisition of control filing. An application for such supervisory 
approval under paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section shall set 
forth all information determined sufficient for supervisory purposes and 
shall substantiate why the requested capital distribution should be 
permitted under the applicable criteria for its tier.
    (2) The requirements of this section shall supersede the provisions 
of agreements or conditions to approved applications controlling 
associations' capital distributions that were less stringent than the 
restrictions imposed under this rule.
    (3) An association subject to restrictions under an agreement or 
application condition that are more stringent than the restrictions 
imposed by this rule may submit a written notice to OTS seeking to be 
subject to this rule. The Office within 30 days of receipt of the notice 
will evaluate the notice and make a determination of whether the facts 
initially warranting imposition of the more stringent agreement or 
condition warrant the continuation of those restrictions or if the 
provisions of this section should apply to the association.

<R05>
Sec. 563.161  Management and financial policies.

    (a) For the protection of its account holders and other savings 
associations each savings association and service corporation thereof 
shall maintain safe and sound management and shall pursue financial 
policies that are safe and consistent with economical home financing and 
the purposes of federal savings associations and are appropriate to 
their respective types of operations; in implementing this regulation 
the Office will take into consideration that service corporations may be 
authorized to engage in activities which involve a higher degree of risk 
than do activities permitted to savings associations.
    (b) Compensation to officers, directors, and employees of each 
savings association and its service corporations shall not be in excess 
of that which is reasonable and commensurate with their duties and 
responsibilities. Former officers, directors, and employees of savings 
association or its service corporation who regularly perform services 
therefor under consulting contracts are employees thereof for purposes 
of this paragraph (b).


<R05>
Sec. 563.170  Examinations and audits; appraisals; establishment and maintenance of records.

    (a) Examinations and audits. Each savings association and affiliate 
thereof shall be examined periodically, and may be examined at any time, 
by the Office, with appraisals when deemed advisable, in accordance with 
general policies from time to time established by the Office. The costs, 
as computed by the Office, of any examinations made by it, including 
office analysis, overhead, per diem, travel expense, other supervision 
by the Office, and other indirect costs, shall be paid by the savings 
associations examined, except that in the case of service corporations 
of Federal savings associations the cost of examinations, as determined 
by the Office, shall be paid by the service corporations. Payments shall 
be made in accordance with a schedule of annual assessments based upon 
each savings association's total assets and of rates for examiner time 
in amounts determined by the Office.
    (b) Appraisals. (1) Unless otherwise ordered by the Office, 
appraisal of real estate by the Office in connection with any 
examination or audit of a savings association, affiliate, or service 
corporation shall be made by an appraiser, or by appraisers, selected by 
the Office's Regional Director of the Region in which such savings 
association is located. The cost of such appraisal shall promptly be 
paid by such savings association, affiliate, or service corporation 
direct to such appraiser or appraisers upon receipt by the savings 
association, affiliate, or service corporation of a statement of such 
cost as approved by such Regional Director. A copy of the report of each 
appraisal made by the Office pursuant to any of the foregoing provisions 
of this section

[[Page 197]]

shall be furnished to the savings association, affiliate, or service 
corporation, as appropriate within a reasonable time, not to exceed 90 
days, following the completion of such appraisals and the filing of a 
report thereof by the appraiser, or appraisers, with such Regional 
Director.
    (2) The Office may obtain at any time, at its expense, such 
appraisals of any of the assets, including the security therefor, of a 
savings association, affiliate, or service corporation as the Office 
deems appropriate.
    (c) Establishment and maintenance of records. To enable the Office 
to examine savings associations and affiliates and audit savings 
associations, affiliates, and service corporations pursuant to the 
provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, each savings association, 
affiliate, and service corporation shall establish and maintain such 
accounting and other records as will provide an accurate and complete 
record of all business it transacts. This includes, without limitation, 
establishing and maintaining such other records as are required by 
statute or any other regulation to which the savings association, 
affiliate, or service corporation is subject. The documents, files, and 
other material or property comprising said records shall at all times be 
available for such examination and audit wherever any of said records, 
documents, files, material, or property may be.
    (d) Change in location of records. A savings association shall not 
transfer the location of any of its general accounting or control 
records, or the maintenance thereof, from its home office to a branch or 
service office, or from a branch or service office to its home office or 
to another branch or service office unless prior to the date of transfer 
its board of directors has:
    (1) By resolution authorized the transfer or maintenance and;
    (2) Sent a certified copy of the resolution to the Regional Director 
of the OTS Region in which the principal office of the savings 
association is located.
    (e) Use of data processing services for maintenance of records. A 
savings association which determines to maintain any of its records by 
means of data processing services shall so notify the Regional Director 
of the Region in which the principal office of such savings association 
is located, in writing, at least 90 days prior to the date on which such 
maintenance of records will begin. Such notification shall include 
identification of the records to be maintained by data processing 
services and a statement as to the location at which such records will 
be maintained. Any contract, agreement, or arrangement made by a savings 
association pursuant to which data processing services are to be 
performed for such savings association shall be in writing and shall 
expressly provide that the records to be maintained by such services 
shall at all times be available for examination and audit.

    (a) General. The OTS examines savings associations pursuant to 
authority conferred by 12 U.S.C. 1463 and the requirements of 12 U.S.C. 
1820(d). The OTS is required to conduct a full-scope, on-site 
examination of every savings association at least once during each 12-
month period.
    (b) 18-month rule for certain small institutions. The OTS may 
conduct a full-scope, on-site examination at least once during each 18-
month period, rather than each 12-month period as provided in paragraph 
(a) of this section, if the following conditions are satisfied:
    (1) The savings association has total assets of $250 million or 
less;
    (2) The savings association is well capitalized as defined in 12 CFR 
565.4;
    (3) At its most recent examination, the OTS found the savings 
association to be well managed;
    (4) At its most recent examination, the OTS determined that the 
savings association was in outstanding or good condition, that is, it 
received a composite rating of 1 or 2 under the Uniform Financial 
Institutions Rating

System (Copies are available at the addresses specified in Sec. 516.1 of 
this chapter);
    (5) The savings association currently is not subject to a formal 
enforcement proceeding or order; and
    (6) No person acquired control of the savings association during the 
preceding 12-month period in which a full-scope on-site examination 
would have been required but for this section.
    (c) Authority to conduct more frequent examinations. This section 
does not limit the authority of the OTS to examine any savings 
association as frequently as the agency deems necessary.

Sec. 563.173  Forward commitments.

    (a) Definitions--(1) Forward commitment. The term ``forward 
commitment'' means an oral or written contract to buy securities 30 or 
more days after the contract date; such a commitment is a standby 
commitment if delivery is optional with the seller and a firm commitment 
if both buyer and seller are obligated to perform on the agreed date.
    (2) Securities. The term ``securities'' means assets in which the 
savings association is authorized to invest (except financial futures or 
financial options contracts entered into pursuant to Sec. 563.174 or 
Sec. 563.175 of this part).
    (3) Commitment fee. The term ``commitment fee'' means any 
consideration received directly or indirectly by a savings association 
for a forward commitment.
    (b) Authorized personnel. The minutes of the board of directors of 
the savings association shall set out the names, duties, 
responsibilities, and current limits of authority of the savings 
association's personnel authorized to engage in forward commitment 
transactions for the savings association; the brokerage firms through 
which authorized personnel may conduct forwards activity; and the dollar 
limit on transactions with each such firm.
    (c) Limitations--(1) General. A savings association may make forward 
commitments to purchase securities, subject to the limits in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section, if that activity is conducted in a safe and 
sound manner. An example of an unsafe and unsound practice which may 
preclude further investment under this section is an inability to fund 
commitments when due. No savings association may sell a forward 
commitment or security under agreement to purchase another forward 
commitment or security at a price other than actual market value.
    (2) Percent of assets. A savings association's outstanding forward 
commitments to purchase securities plus short put options entered into 
pursuant to Sec. 563.175 of this part may not exceed an amount equal to 
5 percent of its assets if total capital is 3 percent or less of assets, 
10 percent of its assets if total capital is over 3 percent but less 
than 5 percent of assets, or 15 percent of its assets if total capital 
is 5 percent or more of assets.
    (d) Disposal before settlement. All profit or loss related to 
disposal or modification of a forward commitment before settlement shall 
be recognized on the savings association's books at the time of disposal 
or modification.
    (e) Recordkeeping requirements. A savings association engaging in 
forward commitments shall establish and maintain the following:
    (1) A current register of all outstanding forward commitments, 
including the type (firm or standby), commitment date, amount, rate, 
price to be paid at settlement, market price at date of commitment, 
settlement date, commitment fees received, date and manner of disposal, 
sales price and market value at disposal if disposition is made on or 
prior to settlement date other than through funding, and seller's 
identity and confirmation; and
    (2) Documentation of the savings association's ability to fund all 
outstanding forward commitments when due.

Sec. 563.174  Futures transactions.

    (a) Definitions. As used in this section, the definitions in 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) apply unless the context otherwise 
requires.
    (1) The term forward commitment means a written commitment to make, 
purchase or issue mortgage loans or mortgage related securities at a 
price

[[Page 199]]

and on or before a date specified in the commitment.
    (2) The term financial futures transaction means the purchase or 
sale of a financial futures contract.
    (3) The term long position means the purchase of a financial futures 
contract to take delivery of a financial instrument.
    (4) The term mortgage-related securities means securities based on 
and backed by mortgages, including mortgage-backed securities guaranteed 
by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMAs), Mortgage 
Participation Certificates of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage 
Corporation, Mortgage Pass-through Certificates of the Federal National 
Mortgage Association, and similar obligations issued by the savings 
association or in which the savings association is authorized to invest.
    (5) The term offset means to cancel an obligation to make or take 
delivery of securities under a financial instrument under a financial 
futures contract. A futures contract to purchase a financial instrument 
is offset by a futures contract to sell a financial instrument of the 
same type for the same delivery month. A futures contract to sell a 
financial instrument is offset by a futures contract to purchase a 
financial instrument of the same type for the same delivery month.
    (6) The term short position means the holding of a financial futures 
contract to make delivery of a financial instrument.
    (b) Permitted transactions. To the extent that it has legal power to 
do so, a savings association may engage in interest-rate futures 
transactions to reduce its net interest-rate risk exposure as provided 
in this paragraph (b). For purposes of this section, net interest-rate 
risk exposure is the volatility in a savings association's earnings or 
the market value of its portfolio equity that can arise from the 
mismatching of the effective maturities of assets, liabilities, and off-
balance sheet contracts. A savings association may enter into short 
positions that are appropriate for reducing its net interest-rate risk 
exposure. A savings association may enter into long positions, other 
than those that offset short positions, only under the conditions in 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.
    (1) The futures position must be matched against a firm forward 
commitment to sell mortgages not yet originated or to issue mortgage-
related securities to be based on mortgages not yet originated. For 
purposes of this paragraph (b), a firm forward commitment is a written 
commitment obligating the seller to make delivery, and the buyer to take 
delivery, of mortgage loans not yet originated or mortgage-related 
securities to be based on mortgages not yet originated, at a price and 
on or before a date specified in the commitment.
    (2) The futures position may be entered into and maintained only to 
the extent that the savings association's firm forward commitments 
exceed 10 percent of long-term assets with fixed interest rates. For 
purposes of this section, long-term assets are those having remaining 
terms to maturity in excess of five years.
    (c) Authorized contracts. A savings association may engage in 
interest-rate futures transactions using any interest-rate futures 
contracts designated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and 
based upon a financial instrument in which the savings association has 
authority to invest in or to issue.
    (d) Board of directors' authorization. Prior to engaging in 
interest-rate futures transactions, a savings association's board of 
directors must authorize such activity. In authorizing futures trading, 
the board of directors shall consider any plan to engage in financial 
futures transactions, shall endorse specific written policies, and shall 
require the establishment of internal control procedures. Policy 
objectives must be specific enough to outline permissible contract 
strategies, taking into account price and yield correlations between 
assets and liabilities and the financial futures contracts with which 
they are matched; the relationship of the strategies to the savings 
association's operations; and how such strategies reduce the savings 
association's net interest-rate risk exposure. Internal control 
procedures shall include, at a minimum, periodic reports to management, 
segregation of

[[Page 200]]

duties and internal review procedures. In addition, the minutes of the 
meeting of the board of directors shall set forth limits applicable to 
financial futures transactions, identify personnel authorized to engage 
in financial futures transactions, and set forth the duties, 
responsibilities and limits of authority of such personnel. The board of 
directors shall review the position limit, all outstanding contract 
positions, and the unrealized gains and losses on those positions and 
matched items at each regular meeting of the board.
    (e) Notification. A savings association engaging in financial 
futures transactions shall notify the Regional Director of the region in 
which its principal office is located immediately following 
authorization of its board of directors to engage in financial futures 
transactions.
    (f) Records retention. A savings association engaging in financial 
futures transactions shall maintain records of such transactions 
sufficient to document how the transactions reduce the net interest-rate 
risk exposure of the savings association in accordance with the 
requirements of paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of this section.
    (1) Contract register. The savings association shall maintain a 
contract register adequate to identify and control all financial futures 
contracts and including, at a minimum, the type and amount of each 
contract, the maturity date of each contract, the cost of each contract, 
the dollar amount and description of the asset or the liability with 
which the futures contract is matched, and the date and manner in which 
a contract is closed out. Such register shall be prepared in a manner 
sufficient to indicate at any time the savings association's total 
outstanding long and short financial futures positions.
    (2) Other documentation. The savings association shall maintain, as 
part of the documentation of its financial futures activity, a schedule 
that describes the hedge objective of the futures contracts 
(individually or in groups as appropriate) and the hedge results.
    (3) Period covered. The records designated in this paragraph (f) 
shall be maintained for all futures transactions closed-out during at 
least the preceding ten years.

sale of a financial options contract.

or take delivery of a financial instrument.
    (12) The term primary dealer in government securities means any

Securities and any parent, subsidiary, or affiliated entity of such 
primary dealer. Provided, that the member guarantees (to the 
satisfaction of the OTS) the over-the-counter financial options 
transactions between its parent, subsidiary, or affiliated entity with a 
savings association, and provided further, that the parent, subsidiary, 
or affiliated entity is substantially engaged in similar activities.
    (13) The term permissible counterparty means any entity that is:
    (i) A primary dealer as defined in paragraph (a)(12) of this 
section;
    (ii) A bank subject to the regulation and supervision of the 
Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 
or the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and that is in

    (vii) The Federal Home Loan Banks;
    (viii) The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal 
National Mortgage Association, or the Government National Mortgage 
Association; or
    (ix) Any other entity that the OTS, upon application, determines to 
be adequately regulated, capitalized, and audited or examined such that 
acting as a counterparty in an over-the-counter options transaction with 
a savings association would not entail substantial credit risks for the 
association. The OTS delegates the authority to consider and approve 
such applications to the Deputy Director for Regional Operations, with 
the concurrence of the Chief Counsel, or their respective designees.
    (b) Permitted transactions. To the extent that it has legal power to 
do so, a savings association may engage in financial options 
transactions as provided in this paragraph (b).

[[Page 202]]

    (1) Long positions. A savings association may enter into long 
positions without numerical limit.
    (2) Short positions. A savings association may enter into short call 
positions without numerical limit. A savings association may enter into 
short put options to the extent that the aggregate amount of its short 
put options and forward commitments to purchase securities does not 
exceed the limitations set forth in Sec. 563.173(c)(2) of this part.
    (c) Authorized contracts. A savings association may engage in 
financial options transactions using any financial options contracts 
either--
    (1) Designated by the CFTC or approved by the SEC; or
    (2) Entered into with a ``permissible counterparty'' (as defined in 
paragraph (a)(13) of this section) and based upon a financial instrument 
that the savings association has authority to invest in or to issue.
    (d) Board of directors' authorization. Prior to engaging in 
financial options transactions, a savings association's board of 
directors must authorize such activity. In authorizing options, the 
board of directors shall consider any plan to engage in writing or 
purchasing financial options contracts, shall endorse specific written 
policies, and shall require the establishment of internal control 
procedures. For options positions that will be matched with cash or 
forward market positions, policy objectives must be specific enough to 
outline permissible options contract strategies, taking into account 
price and yield correlations between assets or liabilities and the 
financial options contracts; the relationship of the strategies to the 
savings association's operations; the rationale for the ratio of the 
value of options positions to the value of the matched cash market 
positions; and how the options strategy reduces the savings 
association's interest-rate risk exposure. For unmatched option 
positions, policy objectives must specify the relationship of the 
strategy to the savings association's operations. Prudent business 
judgment shall be exercised by participating savings associations 
engaging in financial options transactions in order to maintain a safe 
and sound financial position. Internal control procedures shall include, 
at a minimum, periodic reports to management, segregation of duties and 
internal review procedures. In addition, the minutes of the meeting of 
the board of directors shall set forth limits applicable to financial 
options transactions, identify personnel authorized to engage in 
financial options transactions, and set forth the duties, 
responsibilities and limits of authority of such personnel. The board of 
directors shall review the position limit, all outstanding options 
contract positions, and the unrealized gains or losses on those 
positions at each regular meeting of the board.
    (e) Notification, reporting, and approval. (1) A savings association 
shall notify the Regional Director of the region in which its principal 
office is located immediately following authorization of its board of 
directors to engage in financial options transactions; and
    (2) A savings association shall not engage in over-the-counter 
financial option transactions with any permissible counterparty unless 
such counterparty agrees to notify the Regional Director of the region 
in which the principal office of the savings association is located 
immediately following the entering into such transaction. A savings 
association shall not continue to engage in over-the-counter financial 
options transactions with any permissible counterparty that has failed 
to so notify the appropriate Regional Director with respect to previous 
over-the-counter financial option transactions with that savings 
association. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no savings association shall 
engage in a long over-the-counter financial option transaction with a 
specific permissible counterparty, without obtaining the prior approval 
of its Regional Director, whenever the aggregate exercise value of all 
long over-the-counter financial option positions with the counterparty 
exceeds the limitations contained in Sec. 563.93(c)(1) of this part. A 
Regional Director may approve any financial option transaction whenever 
he determines that such transaction does not subject the SAIF to undue 
risk. In making such determinations, the Regional Director shall 
consider:

[[Page 203]]

    (i) The creditworthiness of the specific counterparty;
    (ii) The savings association's experience with such counterparty and 
with transacting in financial option and futures contracts generally;
    (iii) The nature of the subject contracts (e.g., matched or 
unmatched); and
    (iv) Any other circumstances deemed relevant by the Regional 
Director. An application to enter into a financial option transaction 
under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be deemed approved if the 
Regional Director does not deny such application within 10 calendar days 
from the date the application was filed.
    (f) Records retention. A savings association engaging in financial 
options transactions shall maintain records of such transactions in 
accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(3) of 
this section.
    (1) Contract register. The savings association shall maintain a 
contract register adequate to identify and control all financial options 
contracts and sufficient to indicate at any time the amounts of 
financial options contracts required to be reported on its monthly 
report. At a minimum, the register shall list the type, amount, 
expiration date and the cost of or income from each contract.
    (2) Other documentation. The savings association shall maintain, as 
part of the documentation of its financial options activity, a schedule 
of any cash market or forward commitment position with which the option 
is matched, the objective for each contract (or group of contracts), and 
the results.
    (3) Period covered. The records designated in this paragraph (f) 
shall be maintained for all financial options closed out during the 
preceding ten years.

savings association's interest-rate-risk exposure and devise a policy 
for the savings association's management of that risk.

report to the board of directors regarding implementation of the savings 
association's policy for interest-rate-risk management and shall make 
that information available upon request to the Office.
    (d) The savings association's board of directors shall review the 
results of operations at least quarterly and shall make such adjustments 
as it considers necessary and appropriate to the policy for interest-
rate-risk management, including adjustments to the authorized acceptable 
level of interest-rate risk.

    (a) Periodic reports. Each savings association and service 
corporation thereof shall make such periodic or other reports of its 
affairs in such manner and on such forms as the Office may prescribe. 
The Office may provide that reports filed by savings associations or 
service corporations to meet the requirements of other regulations also 
satisfy requirements imposed under this section.
    (b) False or misleading statements or omissions. No savings 
association or director, officer, agent, employee, affiliated person, or 
other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of such 
association nor any person filing or seeking approval of any application 
shall knowingly:
    (1) Make any written or oral statement to the Office or to an agent, 
representative or employee of the Office that is false or misleading 
with respect to any material fact or omits to state a material fact 
concerning any matter within the jurisdiction of the Office; or
    (2) Make any such statement or omission to a person or organization 
auditing a savings association or otherwise preparing or reviewing its 
financial statements concerning the accounts, assets, management 
condition, ownership, safety, or soundness, or other affairs of the 
association.
    (c) Notifications of loss and reports of increase in deductible 
amount of bond. A savings association maintaining bond coverage as 
required by Sec. 563.190 of this part shall promptly notify its bond 
company and file a proof of loss under the procedures provided by its 
bond, concerning any covered losses greater than twice the deductible 
amount. Whenever a deductible amount specified in a bond is increased 
above the permissible deductible amount specified in the table in 
Sec. 563.190(b) of this part, the affected savings association or 
service corporation shall report promptly the facts concerning such 
increase in writing to the OTS.
    (d) Suspicious Activity Reports--(1) Purpose and scope. This 
paragraph (d) ensures that savings associations and service corporations 
file a Suspicious Activity Report when they detect a known or suspected 
violation of Federal law or a suspicious transaction related to a money 
laundering activity or a violation of the Bank Secrecy Act.
    (2) Definitions. For the purposes of this paragraph (d):
    (i) FinCEN means the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the 
Department of the Treasury.
    (ii) Institution-affiliated party means any institution-affiliated 
party as that term is defined in sections 3(u) and 8(b)(9) of the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(u) and 1818(b)(9)).
    (iii) SAR means a Suspicious Activity Report on the form prescribed 
by the OTS.
    (3) SARs required. A savings association or service corporation 
shall file a SAR with the appropriate Federal law enforcement agencies 
and the Department of the Treasury in accordance with the form's 
instructions, by sending a completed SAR to FinCEN in the following 
circumstances:
    (i) Insider abuse involving any amount. Whenever the savings 
association or service corporation detects any known or suspected 
Federal criminal violation, or pattern of criminal violations, committed 
or attempted against the savings association or service corporation or 
involving a transaction or transactions conducted through the savings 
association or service corporation, where the savings association or 
service corporation believes that it was either an actual or potential 
victim of

[[Page 205]]

a criminal violation, or series of criminal violations, or that it was 
used to facilitate a criminal transaction, and it has a substantial 
basis for identifying one of its directors, officers, employees, agents 
or other institution-affiliated parties as having committed or aided in 
the commission of a criminal act, regardless of the amount involved in 
the violation.
    (ii) Violations aggregating $5,000 or more where a suspect can be 
identified. Whenever the savings association or service corporation 
detects any known or suspected Federal criminal violation, or pattern of 
criminal violations, committed or attempted against the savings 
association or service corporation or involving a transaction or 
transactions conducted through the savings association or service 
corporation and involving or aggregating $5,000 or more in funds or 
other assets, where the savings association or service corporation 
believes that it was either an actual or potential victim of a criminal 
violation or series of criminal violations, or that it was used to 
facilitate a criminal transaction, and it has a substantial basis for 
identifying a possible suspect or group of suspects. If it is determined 
prior to filing this report that the identified suspect or group of 
suspects has used an alias, then information regarding the true identity 
of the suspect or group of suspects, as well as alias identifiers, such 
as drivers' license or social security numbers, addresses and telephone 
numbers, must be reported.
    (iii) Violations aggregating $25,000 or more regardless of potential 
suspects. Whenever the savings association or service corporation 
detects any known or suspected Federal criminal violation, or pattern of 
criminal violations, committed or attempted against the savings 
association or service corporation or involving a transaction or 
transactions conducted through the savings association or service 
corporation and involving or aggregating $25,000 or more in funds or 
other assets, where the savings association or service corporation 
believes that it was either an actual or potential victim of a criminal 
violation or series of criminal violations, or that it was used to 
facilitate a criminal transaction, even though there is no substantial 
basis for identifying a possible suspect or group of suspects.
    (iv) Transactions aggregating $5,000 or more that involve potential 
money laundering or violations of the Bank Secrecy Act. Any transaction 
(which for purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(iv) means a deposit, 
withdrawal, transfer between accounts, exchange of currency, loan, 
extension of credit, purchase or sale of any stock, bond, certificate of 
deposit, or other monetary instrument or investment security, or any 
other payment, transfer, or delivery by, through, or to a financial 
institution, by whatever means effected) conducted or attempted by, at 
or through the savings association or service corporation and involving 
or aggregating $5,000 or more in funds or other assets, if the savings 
association or service corporation knows, suspects, or has reason to 
suspect that:
    (A) The transaction involves funds derived from illegal activities 
or is intended or conducted in order to hide or disguise funds or assets 
derived from illegal activities (including, without limitation, the 
ownership, nature, source, location, or control of such funds or assets) 
as part of a plan to violate or evade any law or regulation or to avoid 
any transaction reporting requirement under Federal law;
    (B) The transaction is designed to evade any regulations promulgated 
under the Bank Secrecy Act; or
    (C) The transaction has no business or apparent lawful purpose or is 
not the sort in which the particular customer would normally be expected 
to engage, and the institution knows of no reasonable explanation for 
the transaction after examining the available facts, including the 
background and possible purpose of the transaction.
    (4) Service corporations. When a service corporation is required to 
file a SAR under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, either the service 
corporation or a savings association that wholly or partially owns the 
service corporation may file the SAR.
    (5) Time for reporting. A savings association or service corporation 
is required to file a SAR no later than 30 calendar days after the date 
of initial

[[Page 206]]

detection of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a SAR. If no 
suspect was identified on the date of detection of the incident 
requiring the filing, a savings association or service corporation may 
delay filing a SAR for an additional 30 calendar days to identify a 
suspect. In no case shall reporting be delayed more than 60 calendar 
days after the date of initial detection of a reportable transaction. In 
situations involving violations requiring immediate attention, such as 
when a reportable violation is ongoing, the savings association or 
service corporation shall immediately notify, by telephone, an 
appropriate law enforcement authority and the OTS in addition to filing 
a timely SAR.
    (6) Reports to state and local authorities. A savings association or 
service corporation is encouraged to file a copy of the SAR with state 
and local law enforcement agencies where appropriate.
    (7) Exception. A savings association or service corporation need not 
file a SAR for a robbery or burglary committed or attempted that is 
reported to appropriate law enforcement authorities.
    (8) Retention of records. A savings association or service 
corporation shall maintain a copy of any SAR filed and the original or 
business record equivalent of any supporting documentation for a period 
of five years from the date of the filing of the SAR. Supporting 
documentation shall be identified and maintained by the savings 
association or service corporation as such, and shall be deemed to have 
been filed with the SAR. A savings association or service corporation 
shall make all supporting documentation available to appropriate law 
enforcement agencies upon request.
    (9) Notification to board of directors--(i) Generally. Whenever a 
savings association (or a service corporation in which the savings 
association has an ownership interest) files a SAR pursuant to this 
paragraph (d), the management of the savings association or service 
corporation shall promptly notify its board of directors, or a committee 
of directors or executive officers designated by the board of directors 
to receive notice.
    (ii) Suspect is a director or executive officer. If the savings 
association or service corporation files a SAR pursuant to this 
paragraph (d) and the suspect is a director or executive officer, the 
savings association or service corporation may not notify the suspect, 
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 5318(g)(2), but shall notify all directors who are 
not suspects.
    (10) Compliance. Failure to file a SAR in accordance with this 
section and the instructions may subject the savings association or 
service corporation, its directors, officers, employees, agents, or 
other institution-affiliated parties to supervisory action.
    (11) Obtaining SARs. A savings association or service corporation 
may obtain SARs and the instructions from the appropriate OTS Regional 
Office listed in 12 CFR 516.1(b).
    (12) Confidentiality of SARs. SARs are confidential. Any institution 
or person subpoenaed or otherwise requested to disclose a SAR or the 
information contained in a SAR shall decline to produce the SAR or to 
provide any information that would disclose that a SAR has been prepared 
or filed, citing this paragraph (d), applicable law (e.g., 31 U.S.C. 
5318(g)), or both, and shall notify the OTS.
    (13) Safe harbor. The safe harbor provision of 31 U.S.C. 5318(g), 
which exempts any financial institution that makes a disclosure of any 
possible violation of law or regulation from liability under any law or 
regulation of the United States, or any constitution, law or regulation 
of any state or political subdivision, covers all reports of suspected 
or known criminal violations and suspicious activities to law 
enforcement and financial institution supervisory authorities, including 
supporting documentation, regardless of whether such reports are filed 
pursuant to this paragraph (d), or are filed on a voluntary basis.
    (e) Adjustable-rate mortgage indices--(1) Reporting obligation. Upon 
the request of a Federal Home Loan Bank, all savings associations within 
the jurisdiction of that Federal Home Loan Bank shall report the data 
items set forth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section for the Federal Home 
Loan Bank to use in calculating and publishing an adjustable-rate 
mortgage index.
    (2) Data to be reported. For purposes of paragraph (e)(1) of this

    (2) Provide that each eligible account holder shall receive, without 
payment, nontransferable subscription rights to purchase capital stock

established for the public offering or the direct community offering 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(6) or (d)(4) of this section, one-tenth of one 
percent of the total offering of shares, or 15 times the product 
(rounded down to the next whole number) obtained by multiplying the 
total number of shares of capital stock to be issued by a fraction of 
which the numerator is the amount of the qualifying deposit of the 
eligible account holder and the denominator is the total amount of 
qualifying deposits of all eligible account holders in the converting 
savings association.
    (i) In the event of an oversubscription to capital stock pursuant to 
this paragraph (c)(2), shares shall be allocated among subscribing

    (ii) Any shares not allocated in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(i) 
of this section shall be allocated among the subscribing eligible 
account holders on such equitable basis, related to the amounts of their 
respective qualifying deposits, as may be provided in the plan of

received by officers and directors and their associates of the 
converting savings association based on their increased deposits in the

purchase capital stock in an amount equal to the greater of the maximum 
purchase limitation established for the public offering or the direct

section, one-tenth of one percent of the total offering of shares, or 15 
times the product (rounded down to the next whole number) obtained by

deposit of the supplemental eligible account holder and the denominator 
is the total amount of the qualifying deposits of all supplemental 
eligible account holders in the converting savings association on the

subscription rights to be distributed pursuant to this paragraph (c)(4) 
of this section.
    (iii) In the event of an oversubscription to capital stock pursuant 
to this paragraph (c)(4), shares shall be allocated among the 
subscribing supplemental eligible account holders so as to permit each 
such supplemental account holder, to the extent possible, to purchase a 
number of shares sufficient to make his or her total allocation 
(including the number of shares, if any, allocated in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section) equal to 100 shares.
    (iv) Any shares not allocated in accordance with paragraph 
(c)(4)(iii) of this section shall be allocated among the subscribing

to the amounts of their respective qualifying deposits, as may be 
provided in the plan of conversion.
    (5) Provide that association voting members who are not either 
eligible account holders or supplemental eligible account holders shall 
receive, without payment, nontransferable subscription rights to 
purchase capital stock in an amount equal to the greater of the maximum 
purchase limitation established for the public offering or the direct 
community offering pursuant to paragraph (c)(6) or (d)(4) of this 
section, or one-tenth of one percent of the total offering of shares.
    (i) Subscription rights received pursuant to this paragraph (c)(5)

conversion. Such conditions shall include, but not be limited to:
    (i) Subject to the adoption in the plan of conversion of the 
optional provision of paragraph (d)(4) of this section, a condition 
limiting purchases in the public offering or the direct community 
offering by any person together with any associate or group of persons 
acting in concert to not more than five percent (5%) of the total 
offering of shares, except that any one or more tax-qualified employee 
benefit plans may purchase in the aggregate not more than ten percent 
(10%) of the total offering of shares. Shares held by one or more tax-
qualified employee stock benefit plans and attributed to a person shall 
not be aggregated with other shares purchased directly by or otherwise 
attributable to that person.

[[Page 217]]

    (ii) A condition requiring that orders for stock in any public 
offering or direct community offering shall first be filled up to a 
maximum of two percent of the conversion stock and thereafter remaining 
shares shall be allocated on an equal number of shares per order basis 
until all orders have been filled.
    (iii) A condition requiring the stock to be offered and sold in the 
public offering or the direct community offering to be offered and sold 
in a manner that will achieve the widest distribution of the stock.
    (iv) A condition that any direct community offering by the 
converting savings association shall give a preference to natural 
persons residing in the association's local community.
    (7) Subject to the adoption in the plan of conversion of the 
optional provision of paragraph (d)(4) of this section, provide that the 
total shares that any person and any associate or group of persons 
acting in concert may subscribe for or purchase in the conversion shall 
not exceed five percent (5%) of the total offering of shares, except 
that any one or more tax-qualified employee benefit plans may purchase 
in the aggregate not more than ten percent (10%) of the total offering 
of shares. Shares held by one or more tax-qualified employee stock 
benefit plans and attributed to a person shall not be aggregated with 
shares purchased directly by or otherwise attributable to that person.
    (8) Provide that the officers and directors of the converting 
association and their associates may purchase in the conversion, up to 
thirty-five percent (35%) of the total offering of shares of the 
converting association provided that the converting association has less 
than $50 million in total assets, and up to twenty-five percent (25%) in 
the total offering of shares if the converting association has more than 
$500 million in total assets. If the converting association has between 
$50 million and $500 million, in total assets, the maximum percentage 
shall be equal to thirty-five percent (35%) minus one percent (1%) 
multiplied by the quotient of the total assets less $50 million divided 
by $45 million. For example, for a converting association with $275 
million in total assets, the percentage will be thirty percent (30%), 
calculated as thirty-five percent (35%) minus one percent (1%) 
multiplied by the quotient of $275 million less $50 million, or $225 
million, divided by $45 million, which equals five, or five percent 
(5%), which when subtracted leaves a difference of thirty percent (30%). 
In calculating the number of shares which may be purchased, any shares 
attributable to the officers and directors and their associates but held 
by one or more tax-qualified employee stock benefit plans shall not be 
included. In the case of merger conversions undertaken pursuant to 
Sec. 563b.10, any shares owned prior to the merger conversion by 
officers, directors, and their associates shall not be included in 
calculating the aggregate amount which may be purchased by such persons.

shall not purchase, without the prior written approval of the Office, 
the capital stock of the converted savings association except from a 
broker or dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
for a period of three years following the date of the conversion; except 
that, this paragraph (c)(9) shall not apply to:
    (i) Negotiated transactions involving more than one percent (1%) of 
the outstanding capital stock of the converted savings association; or
    (ii) Purchases of stock made by and held by any one or more tax-
qualified or non-tax-qualified employee stock benefit plan which may be 
attributable to individual officers or directors.
    (10) Provide that the sales price of the shares of capital stock to 
be sold in the conversion shall be a uniform price determined in 
accordance with Sec. 563b.7 of this part; and specify the underwriting

shares not sold to persons with subscription rights.
    (11) Establish a time period within which the conversion must be 
completed prior to termination. The time period shall be not more than 
24 months from the date the association members approve the plan of 
conversion and shall not be extended by the

[[Page 218]]

converting savings association or the Office.
    (12) Provide that each savings account holder of the converting 
savings association shall receive, without payment, a withdrawable 
savings account or accounts in the converted savings association equal 
in withdrawable amount to the withdrawal value of such account holder's

regulations with respect to the amount and the priorities on liquidation 
of each of the association's eligible savers' inchoate interest in the 
liquidation account, to the extent it is still in existence: Provided, 
That an eligible saver's inchoate interest in the liquidation account 
shall not entitle such eligible saver to any voting rights at meetings

the converted savings association shall:
    (i) Limit such voting rights to the minimum required by State law,

may be commenced concurrently with or at any time after the mailing to 
association members pursuant to Sec. 563b.6(c) of this part of the proxy

be no more than a correspondingly appropriate number of shares based on 
total asset size (for example, 20 percent in the case of a converting 
savings association with total assets of approximately $275 million); 
and
    (ii) The shares shall be allocated among directors, officers, and 
employees on an equitable basis such as by giving weight to period of 
service, compensation and position, subject to a

[[Page 220]]

reasonable limitation on the amount of shares which may be purchased by 
any person associate thereof, or group of affiliated persons or group of 
persons otherwise acting in concert.
    (3) That any account holder receiving rights to purchase stock in 
the subscription offering, shall also receive, without payment, non-
transferable subscription rights to purchase up to one percent of the 
total offering of shares of capital stock, to the extent that such 
shares are available after satisfying the subscriptions provided for 
under paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(4), (c)(5), and (c)(23) of this section, 
subject to such conditions as may be provided in the plan of conversion. 
In the event of an oversubscription for such additional shares, the 
shares available shall be allocated among the subscribing eligible 
account holders, supplemental eligible account holders and voting 
members on such equitable basis, related to the amounts of their 
respective subscriptions, as may be provided in the plan of conversion. 
Where possible such subscriptions shall be allocated in such a manner 
that total purchases by eligible account holders, supplemental eligible 
account holders, and voting members shall be rounded to the nearest 100 
shares.
    (4) That purchases in the public offering or in the direct community 
offering by any person together with any associate or group of persons 
acting in concert shall be limited to less than ten percent (10%) of the 
total offering of shares. The percentage amount by which any order for 
conversion stock exceeds 5% of the total offering of shares shall be 
aggregated with the percentage amounts by which all other orders for 
conversion stock exceed 5% of the total offering of shares. The 
aggregate amount shall not exceed 10% of the total offering of shares, 
except that this limitation shall not apply to the purchases of the tax-
qualified employee stock benefit plans.
    (5) That the converting savings association may require association 
members to return by a reasonable date certain a postage-paid written 
communication provided by the converting savings association requesting 
receipt of a subscription offering circular, or a preliminary or final 
offering circular in an offering pursuant to paragraph (d)(11) of this 
section, in order to be entitled to receive an offering circular from 
the converting savings association: Provided, That the subscription 
offering or the offering pursuant to paragraph (d)(11) of this section 
shall not be closed until the expiration of thirty days after the 
mailing by the converting savings association to association members of 
the postage-paid written communication. If the subscription offering or 
the offering pursuant to paragraph (d)(11) of this section is not 
commenced within 45 days after the meeting of association members, the 
converting savings association that has adopted this optional provision 
shall transmit no more than 30 days prior to the commencement of the 
subscription offering or the offering pursuant to paragraph (d)(11) of 
this section to each association member who had been furnished with 
proxy soliciting materials, written notice of the commencement of the 
offering, which notice shall state that the converting savings 
association is not required to furnish an offering circular to an 
association member unless the association member returns by a reasonable 
date certain the postage-paid written communication provided by the 
converting savings association requesting receipt of an offering 
circular.
    (6) That the converting savings association may require eligible 
account holders and supplemental eligible account holders who are not 
voting members pursuant to Sec. 563b.6(d) of this part to return by a 
reasonable date certain a postage-paid written communication provided by 
the converting savings association requesting the receipt of a 
subscription offering circular, or a preliminary or final offering 
circular in an offering pursuant to paragraph (d)(11) of this section, 
in order to be entitled to receive an offering circular from the 
converting savings association: Provided, That the subscription offering 
or the offering pursuant to paragraph (d)(11) of this section shall not 
be closed until the expiration of thirty days after the mailing by the 
converting savings association to the non-voting eligible account 
holders and supplemental eligible account holders of the postage-paid 
written communication.

[[Page 221]]

If the subscription offering or the offering pursuant to paragraph 
(d)(11) of this section is not commenced within 45 days after the 
meeting of association members, the converting savings association that 
has adopted this optional provision shall transmit no more than 30 days 
prior to the commencement of the subscription offering or the offering 
pursuant to paragraph (d)(11) of this section to each eligible account 
holder and supplemental account holder who had been furnished with a 
notice pursuant to paragraph (d)(11) of this section written notice of 
the commencement of the offering, which notice shall state that the 
converting savings association is not required to furnish an offering 
circular to a non-voting eligible account holder or supplemental 
eligible account holder unless the eligible account holder or 
supplemental eligible account holder returns by a reasonable date 
certain the postage-paid written communication provided by the 
converting savings association requesting receipt of an offering 
circular.
    (7) That any insignificant residue of shares of the converting 
savings association not sold in the subscription offering or in a public 
offering referred to in paragraph (c)(6) of this section may be sold in 
such other manner as provided in the plan with the Office's approval.
    (8) That the number of shares which any person, or group of persons 
affiliated with each other or otherwise acting in concert, may subscribe 
for in the subscription offering may be made subject to a limit of not 
less than one percent of the total offering of shares.
    (9) That any person exercising subscription rights to purchase 
capital stock shall be required to purchase a minimum of up to 25 shares 
to the extent such shares are available (but the aggregate price for any 
minimum share purchase shall not exceed $500).
    (10) That the converted savings association shall issue and sell, in 
lieu of shares of its capital stock, units of securities consisting of 
capital stock and long-term warrants or other equity securities, in 
which event any reference in the provisions of this part to capital 
stock shall apply to such units of equity securities unless the context 
otherwise requires.
    (11) That, instead of a separate subscription offering, all 
subscription rights issued in connection with the conversion shall be 
exercisable by delivery of properly completed and executed order forms 
to the underwriters or selling group for the public offering or pursuant 
to any other procedure, subject to the applicant demonstrating to the 
Office the feasibility of the method of exercising such rights and to 
such conditions as shall be provided in the plan of conversion. Such 
conditions shall include, but not be limited to, a condition requiring 
that orders for stock in the public offering or direct community 
offering shall first be filled, in the order of priority set forth in 
this section, by orders of persons exercising subscription rights.
    (12) That the offering of stock to be sold in the subscription 
offering may give a preference to eligible account holders, supplemental 
eligible account holders, and other voting members residing in the 
association's local community.
    (13) That the Office may approve such other equitable provisions as 
are necessary to avert imminent injury to the converting savings 
association.
    (e) Determination of amount of qualifying deposit; predecessor and 
successor accounts. (1) Unless otherwise provided in the plan of 
conversion, for the purposes of this section, the amount of the 
qualifying deposit of an eligible account holder or supplemental 
eligible account holder shall be the total of the deposit balances in 
the eligible account holder's or supplemental eligible account holder's 
savings accounts in the converting savings association as of the close 
of business on the eligibility record date or supplemental eligibility 
record date. However, the plan of conversion may provide that any 
savings accounts with total deposit balances of less than $50 (or any 
lesser amount) shall not constitute a qualifying deposit.
    (2) As used in this section, the term ``savings account'' includes a 
predecessor or successor account of a given savings account which is 
held only in the same right and capacity and on the same terms and 
conditions as the given

[[Page 222]]

savings account. However, the plan of conversion may provide for lesser 
requirements for consideration as a predecessor or successor account.
    (f) Liquidation account. (1) Each converted savings association 
shall, at the time of conversion, establish a liquidation account in an 
amount equal to the amount of net worth of the converting savings 
association as of the latest practicable date prior to conversion. For 
the purposes of this paragraph, the savings association shall use the 
net worth figure no later than that set forth in its latest statement of 
financial condition contained in the final offering circular. The 
function of the liquidation account is to establish a priority on 
liquidation and, except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, 
the existence of the liquidation account shall not operate to restrict 
the use or application of any of the net worth accounts of the converted 
savings association.
    (2) The liquidation account shall be maintained by the converted 
savings association for the benefit of eligible account holders and 
supplemental eligible account holders who maintain their savings 
accounts in such association. Each such eligible account holder and 
supplemental eligible account holder shall, with respect to each savings 
account held, have a related inchoate interest in a portion of the 
liquidation account balance (``subaccount'').
    (3) In the event of a complete liquidation of the converted savings 
association (and only in such event), each eligible account holder and 
supplemental eligible account holder shall be entitled to receive a 
liquidation distribution from the liquidation account, in the amount of 
the then current adjusted subaccount balances for savings accounts held, 
before any liquidation distribution may be made with respect to capital 
at the time of the conversion in exchange for the surrender of mutual 
capital certificates issued by the association prior to conversion. A 
merger, consolidation, sale of bulk assets, or similar combination or 
transaction with another SAIF-insured savings association is not 
considered a complete liquidation for these purposes, and in such a 
transaction the liquidation account would be assumed by the surviving 
association. Preferred stock issued in exchange for mutual capital 
certificates may receive distributions in liquidation prior to 
distribution from the liquidation account to the holders of the mutual 
capital certificates that would have been entitled to priority over the 
residual rights of depositors had the association not been converted as 
of the date of liquidation.
    (4) The initial subaccount balance for a savings account held by an 
eligible account holder and/or supplemental eligible account holder 
shall be determined by multiplying the opening balance in the 
liquidation account by a fraction of which the numerator is the amount 
of qualifying deposits in such savings account on the eligibility record 
date and/or the supplemental eligibility record date and the denominator 
is the total amount of qualifying deposits of all eligible account 
holders and supplemental eligible account holders in the converting 
savings association on such dates. For savings accounts in existence at 
both dates, separate subaccounts shall be determined on the basis of the 
qualifying deposits in such saving accounts on such record dates. Such 
initial subaccount balances shall not be increased, and it shall be 
subject to downward adjustment as provided in paragraph (f)(5) of this 
section.
    (5) If the deposit balance in any savings account of an eligible 
account holder or supplemental eligible account holder at the close of 
business on any annual closing date subsequent to the respective record 
dates is less than the lesser of:
    (i) The deposit balance in such savings account at the close of 
business on any other annual closing date subsequent to the eligibility 
record date or supplemental eligibility record date; or
    (ii) The amount of qualifying deposit as of the eligibility record 
date or the supplemental eligibility record date, the subaccount balance 
for such savings account shall be adjusted by reducing such subaccount 
balance in an amount proportionate to the reduction in such deposit 
balance.

In the event of such a downward adjustment, the subaccount balance shall

[[Page 223]]

not be subsequently increased, notwithstanding any increase in the 
deposit balance of the related savings account. The converted 
association shall not be required to recompute the liquidation account 
and subaccount balances provided the converted association maintains 
records sufficient to make necessary computations in the event of a 
complete liquidation or such other events as may require a computation 
of the balance of the liquidation account. The liquidation subaccount of 
an account holder shall be maintained for as long as the account holder 
maintains an account with the same Social Security number.
    (g) Restrictions on repurchase of stock; payment of dividends; and 
use of stock option and management or employee stock benefit plans. Each 
savings association that converts pursuant to this part shall be subject 
to the following conditions:
    (1) No converted savings association shall for a period of three 
years from the date of the completion of the conversion repurchase any 
of its capital stock from any person, except that this restriction shall 
not apply to either:
    (i) A repurchase, on a pro rata basis pursuant to an offer approved 
by the Office and made to all shareholders of such association; or
    (ii) The repurchase of qualifying shares of a director.
    (2) No converted association shall declare or pay a dividend on, or 
repurchase any of, its capital stock if the effect thereof would cause 
the regulatory capital of the converted association to be reduced below 
the amount required for its liquidation account. Any dividend declared 
or paid on, or repurchase of, a converted association's capital stock 
also shall be in compliance with Sec. 563.134 of this chapter.
    (3)(i) A converted savings association subject to paragraph (g)(1) 
of this section may repurchase its capital stock provided:
    (A) No repurchases occur within one year following conversion;
    (B) Repurchases within year two and year three after conversion are 
part of an open-market stock repurchase program that does not allow for 
a repurchase of more than 5% of the association's outstanding capital 
stock during a twelve month period;
    (C) The repurchases do not cause the association to become 
undercapitalized (as defined in 12 CFR 565.4); and
    (D) The association provides to the Regional Director, with a copy 
to the Chief Counsel's Office, Business Transactions Division, no later 
than ten days prior to the commencement of a repurchase program, written 
notice containing a full description of the repurchase program to be 
undertaken, the effect of such repurchases on its regulatory capital 
position, and a valid business purpose for the repurchase; and the 
Regional Director does not disapprove the repurchase program based upon 
a determination that:
    (1) The repurchase program would materially adversely affect the 
financial condition of the savings association;
    (2) The information submitted by the savings association is 
insufficient upon which to base a conclusion as to whether the 
association's financial condition would be materially adversely 
affected; or
    (3) The association did not demonstrate a valid business purpose for 
the stock repurchase.
    (ii) During the first three years following conversion, the OTS, in 
accordance with the standards contained in this paragraph, may permit 
stock repurchases in excess of the amounts specified in paragraph 
(g)(3)(i) of this section, where exceptional circumstances are 
established.
    (4) Use of Stock Option and Management or Employee Stock Benefit 
Plans. No converted savings association shall, for a one year period 
from the date of the conversion, implement a stock option plan or 
management or employee stock benefit plan, other than a tax-qualified 
plan complying with (c)(6) of this section, unless each of the following 
requirements are met:
    (i) Each of the plans was fully disclosed in the proxy soliciting 
and conversion stock offering materials;
    (ii) For stock option plans, the total number of shares of common 
stock for which options may be granted does not exceed ten percent of 
the amount of shares issued in the conversion;

[[Page 224]]

    (iii) For management or employee stock benefit plans, the aggregate 
amount of such plans shall not exceed three percent of the amount of 
shares issued in the conversion;
    (iv) The aggregate amount of all shares obtained by a tax-qualified 
employee stock benefit plan(s) in the conversion, pursuant to (c)(6) of 
this section, or within one year following the conversion, and all the 
shares in a management or employee stock benefit plan, pursuant to 
paragraph (g)(4)(iii) of this section, shall not exceed ten percent of 
the total amount of shares issued in the conversion;
    (v) Associations that have in excess of ten percent tangible capital 
following the conversion, may be granted, on a case by case basis, 
approval to establish a management or employee stock benefit plan 
pursuant to paragraph (g)(4)(iii) of this section in an amount up to 
four percent of the amount of the shares issued in the conversion, and 
an aggregate total of up to twelve percent for all plans established 
pursuant to paragraph (g)(4)(iv) of this section;
    (vi) No individual shall receive more than twenty-five percent of 
the shares of any plan and directors who are not employees of the 
association shall not receive more than five percent of the stock 
individually, or thirty percent in the aggregate, of any plan;
    (vii) All such plans, prior to establishment and implementation, are 
approved by the holders of a majority of the total votes eligible to be 
cast at any duly called meeting of shareholders of the association or 
its holding company, either annual or special, to be held not earlier 
than six months after completion of the conversion;
    (viii) In the case of a savings association subsidiary of a mutual 
holding company, all such plans, prior to establishment and 
implementation, are approved by the holders (other than its parent 
mutual holding company) of a majority of the total votes eligible to be 
cast, at any duly called meeting of shareholders, either annual or 
special, to be held no earlier than six months after completion of the 
conversion;
    (ix) For stock option plans, stock options are granted at no less 
than the market price at which the stock is trading at the time of 
grant;
    (x) For management or employee stock benefit plans, no conversion 
stock is used to fund the plans;
    (xi) The plans subject to this section must comply with the terms 
and amounts specified in paragraph (g)(4) of this section;
    (xii) The plans subject to this section shall begin vesting no 
earlier than one year from the date the plans are approved by 
shareholders, shall not vest at a rate in excess of 20% a year, and 
shall not provide for accelerated vesting except in the case of 
disability or death;
    (xiii) Disclosure in all proxy and related material distributed to 
shareholders in connection with the meeting at which the stock option 
plans and management stock benefit plans will be voted shall state that 
the plans comply with OTS regulations, that the OTS in no way endorses 
or approves the plans; and no written or oral representation to the 
contrary shall be made; and
    (xiv) No later than five calendar days from the date of shareholder 
approval of any stock option or management benefit plans, the 
institution shall file with the OTS a copy of the approved plans and 
written certification that the plans approved by the shareholders are 
the same plans filed with and disclosed in the proxy materials.
    (h) Manipulative and deceptive devices. In the offer, sale or 
purchase of securities issued incident to its conversion, no savings 
association, or any director, officer, attorney agent or employee 
thereof, shall:
    (1) Employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud;
    (2) Obtain money or property by means of any untrue statement of a 
material fact or any omission to state a material fact necessary in 
order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances 
under which they were made, not misleading; or
    (3) Engage in any act, transaction, practice, or course of business 
which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon a purchaser or 
seller.
    (i) Acquisition of the securities of converting and converted 
savings associations--(1) Prohibited transfers. Prior to the completion 
of a conversion, no person shall transfer, or enter into any

[[Page 225]]

agreement or understanding to transfer, the legal or beneficial 
ownership of conversion subscription rights, or the underlying 
securities to the account of another.
    (2) Prohibition of offers and certain acquisitions. Prior to the 
completion of a conversion, no person shall make any offer, or any 
announcement of an offer, for any security of the converting savings 
association issued in connection with the conversion nor shall any 
person knowingly acquire securities of the converted savings association 
issued in connection with the conversion in excess of the maximum 
purchase limitations established in the association's approved plan of 
conversion pursuant to paragraph (c)(7) or (d)(4) of this section.
    (3) Prohibition on offers to acquire and acquisitions of stock for 
three years following conversion. (i) For a period of three years 
following the date of the completion of the conversion, no person shall, 
directly or indirectly, offer to acquire or acquire the beneficial 
ownership of more than ten percent of any class of an equity security of 
a savings association converted in accordance with the provisions of 
this part 563b, without the prior written approval of the Office. Where 
any person, directly or indirectly, acquires beneficial ownership of 
more than ten percent of any class of any equity security of a savings 
association converted in accordance with part 563b, without the prior 
wirtten approval of the Office as required by this section, the 
securities beneficially owned by such person in excess of ten percent 
shall not be counted as shares entitled to vote and shall not be voted 
by any person or counted as voting shares in connection with any matter 
submitted to the stockholders for a vote. For the purposes of this 
section, a person shall be deemed to have acquired beneficial ownership 
of more than ten percent (10%) of a class of equity security of a 
savings association where the person holds any combination of stock or 
revocable or irrevocable proxies of the association under circumstances 
that give rise to a conclusive control determination or rebuttable 
control determination under Secs. 574.4(a) and 574.4(b) of this chapter. 
In obtaining the prior written approval of the OTS under this paragraph 
(i), the criteria for approval under paragraph (i)(5) of this section 
should be addressed, if applicable, in the application, notice, or 
rebuttal required by part 574 of this chapter for the acquisition of 
stock of a savings association, as set forth in Sec. 574.6(j) of this 
chapter.
    (ii) A conversion shall be deemed completed on the date all of the 
converting association's conversion stock was sold.
    (iii) An acquisition of shares shall be presumed to have been made 
if the acquiror entered into a binding written agreement for the 
transfer of shares. An offer shall be deemed made when communicated.
    (4) Exceptions. (i) Paragraphs (i)(1) and (i)(2) of this section 
shall not apply to a transfer, agreement, or understanding to transfer, 
offer, or announcement of an offer or intent to make an offer which:
    (A) Pertains only to securities to be purchased pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(6), (d)(7), or (d)(12); and
    (B) Has the prior written approval of the Office.
    (ii) Paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this section shall not apply to 
any offer with a view toward public resale made exclusively to the 
association or to the underwriters or a selling group acting on its 
behalf.
    (iii) Unless made applicable by the Office by prior advice in 
writing, the restriction contained in paragraph (i)(3) of this section 
shall not apply to any offer or announcement of an offer which if 
consummated would result in the acquisition by a person, together with 
all other acquisitions by the person of the same class of securities 
during the preceding 12-month period, of not more than one percent of 
the class of securities.
    (iv) The restriction contained in paragraph (i)(3) of this section 
shall not apply to any offer to acquire or acquisition of beneficial 
ownership of more than ten percent of the common stock of a savings 
association by a corporation whose ownership is or will be substantially 
the same as the ownership of the savings association, provided that the 
offer or acquisition is

[[Page 226]]

made more than one year following the date of completion of the 
conversion.
    (v) Paragraphs (i)(1), (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this section shall not 
apply to the acquisition of securities of an association or holding 
company thereof by any one or more tax-qualified employee stock benefit 
plans of such association or holding company, provided that, the plan or 
plans do not have beneficial ownership in the aggregate of more than 
twenty-five percent (25%) of any class of equity security of the 
converted association or holding company.
    (vi) No application under paragraph (i)(3)(i) of this section 
generally shall be required for any proposed acquisition that requires 
prior approval of, or clearance by, the OTS under 12 CFR part 574 
provided that the application required to be filed pursuant to part 574 
of this chapter addresses in specific detail how the proposed 
transaction will comply with the criteria for approval under paragraph 
(i)(5) of this section, and the proposed acquisition is not opposed by 
the recently converted association subject to paragraph (i)(3)(i) of 
this section. Where, pursuant to this paragraph (i)(4)(vi), no separate 
application under paragraph (i)(3)(i) of this section is required, the 
prohibition on offers to acquire equity securities contained in 
paragraph (i)(3)(i) of this section shall not apply.
    (5) Criteria for approval. The Office may deny an application 
involving an offer or acquisition of any security or proxies to vote 
securities of a converted association submitted under paragraph (i)(3) 
of this section if it finds that the proposed acquisition:
    (i) Would frustrate the purposes of the provisions of this part 
563b;
    (ii) Would be manipulative or deceptive;
    (iii) Would subvert the fairness of the conversion;
    (iv) Would be likely to result in injury to the association;
    (v) Would not be consistent with economical home financing;
    (vi) Would otherwise be violative of law or regulation; or
    (vii) Would not contribute to the prudent deployment of the 
association's conversion proceeds.
    (6) Optional charter provisions. The plan of conversion may provide 
for the charter of the converted savings association to include, for a 
specified period of not more than five years following the date of the 
completion of the conversion, any or all of the provisions of 
Sec. 552.4(b)(8) of this chapter: Provided, that if the savings 
association is converting to a state-chartered stock association, it 
shall include in its application an opinion of counsel independent of 
the association that such charter provisions are permissible under the 
law of the applicable state. At any annual or special meeting of its 
shareholders, a converted state-chartered savings association may adopt 
any charter provision regarding the acquisition by any person or persons 
of its equity securities that would be permitted to be adopted by a 
savings association chartered by the state in which the converted 
savings association is chartered, and a converted federally-chartered 
savings association may adopt any such charter provision permitted under 
Sec. 552.4 of this chapter.
    (7) Definitions. (i) The term person includes an individual, a group 
acting in concert, a corporation, a partnership, an association, a joint 
stock company, a trust, an unincorporated organization or similar

    (ii) The term offer includes every offer to buy or acquire, 
solicitation of an offer to sell, tender offer for, or request or 
invitation for tenders of, a security or interest in a security, for 
value: Provided, That for the purpose of this Sec. 563b.3(i), the term 
``offer'' shall not include:
    (A) Inquiries directed solely to the management of a savings 
association and not intended to be communicated to stockholders, 
designed to elicit an indication of management's receptivity to the 
basic structure of a potential acquisition with respect to the amount of 
securities, manner of acquisition and formula for determining price, or
    (B) Nonbinding expressions of understanding or letters of intent 
with the management of a savings association regarding the basic 
structure of a potential acquisition with respect to the

[[Page 227]]

effected by purchase, exchange, operation of law or otherwise.
    (iv) The term security includes non-transferable subscription rights 
issued pursuant to a plan of conversion as well as a security as defined 
in 15 U.S.C. 78c(2)(10).

Sec. 563b.4  Notice of filing; public statements; confidentiality.

    (a) Information prior to approval of plan of conversion. (1) A 
savings association which is considering converting pursuant to this 
part and its directors, officers and employees shall keep such 
consideration in the strictest confidence and shall only discuss the 
potential conversion as would be consistent with the need to prepare 
information for filing an application for conversion. Should this 
confidence be breached the Office may require remedial measures 
including:
    (i) A public statement by the association that its board of 
directors is currently considering converting pursuant to this part;
    (ii) Providing for an eligibility record date which shall be as of 
such a date prior to the adoption of the plan by the converting savings 
association's board of directors as to assure the equitability of the 
conversion;
    (iii) Limitation of the subscription rights of any person violating 
or aiding the violation of this section to an amount deemed appropriate 
by the Office; and
    (iv) Any other actions the Office may deem appropriate and necessary

Division. Copies of the definitive statement, letter and press release

conversion.

[[Page 229]]

The applicant shall prominently post the notice in each of its offices 
and publish the notice in at least one newspaper printed in the English

may, in its discretion, and upon written request, extend the twenty day 
comment period for an additional twenty calendar days. Failure to 
provide the written comments in twenty calendar days may preclude the 
pursuit of any administrative or judicial remedies. Two copies of the 
comments should be sent to the Chief Counsel, Business Transactions

the Regional Director. The proposed plan of conversion and any comments 
will be available for inspection by any member of the applicant at the

the plan of conversion may also be inspected at the home office and each 
branch office of the applicant.
    (2) If a significant number of the applicant's members speak a

translation of the notice shall also be published in that newspaper.
    (3) Promptly after publication of the notice or notices prescribed 
in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2), the applicant shall file four copies of 
each notice with the Office accompanied by an affidavit of publication 
from each publisher.
    (c) Should the applicant desire to submit any information it deems 
to be of a confidential nature regarding the answer to any item or any 
part of any exhibit included in any application under this part, such 
information pertaining to such item or exhibit shall be separately bound 
and labeled ``confidential,'' and a statement shall be submitted 
therewith briefly setting forth the grounds on which such information 
should be treated as confidential. Only general reference thereto need 
be made in that portion of the application which the applicant deems not 
to be confidential. Applications under this part shall be made available 
for inspection by the public, except for portions which are bound and 
labeled ``confidential'' and which the Office determines to withhold 
from public availability under 5 U.S.C. 552 and part 505 of this 
chapter. Preliminary soliciting materials will be made available upon 
filing, unless such materials are not otherwise available to the public 
and are bound and labeled ``confidential.'' The applicant will be 
advised of any decision by the Office to make public information 
designated ``confidential'' by the applicant. Even though sections of 
the application are considered ``confidential,'' as far as public 
inspection thereof is concerned, to the extent it deems necessary, the 
Office may comment on such confidential submissions in any public 
statement in connection with its decision on the application without 
prior notice to the applicant.

Sec. 563b.5  Solicitation of proxies; proxy statement.

    (a) Solicitations to which rules apply. This section applies to 
every solicitation of a proxy from an association member of a savings 
association for the meeting at which a conversion plan

[[Page 230]]

will be voted upon, except the following:
    (1) Any solicitation made otherwise than on behalf of the management 
of the savings association where the total number of persons solicited 
is not more than 50;
    (2) Any solicitation through the medium of a newspaper advertisement 
which informs association members, following approval of the plan of 
conversion, of a source from which they may obtain copies of a proxy 
statement, form of proxy, or any other soliciting material and does no 
more than:
    (i) Name the savings association;
    (ii) State the reason for the advertisement;
    (iii) Identify the proposal or proposals to be acted upon by 
association members; and
    (iv) Urge the member to vote at the meeting.
    (b) Use of proxy soliciting material to be authorized. No proxy 
soliciting material required to be filed with the Office prior to use 
shall be furnished to association members or otherwise released for 
distribution until the use of such material has been authorized in 
writing by the Office. Proxy material authorized for use by the Office 
shall be mailed to the association members within ten days of such 
authorization unless extended by the Office in writing.
    (c) Information to be furnished association members. No solicitation 
subject to this section shall be made unless each person solicited is 
concurrently furnished, or has previously been furnished, a written 
proxy statement the use of which has been authorized by the Office.
    (d) Requirements as to proxy. (1) The form of proxy:
    (i) Shall indicate in bold face type whether the proxy is solicited 
on behalf of the management;

on each such matter to which no choice is so specified.
    (2) No proxy subject to this section shall confer authority to vote 
at any meeting other than the meeting (or any adjournment thereof) to

may be voted with respect to matters not related to the plan of 
conversion.
    (3) The proxy statement or form of proxy shall provide that the 
votes represented by the proxy will be voted; that, where the person 
solicited specifies by means of a ballot provided pursuant to paragraph 
(d)(1)(viii) of this section a choice with respect to any matter to be 
acted upon, the votes will be voted in accordance with the 
specifications so made; and that if no choice is so specified, the votes 
will be cast as indicated in bold face type on the form of proxy.

subject to this section including soliciting material in the form of 
press releases, and

[[Page 231]]

radio or television scripts, to be used or furnished to association 
members subsequent to furnishing the proxy statement, shall be filed 
with the Office at least five business days prior to the date on which 
the Office is requested to authorize the use of such material. Speeches 
may, but need not be, filed with the Office prior to use.
    (3) Twenty-five copies of the proxy statement and ten copies of the 
form of proxy and all other soliciting material, in the form in which 
such material is furnished to association members, shall be filed with 
or mailed for filing to the Office not later than the date such material 
is first sent or given to association members. All materials filed 
pursuant to this paragraph (e)(3) shall be accompanied by a statement of 
the date on which copies of such materials are to be released to 
association members.
    (4) If the solicitation is to be made in whole or in part by 
personal solicitation, ten preliminary copies of all written 
instructions or other material which discusses or reviews, or comments 
upon the merits of, any matter to be acted upon and which is to be

use directly or indirectly in connection with the solicitation shall be 
filed with the Office at least five business days prior to the date on 
which the Office is requested to authorize the use of such material.
    (5) All preliminary copies of material filed pursuant to paragraphs 
(e)(1), (e)(2) and (e)(4) of this section shall be clearly marked on the

unless otherwise deemed confidential pursuant to Sec. 563b.4(c) of this 
part.
    (6) Unless requested by the Office, copies of replies to inquiries 
from members of the savings association and copies of communications 
which do no more than request that forms of proxy theretofore solicited 
be signed and returned need not be filed pursuant to paragraph (e) of 
this section.
    (7) Where any proxy statement, form of proxy or other material filed 
pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section is amended or revised, four of 
the required copies of such amended or revised material filed with the 
Office shall be marked to indicate clearly and precisely the changes 
effected therein subsequent to the last prior filing.
    (f) Mailing communications for associations members. If the 
management of the applicant has adopted a plan of conversion, the 
applicant shall perform such of the following acts as may be duly 
requested in writing with respect to a matter to be considered at the 
meeting to vote on the plan of conversion by any association member who 
will defray the reasonable expenses to be incurred by the applicant in 
the performance of the act or acts requested.
    (1) The applicant shall mail or otherwise furnish to such 
association member the following information as promptly as practicable 
after the receipt of such request:
    (i) A statement of the approximate number of association members who 
have been or are to be solicited on behalf of the management, or any 
group of such holders which the association member shall designate; and
    (ii) An estimate of the cost of mailing a specified proxy statement, 
form of proxy or other communication to such association member.
    (2) Copies of any proxy statement, form of proxy or other 
communication furnished by the association member and as approved by the 
Office shall be mailed by the applicant to such of the association 
members specified in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section as the 
association member shall designate.

shall be mailed with reasonable promptness by the applicant after 
receipt of the material to be mailed, envelopes or other containers 
therefor and postage or payment for postage.
    (4) Neither the management nor the applicant shall be responsible 
for such proxy statement, form of proxy or other communication.
    (g) False or misleading statements. (1) No solicitation of a proxy 
by the applicant, its management, or any other person for the meeting to 
vote on conversion shall be made by means of any proxy statement, form 
of proxy, notice of meeting or other communication, written or oral, 
containing any statement which, at the time and in the

[[Page 232]]

light of the circumstances under which it is made, is false or 
misleading with respect to any material fact, or which omits to state 
any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not 
false or misleading or necessary to correct any statement in any earlier 
communication with respect to the solicitation of a proxy for such 
meeting which has become false or misleading.
    (2) The fact that a proxy statement, form of proxy or other 
soliciting material has been filed with or examined by the Office and 
authorized for use shall not be deemed a finding by the Office that such 
material is accurate or complete or not false or misleading, or that the 
Office has passed upon the merits of or approved any proposal contained 
therein. No representation contrary to the foregoing shall be made by 
any person.
    (3) If a solicitation by management violates any provision of this 
section, the Office may require remedial measures including:
    (i) Correction of any such violation by means of a retraction and 
new solicitation;
    (ii) Rescheduling of the meeting for a vote on the conversion; and
    (iii) Any other actions the Office may deem appropriate in the 
circumstances in order to ensure a fair vote.
    (h) Prohibition of certain solicitations. No person soliciting a 
proxy from an association member for the meeting to vote on conversion 
shall solicit:
    (1) Any undated or post-dated proxy;
    (2) Any proxy which provides that it shall be deemed to be dated as 
of any date subsequent to the date on which it is signed by the 
association members;
    (3) Any proxy which is not revocable at will by the association 
member giving it; or
    (4) Any proxy which is part of any other document or instrument 
(such as an account card).

<R05>
Sec. 563b.7  Pricing and sale of securities.

    (a) General. (1) No offer to sell securities of an applicant 
pursuant to a plan of conversion may be made prior to approval by the 
Office of the application for conversion and until the proxy statement 
has been authorized for use by the Office.
    (2) No offering circular may be transmitted to any person in 
connection with an offer or sale of a security that is the subject of a 
plan of conversion which has been filed with the Office unless the 
offering circular meets the requirements of this part or part 563g.
    (3) No sale of securities may be made except by means of a final 
offering circular which has been declared effective by the Office.
    (4) The provisions of Sec. 563b.7(a) shall not apply to preliminary 
negotiations or agreements between an applicant and any underwriter or 
among underwriters who are to be in priority of contract with the 
applicant.
    (b) Distribution of offering materials. Any preliminary offering 
circular which has been filed with the Office may be distributed in 
connection with the offering at the same time as or after the proxy 
statement is mailed to association members pursuant to Sec. 563b.6(c) of 
this part. No final offering circular shall be distributed until it has 
been declared effective by the Office. The declaration of effectiveness 
of the final offering circular by the Office shall not extend beyond the 
maximum time period specified for the completion of the sale of all the 
capital stock in paragraph (i) of this section, or beyond such period of 
time as the Office shall establish upon a subsequent declaration of 
effectiveness in the event of the granting of an extension of time under 
paragraph (k) of this section.
    (c) Estimated price information. If the offering is to commence 
prior to the meeting of the association members held to vote on the plan 
of conversion, the proxy statement authorized for use

[[Page 234]]

by the Office shall set forth the estimated price range. Any preliminary 
offering circular shall set forth the estimated price range. The maximum 
of such price range should normally be no more than 15 percent above the 
average of the minimum and maximum of such price range and the minimum 
should normally be no more than 15 percent below such average. The 
maximum price used in the price range should normally be no more than 
$50 per share and the minimum no less than $5 per share.
    (d) Prohibited representations. The Office will review the price 
information required under this section in determining whether to give 
approval to applications for conversion when the offering is to commence 
prior to the meeting of association members, and will review the 
information in determining whether to declare a final offering circular 
effective. No representations may be made in any manner that such price 
information has been approved by the Office or that the shares of 
capital stock sold pursuant to the plan of conversion have been approved 
or disapproved by the Office or that the Office has passed upon the 
accuracy or adequacy of any offering circular covering such shares.
    (e) Underwriting expenses. Underwriting commissions shall not exceed 
an amount or percentage per share accepted as reasonable by the Office 
or its delegate. No underwriting commission shall be allowed or paid 
with respect to shares of capital stock sold in the subscription 
offering unless the plan of conversion contains the optional provision 
permitted by Sec. 563b.3(d)(11) of this part; however, an underwriter 
may be reimbursed for accountable expenses in connection with the 
subscription offering where the public offering is limited such that 
reasonable underwriting commissions thereon would not be sufficient to 
cover total accountable expenses and, in the case in which no public 
offering occurs, an underwriter may be paid a consulting fee reasonable 
under the circumstances as the Office shall accept. The term 
``underwriting commissions'' includes underwriting discounts.
    (f) Pricing materials. (1) In considering the pricing information 
required under paragraph (c) of this section, the Office will apply the 
following guidelines:
    (i) The materials shall be prepared by persons independent of the 
applicant, experienced and expert in the area of corporate appraisal, 
and acceptable to the Office;
    (ii) The materials shall contain a full appraisal, including a 
complete and detailed description of the elements that make up an 
appraisal report, justification for the methodology employed and 
sufficient support for the conclusions reached therein;
    (iii) To the extent that the appraisal is based on a capitalization 
of the pro forma income of the converted savings association, the 
materials must indicate the basis for determination of the income to be 
derived from the proceeds of the sale of stock and demonstrate the 
appropriateness of the earnings-multiple used, including assumptions 
made as to future earnings growth. To the extent that the appraisal is 
based on comparison of the capital stock of the applicant with 
outstanding capital stock of existing stock associations, such existing 
stock associations must be reasonably comparable to the converting 
savings association in terms of such factors as size, market area, 
competitive conditions, profit history, and expected future earnings;
    (iv) In those instances where the initial appraisal report is deemed 
to be materially deficient and/or substantially incomplete, the OTS may 
deem the entire conversion application materially deficient and/or 
substantially incomplete, and in accordance with the OTS applications 
processing rules, 12 CFR part 516, decline to further process the 
application.
    (2) In addition to the information required in paragraph (f)(1) of 
this section, the applicant shall submit information demonstrating to 
the satisfaction of the Office the independence and expertise of any 
person preparing materials under this paragraph. No appraiser shall 
serve as an underwriter or selling agent under the same plan of 
conversion. No affiliate of an appraiser may act as an underwriter or 
selling agent unless procedures are followed and representations made to 
ensure that an appraiser is separate from the underwriter or selling 
agent affiliate

[[Page 235]]

and the underwriter or selling agent affiliate does not make 
recommendations or in any way impact the appraisal. No appraiser shall 
receive any other fee except for the fee for services rendered in 
connection with such appraisal.
    (3) In addition to the information required in paragraphs (f)(1) and 
(f)(2) of this section, the applicant shall file with the Office such 
additional information with respect to the pricing of the capital stock 
of the association as the Office may request.
    (g) Order forms for purchase of capital stock. (1) Promptly after 
the Office has declared effective the offering circular for the 
subscription offering, the applicant shall distribute order forms for 
the purchase of shares of capital stock in the offering to all eligible 
account holders, supplemental eligible account holders, voting members 
and other persons who may subscribe for shares of capital stock under 
the plan of conversion. If the converting savings association shall have 
adopted in its plan of conversion the optional provisions set forth in 
Sec. 563b.3 (d)(5), (d)(6), or (d)(11) of this part, the applicant shall 
deliver order forms to the eligible account holders, supplemental 
eligible account holders, and voting members who requested receipt of 
the offering circular.
    (2) Each order form shall be accompanied or preceded by the final 
offering circular for the subscription offering or the public offering, 
as the case may be, and a set of detailed instructions explaining how to 
properly complete such order forms.
    (3) The maximum subscription price stated on each order form shall 
be the amount to be paid when the order form is returned. The maximum 
subscription price and the actual subscription price shall be within the 
subscription price range stated in the Office's approval and the 
offering circular. If either the maximum subscription price or the 
actual subscription price is not within the subscription price range, 
the applicant must obtain an amendment to the Office's approval. If 
appropriate, the Office will condition its approval by requiring a 
resolicitation of proxies and/or order forms. If the actual public 
offering price is less than the maximum subscription price stated on the 
order form, the actual subscription price shall be correspondingly 
reduced and the difference shall be refunded to those who have paid the 
maximum subscription price, unless the subscribers affirmatively elect 
to have the difference applied to the purchase of additional shares of 
capital stock.
    (4) Each order form shall be prepared so as to indicate to the 
person receiving it, in as simple, clear and intelligible a manner as 
possible, the actions which are required or available to him or her with 
respect to the form and the capital stock offered for purchase thereby. 
Specifically, each order form shall:
    (i) Indicate the maximum number of shares that may be purchased 
pursuant to the subscription rights;
    (ii) Indicate the period of time within which the subscription 
rights must be exercised, which period of time shall be no less than 20 
days and no more than 45 days following the date of the mailing of the 
subscription offering order form;
    (iii) State the maximum subscription price per share of capital 
stock;
    (iv) Indicate any requirements as to the minimum number of shares of 
capital stock which may be purchased;
    (v) Provide a specifically designated blank space or spaces for 
indicating the number of shares of capital stock which the eligible 
account holder or other person wishes to purchase;
    (vi) Indicate the manner of required payment and, if such payment 
may be made by withdrawal from a certificate of deposit, indicate that 
such withdrawal may be made without penalty. If payment is to be made by 
withdrawal from a savings account or certificate of deposit, a box to 
check should be provided;
    (vii) Provide specifically designated blank spaces for dating and 
signing the order form;
    (viii) Contain an acknowledgment by the account holder or other 
person signing the order form that he or she has received a final 
offering circular prior to so signing; and
    (ix) Indicate the consequences of failing to properly complete and 
return the order form, including a statement that the subscription 
rights are nontransferable and will become void at the end of the 
subscription period. The

[[Page 236]]

order form may, and the set of instructions shall, indicate the place or 
places to which the order forms are to be returned and when the order 
forms shall be deemed to be received, such as by date and time of actual 
receipt at the address indicated or by date and time of postmark.
    (5) The order form may provide that it may not be modified without 
the applicant's consent after its receipt as set forth in the order 
form. If payment is to be made by withdrawal from a savings account or 
certificate of deposit, the applicant may, but need not, cause such 
withdrawal to be made upon receipt of the order form. If such withdrawal 
is made at any time prior to the closing date of the public offering, 
the applicant shall pay interest to the account holder on the account 
withdrawn as if such amount had remained in the account from which it 
was withdrawn until such closing date.
    (h) Withdrawal from certificate accounts. Notwithstanding any 
regulatory provision regarding penalties for early withdrawal from 
certificate accounts, the applicant may allow payment for capital stock 
pursuant to the exercise of subscription rights by withdrawal from a 
certificate account without the assessment of such penalties. In the 
case of early withdrawal of only a portion of such account, the 
certificate evidencing such account shall be cancelled if the applicable 
minimum balance requirement ceases to be met. The remaining balance will 
earn interest at the passbook rate.
    (i) Period for completion of sale. The sale of all shares of capital 
stock of the converting savings association to be made under the plan of 
conversion, including any sale in a public offering or direct community 
marketing, shall be completed as promptly as possible and within 45 
calendar days after the last day of the subscription period, unless 
extended by the Office.
    (j) Interest on subscriptions and direct community offering purchase 
orders. The converting savings association shall pay interest at not 
less than the passbook rate on all amounts paid in cash or by check or 
money order to the association to purchase shares of capital stock in 
the subscription offering or direct community offering from the date 
payment is received by the association until the conversion is completed 
or terminated.
    (k) Extensions of time to complete public offering or direct 
community offering; post-effective amendments to subscription offering 
circular. (1) The Office may grant one or more extensions of the time 
required to complete the sale of all shares of capital stock under 
paragraph (i) of this section, provided that no single extension of time 
shall exceed 90 days.
    (2) Immediately upon the granting of an extension of time pursuant 
to paragraph (k)(1) of this section, the converting savings association 
shall distribute to each subscriber in the offering and, if applicable, 
each person who has ordered capital stock in the direct community 
offering, a post-effective amendment to the offering circular filed 
under an amendment to the application for conversion and declared 
effective by the Office pursuant to paragraph (k)(4) of this section 
which shall notify each subscriber and each ordering person of the 
granting of the extension of time, and of the right of each subscriber 
and each ordering person to increase, decrease or rescind this 
subscription:
    (i) At any time prior to 20 days before the end of the extension 
period; or (ii) at any time prior to the date of the commencement of the 
public offering or the direct community offering: Provided, That if the 
public offering or the direct community offering is not completed within 
20 days after its commencement, all instructions from subscribers and 
ordering persons to increase, decrease, or rescind their subscriptions 
or orders received during the 20-day offering period shall be honored by 
the converting savings association.
    (3) For the purpose of paragraph (k) of this section, the public 
offering shall be deemed to commence upon the filing with the Office of 
the preliminary offering circular for the public offering, and the 
direct community offering shall be deemed to commence upon the 
declaration of effectiveness by the Office of the final offering 
circular.

[[Page 237]]

    (4) After the expiration of subscription rights, the converting 
savings association shall file with and have declared effective by the 
Office a post-effective amendment to the offering circular delivered to 
subscribers upon the occurrence of any event, circumstance, or change of 
circumstance which would be material to the investment decision of a 
subscriber or, if applicable, a person who has ordered capital stock in 
the direct community offering.
    (5) Any post-effective amendment to an offering circular distributed 
to subscribers in the offering shall be distributed by the converting 
savings association immediately after the declaration of effectiveness 
to each subscriber, and, if applicable, each person who has ordered 
stock in the direct community offering, and the converting savings 
association shall grant to each subscriber and ordering person the right 
to increase, decrease, or rescind his or her subscription or order for a 
period which shall be no less than the greater of ten days from the date 
of the mailing of the post-effective amendment or the period remaining 
in an extension of time granted by the Office pursuant and subject to 
the provisions of paragraph (k)(2) of this section.

(1) Any application for approval that is improperly executed shall not 
be accepted for filing and shall be returned to the applicant.
    (2) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, 
any application for approval that does not contain copies of:
    (i) A plan of conversion;
    (ii) A preliminary proxy statement with signed financial statements; 
and
    (iii) A preliminary form of proxy, shall not be accepted for filing 
and shall be returned to the applicant.

Any application for approval containing a materially incomplete plan of 
conversion, proxy statement, or form of proxy may be returned by the 
Office to the applicant.
    (3) Any application for approval which contains, at a minimum, a 
materially complete plan of conversion shall be accepted for filing if 
the application for approval is accompanied by the written request of 
the applicant that the application not be reviewed by the Office until 
the applicant requests and the Office consents to the filing of the 
additional materials set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (c) Additional filing requirements. An applicant whose plan of 
conversion has been approved by the Office shall fulfill the following 
requirements.
    (1) The applicant shall file with the Office promptly after the 
meeting of association members called to consider the plan of conversion 
a certified copy of each resolution adopted at such meeting relating to 
the plan of conversion, together with the following information:
    (i) The total number of votes eligible to be cast;
    (ii) The total number of votes represented in person or by proxy at 
the meeting;
    (iii) The total number of votes cast in favor of and against each 
such matter; and
    (iv) The percentage of votes necessary to approve each such matter.

The compilation of the votes cast at the meeting may be prepared for the 
savings association by an independent public accountant or by an 
independent transfer agent.
    (2) The applicant shall file with the Office promptly after the 
meeting of association members called to consider the plan of conversion 
an opinion of counsel to the effect that:
    (i) The meeting of members was duly held in accordance with all 
requirements of applicable State and Federal law and regulation;
    (ii) All requirements of State law applicable to the conversion have 
been complied with; and

[[Page 238]]

    (iii) If the association has used proxies executed prior to the 
proxy solicitation required by Sec. 563b.6(c)(1), the authority 
conferred by such proxies includes authority to vote on the plan of 
conversion.
    (3) Each offering circular for the offering shall be prepared in 
compliance with this part and Form OC. The applicant shall file with the

    (d) Termination or amendment of charter. (1) Upon approval of a plan 
of conversion by the members of a State-chartered savings association or 
a Federal savings association which is converting to a State-chartered 
stock savings association, the charter of such savings association shall 
terminate effective upon the issuance to it of a stock charter under the 
laws of the State in which the home office of the applicant is located. 
If such converting savings association is a Federal savings association, 
its Federal charter shall promptly be surrendered to the Office for 
cancellation. A savings association converting to a State-chartered 
stock savings association shall promptly file with the Office a copy of 
the stock charter issued to it.
    (2) A mutual association converting to a Federal stock association 
shall apply to amend its charter and bylaws to read in a form consistent

shall be stated in the Office's order approving the conversion.
    (3) The corporate existence of a mutual association converting to a 
federally-chartered stock association shall not terminate, but the 
converted association shall be deemed to be a continuation of the 
association so converted. In the case of a Federal or a State-chartered 
mutual savings association converting to a State-chartered stock savings 
association, unless State law otherwise prescribes, the corporate 
existence of the converting savings association shall similarly not 
terminate and the converted savings association shall be deemed to be a 
continuation of the savings association so converted.

Whenever a requirement is made under this part for the filing of four 
copies of any document with the Office, one copy shall be filed with the 
Regional Director or his or her designee and the remaining copies with 
the Chief Counsel, Business Transactions Division, Office of Thrift 
Supervision, 1700 G Street, NW., Washington, DC 20552. Whenever a 
requirement is made under this part for the filing of ten or more copies 
of any document with the Office, three copies shall be filed with the 
Regional Director or his or her designee and the remaining copies with 
the Chief Counsel, Business Transactions Division. Whenever a 
requirement is made under this part that a document to be filed be 
manually signed, one manually signed copy shall be filed with the 
Regional Director or his or her designee and another with the Chief 
Counsel, Business Transactions Division. Other copies shall be 
conformed. Each of the copies filed under this part shall be bound, in 
one or more parts, without stiff covers. The binding shall be made on 
the side or stitching margin in such manner as to leave the reading 
matter legible.
    (2) At least two copies of every application and every amendment 
thereto filed shall be manually signed by:
    (i) A duly authorized representative of the applicant on its behalf;
    (ii) Its principal executive officer;
    (iii) Its principal financial officer;
    (iv) Its principal accounting officer; and
    (v) At least two-thirds of its directors.

pursuant to a power of attorney, four copies of such power of attorney, 
including two manually signed, shall be filed with the application.
    (4)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section, 
the filing of any application or amendment thereto under this part shall 
constitute a representation of the applicant by its duly authorized 
representative, the applicant's principal executive officer, the 
applicant's principal financial officer, and the applicant's principal 
accounting officer, and each member of the applicant's board of 
directors (whether or

[[Page 239]]

not such director has signed the application or any amendment thereto) 
severally that:
    (A) He or she has read such application or amendment;
    (B) In the opinion of each such person, he or she has made such 
examination and investigation as is necessary to enable him or her to 
express an informed opinion that such application or amendment complies 
to the best of his or her knowledge and belief with the applicable 
requirements of this part and forms prescribed hereunder; and
    (C) Each such person holds such informed opinion.
    (ii) The representations specified in paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this 
section shall not be deemed to have been made by any director of the 
applicant who did not sign the application or any amendment thereto, if, 
and only to the extent that, such director files with the Office within 
10 business days after the filing of such application or amendment a 
statement describing those portions of such filing as to which he or she 
does not so represent.
    (f) Requirements as to paper and printing. (1) Applications shall be 
filed on good quality, unglazed, white paper approximately 8\1/2\ by 13 
or 8\1/2\ by 11 inches in size, insofar as practicable. However, tables, 
charts, maps and financial statements may be on larger paper if folded 
to such sizes, and the plan of conversion, proxy statement and offering 
circular may be on smaller paper if the applicant so desires.
    (2) Applications and, insofar as practicable, all papers and 
documents filed as a part thereof, shall be printed, lithographed, 
mimeographed or type-written. However, applications for any portion 
thereof may be prepared by any similar process which, in the opinion of 
the Office, produces copies suitable for a permanent record. 
Irrespective of the process used, all copies of any such material shall 
be clear, easily readable and suitable for repeated photocopying. Debits 
in credit categories and credits in debit categories shall be designated 
so as to be clearly distinguishable as such on photocopies.
    (g) Method of preparation. Every application shall furnish 
information in item-and-answer form in response to the items of the 
appropriate form, and shall include the captions of the form, but omit 
the text of all items and instructions. Every proxy statement and 
offering circular shall present information as provided in paragraph (n) 
of this section in response to the items of the appropriate form in lieu 
of furnishing the information in item-and-answer form, and shall omit 
the captions and text of all items and instruction. Every application 
shall include a cross reference sheet showing the location in the proxy 
statement and offering circular of the response to the items of the 
appropriate form. If any such item is inapplicable, or the answer 
thereto is in the negative and is omitted, a statement to that effect 
shall be made in the cross reference sheet.
    (h) Interpretation of requirements. (1) Unless the context indicates 
otherwise, the forms require information only as to the applicant.
    (2) Whenever words relate to the future, they have reference solely 
to present intention.
    (3) Any words indicating the holder of a position or office include 
persons, by whatever titles designated, whose duties are those 
ordinarily performed by holders of such positions or offices.
    (i) Additional information. In addition to the information expressly 
required to be included in any application under this part, there shall 
be added such further material information, if any, as may be necessary 
to make the required statements, in the light of the circumstances under 
which they made, not misleading.
    (j) Information unknown or not reasonably available. Information 
required need be given only insofar as it is known or reasonably 
available to the applicant. If any required information is unknown and 
not reasonably available to the applicant, either because the obtaining 
thereof would involve unreasonable effort or expense, or because it 
rests peculiarly within the knowledge of another person not affiliated 
with the applicant, the information may be omitted, subject to the 
following conditions:
    (1) The applicant shall give such information on the subject as it 
possesses or can acquire without unreasonable

[[Page 240]]

effort or expense, together with the sources thereof.
    (2) The applicant shall include a statement either showing that 
unreasonable effort or expense would be involved or indicating the 
absence of any affiliation with the person within whose knowledge the 
information rests and stating the result of a request made to such 
person for the information.
    (k) Incorporation of certain information by reference. (1) Where an 
item in an application calls for information not required to be included 
in the proxy statement or offering circular, matter contained in any 
part of the application, including exhibits, may be incorporated by 
reference in answer, or partial answer, to such item. No information may 
be incorporated by reference in a proxy statement or offering circular, 
unless the document containing such information is attached thereto or 
is summarized or outlined as provided in paragraph (l) of this section. 
However, an offering circular may incorporate by reference the 
information contained in a proxy statement previously delivered, without 
need of summary or outline.
    (2) Material incorporated by reference shall be clearly identified 
in the reference. An express statement that the specified matter is 
incorporated by reference shall be made at the particular place in the 
application where the information is required. Matter shall not be 
incorporated by reference in any case where such incorporation would 
render the statement incomplete, unclear or confusing.
    (l) Summaries or outlines of documents. Where a summary or outline 
of the provisions of any document is required, only a brief statement 
shall be made, in succinct and condensed form, as to the most important 
provisions of the document. In addition to such statement, the summary 
or outline may incorporate by reference particular items, sections or 
paragraphs of any exhibit and may be qualified in its entirety by such 
reference.
    (m) Legibility of materials. The body of all printed plans of 
conversion, proxy statements, and offering circulars, including all 
notes to financial statements and other tabular data included therein, 
shall be in roman type at least as large and as legible as 10-point 
modern type. However, to the extent necessary for convenient 
presentation, financial statements and other tabular data, including 
tabular data in notes, may be in roman type at least as large and as 
legible as 8-point modern type. All such type shall be leaded at least 2 
points.
    (n) Presentation of information. (1) The information required in a 
proxy statement or offering circular need not follow the order of the 
items or other requirements in the appropriate form. Such information 
shall not, however, be set forth in such fashion as to obscure any of 
the required information or any information necessary to keep the 
required information from being incomplete or misleading. Where an item 
requires information to be given in tabular form it shall be given in 
substantially the tabular form specified in the item.
    (2) All information contained in a plan of conversion, proxy 
statement or offering circular shall be set forth under appropriate 
captions or headings reasonably indicative of the principal subject 
matter set forth thereunder. Except as to financial statements and other 
tabular data, all information set forth in any form under this part 
shall be divided into reasonably short paragraphs or sections.
    (3) Every proxy statement and offering circular shall include in the 
forepart thereof a reasonably detailed table of contents showing the 
subject matter of its various sections or subdivisions and the page 
number on which each such section or subdivision begins.
    (4) All information required to be included in a proxy statement or 
offering circular shall be clearly understandable without the necessity 
of referring to the particular form or to the regulations under this 
part. Except as to financial statements and information required in 
tabular form, the information set forth in a proxy statement or offering 
circular may be expressed in condensed or summarized form.
    (5) Financial statements are to be set forth in comparative form, 
and shall include the notes thereto and the accountants' certificate or 
certificates.

[[Page 241]]

Section 563c.1 of this chapter governs the certification, form and 
content of such financial statements, including the basis of 
consolidation.
    (o) Application of amendments to regulations and forms. (1) The form 
and contents of any filing made under the provisions of this part need 
conform only to the applicable regulations and forms then in effect, and 
contain the information, including financial statements specified 
therein, required at the time the filing is made, notwithstanding 
subsequent amendments to such regulations, except as otherwise provided 
in any such amendment or in paragraph (o)(2) of this section.
    (2) Whenever the Office prohibits by order or otherwise the use of 
any filing under this part, the form and contents of any filing used 
thereafter shall conform to the requirements of such order and the 
applicable regulations and forms in effect at the time such prohibition 
ceases to be effective.
    (p) Consents of experts. (1) If any accountant, attorney, investment 
banker, appraiser, or other persons whose professions give authority to 
a statement made in any application under this part are named as having 
prepared, reviewed, passed upon, or certified any part thereof, or any 
report or valuation for use in connection therewith, the written consent 
of such person shall be filed with the application. If any portion of a 
report of an expert is quoted or summarized as such in any filing under 
this part, the written consent of the expert shall expressly state that 
the expert consents to such quotation or summarization.
    (2) All written consents filed pursuant to paragraph (p) of this 
section shall be dated and signed manually. A list of such consents 
shall be filed with the application. Where the consent of the expert is 
contained in his or her report, a reference shall be made in the list to 
the report containing such consent.
    (q) Consents of persons about to become directors. If any person who 
has not signed an application is named in the proxy statement or 
offering circular as about to become a director, the written consent of 
such person shall be filed with the appropriate form.
    (r) Date of filing. The date on which any documents are actually 
received by the Office in the manner prescribed in this part shall be 
the date of filing thereof.
    (s) Amendments. All amendments to any application under this part 
shall be filed under cover of an appropriate facing sheet, shall be 
numbered consecutively in the order in which filed, and shall conform to 
all pertinent regulations applicable to the type of application which 
they amend.
    (t) Pre-filing conferences with applicants. (1) The staff of the 
Office, including the Regional Director or his or her designee, will be 
available for conferences with prospective applicants or their 
representatives in advance of filing an application to convert. These 
conferences may be held for the purpose of discussing generally the 
problems confronting an applicant in effecting conversion or to resolve 
specific problems of an unusual nature.
    (2) Pre-filing review of an application may be refused by the staff 
of the Office if such review would delay the examination and processing 
of material which has already been filed or would favor certain 
applicants at the expense of others. In any conference under paragraph 
(t) of this section, the staff of the Office will not undertake to 
prepare material for filing but will limit themselves to indicating the 
kind of information required, leaving the actual drafting to the 
applicant and its representatives.
    (u) Review of the Office's action. Any person aggrieved by a final 
action of the Office which approves, with or without conditions, or 
disapproves a plan of conversion pursuant to this part may obtain review 
of such action by filing in the court of appeals of the United States 
for the circuit in which the principal office or residence of such 
person is located, or in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia Circuit, a written petition praying that the final action of 
the Office be modified, terminated or set aside. Such petition must be 
filed within 30 days after publication of notice of such final action in 
the Federal Register, or 30 days after the mailing by the applicant of 
the notice to members as provided for in Sec. 563b.6(c) of this part, 
whichever

[[Page 242]]

is later. The further procedure for review is as follows: A copy of the 
petition is forthwith transmitted to the Office by the clerk of the 
court and thereupon the Office files in the court the record in the 
proceeding, as provided in section 2112 of title 28 of the U.S. Code. 
Upon the filing of the petition, the court has jurisdiction, which upon 
the filing of the record is exclusive, to affirm, modify, terminate, or 
set aside in whole or in part, the final action of the Office. Review of 
such proceedings is had as provided in chapter 7 of title 5 of the U.S. 
Code. The judgment and decree of the court is final, except that they 
are subject to review by the Supreme Court upon certiorari as provided 
in section 1254 of title 28 of the U.S. Code.
    (v) Post-conversion reports. The applicant shall file such post-
conversion reports concerning its conversion as the Office may require.

Sec. 563b.9  Conversion of a savings association in connection with the formation of a holding company.

    A savings association may convert to the stock form pursuant to this 
subpart A as part of a transaction in which a holding company is 
organized to acquire upon issuance all the capital stock of the 
converted savings association. In such a transaction eligible account 
holders, supplemental eligible account holders, and voting members of 
the converting savings association shall receive, without payment, 
nontransferable rights under Sec. 563b.3(c)(2), (c)(4), and (c)(5) of 
this part to purchase capital stock of the newly-formed holding company 
in lieu of capital stock of the converting association. Unless clearly 
inapplicable, all of the requirements of this subpart A shall apply to a 
conversion under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 563b.10  Conversion of a savings association through merger with an existing holding company or stock savings association.

    A savings association that qualifies for a voluntary supervisory 
conversion under subpart C of this part may convert to stock form by 
merging with an existing holding company or interim Federal or state 
chartered stock association in a transaction in which stock of the 
existing holding company or resulting association is issued.
[59 FR 22735, May 3, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 563b.11  Convenience and needs considerations.

    In reviewing an application under this subpart, the Office will 
examine the extent to which the conversion will affect the convenience 
and needs of the communities to be served by the converted savings 
association. The Office will review the applicant's record under part 
563e of this chapter. In addition, the Office will scrutinize the 
business plan of the applicant. Each applicant must demonstrate that the 
proposed deployment of proceeds contained in its business plan will help 
meet the credit and lending needs of the communities served by the 
applicant. Also, the Office will consider other relevant factors 
relating to the association's performance in meeting the convenience and 
needs of the community. Based on an assessment of the applicant's record 
under part 563e of this chapter, the applicant's business plan and other 
relevant factors, the Office may approve the application, deny the 
application, or approve the application on the condition that the 
applicant improve certain aspects of its CRA performance record or

<R04>
           Subpart C--Voluntary Supervisory Stock Conversions


<R05>
Sec. 563b.20  Scope of subpart.

    (a) Except as the Office may otherwise determine, the provisions of 
this subpart shall govern the voluntary supervisory conversion from the 
mutual to stock form of savings associations as authorized, ordered or 
concurred in by the Office or the FDIC pursuant to sections 5(i) (1) and 
(2), 5(o)(2)(C), and 5(p) of the Home Owners' Loan Act, 12 U.S.C. 
1464(i) (1), (2), (o)(2)(C), and (p).

[[Page 243]]

    (b) All of the provisions of Subpart A of this part shall apply to a 
supervisory conversion undertaken pursuant to this subpart unless 
clearly inapplicable.


<R05>
Sec. 563b.21  Voluntary supervisory conversions.

    (a) A voluntary supervisory conversion of a savings association 
pursuant to this subpart may involve the sale of a converting 
association's shares directly to an acquiror(s), which may be a person, 
company, depository institution, or depository institution holding 
company. The conversion may result in the converting association being 
merged into or consolidated with an existing or newly created depository 
institution, but only as authorized by and in accordance with any 
limitations or restrictions imposed by applicable laws and regulations.
    (b) A majority of the directors of the converting association must 
adopt a plan of voluntary supervisory conversion that complies with the 
provisions of this subpart. The members of the association have no 
rights of approval or participation in the voluntary supervisory 
conversion, or to the continuance of any legal or beneficial ownership 
interests in the converted association, unless otherwise provided by the 
OTS. The members shall have interests in a liquidation account, if one 
is established, pursuant to Sec. 563b.28 of this subpart.
[57 FR 49380, Nov. 2, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 563b.22  Purpose of subpart.

    The purpose of this subpart is to give guidance to savings 
associations and potential acquirors of the stock of converting savings 
associations regarding the qualification of savings associations for a 
supervisory conversion under this subpart, and guidance as to the extent 
to which the Office will permit, by means of a supervisory conversion, 
deviations from the substantive and procedural requirements adopted by 
the Office for standard conversions under subpart A of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 563b.23  Authorization of supervisory conversions.

    (a) The OTS may authorize or order a voluntary supervisory 
conversion if a savings association files an application containing the 
information and documents specified in Sec. 563b.27 of this subpart, in 
accordance with the procedures specified in Sec. 563b.29 of this 
subpart, and meets the qualification standards specified in Sec. 563b.24 
of this subpart. If the OTS authorizes or orders a supervisory stock 
conversion, the conditions specified in Sec. 563b.30 of this subpart 
must be fulfilled and the resulting institution and the purchaser(s) of 
its conversion stock must comply with the requirements of Sec. 563b.31 
of this subpart.
    (b) In connection with approval of an association's conversion, the 
OTS may impose conditions and restrictions on the converting or 
resulting institution, the acquiror, and controlling parties, directors 
and officers of either, to prevent unsafe or unsound practices, to 
protect the deposit insurance funds and the public interest, and to 
prevent potential injury or detriment to the converting or resulting 
association. The OTS generally will exercise this authority consistent 
with applicable supervisory policies.
    (c) The OTS may deny an association's conversion if the Office 
determines that the converting or resulting association, the acquiror, 
or controlling parties or directors and officers of either, have engaged 
in unsafe or unsound practices in connection with the transaction, or 
that the transaction is detrimental to or would cause potential injury 
to the converting or resulting association, the Federal deposit 
insurance funds or is contrary to the public interest.
    (d) For three years following the date of completion of a voluntary 
supervisory conversion, neither any controlling shareholder nor the 
resulting institution may acquire shares from minority shareholders 
without the prior approval of the OTS.
[57 FR 49381, Nov. 2, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 563b.24  Qualification for supervisory conversion of SAIF-insured associations.

    (a) The OTS in its discretion may authorize the supervisory 
conversion of a SAIF-insured savings association upon finding that the 
association:

[[Page 244]]

    (1) Is significantly undercapitalized; and
    (2) Would be a viable entity as determined under Sec. 563b.26 of 
this subpart, following the conversion.
    (b) The OTS in its discretion also may authorize the supervisory 
conversion of a SAIF-insured savings association upon finding that the 
association:
    (1) Is undercapitalized;
    (2) Demonstrates by clear evidence that a standard conversion that 
would raise sufficient capital to enable the association to be 
adequately capitalized is not feasible; and
    (3) Would be a viable entity as determined under Sec. 563b.26 of 
this subpart, following the conversion.
    (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the OTS also may 
authorize, (or in the case of a Federal savings association require), 
the conversion of a savings association into a Federal savings 
association pursuant to section 5(p) of the Home Owners' Loan Act, 12 
U.S.C. 1464(p).
[57 FR 49381, Nov. 2, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 563b.25  Qualification for supervisory conversion of BIF-insured savings associations.

    (a) The Office may, in its discretion, concur with the determination 
of the FDIC that a BIF-insured mutual savings bank qualifies for a 
voluntary supervisory conversion if the FDIC certifies to the Office in 
accordance with section 5(o)(2)(C) of the Home Owners' Loan Act, 12 
U.S.C. 1464(o)(2)(C), that severe financial conditions exist that 
threaten the stability of the savings bank and that the voluntary 
supervisory conversion is likely to improve the financial condition of 
the savings bank; or
    (b) The Office may, in its discretion, authorize a BIF-insured 
savings association to undergo a voluntary supervisory conversion to 
Federal stock form if the following conditions have been met:
    (1) The association's liabilities exceed its assets, as calculated 
under generally accepted accounting principles, assuming the association 
is a going concern; and
    (2)(i) A sufficient amount of permanent capital stock is issued in 
connection with the voluntary supervisory conversion to allow the 
association to meet its capital requirement as established by the FDIC 
immediately upon completion of the conversion; or
    (ii) The FDIC has indicated that, based upon the association's 
proposed post-conversion operating plan, the association would achieve a 
capital level acceptable to the FDIC within a period satisfactory to the 
FDIC.


<R05>
Sec. 563b.26  Viability of converted savings association.

    (a) An application of a SAIF-insured savings association to convert 
pursuant to this subpart may be approved by the Office in its discretion 
if it finds that the SAIF-insured savings association will be a ``viable 
entity'' following the conversion.
    (b) A converting SAIF-insured association is a ``viable entity'' if:
    (1) As part of the plan of conversion:
    (i) The capital being infused into the association through its 
conversion is sufficient to cause the converted or resulting association 
to be adequately capitalized; provided that the OTS, in its discretion, 
may require higher capitalization as it deems appropriate for safety and 
soundness reasons; and
    (ii) The converting association, its proposed conversion, and any 
acquiror(s) comply with applicable supervisory policies; and
    (2) The transaction taken as a whole is in the best interest of, and 
does not present potential for injury or detriment to, the converting 
association, the federal deposit insurance funds, or the public 
interest.

Sec. 563b.28  Liquidation account.

    A liquidation account must be established in accordance with the 
requirements set forth at Sec. 563b.3(f) of this part; provided,

[57 FR 49382, Nov. 2, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 563b.29  Procedural requirements.

    (a) Filing of voluntary supervisory conversion application. A 
savings association seeking to convert pursuant to this subpart shall 
file with the OTS the information and documents specified in 
Sec. 563b.27 of this subpart.
    (b) Incomplete application. An application for supervisory stock 
conversion that does not contain all of the applicable information and 
documents specified in Sec. 563b.27 of this part shall constitute an 
incomplete application, and the Regional Director shall continue to seek 
other appropriate supervisory resolutions of the association's financial 
condition pending the filing of a complete application.
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) Termination or amendment of charter. (1) Upon approval by the 
Office of a plan of supervisory stock conversion of a state-chartered 
savings association or a federally-chartered savings association which 
is converting to a state-chartered stock savings association, the mutual 
charter of such savings association shall terminate upon the issuance to 
it of a stock charter under the laws of the state in which its home 
office is located. If such converting savings association is a 
federally-chartered savings association, its federal charter shall be 
surrendered promptly to the Office for cancellation. A savings 
association converting to a state-chartered stock savings association 
shall promptly file with the Office a copy of the stock charter issued 
to it.
    (2) A mutual savings association converting to a federally-chartered 
stock savings association shall apply to amend its charter and bylaws to 
read in a form consistent with part 552 of this chapter. The effective 
date of such amendment shall be stated in the Office's order approving 
the conversion.
    (3) The corporate existence of a mutual savings association 
converting to a federally-chartered stock savings association shall not 
terminate, but the converted association shall be deemed to be a 
continuation of the association so converted. In the case of a federal 
or state-chartered mutual savings association converting to a state-
chartered stock savings association, unless state law otherwise 
prescribes, the corporate existence of the converting mutual savings 
association shall similarly not terminate and the converted savings 
association shall be deemed to be a continuation of the savings 
association so converted.

    (a) Completion of the sale of conversion stock within a maximum of 
three months after the Office approves the application, or within such 
additional period as the OTS may for good cause grant;
    (b) Compliance with all filing requirements of 12 CFR parts 563b and

Sec. 563b.32  Expenses.

    Expenses incurred by a savings association in connection with its 
voluntary supervisory conversion application shall be reasonable and, 
with respect to a SAIF-insured savings association, shall not be in an 
amount such that the payment of such expenses would render the proceeds 
to the association from the sale of its conversion stock insufficient to 
satisfy the viability requirement of Sec. 563b.26 of this subpart.

Sec. 563b.33  Employment contracts.

    An applicant for voluntary supervisory conversion must justify any 
employment contract incidental to the conversion, and otherwise 
demonstrate that the making of such an employment contract by a savings 
association would not be an unsafe or unsound practice or represent a 
sale of control. The Office shall determine the permissibility of such 
contract based upon, at a minimum, the applicant's justification for the 
contract, the term, salary, and severance provisions of the contract, 
the identity and background of the officer or employee who is subject to 
the employment contract, and the amount of the conversion stock to be 
purchased by such officer or employee or his or her affiliates or 
associates. Any employment contract incident to a voluntary supervisory 
conversion with a term in excess of one year granted to existing 
management of a savings association generally will be disfavored.

solicitations comply with Sec. 563b.5(g)(1).

          Item 4. Voting Rights and Vote Required for Approval

    (a) Describe briefly the voting rights of each class of association 
members, state the approximate total number of votes entitled to be cast

particular, see items 401 and 404 of Regulation S-K, 17 CFR 229.401 and 
404, and item 6 of Regulation 14A, 17 CFR 240.14a-101. Unless the 
context otherwise requires, the words ``registrant'' and ``issuer'' in 
those regulations shall refer to the applicant and the word 
``Commission'' shall refer to the Office.
    (b) State whether control of the applicant has been exercised 
through the use of proxies and the nature of such control.

                     Item 6. Management Remuneration

to be disclosed in a registration or proxy statement filed with the 
Office under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78a et seq. 
In particular, see item 402 of Regulation S-K, 17 CFR 229.402, and item 
7 of Regulation 14A, 17 CFR 240.14a-101. Unless the context otherwise 
requires, the words ``registrant'' and ``Commission'' in those 
regulations shall refer to the applicant and to the Office, 
respectively.

                    Item 7. Business of the Applicant

    (a) Narrative description of business. (1) Discuss briefly the 
organizational history of the applicant, including the year of 
organization, the identity of the chartering authority, and any material 
charter conversions.
    (2) Describe the business conducted and intended to be conducted by 
the applicant and

[[Page 252]]

its subsidiaries. This should include a description of the general 
development of the business of the applicant and any predecessor(s) 
during the past five years, or such shorter period as the applicant may 
have been engaged in business. Information shall be disclosed for 
earlier periods if material to an understanding of the general 
development of the business. Any material changes in the mode of 
conducting the business should be discussed.
    (3) Consideration should be given to inclusion of a description of 
the applicant's historical practices, including the average remaining 
term to maturity of its portfolio of mortgage loans, and present 
intention regarding the making of loans, whether real estate or other, 
the nature of security received, the terms of loans, whether carrying 
fixed or variable interest rates, and the retention of loans or their 
resale in secondary mortgage markets. Historical description might 
require a general identification of the magnitude of various activities.
    (4) Also explain any significant impact to the association as a 
result of any material acquisitions.
    (b) Selected financial data. Furnish in comparative columnar form a 
summary of selected financial data for the applicant for:
    (1) Each of the last five fiscal years of the applicant (or for the 
life of the applicant and its predecessors, if less); and
    (2) Any additional fiscal years necessary to keep the summary from 
being misleading.
    Instructions. 1. The purpose of the summary of selected financial 
data shall be to supply in convenient and readable format selected data 
which highlight significant trends in the applicant's financial 
condition and results of operations.
    2. Subject to appropriate variation to conform to the nature of the 
applicant's business, the following items, as a minimum, shall be 
included in the summary: Total interest income; total interest expense; 
income (loss) from continuing operations; net income; total loans; total 
investments; total assets; total savings; total borrowings; total 
regulatory capital; and total number of customer service facilities 
indicating the number which provide full service. Applicants may include 
additional items which they believe would enhance understanding and 
highlight trends in their financial condition and results of operations. 
Briefly describe, or cross reference to a discussion of, factors such as 
accounting changes, business combinations, or dispositions of business 
operations that materially affect the comparability of the information 
reflected in selected financial data. Discussion of, or reference to, 
any material uncertainties should also be included where those matters 
might cause the data reflected not to be indicative of the applicant's 
future financial condition or results of operations.
    3. Those applicants which elect to provide five-year summary 
information in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards 
Board's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 89 (``SFAS 89'') 
``Financial Reporting and Changing Prices,'' may combine such 
information with the selected financial data appearing pursuant to this 
item.
    4. All references to the applicant in the summary and in these 
instructions shall mean the applicant and its consolidated subsidiaries.
    5. If interim-period financial statements are included, or are 
required to be included by item 14, applicants should update the 
selected financial data for the interim period to reflect any material 
change in the trends indicated; where such updating information is 
necessary, applicants shall provide the information on a comparative 
basis unless not necessary to an understanding of the updating 
information.
    (c) Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and 
results of operations. (1) Discuss applicant's financial condition, 
changes in financial condition, and results of operations. The 
discussion shall provide information as specified in paragraphs (i), 
(ii), and (iii) of this paragraph with respect to liquidity, capital 
resources, and results of operations and also should provide all other 
information which the applicant believes to be necessary to an 
understanding of its financial condition, changes in financial 
condition, and results of operations. Significant business combinations 
should be discussed. Discussion of liquidity and capital resources may 
be combined whenever the two topics are interrelated. Where in the 
applicant's judgment a discussion of subdivisions of the applicant's 
business would be appropriate to an understanding of the business, the 
discussion should focus on each relevant, reportable segment or other 
subdivision of the business and on the applicant as a whole.
    (i) Liquidity. Identify any known trends or any known demands, 
commitments, events, or uncertainties which will result in or which are 
reasonably likely to result in the applicant's liquidity increasing or 
decreasing in any material way. If a material deficiency is identified, 
indicate the course of action which the applicant has taken or proposes 
to take to remedy the deficiency. Identify and separately describe 
internal and external sources of liquidity, and briefly discuss any 
material unused sources of liquid assets. Comment on maturity imbalances 
between assets and liabilities and planned activities in the secondary 
mortgage market.
    (ii) Committed resources. (A) Describe the applicant's material 
commitments for loan fundings or other expenditures as of the end of the 
latest fiscal period and indicate the general purpose of the commitments 
and the

[[Page 253]]

anticipated source of funds needed to fulfill the commitments.
    (B) Describe any known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in 
the applicant's committed resources. Indicate any expected material 
changes in the mix and the relative cost of the resources. This 
discussion should consider changes between savings, equity, debt, and 
any off-balance-sheet financing arrangements.
    (iii) Results of operations. (A) Describe any unusual or infrequent 
events or transactions or any significant economic changes that 
materially affected the amount or reported income from continuing 
operations and, in each case, indicate the extent to which income was 
affected. In addition, describe any other significant components of 
revenues or expenses which, in the applicant's judgment, should be 
described in order to understand the applicant's results of operations.
    (B) Describe any known trends or uncertainties which have had, or 
which the applicant reasonably expects will have, a materially favorable 
or unfavorable impact on net sales or revenues or income from continuing 
operations. If the applicant knows of events which will cause a material 
change in the relationship between costs and revenues (such as known 
future increases in costs of money or interest rates) the change in the 
relationship should be disclosed.
    (C) To the extent that the financial statements disclose material 
increases in interest expense, provide a narrative discussion of the 
extent to which the increases are attributable to increases in rates or 
to increases in volume.
    (D) For the three most recent fiscal years of the applicant, or for 
those fiscal years in which the applicant has been engaged in business, 
whichever period is shorter, discuss the impact of inflation and 
changing prices on the applicant's revenues and on income from 
continuing operations.
    (E) For the most recent financial statement presented, discuss any 
unusual risk characteristics in the assets of the applicant. This would 
include real estate development, significant amounts of commercial real 
estate as loan collateral, and any other significant risk factors 
inherent in the applicant's lending or investment portfolios, including 
significant increases in amounts of nonaccrual, past due, restructured, 
and potential problem loans (see Securities and Exchange Commission's 
Securities Act Industry Guide 3, section III C).
    Instructions. 1. The applicant's discussion and analysis shall be of 
the financial statements and of other statistical data which the 
applicant believes will enhance a reader's understanding of its 
financial condition, changes in financial condition, and results of 
operations. Generally, the discussion should cover the three-year period 
covered by the financial statements and should utilize year-to-year 
comparisons or other formats which in the applicant's judgment enhance a 
reader's understanding. However, where trend information is relevant, 
reference to the five-year selected financial data appearing in item 
7(b) above may be necessary.
    2. The purpose of the discussion and analysis should be to provide 
to investors and other users information relevant to an assessment of 
the financial condition and results of operations of the applicant as 
determined by evaluating the amounts and certainty of cash flows from 
operations and from outside sources. The information provided in this 
item 7(c) need only include that which is available to the applicant 
without undue effort or expense and which does not clearly appear in the 
applicant's financial statements.
    3. The discussion and analysis should specifically focus on material 
events and uncertainties known to management which would cause reported 
financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future 
operating results or of future financial condition. This would include 
description and amounts of (a) matters which would have an impact on 
future operations and have not had an impact in the past, and (b) 
matters which have had an impact on reported operations and are not 
expected to have an impact upon future operations.
    4. Where the consolidated financial statements reveal material 
changes from year to year in one or more line items, the causes for the 
changes should be described to the extent necessary to an understanding 
of the applicant's business as a whole; provided, however, if the causes 
for a change in one line item also relate to other line items, no 
repetition is required and a line-by-line analysis of the financial 
statements as a whole is not required or generally appropriate. 
Applicants need not recite the amounts of changes from year to year 
which are readily computable from the financial statements. The 
discussion should not merely repeat numerical data contained in the 
consolidated financial statements.
    5. The term ``liquidity'' as used in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this 
item 7 refers to the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate 
amounts of cash to meet the enterprise's needs for cash. Except where it 
is otherwise clear from the discussion, the applicant should indicate 
those balance sheet conditions or income or cash flow items which the 
applicant believes may be indicators of its liquidity condition. 
Liquidity generally should be discussed on both a long-term and short-
term basis. The issue of liquidity should be discussed in the context of 
the applicant's own business or businesses. Liquidity does not 
necessarily mean ``liquid assets'' as defined in the liquidity 
regulations of the Office.

[[Page 254]]

    6. Applicants are encouraged, but not required, to supply forward-
looking information. This is to be distinguished from presently known 
data which will have an impact upon future operating results, such as 
known future increases in rates or other costs. This latter data is 
required to be disclosed. Any forward-looking information supplied is 
hereby expressly covered by the safe-harbor rule for projections, 
Sec. 563d.3b-6, under the circumstances specified in that rule.
    7. Applicants which elect to provide narrative explanations of 
supplementary information disclosed in accordance with SFAS 89 may 
combine the explanations with their discussion and analysis required 
pursuant to this provision or they may supply the information 
separately. If the information is combined, it shall be located in 
reasonable proximity to the discussion and analysis. If the information 
is not combined, the discussion of the impact of inflation otherwise 
required by this item may be omitted if there is an appropriate cross 
reference to the explanations provided pursuant to SFAS 89.
    8. Applicants which elect not to provide explanations of 
supplementary information disclosed in accordance with SFAS 89 may 
discuss the effects of inflation and changes in prices in whatever 
manner appears appropriate under the circumstances. Although voluntary 
compliance with SFAS 89 is encouraged, all that is required is a brief 
textual presentation of management's views. No specific numerical 
financial data need be presented.
    9. All references to the applicant in the discussion and in these 
instructions shall mean the applicant and its consolidated subsidiaries.
    (2) If interim-period financial statements are included or are 
required to be included by item 14, a management's discussion and 
analysis of the financial condition and results of operations shall be 
provided to enable the reader to assess material changes in financial 
condition and results of operations between the periods specified in 
subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this paragraph (2). The discussion and 
analysis shall include a discussion of material changes in those items 
specifically listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this item 7, except that the 
impact of inflation and changing prices on operations for interim 
periods need not be addressed.
    (i) Material changes in financial condition. Discuss any material 
changes in financial condition from the end of the preceding fiscal year 
to the date of the most recent interim balance sheet provided. If the 
interim financial statements include an interim balance sheet as of the 
corresponding interim date of the preceding fiscal year, any material 
change in financial condition from that date to the date of the most 
recent interim balance sheet provided shall also be discussed. If 
discussions of changes from both the end and the corresponding interim 
date of the preceding fiscal year are required, the discussions may be 
combined at the discretion of the applicant.
    (ii) Material changes in results of operations. Discuss any material 
changes in the applicant's results of operations with respect to the 
most recent fiscal year-to-date period for which an income statement is 
provided and the corresponding year-to-date period of the preceding 
fiscal year. If the applicant is required to or has elected to provide 
an income statement for the most recent fiscal year quarter, the 
discussion also shall cover material changes with respect to that fiscal 
quarter and the corresponding fiscal quarter in the preceding fiscal 
year. In addition, if the applicant has elected to provide an income 
statement for the 12-month period ended as of the date of the most 
recent interim balance sheet provided, the discussion shall also cover 
material changes with respect to that 12-month period and the 12-month 
period ended as of the corresponding interim balance sheet date of the 
preceding fiscal year.
    Instructions. 1. If interim financial statements are presented 
together with financial statements for full fiscal years, the discussion 
of the interim financial information shall be prepared pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(2) and the discussion of the full fiscal year information 
shall be prepared pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this item 7. Such 
discussions may be combined.
    2. The discussion and analysis required by this paragraph (c)(2) is 
required to focus only on material changes. Where the interim financial 
statements reveal material change from period to period in one or more 
significant line items, the causes for the changes should be described 
if they have not already been disclosed; however, if the causes for a 
change in one line item also relate to other line items, no repetition 
is required. Applicants need not recite the amounts of changes from 
period to period which are readily computable from the financial 
statements. This discussion should not merely repeat numerical data 
contained in the financial statements. The information provided should 
include that which is available to the applicant without undue effort or 
expense and which does not clearly appear in the applicant's interim 
financial statements.
    3. The applicant's discussion of material changes in results of 
operations should identify any significant elements of the applicant's 
income or loss from continuing operations which do not arise from or are 
not necessarily representative of the applicant's ongoing business.
    4. Applicants are encouraged but are not required to discuss 
forward-looking information. Any forward-looking information supplied is 
expressly covered by the safe-harbor

[[Page 255]]

rule for projections, Sec. 563d.3b-6, under the circumstances specified 
in that rule.
    (d) Lending activities. (1) Briefly describe the applicable Federal 
and State restrictions on the lending activities of the applicant, 
including applicable laws affecting mortgage loan interest rates. Also 
briefly describe the applicant's general policy concerning loan-to-value 
ratios; customary methods of obtaining loan originations, such as the 
use of loan consultants; approval of properties as security for loans; 
the use of a loan committee, if any; and policies as to requiring title, 
fire, and casualty insurance on security properties. Indicate the 
applicant's general future intentions with respect to activities in 
secondary mortgage markets, including transactions with the Federal Home 
Loan Mortgage Corporation or mortgage bankers. If significant, indicate 
loan service fee income as a percentage of net interest income for the 
years required by item 14(b).
    (2) As to the lending area of the applicant, describe briefly (i) 
the lending area restrictions, if any, applicable to the applicant, (ii) 
the areas in which the applicant normally lends, and (iii) any material 
loan concentration areas of the applicant. The descriptions may include 
maps illustrating one or more of these areas. Furnish an estimate of the 
housing vacancy rates in areas where the applicant's loan concentrations 
are located, if practicable.
    (3) Describe briefly the general long-term nature of investment in 
mortgage loans and the consequent effect upon the earnings spread of 
savings associations. State the normal maturity of loans made by the 
applicant on the security of single-family dwellings and furnish an 
estimate as to the average length of time the loans are outstanding.
    (4) For each of the periods required by item 14(b), set forth in

yield, the following:
    (i) Average yield during the period on: (A) Loan portfolio, (B)

earnings equaling the difference between the dollar amount of interest 
earned and paid). Average interest-earning assets should be determined

    (v) For each of the periods required by item 14(b), set forth in 
tabular form: (A) The dollar amount of change in interest income and (B)

volume multiplied by old rate), (2) changes in rates (change in rate 
multiplied by old volume), and (3) changes in rate-volume (change in 
rate multiplied by the change in volume). The rate/volume variances

due after one year which have predetermined interest rates and floating 
or adjustable interest rates.
    Instructions. 1. Scheduled principal repayments should be reported 
in the maturity category in which the payment is due.
    2. Demand loans, loans having no stated schedule of repayments and 
no stated maturity, and overdrafts should be reported as due in one year 
or less.
    3. Determinations of maturities should be based upon contract terms. 
However, such terms may vary due to the applicant's ``rollover policy,'' 
in which case the maturity should be revised as appropriate and the 
rollover policy should be briefly discussed.
    (7) Describe briefly the risk elements within the loan and 
investment portfolios including the applicant's customary procedures

state sources, if such total is significant.
    (2) Set forth in tabular form the amounts of time deposit accounts 
by categories of interest rates as of the dates of each balance sheet 
filed. Each interest-rate category should not be more than 200 basis 
points. As of the date of the latest balance sheet, set forth, in 
tabular form for each interest-rate category, the amounts of savings 
maturing during each of the three years following the balance sheet date 
and the total maturing thereafter.
    (3) Disclose the weighted-average rate and general terms (as well as 
formal provisions for the extension of the maturity) of each category of 
short-term borrowings required by Balance Sheet Caption 14, 
Sec. 563c.102, along with the maximum amount of borrowings in each 
category outstanding at any month-end during each period for which an 
end-of-period balance sheet is required. In addition, disclose the 
approximate average short-term borrowings outstanding during the period 
and the approximate weighted-average interest rate (and a brief 
description of the means used to compute such average) for such 
aggregate short-term borrowings. The disclosure required by this

particular category when the aggregate amount of such borrowings at the 
balance sheet date does not exceed one percent of assets at that date. 
Notwithstanding this reporting threshold, if the weighted average of 
such borrowings outstanding during the year exceeds one percent of 
assets at year-end and significantly exceeds the amount of such 
borrowings at year-end, the disclosure called for by this paragraph (3) 
should be furnished. This information is not required to be given for 
any category of short-term borrowings for which the average balance 
outstanding during the period was less than 30 percent of stockholders 
equity at the end of the period.

    3. An offering circular for the subscription offering in ``wrap 
around'' form distributed to association members and other persons who 
have previously been furnished a copy of the proxy statement need not 
contain the proxy statement as an attachment provided such offering 
circular states that a copy of the proxy statement has previously been 
furnished to such persons and that an additional copy thereof will be 
furnished promptly upon request to the applicant (with the telephone 
number and mailing address of the applicant stated).

             Item 2. Additional Current Information Required

    Each offering circular shall, as of its respective dates of 
issuance, include, to the extent available, the following additional 
current information to the extent that such information is not already

    (f) Any other information necessary to make such offering circular

addition, a subscription offering circular shall contain any more recent

offering or public offering pursuant to this paragraph (f).

            Item 3. Statement Required in Offering Circulars

    There shall be set forth on the outside cover page of every offering

Roman type at least as large as ten-point modern type and at least two 
points leaded:

  THESE SHARES HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE OFFICE OF 
   THRIFT SUPERVISION NOR HAS SUCH OFFICE PASSED UPON THE ACCURACY OR 
 ADEQUACY OF THIS OFFERING CIRCULAR. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY 
                              IS UNLAWFUL.

                  Item 4. Preliminary Offering Circular

    The outside front cover page of any preliminary offering circular 
shall bear, in red ink, the caption ``Preliminary Offering Circular,'' 
the date of its issuance, and the following statement printed in type as 
large as that used generally in the body of such offering circular.
    ``This offering circular has been filed with the Office of Thrift 
Supervision, but has not been authorized for use in final form. 
Information contained herein is subject to completion or amendment. The 
shares covered hereby may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted 
prior to the time the offering circular is declared effective by the 
Office of Thrift Supervision. The offering circular shall not constitute 
an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there 
be any sale of these shares in any State in which such offer, 
solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or 
qualification under the securities laws of any such State.''

   Item 5. Information with Respect to Exercise of Subscription Rights

    Any offering circular which is required to be delivered to 
subscribers shall describe all

[[Page 262]]

material terms of the offering relating to the exercise of subscription

    Each offering circular shall describe the material terms of the plan 
or plans of distribution for all unsubscribed shares of capital stock to 
the extent such description is not already in the proxy statement, 
including the following:
    (a) If the shares are to be offered through underwriters, the 
outside front cover page of both offering circulars shall give the 
information called for by this paragraph. In the case of the offering 
circular for any public offering, such information shall be given in 
substantially the tabular form set forth below. In any other case, the 
information may be given in narrative form. If the information is not 
known at the time of the subscription offering, so state and estimate.

                                                                 Underwriting discounts                         
                                            Price to public         and commissions       Proceeds to applicant

  Total..............................  $______................  $______................  $______                
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) An offering circular for a public offering or direct community 
marketing, where the plan of conversion does not contain the optional 
provision permitted by Sec. 563b.3(d)(11), may omit the description 
relating to the exercise of subscription rights required by item 5.
    (c) If any shares are to be offered through underwriters, the 
offering circular for the public offering shall state the names of the 
principal underwriters and the respective amounts underwritten by each. 
The names of the principal underwriters other than the managing 
underwriters and the respective amounts to be underwritten may be 
omitted from the offering circular for the subscription offering, unless 
the plan of conversion contains the optional provision permitted by 
Sec. 563b.3(d)(11). Each offering circular shall identify each principal 
underwriter having a material relationship to the applicant and state 
the nature of the relationship. Each offering circular shall state 
briefly the nature of the underwriter's obligation to take the 
unsubscribed shares.
    (d) The offering circular for the public offering shall state 
briefly the discounts and commissions to be allowed or paid to dealers 
in connection with the sale of the unsubscribed shares. Such information 
may be omitted from the offering circular for any subscription offering, 
unless the plan of conversion contains the optional provision permitted 
by Sec. 563b.3(d)(11).
    (e) If any shares are to be offered through underwriters, the 
offering circular for the public offering shall identify any principal 
underwriter that intends to confirm sales to any accounts over which it 
exercises discretionary authority and include an estimate of the number 
of shares so intended to be confirmed. Such information may be omitted 
from the offering circular for any subscription offering.
    Instructions. 1. Commissions include all cash, securities, 
contracts, or anything else of value, paid, to be set aside, disposed 
of, or understandings made with or for the benefit of any persons in 
which any underwriter or dealer is interested, in connection with the 
sale of the shares.
    2. Only commissions paid by the applicant in cash are to be included 
in the table. Any other consideration to the underwriters shall be set 
forth following the table with a reference thereto in the second column 
of the table. Any finder's fees or similar payments shall be 
appropriately disclosed.
    3. All that is required as to the nature of the underwriters' 
obligation is whether the underwriters are or will be committed to take 
and to pay for all of the shares if any are taken, or whether it is 
merely an agency or ``best efforts'' arrangement under which the 
underwriters are required to take and pay for only such shares as they 
may sell to the public. Conditions precedent to the underwriters' taking 
the shares, including customary ``market outs,'' need not be described. 
If a ``best efforts'' arrangement is used, describe any standby 
commitments for shares not sold.
    (f) If any shares are to be sold by the converting savings 
association through a direct community marketing, indicate the timing of 
the offering, the geographical area where the offering will be made, the 
method to be employed to market the shares, including the frequency and 
nature of communications or contracts with potential purchasers, any 
preferences that will be given any such geographical area or class of 
potential purchasers, and the limitations on purchases by potential 
purchasers.

<R05>
Sec. 563c.2  Definitions.

    (See also 17 CFR 210.1-02.)
    (a) Registrant. The term ``registrant'' means an applicant, a

statements in accordance with this subpart.
    (b) Significant subsidiary. The term ``significant subsidiary'' 
means a subsidiary, including its subsidiaries, which meets any of the 
following conditions:
    (1) The association's and its other subsidiaries' investments in and 
advances to the subsidiary exceed 10 percent of the total assets of the 
association and its subsidiaries consolidated as of the end of the most 
recently completed fiscal year (for purposes of determining whether 
financial statements of a business acquired or to be acquired in a 
business combination accounted for as a pooling of interests are 
required pursuant to 17 CFR 210.3-05, this condition is also met when 
the number of common shares exchanged by the association exceeds 10 
percent of its total common shares outstanding at the date the 
combination is initiated); or
    (2) The association's and its other subsidiaries' proportionate 
share of the total assets (after intercompany eliminations) of the

its subsidiaries consolidated as of the end of the most recently

[[Page 264]]

    (3) The association's and its other subsidiaries' equity in the 
income from continuing operations before income taxes, extraordinary 
items, and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of the 
subsidiary exceeds 10 percent of such income of the association and its 
subsidiaries consolidated for the most recently completed fiscal year.

    Computational note: For purposes of making the prescribed income 
test the following guidance should be applied:
    1. When a loss has been incurred by either the parent or its 
consolidated subsidiaries or the tested subsidiary, but not both, the 
equity in the income or loss of the tested subsidiary should be excluded 
from the income of the association and its subsidiaries consolidated for 
purposes of the computation.
    2. If income of the association and its subsidiaries consolidated 
for the most recent fiscal year is at least 10 percent lower than the 
average of the income for the last five fiscal years, such average 
income should be substituted for purposes of the computation. Any loss 
years should be omitted for purposes of computing average income.

    (See also 17 CFR 210.2-01.)
    The term ``qualified public accountant'' means a certified public 
accountant or licensed public accountant certified or licensed by a 
regulatory authority of a State or other political subdivision of the 
United States who is in good standing as such under the laws of the 
jurisdiction where the home office of the registrant to be audited is 
located. Any person or firm who is suspended from practice before the 
Securities and Exchange Commission or other governmental agency is not a 
``qualified public accountant'' for purposes of this section.

financial statements when the restricted net assets (17 CFR 210.4-
08(e)(3)) of consolidated subsidiaries exceed 25 percent of consolidated 
net assets as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year. The 
investment in and indebtedness of and to association subsidiaries shall 
be stated separately in the condensed balance sheet from amounts for 
other subsidiaries; and the amount of cash dividends paid to the parent 
association for each of the last three years by association subsidiaries 
shall be stated separately in the condensed income statement from 
amounts for other subsidiaries.
    (b) For purposes of the above test, restricted net assets of 
consolidated subsidiaries shall mean that amount of the association's 
proportionate share of net assets of consolidated subsidiaries (after 
intercompany eliminations) which as of the end of the most recent year 
may not be transferred to the parent company by subsidiaries in the form 
of loans, advances, or cash dividends without the consent of a third 
party (i.e., lender, regulatory agency, foreign government, etc.).
    (c) Where restrictions on the amount of funds which may be loaned or 
advanced differ from the amount restricted as to transfer in the form of 
cash dividends, the amount least restrictive to the subsidiary shall be 
used. Redeemable preferred stocks (See item I (22) in Sec. 563c.102) and 
minority interest (See item I (21) in Sec. 563c.102) shall be deducted 
in computing net assets for purposes of this test.

amounts in this caption should include noninterest-bearing deposits with 
depository institutions.
    (b) State in a note the amount and terms of any deposits in

may include legally restricted deposits held as compensating balances 
against short-term borrowing arrangements, contracts entered into with 
others, or company statements of intention with regard to particular 
deposits; however, time deposits and short-term certificates of deposits 
are not generally included in legally restricted deposits. In cases 
where compensating balance arrangements exist but are not agreements 
which legally restrict the use of cash amounts shown on the balance 
sheet, describe in the notes to the financial statements these 
arrangements and the amount involved, if determinable, for the most 
recent audited balance sheet required and for any subsequent unaudited 
balance sheet required. Compensating balances that are maintained under 
an agreement to ensure future credit availability shall be disclosed in 
the notes to the financial statements along with the amount and terms of 
the agreement.
    (c) Checks outstanding in excess of an applicant's book balance in a 
demand deposit account shall be shown as a liability.
    2. Interest-bearing deposits in other banks.

15.
    4. Trading account assets. Include securities considered to be held 
for trading purposes.
    5. Other short-term investments.
    6. Investment securities. (a) Include securities considered to be 
held for investment purposes. Disclose the aggregate book value of 
investment securities as the line item on the balance sheet; and also 
show on the face of the balance sheet the aggregate market value at the 
balance sheet date. The aggregate amounts should include securities 
pledged, loaned, or sold under repurchase agreements and similar 
arrangements. Borrowed securities and securities purchased under resale 
agreements or similar arrangements should be excluded.
    (b) Disclose in a note the carrying value and market value of 
securities of (i) the U.S. Treasury and other U.S. Government agencies 
and corporations; (ii) states of the U.S. and political subdivisions

individual automobile loans, other installment loans, mobile home loans, 
and residential repair and modernization loans.
    (iv) Include under the commercial, financial, and agricultural 
category all loans not included in another category. This category shall 
include, but not be limited to, loans to real estate investment trusts, 
mortgage companies, banks, and other financial institutions; loans for 
carrying securities; and loans for agricultural purposes. Do not include 
loans secured primarily by developed real estate.
    (d) State separately any other loan category regardless of relative 
size if necessary to reflect any unusual risk concentration.
    (e) Unearned income on installment loans shall be shown and deducted 
separately from total loans.
    (f) Unamortized discounts on purchased loans shall be deducted 
separately from total loans.

[[Page 266]]

    (g) Loans in process shall be deducted separately from total loans.
    (h) A series of categories other than those specified in item (b) of 
paragraph 8. may be used to present details of loans if considered a 
more appropriate presentation. The categories specified in item (b) of 
paragraph 8. should be considered the minimum categories that may be 
presented.

disclose in a note the total dollar amount of loans being serviced by

    (j)(i)(A) As of each balance sheet date, disclose in a note the 
aggregate dollar amount of loans (exclusive of loans to any such persons 
which in the aggregate do not exceed $60,000 during the last year) made

officers, or principal holders of equity securities (17 CFR 210.1-02) of 
the association or any of its significant subsidiaries (17 CFR 210.1-02) 
or to any associate of such persons. For the latest fiscal year, an 
analysis of activity with respect to such aggregate loans to related 
parties should be provided. The analysis should include at the beginning 
of the period new loans, repayments, and other changes. (Other changes, 
if significant, should be explained.)
    (B) This disclosure need not be furnished when the aggregate amount 
of such loans at the balance sheet date (or with respect to the latest 
fiscal year, the maximum amount outstanding during the period) does not

                      III. Statement of Cash Flows

material, proceeds from principal repayments and maturities from loans 
and mortgage-backed securities should be segregated from proceeds from 
sales of loans and mortgage-backed securities, purchases of loans,

material. Additional guidance may be found in the FASB's Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards No. 95 Statement of Cash Flows.

    (1) Establishing the framework and criteria by which the OTS 
assesses a savings association's record of helping to meet the credit 
needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income 
neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the 
savings association; and
    (2) Providing that the OTS takes that record into account in 
considering certain applications.
    (c) Scope--(1) General. This part applies to all savings 
associations except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (2) Certain special purpose savings associations. This part does not

             Subpart B--Standards for Assessing Performance

    Source:  60 FR 22213, May 4, 1995, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 563e.21  Performance tests, standards, and ratings, in general.

    (a) Performance tests and standards. The OTS assesses the CRA 
performance of a savings association in an examination as follows:
    (1) Lending, investment, and service tests. The OTS applies the 
lending, investment, and service tests, as provided in Secs. 563e.22 
through 563e.24, in evaluating the performance of a savings association, 
except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(4) of this 
section.
    (2) Community development test for wholesale or limited purpose 
savings associations. The OTS applies the community development test for 
a wholesale or limited purpose savings association, as provided in 
Sec. 563e.25, except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
    (3) Small savings association performance standards. The OTS applies 
the small savings association performance standards as provided in 
Sec. 563e.26 in evaluating the performance of a small savings 
association or a savings association that was a small savings 
association during the prior calendar year, unless the savings 
association elects to be assessed as provided in paragraphs (a)(1), 
(a)(2), or (a)(4) of this section. The savings association may elect to 
be assessed as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section only if it 
collects and reports the data required for other savings associations 
under Sec. 563e.42.
    (4) Strategic plan. The OTS evaluates the performance of a savings 
association under a strategic plan if the savings association submits, 
and the OTS approves, a strategic plan as provided in Sec. 563e.27.
    (b) Performance context. The OTS applies the tests and standards in 
paragraph (a) of this section and also considers whether to approve a 
proposed strategic plan in the context of:
    (1) Demographic data on median income levels, distribution of 
household income, nature of housing stock, housing costs, and other 
relevant data pertaining to a savings association's assessment area(s);
    (2) Any information about lending, investment, and service 
opportunities in the savings association's assessment area(s) maintained 
by the savings association or obtained from community organizations, 
state, local, and tribal governments, economic development agencies, or 
other sources;
    (3) The savings association's product offerings and business 
strategy as determined from data provided by the savings association;
    (4) Institutional capacity and constraints, including the size and 
financial condition of the savings association, the economic climate 
(national, regional, and local), safety and soundness limitations, and 
any other factors that significantly affect the savings association's 
ability to provide lending, investments, or services in its assessment 
area(s);
    (5) The savings association's past performance and the performance 
of similarly situated lenders;
    (6) The savings association's public file, as described in 
Sec. 563e.43, and any written comments about the savings association's 
CRA performance submitted to the savings association or the OTS; and
    (7) Any other information deemed relevant by the OTS.
    (c) Assigned ratings. The OTS assigns to a savings association one 
of the following four ratings pursuant to Sec. 563e.28 and Appendix A of 
this part: ``outstanding''; ``satisfactory''; ``needs to improve''; or 
``substantial noncompliance,'' as provided in 12 U.S.C. 2906(b)(2). The 
rating assigned by the OTS reflects the savings association's record of 
helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- 
and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound 
operation of the savings association.
    (d) Safe and sound operations. This part and the CRA do not require 
a savings association to make loans or investments or to provide 
services that are inconsistent with safe and sound operations. To the 
contrary, the OTS anticipates savings associations can meet the 
standards of this part with safe and sound loans, investments, and

[[Page 278]]

services on which the savings associations expect to make a profit. 
Savings associations are permitted and encouraged to develop and apply 
flexible underwriting standards for loans that benefit low- or moderate-
income geographies or individuals, only if consistent with safe and 
sound operations.


<R05>
Sec. 563e.22  Lending test.

    (a) Scope of test. (1) The lending test evaluates a savings 
association's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its 
assessment area(s) through its lending activities by considering a 
savings association's home mortgage, small business, small farm, and 
community development lending. If consumer lending constitutes a 
substantial majority of a savings association's business, the OTS will 
evaluate the savings association's consumer lending in one or more of 
the following categories: motor vehicle, credit card, home equity, other 
secured, and other unsecured loans. In addition, at a savings 
association's option, the OTS will evaluate one or more categories of 
consumer lending, if the savings association has collected and 
maintained, as required in Sec. 563e.42(c)(1), the data for each 
category that the savings association elects to have the OTS evaluate.
    (2) The OTS considers originations and purchases of loans. The OTS 
will also consider any other loan data the savings association may 
choose to provide, including data on loans outstanding, commitments and 
letters of credit.
    (3) A savings association may ask the OTS to consider loans 
originated or purchased by consortia in which the savings association 
participates or by third parties in which the savings association has 
invested only if the loans meet the definition of community development 
loans and only in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. The OTS 
will not consider these loans under any criterion of the lending test 
except the community development lending criterion.
    (b) Performance criteria. The OTS evaluates a savings association's 
lending performance pursuant to the following criteria:
    (1) Lending activity. The number and amount of the savings 
association's home mortgage, small business, small farm, and consumer 
loans, if applicable, in the savings association's assessment area(s);
    (2) Geographic distribution. The geographic distribution of the 
savings association's home mortgage, small business, small farm, and 
consumer loans, if applicable, based on the loan location, including:
    (i) The proportion of the savings association's lending in the 
savings association's assessment area(s);
    (ii) The dispersion of lending in the savings association's 
assessment area(s); and
    (iii) The number and amount of loans in low-, moderate-, middle-, 
and upper-income geographies in the savings association's assessment 
area(s);
    (3) Borrower characteristics. The distribution, particularly in the 
savings association's assessment area(s), of the savings association's 
home mortgage, small business, small farm, and consumer loans, if 
applicable, based on borrower characteristics, including the number and 
amount of:
    (i) Home mortgage loans to low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-
income individuals;
    (ii) Small business and small farm loans to businesses and farms 
with gross annual revenues of $1 million or less;
    (iii) Small business and small farm loans by loan amount at 
origination; and
    (iv) Consumer loans, if applicable, to low-, moderate-, middle-, and 
upper-income individuals;
    (4) Community development lending. The savings association's 
community development lending, including the number and amount of 
community development loans, and their complexity and innovativeness; 
and
    (5) Innovative or flexible lending practices. The savings 
association's use of innovative or flexible lending practices in a safe 
and sound manner to address the credit needs of low- or moderate-income 
individuals or geographies.
    (c) Affiliate lending. (1) At a savings association's option, the 
OTS will consider loans by an affiliate of the savings association, if 
the savings association provides data on the affiliate's loans pursuant 
to Sec. 563e.42.

[[Page 279]]

    (2) The OTS considers affiliate lending subject to the following 
constraints:
    (i) No affiliate may claim a loan origination or loan purchase if 
another institution claims the same loan origination or purchase; and
    (ii) If a savings association elects to have the OTS consider loans 
within a particular lending category made by one or more of the savings 
association's affiliates in a particular assessment area, the savings 
association shall elect to have the OTS consider, in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, all the loans within that lending 
category in that particular assessment area made by all of the savings 
association's affiliates.
    (3) The OTS does not consider affiliate lending in assessing a 
savings association's performance under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this 
section.
    (d) Lending by a consortium or a third party. Community development 
loans originated or purchased by a consortium in which the savings 
association participates or by a third party in which the savings 
association has invested:
    (1) Will be considered, at the savings association's option, if the 
savings association reports the data pertaining to these loans under 
Sec. 563e.42(b)(2); and
    (2) May be allocated among participants or investors, as they 
choose, for purposes of the lending test, except that no participant or 
investor:
    (i) May claim a loan origination or loan purchase if another 
participant or investor claims the same loan origination or purchase; or
    (ii) May claim loans accounting for more than its percentage share 
(based on the level of its participation or investment) of the total 
loans originated by the consortium or third party.
    (e) Lending performance rating. The OTS rates a savings 
association's lending performance as provided in Appendix A of this 
part.


<R05>
Sec. 563e.23  Investment test.

    (a) Scope of test. The investment test evaluates a savings 
association's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its 
assessment area(s) through qualified investments that benefit its 
assessment area(s) or a broader statewide or regional area that includes 
the savings association's assessment area(s).
    (b) Exclusion. Activities considered under the lending or service 
tests may not be considered under the investment test.
    (c) Affiliate investment. At a savings association's option, the OTS 
will consider, in its assessment of a savings association's investment 
performance, a qualified investment made by an affiliate of the savings 
association, if the qualified investment is not claimed by any other 
institution.
    (d) Disposition of branch premises. Donating, selling on favorable 
terms, or making available on a rent-free basis a branch of the savings 
association that is located in a predominantly minority neighborhood to 
a minority depository institution or women's depository institution (as 
these terms are defined in 12 U.S.C. 2907(b)) will be considered as a 
qualified investment.
    (e) Performance criteria. The OTS evaluates the investment 
performance of a savings association pursuant to the following criteria:
    (1) The dollar amount of qualified investments;
    (2) The innovativeness or complexity of qualified investments;
    (3) The responsiveness of qualified investments to credit and 
community development needs; and
    (4) The degree to which the qualified investments are not routinely 
provided by private investors.
    (f) Investment performance rating. The OTS rates a savings 
association's investment performance as provided in Appendix A of this 
part.


<R05>
Sec. 563e.24  Service test.

    (a) Scope of test. The service test evaluates a savings 
association's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its 
assessment area(s) by analyzing both the availability and effectiveness 
of a savings association's systems for delivering retail banking 
services and the extent and innovativeness of its community development 
services.
    (b) Area(s) benefitted. Community development services must benefit 
a savings association's assessment area(s) or a broader statewide or 
regional area

[[Page 280]]

that includes the savings association's assessment area(s).
    (c) Affiliate service. At a savings association's option, the OTS 
will consider, in its assessment of a savings association's service 
performance, a community development service provided by an affiliate of 
the savings association, if the community development service is not 
claimed by any other institution.
    (d) Performance criteria--retail banking services. The OTS evaluates 
the availability and effectiveness of a savings association's systems 
for delivering retail banking services, pursuant to the following 
criteria:
    (1) The current distribution of the savings association's branches 
among low-,moderate-, middle-, and upper-income geographies;
    (2) In the context of its current distribution of the savings 
association's branches, the savings association's record of opening and 
closing branches, particularly branches located in low- or moderate-
income geographies or primarily serving low- or moderate-income 
individuals;
    (3) The availability and effectiveness of alternative systems for 
delivering retail banking services (e.g., ATMs, ATMs not owned or 
operated by or exclusively for the savings association, banking by 
telephone or computer, loan production offices, and bank-at-work or 
bank-by-mail programs) in low- and moderate-income geographies and to 
low- and moderate-income individuals; and
    (4) The range of services provided in low-, moderate-, middle-, and 
upper-income geographies and the degree to which the services are 
tailored to meet the needs of those geographies.
    (e) Performance criteria--community development services. The OTS 
evaluates community development services pursuant to the following 
criteria:
    (1) The extent to which the savings association provides community 
development services; and
    (2) The innovativeness and responsiveness of community development 
services.
    (f) Service performance rating. The OTS rates a savings 
association's service performance as provided in Appendix A of this 
part.


<R05>
Sec. 563e.25  Community development test for wholesale or limited purpose savings associations.

    (a) Scope of test. The OTS assesses a wholesale or limited purpose 
savings association's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its 
assessment area(s) under the community development test through its 
community development lending, qualified investments, or community 
development services.
    (b) Designation as a wholesale or limited purpose savings 
association. In order to receive a designation as a wholesale or limited 
purpose savings association, a savings association shall file a request, 
in writing, with the OTS, at least three months prior to the proposed 
effective date of the designation. If the OTS approves the designation, 
it remains in effect until the savings association requests revocation 
of the designation or until one year after the OTS notifies the savings 
association that the OTS has revoked the designation on its own 
initiative.
    (c) Performance criteria. The OTS evaluates the community 
development performance of a wholesale or limited purpose savings 
association pursuant to the following criteria:
    (1) The number and amount of community development loans (including 
originations and purchases of loans and other community development loan 
data provided by the savings association, such as data on loans 
outstanding, commitments, and letters of credit), qualified investments, 
or community development services;
    (2) The use of innovative or complex qualified investments, 
community development loans, or community development services and the 
extent to which the investments are not routinely provided by private 
investors; and
    (3) The savings association's responsiveness to credit and community 
development needs.
    (d) Indirect activities. At a savings association's option, the OTS 
will consider in its community development performance assessment:
    (1) Qualified investments or community development services provided 
by an affiliate of the savings association,

[[Page 281]]

if the investments or services are not claimed by any other institution; 
and
    (2) Community development lending by affiliates, consortia and third 
parties, subject to the requirements and limitations in Sec. 563e.22 (c) 
and (d).
    (e) Benefit to assessment area(s).--(1) Benefit inside assessment 
area(s). The OTS considers all qualified investments, community 
development loans, and community development services that benefit areas 
within the savings association's assessment area(s) or a broader 
statewide or regional area that includes the savings association's 
assessment area(s).
    (2) Benefit outside assessment area(s). The OTS considers the 
qualified investments, community development loans, and community 
development services that benefit areas outside the savings 
association's assessment area(s), if the savings association has 
adequately addressed the needs of its assessment area(s).
    (f) Community development performance rating. The OTS rates a 
savings association's community development performance as provided in 
Appendix A of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 563e.26  Small savings association performance standards.

    (a) Performance criteria. The OTS evaluates the record of a small 
savings association, or a savings association that was a small savings 
association during the prior calendar year, of helping to meet the 
credit needs of its assessment area(s) pursuant to the following 
criteria:
    (1) The savings association's loan-to-deposit ratio, adjusted for 
seasonal variation and, as appropriate, other lending-related 
activities, such as loan originations for sale to the secondary markets, 
community development loans, or qualified investments;
    (2) The percentage of loans and, as appropriate, other lending-
related activities located in the savings association's assessment 
area(s);
    (3) The savings association's record of lending to and, as 
appropriate, engaging in other lending-related activities for borrowers 
of different income levels and businesses and farms of different sizes;
    (4) The geographic distribution of the savings association's loans; 
and
    (5) The savings association's record of taking action, if warranted, 
in response to written complaints about its performance in helping to 
meet credit needs in its assessment area(s).
    (b) Small savings association performance rating. The OTS rates the 
performance of a savings association evaluated under this section as 
provided in Appendix A of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 563e.27  Strategic plan.

    (a) Alternative election. The OTS will assess a savings 
association's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its 
assessment area(s) under a strategic plan if:
    (1) The savings association has submitted the plan to the OTS as 
provided for in this section;
    (2) The OTS has approved the plan;
    (3) The plan is in effect; and
    (4) The savings association has been operating under an approved 
plan for at least one year.
    (b) Data reporting. The OTS's approval of a plan does not affect the 
savings association's obligation, if any, to report data as required by 
Sec. 563e.42.
    (c) Plans in general. (1) Term. A plan may have a term of no more 
than five years, and any multi-year plan must include annual interim 
measurable goals under which the OTS will evaluate the savings 
association's performance.
    (2) Multiple assessment areas. A savings association with more than 
one assessment area may prepare a single plan for all of its assessment 
areas or one or more plans for one or more of its assessment areas.
    (3) Treatment of affiliates. Affiliated institutions may prepare a 
joint plan if the plan provides measurable goals for each institution. 
Activities may be allocated among institutions at the institutions' 
option, provided that the same activities are not considered for more 
than one institution.
    (d) Public participation in plan development. Before submitting a 
plan to the OTS for approval, a savings association shall:

[[Page 282]]

    (1) Informally seek suggestions from members of the public in its 
assessment area(s) covered by the plan while developing the plan;
    (2) Once the savings association has developed a plan, formally 
solicit public comment on the plan for at least 30 days by publishing 
notice in at least one newspaper of general circulation in each 
assessment area covered by the plan; and
    (3) During the period of formal public comment, make copies of the 
plan available for review by the public at no cost at all offices of the 
savings association in any assessment area covered by the plan and 
provide copies of the plan upon request for a reasonable fee to cover 
copying and mailing, if applicable.
    (e) Submission of plan. The savings association shall submit its 
plan to the OTS at least three months prior to the proposed effective 
date of the plan. The savings association shall also submit with its 
plan a description of its informal efforts to seek suggestions from 
members of the public, any written public comment received, and, if the 
plan was revised in light of the comment received, the initial plan as 
released for public comment.
    (f) Plan content--(1) Measurable goals. (i) A savings association 
shall specify in its plan measurable goals for helping to meet the 
credit needs of each assessment area covered by the plan, particularly 
the needs of low- and moderate-income geographies and low- and moderate-
income individuals, through lending, investment, and services, as 
appropriate.
    (ii) A savings association shall address in its plan all three 
performance categories and, unless the savings association has been 
designated as a wholesale or limited purpose savings association, shall 
emphasize lending and lending-related activities. Nevertheless, a 
different emphasis, including a focus on one or more performance 
categories, may be appropriate if responsive to the characteristics and 
credit needs of its assessment area(s), considering public comment and 
the savings association's capacity and constraints, product offerings, 
and business strategy.
    (2) Confidential information. A savings association may submit 
additional information to the OTS on a confidential basis, but the goals 
stated in the plan must be sufficiently specific to enable the public 
and the OTS to judge the merits of the plan.
    (3) Satisfactory and outstanding goals. A savings association shall 
specify in its plan measurable goals that constitute ``satisfactory'' 
performance. A plan may specify measurable goals that constitute 
``outstanding'' performance. If a savings association submits, and the 
OTS approves, both ``satisfactory'' and ``outstanding'' performance 
goals, the OTS will consider the savings association eligible for an 
``outstanding'' performance rating.
    (4) Election if satisfactory goals not substantially met. A savings 
association may elect in its plan that, if the savings association fails 
to meet substantially its plan goals for a satisfactory rating, the OTS 
will evaluate the savings association's performance under the lending, 
investment, and service tests, the community development test, or the 
small savings association performance standards, as appropriate.
    (g) Plan approval--(1) Timing. The OTS will act upon a plan within 
60 calendar days after the OTS receives the complete plan and other 
material required under paragraph (d) of this section. If the OTS fails 
to act within this time period, the plan shall be deemed approved unless 
the OTS extends the review period for good cause.
    (2) Public participation. In evaluating the plan's goals, the OTS 
considers the public's involvement in formulating the plan, written 
public comment on the plan, and any response by the savings association 
to public comment on the plan.
    (3) Criteria for evaluating plan. The OTS evaluates a plan's 
measurable goals using the following criteria, as appropriate:
    (i) The extent and breadth of lending or lending-related activities, 
including, as appropriate, the distribution of loans among different 
geographies, businesses and farms of different sizes, and individuals of 
different income levels, the extent of community development lending, 
and the use of innovative or flexible lending practices to address 
credit needs;

[[Page 283]]

    (ii) The amount and innovativeness, complexity, and responsiveness 
of the savings association's qualified investments; and
    (iii) The availability and effectiveness of the savings 
association's systems for delivering retail banking services and the 
extent and innovativeness of the savings association's community 
development services.
    (h) Plan amendment. During the term of a plan, a savings association 
may request the OTS to approve an amendment to the plan on grounds that 
there has been a material change in circumstances. The savings 
association shall develop an amendment to a previously approved plan in 
accordance with the public participation requirements of paragraph (d) 
of this section.
    (i) Plan assessment. The OTS approves the goals and assesses 
performance under a plan as provided for in Appendix A of this part.

<R05>
Sec. 563e.28  Assigned ratings.

    (a) Ratings in general. Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section, the OTS assigns to a savings association a rating of 
``outstanding,'' ``satisfactory,'' ``needs to improve,'' or 
``substantial noncompliance'' based on the savings association's 
performance under the lending, investment and service tests, the 
community development test, the small savings association performance 
standards, or an approved strategic plan, as applicable.
    (b) Lending, investment, and service tests. The OTS assigns a rating 
for a savings association assessed under the lending, investment, and 
service tests in accordance with the following principles:
    (1) A savings association that receives an ``outstanding'' rating on 
the lending test receives an assigned rating of at least 
``satisfactory'';
    (2) A savings association that receives an ``outstanding'' rating on 
both the service test and the investment test and a rating of at least 
``high satisfactory'' on the lending test receives an assigned rating of 
``outstanding''; and
    (3) No savings association may receive an assigned rating of 
``satisfactory'' or higher unless it receives a rating of at least ``low 
satisfactory'' on the lending test.
    (c) Effect of evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit 
practices. Evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices 
adversely affects the OTS's evaluation of a savings association's 
performance. In determining the effect on the savings association's 
assigned rating, the OTS considers the nature and extent of the 
evidence, the policies and procedures that the savings association has 
in place to prevent discriminatory or other illegal credit practices, 
any corrective action that the savings association has taken or has 
committed to take, particularly voluntary corrective action resulting 
from self-assessment, and other relevant information.


<R05>
Sec. 563e.29  Effect of CRA performance on applications.

    (a) CRA performance. Among other factors, the OTS takes into account 
the record of performance under the CRA of each applicant savings 
association, and for applications under section 10(e) of the Home 
Owners' Loan Act (12 U.S.C. 1467a(e)), of each proposed subsidiary 
savings association, in considering an application for:
    (1) The establishment of a domestic branch or other facility that 
would be authorized to take deposits;
    (2) The relocation of the main office or a branch;
    (3) The merger or consolidation with or the acquisition of the 
assets or assumption of the liabilities of an insured depository 
institution requiring OTS approval under the Bank Merger Act (12 U.S.C. 
1828(c));
    (4) A Federal thrift charter; and
    (5) Acquisitions subject to section 10(e) of the Home Owners' Loan 
Act (12 U.S.C. 1467a(e)).
    (b) Charter application. An applicant for a Federal thrift charter 
shall submit with its application a description of how it will meet its 
CRA objectives. The OTS takes the description into account in 
considering the application and may deny or condition approval on that 
basis.
    (c) Interested parties. The OTS takes into account any views 
expressed by interested parties that are submitted in

[[Page 284]]

accordance with the applicable comment procedures in considering CRA 
performance in an application listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section.
    (d) Denial or conditional approval of application. A savings 
association's record of performance may be the basis for denying or 
conditioning approval of an application listed in paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (e) Insured depository institution. For purposes of this section, 
the term ``insured depository institution'' has the meaning given to 
that term in 12 U.S.C. 1813.

<R05>
Sec. 563e.41  Assessment area delineation.

    (a) In general. A savings association shall delineate one or more 
assessment areas within which the OTS evaluates the savings 
association's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its 
community. The OTS does not evaluate the savings association's 
delineation of its assessment area(s) as a separate performance 
criterion, but the OTS reviews the delineation for compliance with the 
requirements of this section.
    (b) Geographic area(s) for wholesale or limited purpose savings 
associations. The assessment area(s) for a wholesale or limited purpose 
savings association must consist generally of one or more MSAs (using 
the MSA boundaries that were in effect as of January 1 of the calendar 
year in which the delineation is made) or one or more contiguous 
political subdivisions, such as counties, cities, or towns, in which the 
savings association has its main office, branches, and deposit-taking 
ATMs.
    (c) Geographic area(s) for other savings associations. The 
assessment area(s) for a savings association other than a wholesale or 
limited purpose savings association must:
    (1) Consist generally of one or more MSAs (using the MSA boundaries 
that were in effect as of January 1 of the calendar year in which the 
delineation is made) or one or more contiguous political subdivisions, 
such as counties, cities, or towns; and
    (2) Include the geographies in which the savings association has its 
main office, its branches, and its deposit-taking ATMs, as well as the 
surrounding geographies in which the savings association has originated 
or purchased a substantial portion of its loans (including home mortgage 
loans, small business and small farm loans, and any other loans the 
savings association chooses, such as those consumer loans on which the 
savings association elects to have its performance assessed).
    (d) Adjustments to geographic area(s). A savings association may 
adjust the boundaries of its assessment area(s) to include only the 
portion of a political subdivision that it reasonably can be expected to 
serve. An adjustment is particularly appropriate in the case of an 
assessment area that otherwise would be extremely large, of unusual 
configuration, or divided by significant geographic barriers.
    (e) Limitations on the delineation of an assessment area. Each 
savings association's assessment area(s):
    (1) Must consist only of whole geographies;
    (2) May not reflect illegal discrimination;
    (3) May not arbitrarily exclude low- or moderate-income geographies, 
taking into account the savings association's size and financial 
condition; and
    (4) May not extend substantially beyond a CMSA boundary or beyond a 
state boundary unless the assessment area is located in a multistate 
MSA. If a savings association serves a geographic area that extends 
substantially beyond a state boundary, the savings association shall 
delineate separate assessment areas for the areas in each state. If a 
savings association serves a geographic area that extends substantially 
beyond a CMSA boundary, the savings association shall delineate separate 
assessment areas for the areas inside and outside the CMSA.
    (f) Savings associations serving military personnel. Notwithstanding 
the requirements of this section, a savings association whose business 
predominantly consists of serving the needs of military personnel or 
their dependents who are not located within a defined geographic area 
may delineate its entire

[[Page 285]]

deposit customer base as its assessment area.
    (g) Use of assessment area(s). The OTS uses the assessment area(s) 
delineated by a savings association in its evaluation of the savings 
association's CRA performance unless the OTS determines that the 
assessment area(s) do not comply with the requirements of this section.

    (1) Small business and small farm loan data. For each geography in 
which the savings association originated or purchased a small business 
or small farm loan, the aggregate number and amount of loans:
    (i) With an amount at origination of $100,000 or less;
    (ii) With amount at origination of more than $100,000 but less than

and
    (3) Home mortgage loans. If the savings association is subject to

savings association may collect and maintain in machine readable form 
(as prescribed by the OTS) data for consumer loans originated or 
purchased by the savings association for consideration under the lending 
test. A savings association may maintain data for one or more of the 
following categories of consumer loans: motor vehicle, credit card, home 
equity, other secured, and other unsecured. If the savings association 
maintains data for loans in a certain category, it shall maintain data 
for all loans originated or purchased within that category. The savings 
association shall maintain data separately for each category, including 
for each loan:
    (i) A unique number or alpha-numeric symbol that can be used to 
identify the relevant loan file;
    (ii) The loan amount at origination or purchase;
    (iii) The loan location; and
    (iv) The gross annual income of the borrower that the savings 
association considered in making its credit decision.

additional loan distribution data.
    (d) Data on affiliate lending. A savings association that elects to 
have the OTS consider loans by an affiliate, for purposes of the lending 
or community development test or an approved strategic plan, shall 
collect, maintain, and report for those loans the data that the savings 
association would have collected, maintained, and reported pursuant to 
paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of

[[Page 286]]

be prepared to identify the home mortgage loans reported under part 203 
of this title by the affiliate.
    (e) Data on lending by a consortium or a third-party. A savings 
association that elects to have the OTS consider community development

community development tests or an approved strategic plan, shall report 
for those loans the data that the savings association would have 
reported under paragraph (b)(2) of this section had the loans been 
originated or purchased by the savings association.
    (f) Small savings associations electing evaluation under the 
lending, investment, and service tests. A savings association that 
qualifies for evaluation under the small savings association performance 
standards but elects evaluation under the lending, investment, and 
service tests shall collect, maintain, and report the data required for 
other savings associations pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section.
    (g) Assessment area data. A savings association, except a small 
savings association or a savings association that was a small savings

Currency, prepares annually, for each MSA (including an MSA that crosses 
a state boundary) and the non-MSA portion of each state, an aggregate 
disclosure statement of small business and small farm lending by all 
institutions subject to reporting under this part or parts 25, 228, or 
345 of this title. These disclosure statements indicate, for each 
geography, the number and amount of all small business and small farm 
loans originated or purchased by reporting institutions, except that the 
OTS may adjust the form of the disclosure if necessary, because of 
special circumstances, to protect the privacy of a borrower or the 
competitive position of an institution.
    (j) Central data depositories. The OTS makes the aggregate 
disclosure statements, described in paragraph (i) of this section, and 
the individual savings association CRA Disclosure Statements, described 
in paragraph (h) of this section, available to the public at central 
data depositories. The OTS publishes a list of the depositories at which 
the statements are available.

                    Appendix A to Part 563e--Ratings

    (a) Ratings in general. (1) In assigning a rating, the OTS evaluates 
a savings association's performance under the applicable performance 
criteria in this part, in accordance with Sec. 563e.21 and Sec. 563e.28, 
which provides for adjustments on the basis of evidence of 
discriminatory or other illegal credit practices.
    (2) A savings association's performance need not fit each aspect of 
a particular rating profile in order to receive that rating, and 
exceptionally strong performance with respect to some aspects may 
compensate for weak performance in others. The savings association's 
overall performance, however, must be consistent with safe and sound 
banking practices and generally with the appropriate rating profile as 
follows.
    (b) Savings associations evaluated under the lending, investment, 
and service tests. (1) Lending performance rating. The OTS assigns each

not vary in a way that inconveniences its assessment area(s), 
particularly low- and moderate-income geographies and low- and moderate-
income individuals; and
    (D) It provides an adequate level of community development services.
    (iv) Needs to improve. The OTS rates a savings association's service 
performance ``needs to improve'' if, in general, the savings association 
demonstrates:
    (A) Its service delivery systems are unreasonably inaccessible to 
portions of its assessment area(s), particularly to low- or moderate-
income geographies or to low- or moderate-income individuals;
    (B) To the extent changes have been made, its record of opening and 
closing branches has adversely affected the accessibility of its 
delivery systems, particularly in low- or moderate-income geographies or 
to low- or moderate-income individuals;
    (C) Its services (including, where appropriate, business hours) vary 
in a way that inconveniences its assessment area(s), particularly low- 
or moderate-income geographies or low- or moderate-income individuals; 
and
    (D) It provides a limited level of community development services.
    (v) Substantial noncompliance. The OTS rates a savings association's 
service performance as being in ``substantial noncompliance'' if, in 
general, the savings association demonstrates:
    (A) Its service delivery systems are unreasonably inaccessible to 
significant portions of its assessment area(s), particularly to low- or 
moderate-income geographies or to low- or moderate-income individuals;
    (B) To the extent changes have been made, its record of opening and 
closing branches has significantly adversely affected the accessibility 
of its delivery systems, particularly in low- or moderate-income 
geographies or to low- or moderate-income individuals;
    (C) Its services (including, where appropriate, business hours) vary 
in a way that significantly inconveniences its assessment area(s), 
particularly low- or moderate-income geographies or low- or moderate-
income individuals; and
    (D) It provides few, if any, community development services.
    (c) Wholesale or limited purpose savings associations. The OTS 
assigns each wholesale or limited purpose savings association's 
community development performance one of the four following ratings.
    (1) Outstanding. The OTS rates a wholesale or limited purpose 
savings association's community development performance ``outstanding'' 
if, in general, it demonstrates:
    (i) A high level of community development loans, community 
development services, or qualified investments, particularly investments 
that are not routinely provided by private investors;
    (ii) Extensive use of innovative or complex qualified investments, 
community development loans, or community development services; and
    (iii) Excellent responsiveness to credit and community development 
needs in its assessment area(s).
    (2) Satisfactory. The OTS rates a wholesale or limited purpose 
savings association's

[[Page 292]]

community development performance ``satisfactory'' if, in general, it 
demonstrates:
    (i) An adequate level of community development loans, community 
development services, or qualified investments, particularly investments 
that are not routinely provided by private investors;
    (ii) Occasional use of innovative or complex qualified investments, 
community development loans, or community development services; and
    (iii) Adequate responsiveness to credit and community development 
needs in its assessment area(s).
    (3) Needs to improve. The OTS rates a wholesale or limited purpose 
savings association's community development performance as ``needs to 
improve'' if, in general, it demonstrates:
    (i) A poor level of community development loans, community 
development services, or qualified investments, particularly investments 
that are not routinely provided by private investors;
    (ii) Rare use of innovative or complex qualified investments, 
community development loans, or community development services; and
    (iii) Poor responsiveness to credit and community development needs 
in its assessment area(s).
    (4) Substantial noncompliance. The OTS rates a wholesale or limited 
purpose savings association's community development performance in 
``substantial noncompliance'' if, in general, it demonstrates:
    (i) Few, if any, community development loans, community development 
services, or qualified investments, particularly investments that are 
not routinely provided by private investors;
    (ii) No use of innovative or complex qualified investments, 
community development loans, or community development services; and
    (iii) Very poor responsiveness to credit and community development 
needs in its assessment area(s).
    (d) Savings associations evaluated under the small savings 
association performance standards. The OTS rates the performance of each 
savings association evaluated under the small savings association 
performance standards as follows:
    (1) Eligibility for a satisfactory rating. The OTS rates a savings 
association's performance ``satisfactory'' if, in general, the savings 
association demonstrates:
    (i) A reasonable loan-to-deposit ratio (considering seasonal 
variations) given the savings association's size, financial condition, 
the credit needs of its assessment area(s), and taking into account, as 
appropriate, lending-related activities such as loan originations for 
sale to the secondary markets and community development loans and 
qualified investments;
    (ii) A majority of its loans and, as appropriate, other lending-
related activities are in its assessment area(s);
    (iii) A distribution of loans to and, as appropriate, other lending 
related-activities for individuals of different income levels (including 
low- and moderate-income individuals) and businesses and farms of 
different sizes that is reasonable given the demographics of the savings 
association's assessment area(s);
    (iv) A record of taking appropriate action, as warranted, in 
response to written complaints, if any, about the savings association's 
performance in helping to meet the credit needs of its assessment 
area(s); and
    (v) A reasonable geographic distribution of loans given the savings 
association's assessment area(s).
    (2) Eligibility for an outstanding rating. A savings association 
that meets each of the standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating under 
this paragraph and exceeds some or all of those standards may warrant 
consideration for an overall rating of ``outstanding.'' In assessing 
whether a savings association's performance is ``outstanding,'' the OTS 
considers the extent to which the savings association exceeds each of 
the performance standards for a ``satisfactory'' rating and its 
performance in making qualified investments and its performance in 
providing branches and other services and delivery systems that enhance 
credit availability in its assessment area(s).
    (3) Needs to improve or substantial noncompliance ratings. A savings 
association also may receive a rating of ``needs to improve'' or 
``substantial noncompliance'' depending on the degree to which its 
performance has failed to meet the standards for a ``satisfactory'' 
rating.
    (e) Strategic plan assessment and rating. (1) Satisfactory goals. 
The OTS approves as ``satisfactory'' measurable goals that adequately 
help to meet the credit needs of the savings association's assessment 
area(s).
    (2) Outstanding goals. If the plan identifies a separate group of 
measurable goals that substantially exceed the levels approved as 
``satisfactory,'' the OTS will approve those goals as ``outstanding.''
    (3) Rating. The OTS assesses the performance of a savings 
association operating under an approved plan to determine if the savings 
association has met its plan goals:
    (i) If the savings association substantially achieves its plan goals 
for a satisfactory rating, the OTS will rate the savings association's 
performance under the plan as ``satisfactory.''
    (ii) If the savings association exceeds its plan goals for a 
satisfactory rating and substantially achieves its plan goals for an 
outstanding rating, the OTS will rate the savings association's 
performance under the plan as ``outstanding.''

[[Page 293]]

    (iii) If the savings association fails to meet substantially its 
plan goals for a satisfactory rating, the OTS will rate the savings 
association as either ``needs to improve'' or ``substantial 
noncompliance,'' depending on the extent to which it falls short of its 
plan goals, unless the savings association elected in its plan to be 
rated otherwise, as provided in Sec. 25.27(f)(4).

    Source:  61 FR 40308, Aug. 2, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 563f.1  Authority, purpose, and scope.

    (a) Authority. This part is issued under the provisions of the 
Depository Institution Management Interlocks Act (Interlocks Act) (12 
U.S.C. 3201 et seq.), as amended.
    (b) Purpose. The purpose of the Interlocks Act and this part is to 
foster competition by generally prohibiting a management official from 
serving two nonaffiliated depository organizations in situations where 
the management interlock likely would have an anticompetitive effect.
    (c) Scope. This part applies to management officials of savings 
associations, savings and loan holding companies, and affiliates of 
either.


<R05>
Sec. 563f.2  Definitions.

    For purposes of this part, the following definitions apply:
    (a) Affiliate. (1) The term affiliate has the meaning given in 
section 202 of the Interlocks Act (12 U.S.C. 3201). For purposes of that 
section 202, shares held by an individual include shares held by members 
of his or her immediate family. ``Immediate family'' means spouse, 
mother, father, child, grandchild, sister, brother, or any of their 
spouses, whether or not any of their shares are held in trust.
    (2) For purposes of section 202(3)(B) of the Interlocks Act (12 
U.S.C. 3201(3)(B)), an affiliate relationship involving a savings 
association or savings and loan holding company based on common 
ownership does not exist if the OTS determines, after giving the 
affected persons the opportunity to respond, that the asserted 
affiliation was established in order to avoid the prohibitions of the 
Interlocks Act and does not represent a true commonality of interest 
between the depository organizations. In making this determination, the 
OTS considers, among other things, whether a person, including members 
of his or her immediate family, whose shares are necessary to constitute 
the group owns a nominal percentage of the shares of one of the 
organizations and the percentage is substantially disproportionate to 
that person's ownership of shares in the other organization.
    (b) Anticompetitive effect means a monopoly or substantial lessening 
of competition.
    (c) Area median income means:
    (1) The median family income for the metropolitan statistical area 
(MSA), if a depository organization is located in an MSA; or
    (2) The statewide nonmetropolitan median family income, if a 
depository organization is located outside an MSA.
    (d) Community means a city, town, or village, and contiguous or 
adjacent cities, towns, or villages.
    (e) Contiguous or adjacent cities, towns, or villages means cities, 
towns, or villages whose borders touch each other or whose borders are 
within 10 road miles of each other at their closest points. The property 
line of an office located in an unincorporated city, town, or village is 
the boundary line of that city, town, or village for the purpose of this 
definition.
    (f) Critical means important to restoring or maintaining a 
depository organization's safe and sound operations.
    (g) Depository holding company means a bank holding company or a 
savings and loan holding company (as more fully defined in section 202 
of the Interlocks Act (12 U.S.C. 3201)) having its principal office 
located in the United States.
    (h) Depository institution means a commercial bank (including a 
private bank), a savings bank, a trust company, a savings and loan 
association, a building and loan association, a homestead association, a 
cooperative bank,

[[Page 295]]

an industrial bank, or a credit union, chartered under the laws of the 
United States and having a principal office located in the United 
States. Additionally, a United States office, including a branch or 
agency, of a foreign commercial bank is a depository institution.
    (i) Depository institution affiliate means a depository institution 
that is an affiliate of a depository organization.
    (j) Depository organization means a depository institution or a 
depository holding company.
    (k) Low- and moderate-income areas means census tracts (or, if an 
area is not in a census tract, block numbering areas delineated by the 
United States Bureau of the Census) where the median family income is 
less than 100 percent of the area median income.
    (l) Management official. (1) The term management official means:
    (i) A director;
    (ii) An advisory or honorary director of a depository institution 
with total assets of $100 million or more;
    (iii) A senior executive officer as that term is defined in 12 CFR 
574.9(a)(2);
    (iv) A branch manager;
    (v) A trustee of a depository organization under the control of 
trustees; and
    (vi) Any person who has a representative or nominee serving in any 
of the capacities in this paragraph (l)(1).
    (2) The term management official does not include:
    (i) A person whose management functions relate exclusively to the 
business of retail merchandising or manufacturing;
    (ii) A person whose management functions relate principally to the 
business outside the United States of a foreign commercial bank; or
    (iii) A person described in the provisos of section 202(4) of the 
Interlocks Act (12 U.S.C. 3201(4)) (referring to an officer of a State-
chartered savings bank, cooperative bank, or trust company that neither 
makes real estate mortgage loans nor accepts savings).
    (m) Office means a principal or branch office of a depository 
institution located in the United States. Office does not include a 
representative office of a foreign commercial bank, an electronic 
terminal, or a loan production office.
    (n) Person means a natural person, corporation, or other business 
entity.
    (o) Relevant metropolitan statistical area (RMSA) means an MSA, a 
primary MSA, or a consolidated MSA that is not comprised of designated 
Primary MSAs to the extent that these terms are defined and applied by 
the Office of Management and Budget.
    (p) Representative or nominee means a natural person who serves as a 
management official and has an obligation to act on behalf of another 
person with respect to management responsibilities. The OTS will find 
that a person has an obligation to act on behalf of another person only 
if the first person has an agreement, express or implied, to act on 
behalf of the second person with respect to management responsibilities. 
The OTS will determine, after giving the affected persons an opportunity 
to respond, whether a person is a representative or nominee.
    (q) Savings association means:
    (1) Any Federal savings association (as defined in section 3(b)(2) 
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(b)(2));
    (2) Any state savings association (as defined in section 3(b)(3) of 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(b)(3)) the deposits of 
which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; and
    (3) Any corporation (other than a bank as defined in section 3(a)(1) 
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(a)(1)) the deposits 
of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, that 
the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and 
the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision jointly determine to be 
operating in substantially the same manner as a savings association.
    (r) Total assets. (1) The term total assets means assets measured on 
a consolidated basis and reported in the most recent fiscal year-end 
Consolidated Report of Condition and Income.
    (2) The term total assets does not include:

depository institution affiliate;
    (ii) Assets of a bank holding company that is exempt from the 
prohibitions of section 4 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 
pursuant to an order issued under section 4(d) of that Act (12 U.S.C. 
1843(d)) other than the assets of its depository institution affiliate; 
or
    (iii) Assets of offices of a foreign commercial bank other than the 
assets of its United States branch or agency.
    (s) United States means the United States of America, any State or 
territory of the United States of America, the District of Columbia, 
Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, and the Virgin Islands.


<R05>
Sec. 563f.3  Prohibitions.

    (a) Community. A management official of a depository organization 
may not serve at the same time as a management official of an 
unaffiliated depository organization if the depository organizations in 
question (or a depository institution affiliate thereof) have offices in 
the same community.
    (b) RMSA. A management official of a depository organization may not 
serve at the same time as a management official of an unaffiliated 
depository organization if the depository organizations in question (or 
a depository institution affiliate thereof) have offices in the same 
RMSA and each depository organization has total assets of $20 million or 
more.
    (c) Major assets. A management official of a depository organization 
with total assets exceeding $1 billion (or any affiliate thereof) may 
not serve at the same time as a management official of an unaffiliated 
depository organization with total assets exceeding $500 million (or any 
affiliate thereof), regardless of the location of the two depository 
organizations.


<R05>
Sec. 563f.4  Interlocking relationships permitted by statute.

    The prohibitions of Sec. 563f.3 do not apply in the case of any one 
or more of the following organizations or to a subsidiary thereof:
    (a) A depository organization that has been placed formally in 
liquidation, or which is in the hands of a receiver, conservator, or 
other official exercising a similar function;
    (b) A corporation operating under section 25 or section 25A of the 
Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 601 et seq. and 12 U.S.C. 611 et seq., 
respectively) (Edge Corporations and Agreement Corporations);
    (c) A credit union being served by a management official of another 
credit union;
    (d) A depository organization that does not do business within the 
United States except as an incident to its activities outside the United 
States;
    (e) A State-chartered savings and loan guaranty corporation;
    (f) A Federal Home Loan Bank or any other bank organized solely to 
serve depository institutions (a bankers' bank) or solely for the 
purpose of providing securities clearing services and services related 
thereto for depository institutions and securities companies;
    (g) A depository organization that is closed or is in danger of 
closing as determined by the appropriate Federal depository institutions 
regulatory agency and is acquired by another depository organization. 
This exemption lasts for five years, beginning on the date the 
depository organization is acquired;
    (h)(1) A diversified savings and loan holding company (as defined in 
section 10(a)(1)(F) of the Home Owners' Loan Act (12 U.S.C. 
1467a(a)(1)(F)) with respect to the service of a director of such 
company who also is a director of an unaffiliated depository 
organization if:
    (i) Both the diversified savings and loan holding company and the 
unaffiliated depository organization notify their appropriate Federal 
depository institutions regulatory agency at least 60 days before the 
dual service is proposed to begin; and
    (ii) The appropriate regulatory agency does not disapprove the dual 
service before the end of the 60-day period.
    (2) The OTS may disapprove a notice of proposed service if it finds 
that:
    (i) The service cannot be structured or limited so as to preclude an 
anticompetitive effect in financial services in any part of the United 
States;

[[Page 297]]

    (ii) The service would lead to substantial conflicts of interest or 
unsafe or unsound practices; or
    (iii) The notificant failed to furnish all the information required 
by the OTS.
    (3) The OTS may require that any interlock permitted under this 
paragraph (h) be terminated if a change in circumstances occurs with 
respect to one of the interlocked depository organizations that would 
have provided a basis for disapproval of the interlock during the notice 
period; and
    (i) Any savings association or any savings and loan holding company 
(as defined in section 10(a)(1)(D) of the Home Owners' Loan Act) which 
has issued stock in connection with a qualified stock issuance pursuant 
to section 10(q) of such Act, except that this paragraph (i) shall apply 
only with regard to service by a single management official of such 
savings association or holding company, or any subsidiary of such 
savings association or holding company, by a single management official 
of the savings and loan holding company which purchased the stock issued 
in connection with such qualified stock issuance, and shall apply only 
when the OTS has determined that such service is consistent with the 
purposes of the Interlocks Act and the Home Owners' Loan Act.


<R05>
Sec. 563f.5  Regulatory Standards exemption.

    (a) Criteria. The OTS may permit an interlock that otherwise would 
be prohibited by the Interlocks Act and Sec. 563f.3 if:
    (1) The board of directors of the depository organization (or the 
organizers of a depository organization being formed) that seeks the 
exemption provides a resolution to the OTS certifying that the 
organization, after the exercise of reasonable efforts, is unable to 
locate any other candidate from the community or RMSA, as appropriate, 
who:
    (i) Possesses the level of expertise required by the depository 
organization and who is not prohibited from service by the Interlocks 
Act; and
    (ii) Is willing to serve as a management official; and
    (2) The OTS, after reviewing an application submitted by the 
depository organization seeking the exemption, determines that:
    (i) The management official is critical to the safe and sound 
operations of the affected depository organization; and
    (ii) Service by the management official will not produce an 
anticompetitive effect with respect to the depository organization.
    (b) Presumptions. The OTS applies the following presumptions when 
reviewing any application for a Regulatory Standards exemption:
    (1) An interlock will not have an anticompetitive effect if it 
involves depository organizations that, if merged, would not cause the 
post-merger Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) to exceed 1800 and would 
not cause the HHI to increase by more than 200 points. This presumption 
shall not apply to depository organizations subject to the Major Assets 
prohibition of Sec. 563f.3(c).
    (2) A proposed management official is critical to the safe and sound 
operations of a depository institution if:
    (i) That official is approved by the OTS to serve as a director or 
senior executive officer of that institution pursuant to 12 CFR 574.9; 
and
    (ii) The institution had operated for less than two years, was not 
in compliance with minimum capital requirements, or otherwise was in a 
``troubled condition'' as defined in 12 CFR 574.9 at the time the 
service under that section was approved.
    (c) Duration of interlock. An interlock permitted under this section 
may continue until the OTS notifies the affected depository 
organizations otherwise. The OTS may require termination of any 
interlock permitted under this section if the OTS concludes, after 
giving the affected persons the opportunity to respond, that the 
determinations under paragraph (a)(2) of this section no longer may be 
made. A management official may continue serving the depository 
organization involved in the interlock for a period of 15 months 
following the date of the order to terminate the interlock, unless the 
order terminating the interlock provides otherwise.

[[Page 298]]


<R05>
Sec. 563f.6  Management Consignment exemption.

    (a) Criteria. The OTS may permit an interlock that otherwise would 
be prohibited by the Interlocks Act and Sec. 563f.3 if the OTS, after 
reviewing an application submitted by the depository organization 
seeking an exemption, determines that the interlock would:
    (1) Improve the provision of credit to low- and moderate-income 
areas;
    (2) Increase the competitive position of a minority- or women-owned 
depository organization;
    (3) Strengthen the management of a depository institution that has 
been chartered for less than three years at the time an application is 
filed under this part; or
    (4) Strengthen the management of a depository institution that is in 
an unsafe or unsound condition as determined by the OTS on a case-by-
case basis.
    (b) Presumptions. The OTS applies the following presumptions when 
reviewing any application for a Management Consignment exemption:
    (1) A proposed management official is capable of strengthening the 
management of a depository institution described in paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section if that official is approved by the OTS to serve as a 
director or senior executive officer of that institution pursuant to 12 
CFR 574.9 and the institution had operated for less than two years at 
the time the service under 12 CFR 574.9 was approved; and
    (2) A proposed management official is capable of strengthening the 
management of a depository institution described in paragraph (a)(4) of 
this section if that official is approved by the OTS to serve as a 
director or senior executive officer of that institution pursuant to 12 
CFR 574.9 and the institution was not in compliance with minimum capital 
requirements or otherwise was in a ``troubled condition'' as defined 
under 12 CFR 574.9 at the time service under that section was approved.
    (c) Duration of interlock. An interlock granted under this section 
may continue for a period of two years from the date of approval. The 
OTS may extend this period for one additional two-year period if the 
depository organization applies for an extension at least 30 days before 
the current exemption expires and satisfies one of the criteria 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The provisions set forth in 
paragraph (b) of this section also apply to applications for extensions.


<R05>
Sec. 563f.7  Change in circumstances.

    (a) Termination. A management official shall terminate his or her 
service or apply for an exemption to the Interlocks Act if a change in 
circumstances causes the service to become prohibited under that Act. A 
change in circumstances may include, but is not limited to, an increase 
in asset size of an organization, a change in the delineation of the 
RMSA or community, the establishment of an office, an acquisition, a 
merger, a consolidation, or any reorganization of the ownership 
structure of a depository organization that causes a previously 
permissible interlock to become prohibited.
    (b) Transition period. A management official described in paragraph 
(a) of this section may continue to serve the depository organization 
involved in the interlock for 15 months following the date of the change 
in circumstances. The OTS may shorten this period under appropriate 
circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 563f.8  Enforcement.

    Except as provided in this section, the OTS administers and enforces 
the Interlocks Act with respect to savings associations, savings and 
loan holding companies, and affiliates of either, and may refer any case 
of a prohibited interlocking relationship involving these entities to 
the Attorney General of the United States to enforce compliance with the 
Interlocks Act and this part. If an affiliate of a savings association 
or savings and loan holding company is subject to the primary regulation 
of another Federal depository organization supervisory agency, then the 
OTS does not administer and enforce the Interlocks Act with respect to 
that affiliate.

<R05>
Sec. 563f.9  Interlocking relationships permitted pursuant to Federal Deposit Insurance Act.

    A management official or prospective management official of a 
depository organization may enter into an otherwise prohibited 
interlocking relationship with another depository organization for a 
period of up to 10 years if such relationship is approved by the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation pursuant to section 13(k)(1)(A)(v) of the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (12 U.S.C. 1823(k)(1)(A)(v)).

allow additional cash amounts to be contributed by the participants in 
the plan, provided that the securities to be issued are newly issued, or 
are purchased for the account of plan participants, at prices not in 
excess of current market prices at the time of purchase, or at prices 
not in excess of an amount determined in accordance with a pricing 
formula specified in the plan and based upon average or current market

issue any security.
    (8) Offer; Sale or sell. For purposes of this part, the term offer, 
offer to sell, or offer for sale shall include every attempt or offer to

[[Page 300]]

present or future right or privilege to convert the security into 
another security of the same or another issuer, includes an offer and 
sale of the other security only at the time of the offer or sale of the 
warrant or right or convertible security; but neither the exercise of 
the right to purchase or subscribe or to convert nor the issuance of 
securities pursuant thereto is an offer or sale.
    (9) Person means the same as in Sec. 563b.2(a)(27) of this chapter, 
and includes a savings association.
    (10) Purchase and buy mean the same as in Sec. 563b.2(a)(29) of this 
chapter.

chapter, and includes a federally-chartered savings association in 
organization under this chapter, and a state-chartered savings 
association in organization which is granted conditional approval of

includes any underwriter participating in the distribution of securities 
of a savings association.

77aa).
    (13) Security means any non-withdrawable account, note, stock,

with a view to, or offers or sells for an issuer in connection with, the 
distribution of any security, or participates or has a participation in 
the direct or indirect underwriting of any such undertaking; but such 
term shall not include a person whose interest is limited to a 
commission from an underwriter or dealer not in excess of the usual and 
customary distributors' or sellers' commission and such term shall also 
not include any person who has continually held the securities being 
transferred for a period of two (2) consecutive years provided that the 
securities sold in any one (1) transaction shall be less than ten 
percent (10%) of the issued and outstanding securities of the same 
class. The following shall apply for the purpose of determining the 
period securities have been held:
    (i) Stock dividends, splits and recapitalizations. Securities 
acquired from the issuer as a dividend or pursuant to a stock split, 
reverse split or recapitalization shall be deemed to have been acquired 
at the same time as the securities on which the dividend or, if more 
than one, the initial dividend was paid, the securities involved in the 
split or reverse split, or the securities surrendered in connection with 
the recapitalization.
    (ii) Conversions. If the securities sold were acquired from the 
issuer for consideration consisting solely of other securities of the 
same issuer surrendered for conversion, the securities so acquired shall 
be deemed to have been acquired at the same time as the securities 
surrendered for conversion.
    (iii) Contingent issuance of securities. Securities acquired as a 
contingent payment of the purchase price of an equity interest in a 
business, or the assets of a business, sold to the issuer or an 
affiliate of the issuer shall be deemed to have been acquired at the 
time of such sale if the issuer was then committed to issue the 
securities subject only to conditions other than the payment of further 
consideration for such securities. An agreement entered into in 
connection with any such purchase to remain in the employment of, or not 
to compete with, the issuer or affiliate or the rendering of services 
pursuant to such agreement shall not be deemed to be the payment of 
further consideration for such securities.
    (iv) Pledged securities. Securities which are bona fide pledged by 
any person other than the issuer when sold by the pledgee, or by a 
purchaser, after a default in the obligation secured by the

[[Page 301]]

pledge, shall be deemed to have been acquired when they were acquired by 
the pledgor, except that if the securities were pledged without recourse 
they shall be deemed to have been acquired by the pledgee at the time of 
the pledge or by the purchaser at the time of purchase.
    (v) Gifts of securities. Securities acquired from any person, other 
than the issuer, by gift shall be deemed to have been acquired by the 
donee when they were acquired by the donor.
    (vi) Trusts. Securities acquired from the settler of a trust by the 
trust or acquired from the trust by the beneficiaries thereof shall be 
deemed to have been acquired when they were acquired by the settler.
    (vii) Estates. Securities held by the estate of a deceased person or 
acquired from such an estate by the beneficiaries thereof shall be 
deemed to have been acquired when they were acquired by the deceased 
person, except that no holding period is required if the estate is not 
an affiliate of the issuer or if the securities are sold by a 
beneficiary of the estate who is not such an affiliate.
    (viii) Exchange transactions. A person receiving securities in a 
transaction involving an exchange of the securities of one issuer for 
securities of another issuer shall be deemed to have acquired the 
securities received when such person acquired the securities exchanged.
    (b) A term not defined in this part but defined in another part of 
this chapter, when used in this part, shall have the meanings given in 
such other part, unless the context otherwise requires.
    (c) When used in the rules, regulations, or forms of the Commission 
referred to in this part, the term Commission shall be deemed to refer 
to the Office, the term registrant shall be deemed to refer to an issuer 
defined in this part, and the term registration statement or prospectus 
shall be deemed to refer to an offering circular filed under this part, 
unless the context otherwise requires.

    (a) General. No savings association shall offer or sell, directly or 
indirectly, any security issued by it unless:
    (1) The offer or sale is accompanied or preceded by an offering

has been filed and declared effective pursuant to this part; or
    (2) An exemption is available under this part.
    (b) Communications not deemed an offer. The following communications

    (3) Oral offers of securities covered by an offering circular made

not apply to an issuer's offer or sale of securities:
    (a) Complying with the requirements for retail repurchase agreements 
of Sec. 563.84 of this chapter, except where

[[Page 302]]

the issuer has a regulatory capital deficiency under that section.
    (b) Exempt from registration under either section 3(a) or section 4 
of the Securities Act, but only by reason of an exemption other than 
section 3(a)(5) (for regulated savings associations), and section 
3(a)(11) (for intrastate offerings) of the Securities Act;
    (c) In a conversion from the mutual to the stock form of 
organization pursuant to part 563b of this chapter, except for a

    (d) In a non-public offering which satisfies the requirements of

Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Federal National Mortgage 
Association, Government National Mortgage Association or by interests in 
mortgage notes secured by real property;
    (f) Distributed exclusively abroad to foreign nationals: Provided, 
That (1) the offering is made subject to safeguards reasonably designed 
to preclude distribution or redistribution of the securities within, or 
to nationals of, the United States, and (2) such safeguards include, 
without limitation, measures that would be sufficient to ensure that 
registration of the securities would not be required if the securities 
were not exempt under the Securities Act; or
    (g) To its officers, directors or employees pursuant to an employee 
benefit plan or a dividend or interest reinvestment plan, and provided 
that any such plan has been approved by the majority of shareholders

<R05>
Sec. 563g.4  Non-public offering.

    Offers and sales of securities by an issuer that satisfy the 
conditions of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section and the requirements 
of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section shall be deemed to be 
transactions not involving any public offering within the meaning of 
section 4(2) of the Securities Act and Secs.  563g.3(b) and 563g.3(d) of 
this part. However, an issuer shall not be deemed to be not in 
compliance with the provisions of this section solely by reason of 
making an untimely filing of the notice required to be filed by 
paragraph (c) of this section so long as the notice is actually filed 
and all other conditions and requirements of this section are satisfied.
    (a) Regulation D. The offer and sale of all securities in the 
transaction satisfies the Commission's Regulation D (17 CFR 230.501-
230.506), except for the notice requirements of Commission Rule 503 (17 
CFR 230.503) and the limitations on resale in Commission Rule 502(d) (17 
CFR 230.502(d)).
    (b) Sales to 35 persons. The offer and sale of all securities in the 
transaction satisfies each of the following conditions:
    (1) Sales of the security are not made to more than 35 persons 
during the offering period, as determined under the integration 
provisions of Commission Rule 502(a) (17 CFR 230.502(a)). The number of 
purchasers referred to above is exclusive of any accredited investor, 
officer, director or affiliate of the issuer. For purposes of paragraph 
(b) of this section, a husband and wife (together with any custodian or 
trustee acting for the account of their minor children) are counted as 
one person and a partnership, corporation or other organization which 
was not specifically formed for the purpose of purchasing the security 
offered in reliance upon this exemption, is counted as one person.
    (2) All purchasers either have a preexisting personal or business 
relationship with the issuer or any of its officers, directors or 
controlling persons, or by reason of their business or financial 
experience or the business or financial experience of their professional 
advisors who are unaffiliated with and who are not compensated by the 
issuer or any affiliate or selling agent of the issuer, directly or 
indirectly, could reasonably be assumed to have the capacity to protect 
their own interests in connection with the transaction.
    (3) Each purchaser represents that the purchaser is purchasing for 
the

[[Page 303]]

purchaser's own account (or a trust account if the purchaser is a 
trustee) and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any 
distribution of the security.
    (4) The offer and sale of the security is not accomplished by the 
publication of any advertisement.
    (c) Filing of notice of sales. Within 30 days after the first sale 
of the securities, every six months after the first sale of the 
securities and not later than 30 days after the last sale of securities 
in an offering pursuant to this section, the issuer, shall file with the 
Office a report describing the results of the sale of securities as 
required by Sec. 563g.12(b) of this part.
    (d) Limitation on resale. The issuer shall exercise reasonable care 
to assure that the purchasers of the securities are not underwriters 
within the meaning of Sec. 563g.1(a)(14) of this part, which reasonable 
care shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
    (1) Reasonable inquiry to determine if the purchaser is acquiring 
the securities for the purchaser or for other persons;
    (2) Written disclosure to each purchaser prior to the sale that the 
securities are not offered by an offering circular filed with, and 
declared effective by, the Office pursuant to Sec. 563g.2 of this part, 
but instead are being sold in reliance upon the exemption from the 
offering circular requirement provided for by this section; and
    (3) Placement of a legend on the certificate, or other document 
evidencing the securities, indicating that the securities have not been 
offered by an offering circular filed with, and declared effective by, 
the Office and that due care should be taken to ensure that the seller 
of the securities is not an underwriter within the meaning of 
Sec. 563g.1(a)(14) of this part.


<R05>

the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (12 U.S.C. 1818), 
including, but not limited to, institution of cease-and-desist

Sec. 564.3  Appraisals required; transactions requiring a State certified or licensed appraiser.

    (a) Appraisals required. An appraisal performed by a State certified

[[Page 311]]

estate-related financial transactions except those in which:
    (1) The transaction value is $250,000 or less;
    (2) A lien on real estate has been taken as collateral in an 
abundance of caution;
    (3) The transaction is not secured by real estate;
    (4) A lien on real estate has been taken for purposes other than the 
real estate's value;
    (5) The transaction is a business loan that:
    (i) Has a transaction value of $1 million or less; and
    (ii) Is not dependent on the sale of, or rental income derived from, 
real estate as the primary source of repayment;
    (6) A lease of real estate is entered into, unless the lease is the 
economic equivalent of a purchase or sale of the leased real estate;
    (7) The transaction involves an existing extension of credit at the 
lending institution, provided that:
    (i) There has been no obvious and material change in market 
conditions or physical aspects of the property that threatens the 
adequacy of the institution's real estate collateral protection after 
the transaction, even with the advancement of new monies; or
    (ii) There is no advancement of new monies, other than funds 
necessary to cover reasonable closing costs;
    (8) The transaction involves the purchase, sale, investment in, 
exchange of, or extension of credit secured by, a loan or interest in a

backed securities, and each loan or interest in a loan, pooled loan, or 
real property interest met OTS regulatory requirements for appraisals at 
the time of origination;
    (9) The transaction is wholly or partially insured or guaranteed by 
a United States government agency or United States government sponsored 
agency;

United States government sponsored agency; or
    (ii) Involves a residential real estate transaction in which the 
appraisal conforms to the Federal National Mortgage Association or 
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation appraisal standards applicable to 
that category of real estate;
    (11) The regulated institution is acting in a fiduciary capacity and 
is not required to obtain an appraisal under other law; or
    (12) The OTS determines that the services of an appraiser are not 
necessary in order to protect Federal financial and public policy 
interests in real estate-related financial transactions or to protect 
the safety and soundness of the institution.
    (b) Evaluations required. For a transaction that does not require 
the services of a State certified or licensed appraiser under paragraph

an appropriate evaluation of real property collateral that is consistent 
with safe and sound banking practices.

agency believes it is necessary to address safety and soundness 
concerns.
    (d) Transactions requiring a State certified appraiser--(1) All 
transactions of $1,000,000 or more. All federally related transactions 
having a transaction value of $1,000,000 or more shall require an 
appraisal prepared by a State certified appraiser.
    (2) Nonresidential and residential (other than 1-to-4 family) 
transactions of $250,000 or more. All federally related transactions 
having a transaction value of $250,000 or more, other than those 
involving appraisals of 1-to-4 family residential properties, shall 
require an appraisal prepared by a State certified appraiser.
    (3) Complex residential transactions of $250,000 or more. All 
complex 1-to-4 family residential property appraisals rendered in 
connection with federally related transactions shall require a State 
certified appraiser if the transaction value is $250,000 or more. A 
regulated institution may presume that appraisals of 1-to-4 family 
residential properties are not complex, unless the institution has 
readily available information that a given appraisal will be complex. 
The regulated institution

[[Page 312]]

shall be responsible for making the final determination of whether the 
appraisal is complex. If during the course of the appraisal a licensed 
appraiser identifies factors that would result in the property, form of 
ownership, or market conditions being considered atypical, then either:
    (i) The regulated institution may ask the licensed appraiser to 
complete the appraisal and have a certified appraiser approve and co-
sign the appraisal; or
    (ii) The institution may engage a certified appraiser to complete 
the appraisal.
    (e) Transactions requiring either a State certified or licensed 
appraiser. All appraisals for federally related transactions not 
requiring the services of a State certified appraiser shall be prepared 
by either a State certified appraiser or a State licensed appraiser.
    (f) Effective date. Savings associations are required to use State 
certified or licensed appraisers as set forth in this part no later than 
December 31, 1992.

<R05>
Sec. 564.4  Minimum appraisal standards.

    For federally related transactions, all appraisals shall, at a 
minimum:
    (a) Conform to generally accepted appraisal standards as evidenced 
by the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) 
promulgated by the Appraisal Standards Board of the Appraisal 
Foundation, 1029 Vermont Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20005, unless 
principles of safe and sound banking require compliance with stricter 
standards;
    (b) Be written and contain sufficient information and analysis to 
support the institution's decision to engage in the transaction;
    (c) Analyze and report appropriate deductions and discounts for 
proposed construction or renovation, partially leased buildings, non-
market lease terms, and tract developments with unsold units;
    (d) Be based upon the definition of market value as set forth in 
this part; and
    (e) Be performed by State licensed or certified appraisers in 
accordance with requirements set forth in this part.

<R05>
Sec. 564.5  Appraiser independence.

    (a) Staff appraisers. If an appraisal is prepared by a staff 
appraiser, that appraiser must be independent of the lending, 
investment, and collection functions and not involved, except as an 
appraiser, in the federally related transaction, and have no direct or 
indirect interest, financial or otherwise, in the property. If the only 
qualified persons available to perform an appraisal are involved in the 
lending, investment, or collection functions of the regulated 
institution, the regulated institution shall take appropriate steps to 
ensure that the appraisers exercise independent judgment and that the 
appraisal is adequate. Such steps include, but are not limited to, 
prohibiting an individual from performing an appraisal in connection 
with federally related transactions in which the appraiser is otherwise 
involved and prohibiting directors and officers from participating in 
any vote or approval involving assets on which they performed an 
appraisal.
    (b) Fee appraisers. (1) If an appraisal is prepared by a fee 
appraiser, the appraiser shall be engaged directly by the regulated 
institution or its agent, and have no direct or indirect interest, 
financial or otherwise, in the property or the transaction.
    (2) A regulated institution also may accept an appraisal that was 
prepared by an appraiser engaged directly by another financial services 
institution, if:
    (i) The appraiser has no direct or indirect interest, financial or 
otherwise, in the property or the transaction; and
    (ii) The regulated institution determines that the appraisal 
conforms to the requirements of this part and is otherwise acceptable.

<R05>
Sec. 564.6  Professional association membership; competency.

    (a) Membership in appraisal organizations. A State certified 
appraiser or a

[[Page 313]]

State licensed appraiser may not be excluded from consideration for an 
assignment for a federally related transaction solely by virtue of 
membership or lack of membership in any particular appraisal 
organization.
    (b) Competency. All staff and fee appraisers performing appraisals 
in connection with federally related transactions must be State 
certified or licensed, as appropriate. However, a State certified or 
licensed appraiser may not be considered competent solely by virtue of 
being certified or licensed. Any determination of competency shall be 
based upon the individual's experience and educational background as 
they relate to the particular appraisal assignment for which he or she 
is being considered.
[55 FR 34549, Aug. 23, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 564.7  Enforcement.

    Institutions and institution-affiliated parties, including staff 
appraisers and fee appraisers, who violate this part may be subject to 
removal and/or prohibition orders, cease and desist orders, and the 
imposition of civil money penalties pursuant to the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1811 et seq., as amended, or other applicable 
law.

Sec. 564.8  Appraisal policies and practices of savings associations and subsidiaries.

    (a) Introduction. The soundness of a savings association's mortgage 
loans and real estate investments, and those of its service 
corporation(s), depends to a great extent upon the adequacy of the loan 
underwriting used to support these transactions. An appraisal standard 
is one of several critical components of a sound underwriting policy 
because appraisal reports contain estimates of the value of collateral 
held or assets owned. This section sets forth the responsibilities of 
management to develop, implement, and maintain appraisal standards in 
determining compliance with the appraisal requirements of Secs. 563.170 
and 563.172 of this part.
    (b) Definition. For purposes of this section, management means: the 
directors and officers of a savings association, or service corporation 
of such savings association, as those terms are defined in Secs. 561.18 
and 561.35 of this chapter respectively.
    (c) Responsibilities of management. An appraisal is a critical 
component of the loan underwriting or real estate investment decision. 
Therefore, management shall develop, implement, and maintain appraisal 
policies to ensure that appraisals reflect professional competence and 
to facilitate the reporting of estimates of market value upon which 
savings associations may rely to make lending decisions. To achieve 
these results:
    (1) Management shall develop written appraisal policies, subject to 
formal adoption by the savings association's board of directors, that it 
shall implement in consultation with other appropriate personnel. These 
policies shall ensure that adequate appraisals are obtained and proper 
appraisal procedures are followed consistent with the requirements of 
this part 564.
    (2) Management shall develop and adopt guidelines and institute 
procedures pertaining to the hiring of appraisers to perform appraisal 
services for the savings association consistent with the requirements of 
this part 564. These guidelines shall set forth specific factors to be 
considered by management including, but not limited to, an appraiser's 
State certification or licensing, professional education, and type of 
experience. An appraiser's membership in professional appraisal 
organizations may be considered consistent with the requirements of 
Sec. 564.6
    (3) Management shall review on an annual basis the performance of 
all approved appraisers used within the preceding 12-month period for 
compliance with (i) the savings association's appraisal policies and 
procedures; and (ii) the reasonableness of the value estimates reported.
    (d) Exemptions. The requirements of Sec. 564.4(b) through (d) shall 
not apply

[[Page 314]]

with respect to appraisals on nonresidential properties prepared on form 
reports approved by the Office and completed in accordance with the 
applicable instructional booklet.

<R05>
Sec. 565.1  Authority, purpose, scope, other supervisory authority, and disclosure of capital categories.

    (a) Authority. This part is issued by the OTS pursuant to section 38 
(section 38) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) as added by 
section 131 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act 
of 1991 (Pub. L. 102-242, 105 Stat. 2236 (1991)) (12 U.S.C. 1831o).
    (b) Purpose. Section 38 of the FDI Act establishes a framework of 
supervisory actions for insured depository institutions that are not 
adequately capitalized. The principal purpose of this part is to define, 
for savings associations, the capital measures and capital levels that 
are used for determining the supervisory actions authorized under 
section 38 of the FDI Act. This part also establishes procedures for 
submission and review of capital restoration plans and for issuance and 
review of directives and orders pursuant to section 38.
    (c) Scope. This part implements the provisions of section 38 of the 
FDI Act as they apply to savings associations. Certain of these 
provisions also apply to officers, directors and employees of savings 
associations. Other provisions apply to any company that controls a 
savings association and to the affiliates of a savings association.
    (d) Other supervisory authority. Neither section 38 nor this part in 
any way limits the authority of the OTS under any other provision of law 
to take supervisory actions to address unsafe or unsound practices, 
deficient capital levels, violations of law, unsafe or unsound 
conditions, or other practices. Action under section 38 of the FDI Act 
and this part may be taken independently of, in conjunction with, or in 
addition to any other enforcement action available to the OTS, including 
issuance of cease and desist orders, capital directives, approval or 
denial of applications or notices, assessment of civil money penalties, 
or any other actions authorized by law.
    (e) Disclosure of capital categories. The assignment of a savings 
association under this part within a particular capital category is for 
purposes of implementing and applying the provisions of section 38. 
Unless permitted by the OTS or otherwise required by law, no savings 
association may state in any advertisement or promotional material its 
capital category under this subpart or that the OTS or any other federal 
banking agency has assigned the savings association to a particular 
category.

if the acquiring insured depository institution or company has sole 
discretionary authority to exercise voting rights with respect thereto.

extended at the discretion of the appropriate federal banking agency for 
up to three one-year periods.
    (b) Controlling person means any person having control of an insured 
depository institution and any company controlled by that person.

other thing of value to a company or individual for the provision of 
management services or advice to the savings association or related 
overhead expenses, including payments related to supervisory, executive,

individual in the individual's capacity as an officer or employee of the 
savings association.

Sec. 565.3  Notice of capital category.

    (a) Effective date of determination of capital category. A savings 
association shall be deemed to be within a given capital category for 
purposes of section 38 of the FDI Act and this part as of the date the 
savings association is notified of, or is deemed to have notice of, its 
capital category, pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Notice of capital category. A savings association shall be 
deemed to have been notified of its capital levels and its capital 
category as of the most recent date:
    (1) A Thrift Financial Report (TFR) is required to be filed with the 
OTS;
    (2) A final report of examination is delivered to the savings 
association; or
    (3) Written notice is provided by the OTS to the savings association 
of its capital category for purposes of section 38 of the FDI Act and 
this part or that the savings association's capital category has changed 
as provided in paragraph (c) of this section or Sec. 565.4(c).
    (c) Adjustments to reported capital levels and category--(1) Notice 
of adjustment by savings association. A savings association shall 
provide the OTS with written notice that an adjustment to the savings 
association's capital category may have occurred no later than 15 
calendar days following the date that any material event has occurred

[[Page 316]]

that would cause the savings association to be placed in a lower capital 
category from the category assigned to the savings association for 
purposes of section 38 and this part on the basis of the savings 
association's most recent TFR or report of examination.
    (2) Determination by the OTS to change capital category. After 
receiving notice pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the OTS 
shall determine whether to change the capital category of the savings 
association and shall notify the savings association of the OTS's 
determination.


<R05>
Sec. 565.4  Capital measures and capital category definitions.

    (a) Capital measures. For purposes of section 38 and this part, the 
relevant capital measures shall be:
    (1) The total risk-based capital ratio;
    (2) The Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio; and
    (3) The leverage ratio.
    (b) Capital categories. For purposes of section 38 and this part, a 
savings association shall be deemed to be:
    (1) Well capitalized if the savings association:
    (i) Has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0 percent or greater; 
and
    (ii) Has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0 percent or 
greater; and
    (iii) Has a leverage ratio of 5.0 percent or greater; and
    (iv) Is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital 
directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the OTS 
pursuant to section 8 of the FDI Act, the International Lending 
Supervision Act of 1983 (5 U.S.C. 3907), the Home Owners' Loan Act (12 
U.S.C. 1464(t)(6)(A)(ii)), or section 38 of the FDI Act, or any 
regulation thereunder, to meet and maintain a specific capital level for 
any capital measure.
    (2) Adequately capitalized if the savings association:
    (i) Has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 percent or greater; 
and
    (ii) Has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.0 percent or 
greater; and
    (iii) Has:
    (A) A leverage ratio of 4.0 percent or greater; or
    (B) A leverage ratio of 3.0 percent or greater if the savings 
association is assigned a composite rating of 1, as defined in 
Sec. 516.3(c) of this chapter; and
    (iv) Does not meet the definition of a well capitalized savings 
association.
    (3) Undercapitalized if the savings association:
    (i) Has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0 
percent; or

percent; or
    (iii) (A) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) (B) of this 
section, has a leverage ratio that is less than 4.0 percent; or
    (B) Has a leverage ratio that is less than 3.0 percent if the 
savings association is assigned a composite rating of 1, as defined in 
Sec. 516.3(c) of this chapter.
    (4) Significantly undercapitalized if the savings association has:
    (i) A total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6.0 percent; 
or
    (ii) A Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 3.0 
percent; or
    (iii) A leverage ratio that is less than 3.0 percent.
    (5) Critically undercapitalized if the savings association has a 
ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 
2.0 percent.
    (c) Reclassification based on supervisory criteria other than 
capital. The OTS may reclassify a well capitalized savings association 
as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized or 
undercapitalized savings association to comply with certain mandatory or 
discretionary supervisory actions as if the savings association were in 
the next lower capital category (except that the OTS may not reclassify 
a significantly undercapitalized savings association as critically 
undercapitalized) (each of these actions are hereinafter referred to 
generally as ``reclassifications'') in the following circumstances:
    (1) Unsafe or unsound condition. The OTS has determined, after 
notice and opportunity for hearing pursuant to Sec. 565.8(a) of this 
part, that the savings association is in an unsafe or unsound condition; 
or
    (2) Unsafe or unsound practice. The OTS has determined, after notice 
and an opportunity for hearing pursuant to Sec. 565.8(a) of this part, 
that the savings association received a less-than-satisfactory rating 
for any rating category

[[Page 317]]

(other than in a rating category specifically addressing capital 
adequacy) under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System,\1\ or 
an equivalent rating under a comparable rating system adopted by the 
OTS; and has not corrected the conditions that served as the basis for 
the less than satisfactory rating. Ratings under this paragraph (c)(2) 
refer to the most recent ratings (as determined either on-site or off-
site by the most recent examination) of which the savings association 
has been notified in writing.

Sec. 565.5  Capital restoration plans.

    (a) Schedule for filing plan--(1) In general. A savings association 
shall file a written capital restoration plan with the appropriate 
Regional Office within 45 days of the date that the savings association 
receives notice or is deemed to have notice that the savings association 
is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically 
undercapitalized, unless the OTS notifies the savings association in 
writing that the plan is to be filed within a different period. An 
adequately capitalized savings association that has been required 
pursuant to Sec. 565.4(c) to comply with supervisory actions as if the 
savings association were undercapitalized is not required to submit a 
capital restoration plan solely by virtue of the reclassification.
    (2) Additional capital restoration plans. Notwithstanding paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, a savings association that has already submitted 
and is operating under a capital restoration plan approved under section 
38 and this part is not required to submit an additional capital 
restoration plan based on a revised calculation of its capital measures 
or a reclassification of the institution under Sec. 565.4(c) unless the 
OTS notifies the savings association that it must submit a new or 
revised capital plan. A savings association that is notified that it 
must submit a new or revised capital restoration plan shall file the 
plan in writing with the appropriate Regional Office within 45 days of 
receiving such notice, unless the OTS notifies the savings association 
in writing that the plan is to be filed within a different period.
    (b) Contents of plan. All financial data submitted in connection 
with a capital restoration plan shall be prepared in accordance with the 
instructions provided on the TFR, unless the OTS instructs otherwise. 
The capital restoration plan shall include all of the information 
required to be filed under section 38(e)(2) of the FDI Act. A savings 
association that is required to submit a capital restoration plan as the 
result of a reclassification of the savings association pursuant to 
Sec. 565.4(c) of this part shall include a description of the steps the 
savings association will take to correct the unsafe or unsound condition 
or practice. No plan shall be accepted unless it includes any 
performance guarantee described in section 38(e)(2)(C) of the FDI Act by 
each company that controls the savings association.
    (c) Review of capital restoration plans. Within 60 days after 
receiving a capital restoration plan under this part, the OTS shall 
provide written notice to the savings association of whether the plan 
has been approved. The OTS may extend the time within which notice 
regarding approval of a plan shall be provided.
    (d) Disapproval of capital plan. If a capital restoration plan is 
not approved by the OTS, the savings association shall submit a revised 
capital restoration plan, when directed to do so, within the time 
specified by the OTS. Upon receiving notice that its capital restoration 
plan has not been approved, any undercapitalized savings association (as 
defined in Sec. 565.4(b)(3) of this part) shall be subject to all of the 
provisions of section 38 and this part applicable to significantly 
undercapitalized institutions. These provisions shall be applicable 
until such time as a new or revised capital restoration plan submitted 
by the savings association has been approved by the OTS.
    (e) Failure to submit a capital restoration plan. A savings 
association that is undercapitalized (as defined in Sec. 565.4(b)(3) of 
this part) and that fails to submit a written capital restoration plan 
within the period provided in this section shall, upon the expiration of

[[Page 318]]

that period, be subject to all of the provisions of section 38 and this 
part applicable to significantly undercapitalized institutions.
    (f) Failure to implement a capital restoration plan. Any 
undercapitalized savings association that fails in any material respect 
to implement a capital restoration plan shall be subject to all of the 
provisions of section 38 and this part applicable to significantly 
undercapitalized institutions.
    (g) Amendment of capital plan. A savings association that has filed 
an approved capital restoration plan may, after prior written notice to 
and approval by the OTS, amend the plan to reflect a change in 
circumstance. Until such time as a proposed amendment has been approved, 
the savings association shall implement the capital restoration plan as 
approved prior to the proposed amendment.
    (h) Notice to FDIC. Within 45 days of the effective date of OTS 
approval of a capital restoration plan, or any amendment to a capital 
restoration plan, the OTS shall provide a copy of the plan or amendment 
to the FDIC.
    (i) Performance guarantee by companies that control a savings 
association.--(1) Limitation on liability.--(i) Amount limitation. The 
aggregate liability under the guarantee provided under section 38 and 
this part for all companies that control a specific savings association 
that is required to submit a capital restoration plan under this part 
shall be limited to the lesser of:
    (A) An amount equal to 5.0 percent of the savings association's 
total assets at the time the savings association was notified or deemed 
to have notice that the savings association was undercapitalized; or
    (B) The amount necessary to restore the relevant capital measures of 
the savings association to the levels required for the savings 
association to be classified as adequately capitalized, as those capital 
measures and levels are defined at the time that the savings association 
initially fails to comply with a capital restoration plan under this 
part.
    (ii) Limit on duration. The guarantee and limit of liability under 
section 38 and this part shall expire after the OTS notifies the savings 
association that it has remained adequately capitalized for each of four 
consecutive calendar quarters. The expiration or fulfillment by a 
company of a guarantee of a capital restoration plan shall not limit the 
liability of the company under any guarantee required or provided in 
connection with any capital restoration plan filed by the same savings 
association after expiration of the first guarantee.
    (iii) Collection on guarantee. Each company that controls a given 
savings association shall be jointly and severally liable for the 
guarantee for such savings association as required under section 38 and 
this part, and the OTS may require and collect payment of the full 
amount of that guarantee from any or all of the companies issuing the 
guarantee.
    (2) Failure to provide guarantee. In the event that a savings 
association that is controlled by any company submits a capital 
restoration plan that does not contain the guarantee required under 
section 38(e)(2) of the FDI Act, the savings association shall, upon 
submission of the plan, be subject to the provisions of section 38 and 
this part that are applicable to savings associations that have not 
submitted an acceptable capital restoration plan.
    (3) Failure to perform guarantee. Failure by any company that 
controls a savings association to perform fully its guarantee of any 
capital plan shall constitute a material failure to implement the plan 
for purposes of section 38(f) of the FDI Act. Upon such failure, the 
savings association shall be subject to the provisions of section 38 and 
this part that are applicable to savings associations that have failed 
in a material respect to implement a capital restoration plan.


<R05>
Sec. 565.6  Mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions under section 38.

    (a) Mandatory supervisory actions.--(1) Provisions applicable to all 
savings associations. All savings associations are subject to the 
restrictions contained in section 38(d) of the FDI Act on payment of 
capital distributions and management fees.

[[Page 319]]

    (2) Provisions applicable to undercapitalized, significantly 
undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized savings associations. 
Immediately upon receiving notice or being deemed to have notice, as 
provided in Sec. 565.3 or Sec. 565.5 of this part, that the savings 
association is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or 
critically undercapitalized, the savings association shall become 
subject to the provisions of section 38 of the FDI Act:
    (i) Restricting payment of capital distributions and management fees 
(section 38(d));
    (ii) Requiring that the OTS monitor the condition of the savings 
association (section 38(e)(1));
    (iii) Requiring submission of a capital restoration plan within the 
schedule established in this part (section 38(e)(2));

<R05>
Sec. 565.7  Directives to take prompt corrective action.

    (a) Notice of intent to issue a directive.--(1) In general. The OTS 
shall provide an undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or 
critically undercapitalized savings association or, where appropriate, 
any company that controls the savings association, prior written notice 
of the OTS's intention to issue a directive requiring such savings 
association or company to take actions or to follow proscriptions 
described in section 38 that are within the OTS's discretion to require 
or impose under section 38 of the FDI Act, including sections 38(e)(5), 
(f)(2), (f)(3), or (f)(5). The savings association shall have such time 
to respond to a proposed directive as provided by the OTS under 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) Immediate issuance of final directive. If the OTS finds it 
necessary in order to carry out the purposes of section 38 of the FDI 
Act, the OTS may, without providing the notice prescribed in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, issue a directive requiring a savings 
association or any company that controls a savings association 
immediately to take actions or to follow proscriptions described in 
section 38 that are within

[[Page 320]]

the OTS's discretion to require or impose under section 38 of the FDI 
Act, including section 38(e)(5), (f)(2), (f)(3), or (f)(5). A savings 
association or company that is subject to such an immediately effective 
directive may submit a written appeal of the directive to the OTS. Such 
an appeal must be received by the OTS within 14 calendar days of the 
issuance of the directive, unless the OTS permits a longer period. The 
OTS shall consider any such appeal, if filed in a timely matter, within 
60 days of receiving the appeal. During such period of review, the 
directive shall remain in effect unless the OTS, in its sole discretion, 
stays the effectiveness of the directive.
    (b) Contents of notice. A notice of intention to issue a directive 
shall include:
    (1) A statement of the savings association's capital measures and 
capital levels;
    (2) A description of the restrictions, prohibitions or affirmative 
actions that the OTS proposes to impose or require;
    (3) The proposed date when such restrictions or prohibitions would 
be effective or the proposed date for completion of such affirmative 
actions; and
    (4) The date by which the savings association or company subject to 
the directive may file with the OTS a written response to the notice.
    (c) Response to notice.--(1) Time for response. A savings 
association or company may file a written response to a notice of intent 
to issue a directive within the time period set by the OTS. The date 
shall be at least 14 calendar days from the date of the notice unless 
the OTS determines that a shorter period is appropriate in light of the 
financial condition of the savings association or other relevant 
circumstances.
    (2) Content of response. The response should include:
    (i) An explanation why the action proposed by the OTS is not an 
appropriate exercise of discretion under section 38;
    (ii) Any recommended modification of the proposed directive; and
    (iii) Any other relevant information, mitigating circumstances, 
documentation, or other evidence in support of the position of the 
savings association or company regarding the proposed directive.
    (d) OTS consideration of response. After considering the response, 
the OTS may:
    (1) Issue the directive as proposed or in modified form;
    (2) Determine not to issue the directive and so notify the savings 
association or company; or
    (3) Seek additional information or clarification of the response 
from the savings association or company, or any other relevant source.
    (e) Failure to file response. Failure by a savings association or 
company to file with the OTS, within the specified time period, a 
written response to a proposed directive shall constitute a waiver of 
the opportunity to respond and shall constitute consent to the issuance 
of the directive.
    (f) Request for modification or rescission of directive. Any savings 
association or company that is subject to a directive under this part 
may, upon a change in circumstances, request in writing that the OTS 
reconsider the terms of the directive, and may propose that the 
directive be rescinded or modified. Unless otherwise ordered by the OTS, 
the directive shall continue in place while such request is pending 
before the OTS.

Sec. 565.8  Procedures for reclassifying a savings association based on criteria other than capital.

    (a) Reclassification based on unsafe or unsound condition or 
practice--(1) Issuance of notice of proposed reclassification--(i) 
Grounds for reclassification. (A) Pursuant to Sec. 565.4(c) of this 
part, the OTS may reclassify a well capitalized savings association as 
adequately capitalized or subject an adequately capitalized or 
undercapitalized institution to the supervisory actions applicable to 
the next lower capital category if:
    (1) The OTS determines that the savings association is in unsafe or 
unsound condition; or
    (2) The OTS deems the savings association to be engaged in an unsafe 
or unsound practice and not to have corrected the deficiency.
    (B) Any action pursuant to this paragraph (a)(1)(i) shall 
hereinafter be referred to as ``reclassification.''

[[Page 321]]

    (ii) Prior notice to institution. Prior to taking action pursuant to 
Sec. 565.4(c)(1), the OTS shall issue and serve on the savings 
association a written notice of the OTS's intention to reclassify the 
savings association.
    (2) Contents of notice. A notice of intention to reclassify a 
savings association based on unsafe or unsound condition shall include:
    (i) A statement of the savings association's capital measures and 
capital levels and the category to which the savings association would 
be reclassified;
    (ii) The reasons for reclassification of the savings association;
    (iii) The date by which the savings association subject to the 
notice of reclassification may file with the OTS a written appeal of the 
proposed reclassification and a request for a hearing, which shall be at 
least 14 calendar days from the date of service of the notice unless the 
OTS determines that a shorter period is appropriate in light of the 
financial condition of the savings association or other relevant 
circumstances.
    (3) Response to notice of proposed reclassification. A savings 
association may file a written response to a notice of proposed 
reclassification within the time period set by the OTS. The response 
should include:
    (i) An explanation of why the savings association is not in unsafe 
or unsound condition or otherwise should not be reclassified; and
    (ii) Any other relevant information, mitigating circumstances,

savings association or company regarding the reclassification.
    (4) Failure to file response. Failure by a savings association to 
file, within the specified time period, a written response with the OTS 
to a notice of proposed reclassification shall constitute a waiver of 
the opportunity to respond and shall constitute consent to the 
reclassification.
    (5) Request for hearing and presentation of oral testimony or 
witnesses. The response may include a request for an informal hearing 
before the OTS or its designee under this section. If the savings 
association desires to present oral testimony or witnesses at the 
hearing, the savings association shall include a request to do so with 
the request for an informal hearing. A request to present oral testimony 
or witnesses shall specify the names of the witnesses and the general 
nature of their expected testimony. Failure to request a hearing shall 
constitute a waiver of any right to a hearing, and failure to request 
the opportunity to present oral testimony or witnesses shall constitute

    (6) Order for informal hearing. Upon receipt of a timely written 
request that includes a request for a hearing, the OTS shall issue an 
order directing an informal hearing to commence no later than 30 days

request of the savings association. The hearing shall be held in 
Washington, DC or at such other place as may be designated by the OTS, 
before a presiding officer(s) designated by the OTS to conduct the 
hearing.
    (7) Hearing procedures. (i) The savings association shall have the 
right to introduce relevant written materials and to present oral 
argument at the hearing. The savings association may introduce oral 
testimony and present witnesses only if expressly authorized by the OTS 
or the presiding officer(s). Neither the provisions of the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 554-557) governing adjudications 
required by statute to be determined on the record nor part 509 of this 
chapter apply to an informal hearing under this section unless the OTS 
orders that such procedures shall apply.
    (ii) The informal hearing shall be recorded and a transcript 
furnished to the savings association upon request and payment of the 
cost thereof. Witnesses need not be sworn, unless specifically requested 
by a party or the presiding officer(s). The presiding officer(s) may ask 
questions of any witness.

savings association and notify the savings association of the OTS's 
decision.
    (b) Request for rescission of reclassification. Any savings 
association that has been reclassified under this section, may, upon a 
change in circumstances, request in writing that the OTS reconsider the 
reclassification, and may propose that the reclassification be rescinded 
and that any directives issued in connection with the reclassification 
be modified, rescinded, or removed. Unless otherwise ordered by the OTS, 
the savings association shall remain subject to the reclassification and 
to any directives issued in connection with that reclassification while 
such request is pending before the OTS.


<R05>

    (a) Service of notice. When the OTS issues and serves a directive on 
a savings association pursuant to section 565.7 requiring the savings 
association to dismiss any director or senior executive officer under 
section 38(f)(2)(F)(ii) of the FDI Act, the OTS shall also serve a copy 
of the directive, or the relevant portions of the directive where 
appropriate, upon the person to be dismissed.

include a request to do so with the request for an informal hearing. The 
request to present oral testimony or witnesses shall specify the names 
of the witnesses and the general nature of their expected testimony. 
Failure to request a hearing shall constitute a waiver of any right to a 
hearing and failure to request the opportunity to present oral testimony 
or witnesses shall constitute a waiver of any right or opportunity to 
present oral testimony or witnesses.
    (3) Effective date. Unless otherwise ordered by the OTS, the 
dismissal shall remain in effect while a request for reinstatement is 
pending.
    (c) Order for informal hearing. Upon receipt of a timely written 
request from a Respondent for an informal hearing on the portion of a 
directive requiring a savings association to dismiss from office any 
director or senior executive officer, the OTS shall issue an order 
directing an informal hearing to commence no later than 30 days after

for a reasonable period (normally five business days) following 
completion of oral testimony or argument to allow additional written 
submissions to the hearing record.
    (e) Standard for review. A Respondent shall bear the burden of 
demonstrating that his or her continued employment by or service with 
the savings association would materially strengthen the savings 
association's ability:
    (1) To become adequately capitalized, to the extent that the 
directive was issued as a result of the savings association's capital 
level or failure to submit or implement a capital restoration plan; and
    (2) To correct the unsafe or unsound condition or unsafe or unsound 
practice, to the extent that the directive was issued as a result of 
classification of the savings association based on supervisory criteria 
other than capital, pursuant to section 38(g) of the FDI Act.
    (f) Recommendation of presiding officers. Within 20 calendar days 
following the date the hearing and the record on the proceeding are 
closed, the presiding officer(s) shall make a recommendation to the OTS 
concerning the Respondent's request for reinstatement with the savings 
association.

date the record is closed or the date of the response in a case where no 
hearing has been requested, the OTS shall grant or deny the request for

comply with any final directive issued under section 38 and against any 
institution-affiliated party who participates in such violation or 
noncompliance.
    (2) Failure to implement capital restoration plan. The failure of a 
savings association to implement a capital restoration plan required 
under section 38, or this part, or the failure of a company having 
control of a savings association to fulfill a guarantee of a capital 
restoration plan made pursuant to section 38(e)(2) of the FDI Act shall 
subject the savings association or company to the assessment of civil 
money penalties pursuant to section 8(i)(2)(A) of the FDI Act.

    (i) The amount of its liquidity base at the end of the preceding 
calendar quarter; or
    (ii) The average daily balance of its liquidity base during the

loan:
    (A) The current loan balance amount does not exceed 75 percent of 
the value of the property securing the loan; and

property, as an alternative to paragraphs (1) (iii), (vi), and (vii) of 
this definition:

are not inconsistent with the safety and soundness objectives of this 
definition.

goodwill means, for eligible savings associations:

interest rate and exchange-rate contracts, the loss that would be 
incurred in the event of a counterparty default, as measured by the net 
cost of replacing the contract at the current market value. If default

considered to be zero. This mark-to-market process must incorporate 
changes in both interest rates and counterparty credit quality.
    Residential properties. The term residential properties means 
houses, condominiums, cooperative units, and manufactured homes. This

interest and the assets of which are consolidated with those of the 
savings association for purposes of reporting under Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles (GAAP). Generally, these are majority-owned 
subsidiaries.<SUP>1</SUP> This definition does not include ownership 
interests that were taken in satisfaction of debts previously 
contracted, provided that the reporting association has not held the 
interest for more than five years or a longer period approved by the 
OTS.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The OTS reserves the right to review a savings association's 
investment in a subsidiary on a case-by-case basis. If the OTS

such determination regardless of the percentage of ownership held by the 
savings association.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

means, with respect to a commitment-type lending arrangement, that the 
savings association may, at any time, with or without cause, refuse to 
advance funds or extend credit under the facility. In the case of home 
equity lines of credit, the savings association is deemed able to 
unconditionally cancel the commitment if it can, at its option, prohibit 
additional extensions of credit, reduce the line, and terminate the 
commitment to the full extent permitted by relevant Federal law.
    United States Government or its agencies. The term United States 
Government or its agencies means an instrumentality of the U.S.

Sec. 567.2  Minimum regulatory capital requirement.

    (a) To meet its regulatory capital requirement a savings association 
must satisfy each of the following capital standards:

[[Page 334]]

    (1) Risk-based capital requirement. (i) A savings association's 
minimum risk-based capital requirement shall be an amount equal to 8% of 
its risk-weighted assets as measured pursuant to Sec. 567.6(a) of this 
part.
    (ii) A savings association may not use supplementary capital to 
satisfy this requirement in an amount greater than 100% of its core 
capital as defined in Sec. 567.5 of this part.
    (2) Leverage ratio requirement. (i) A savings association's minimum 
leverage ratio requirement shall be the amount set forth in Sec. 567.8 
of this part.
    (ii) A savings association must satisfy this requirement with core 
capital as defined in Sec. 567.5 of this part in an amount not less than 
3% of its adjusted total assets.
    (3) Tangible capital requirement. (i) A savings association's 
minimum tangible capital requirement shall be the amount set forth in 
Sec. 567.9 of this part.
    (ii) A savings association must satisfy this requirement with 
tangible capital as defined in Sec. 567.9 of this part in an amount not 
less than 1.5% of its adjusted total assets.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Savings associations are expected to maintain compliance with 
all of these standards at all times.

<R05>
Sec. 567.3  Individual minimum capital requirements.

    (a) Purpose and scope. The rules and procedures specified in this 
section apply to the establishment of an individual minimum capital 
requirement for a savings association that varies from the requirement 
that would otherwise apply to the savings association under Sec. 567.2 
of this part. Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1464(s), the OTS may establish such 
individual minimum capital requirements for savings associations as it 
deems necessary or appropriate on a case-by-case basis in light of the 
particular circumstances of each savings association.
    (2) Upon adoption and satisfactory implementation of such guidelines 
under the oversight of the Office, the Office may delegate, in all or in 
part, exclusively to the District Directors the authority to set 
individual minimum capital requirements in conformance with the 
guidelines without the requirement for case-by-case concurrence by the 
Deputy Director for Regional Operations and the Office subsequently may 
terminate such delegation. Under such delegation, a District Director's 
decision would constitute final agency action. After such delegation, 
the Deputy Director for Washington Operations under the Office's 
oversight would retain control over the guidelines for District Director 
action and would oversee implementation of and compliance with the 
guidelines. The Deputy Director for Regional Operations would continue 
to be notified of individual minimum capital requirements set by the 
District Directors.
    (b) Appropriate considerations for establishing individual minimum 
capital requirements. Minimum capital levels higher than those required 
under Sec. 567.2 may be appropriate for individual savings associations. 
Increased individual minimum capital requirements may be established 
upon a determination that the savings association's capital is or may 
become inadequate in view of its circumstances. For example, higher 
capital levels may be appropriate for:
    (1) A savings association receiving special supervisory attention;
    (2) A savings association that has or is expected to have losses 
resulting in capital inadequacy;
    (3) A savings association that has a high degree of exposure to 
interest rate risk, prepayment risk, credit risk, concentration of 
credit risk, certain risks arising from nontraditional activities, or 
similar risks; or a high proportion of off-balance sheet risk, 
especially standby letters of credit;
    (4) A savings association that has poor liquidity or cash flow;
    (5) A savings association growing, either internally or through 
acquisitions, at such a rate that supervisory problems are presented 
that are not dealt with adequately by other Office regulations or other 
guidance;
    (6) A savings association that may be adversely affected by the 
activities or condition of its holding company, affiliate(s), 
subsidiaries, or other persons or savings associations with which it has

[[Page 335]]

significant business relationships, including concentrations of credit;
    (7) A savings association with a portfolio reflecting weak credit 
quality or a significant likelihood of financial loss, or that has loans 
in nonperforming status or on which borrowers fail to comply with 
repayment terms;
    (8) A savings association that has inadequate underwriting policies, 
standards, or procedures for its loans and investments; or
    (9) A savings association that has a record of operational losses 
that exceeds the average of other, similarly situated savings 
associations; has management deficiencies, including failure to 
adequately monitor and control financial and operating risks, 
particularly the risks presented by concentrations of credit and 
nontraditional activities; or has a poor record of supervisory 
compliance.
    (c) Standards for determination of appropriate individual minimum 
capital requirements. The appropriate minimum capital level for an 
individual savings association cannot be determined solely through the 
application of a rigid mathematical formula or wholly objective 
criteria. The decision is necessarily based, in part, on subjective 
judgment grounded in agency expertise. The factors to be considered in 
the determination will vary in each case and may include, for example:
    (1) The conditions or circumstances leading to the determination 
that a higher minimum capital requirement is appropriate or necessary 
for the savings association;
    (2) The exigency of those circumstances or potential problems;
    (3) The overall condition, management strength, and future prospects 
of the savings association and, if applicable, its holding company, 
subsidiaries, and affiliates;
    (4) The savings association's liquidity, capital and other 
indicators of financial stability, particularly as compared with those 
of similarly situated savings associations; and
    (5) The policies and practices of the savings association's 
directors, officers, and senior management as well as the internal 
control and internal audit systems for implementation of such adopted 
policies and practices.
    (d) Procedures--(1) Notification. When the OTS determines that a 
minimum capital requirement different from that set forth in Sec. 567.2 
of this part is necessary or appropriate for a particular savings 
association, it shall notify the savings association in writing of its 
proposed individual minimum capital requirement; the schedule for 
compliance with the new requirement; and the specific causes for 
determining that the higher individual minimum capital requirement is 
necessary or appropriate for the savings association. The OTS shall 
forward the notifying letter to the appropriate state supervisor if a 
state-chartered savings association would be subject to an individual 
minimum capital requirement.
    (2) Response. (i) The response shall include any information that 
the savings association wants the OTS to consider in deciding whether to 
establish or to amend an individual minimum capital requirement for the 
savings association, what the individual capital requirement should be, 
and, if applicable, what compliance schedule is appropriate for 
achieving the required capital level. The responses of the savings 
association and appropriate state supervisor must be in writing and must 
be delivered to the OTS within 30 days after the date on which the 
notification was received. Such response should be filed in accordance 
with Sec. 516.1(c) of this chapter. The OTS may extend the time period 
for good cause. The time period for response by the insured savings 
association may be shortened for good cause:
    (A) When, in the opinion of the OTS, the condition of the savings 
association so requires, and the OTS informs the savings association of 
the shortened response period in the notice;
    (B) With the consent of the savings association; or
    (C) When the savings association already has advised the OTS that it 
cannot or will not achieve its applicable minimum capital requirement.
    (ii) Failure to respond within 30 days, or such other time period as 
may be specified by the OTS, may constitute a

[[Page 336]]

waiver of any objections to the proposed individual minimum capital 
requirement or to the schedule for complying with it, unless the OTS has 
provided an extension of the response period for good cause.
    (3) Decision. After expiration of the response period, the OTS shall 
decide whether or not he believes the proposed individual minimum 
capital requirement should be established for the savings association, 
or whether that proposed requirement should be adopted in modified form, 
based on a review of the savings association's response and other 
relevant information. The OTS's decision shall address comments received 
within the response period from the savings association and the 
appropriate state supervisor (if a state-chartered savings association 
is involved) and shall state the level of capital required, the schedule 
for compliance with this requirement, and any specific remedial action 
the savings association could take to eliminate the need for continued 
applicability of the individual minimum capital requirement. The OTS 
shall provide the savings association and the appropriate state 
supervisor (if a state-chartered savings association is involved) with a 
written decision on the individual minimum capital requirement, 
addressing the substantive comments made by the savings association and 
setting forth the decision and the basis for that decision. Upon receipt 
of this decision by the savings association, the individual minimum 
capital requirement becomes effective and binding upon the savings 
association. This decision represents final agency action.
    (4) Failure to comply. Failure to satisfy an individual minimum 
capital requirement, or to meet any required incremental additions to 
capital under a schedule for compliance with such an individual minimum 
capital requirement, shall constitute a legal basis for issuing a 
capital directive pursuant to Sec. 567.4 of this part.
    (5) Change in circumstances. If, after a decision is made under 
paragraph (d)(3) of this section, there is a change in the circumstances 
affecting the savings association's capital adequacy or its ability to 
reach its required minimum capital level by the specified date, OTS may 
amend the individual minimum capital requirement or the savings 
association's schedule for such compliance. The OTS may decline to 
consider a savings association's request for such changes that are not 
based on a significant change in circumstances or that are repetitive or 
frivolous. Pending the OTS's reexamination of the original decision, 
that original decision and any compliance schedule established 
thereunder shall continue in full force and effect.

<R05>
Sec. 567.4  Capital directives.

    (a) Issuance of a Capital Directive--(1) Purpose. In addition to any 
other action authorized by law, the Office may issue a capital directive 
to a savings association that does not have an amount of capital 
satisfying its minimum capital requirement. Issuance of such a capital 
directive may be based on a savings association's noncompliance with a 
capital requirement established under Sec. 567.2, Sec. 567.3, by a 
written agreement under 12 U.S.C. 1464(s), or as a condition for 
approval of an application. A capital directive may order a savings 
association to:
    (i) Achieve its minimum capital requirement by a specified date;
    (ii) Adhere to the compliance schedule for achieving its individual 
minimum capital requirement;
    (iii) Submit and adhere to a capital plan acceptable to the Office 
describing the means and a time schedule by which the savings 
association shall reach its required capital level;
    (iv) Take other action, including but not limited to, reducing the 
savings association's assets or its rate of liability growth, or 
imposing restrictions on the savings association's payment of dividends, 
in order to cause the savings association to reach its required capital 
level;
    (v) Take any action authorized under Sec. 567.10(e); or
    (vi) Take a combination of any of these actions.

A capital directive issued under this section, including a plan 
submitted

[[Page 337]]

pursuant to a capital directive, is enforceable under 12 U.S.C. 1818 in 
the same manner and to the same extent as an effective and outstanding 
cease and desist order which has become final under 12 U.S.C. 1818.
    (2) Notice of intent to issue capital directive. The OTS will 
determine whether to initiate the process of issuing a capital 
directive. The OTS will notify a savings association in writing by 
registered mail of its intention to issue a capital directive. If a 
state-chartered savings association is involved, the OTS will also 
notify and solicit comment from the appropriate state supervisor. The 
notice will state:
    (i) The reasons for issuance of the capital directive and
    (ii) The proposed contents of the capital directive.
    (3) Response to notice of intent. (i) A savings association may 
respond to the notice of intent by submitting its own compliance plan, 
or may propose an alternative plan. The response should also include any 
information that the savings association wishes the OTS to consider in 
deciding whether to issue a capital directive. The appropriate state 
supervisor may also submit a response. These responses must be in 
writing and be delivered within 30 days after the receipt of the 
notices. Such responses shall be submitted in accordance with 
Sec. 516.1(c) of this chapter. In its discretion, the Office may extend 
the time period for the response for good cause. The Office may, for 
good cause, shorten the 30-day time period for response by the insured 
savings assocation:
    (A) When, in the opinion of the Office, the condition of the savings 
association so requires, and the Office informs the savings association 
of the shortened response period in the notice;
    (B) With the consent of the savings association; or
    (C) When the savings association already has advised the Office that 
it cannot or will not achieve its applicable minimum capital 
requirement.
    (ii) Failure to respond within 30 days of receipt, or such other 
time period as may be specified by the Office, may constitute a waiver 
of any objections to the capital directive unless the Office grants an 
extension of the time period for good cause.
    (4) Decision. After the closing date of the savings association's 
response period, or upon receipt of the savings association's response, 
if earlier, the Office shall consider the savings association's response 
and may seek additional information or clarification of the response. 
Thereafter, the Office will determine whether or not to issue a capital 
directive and, if one is to be issued, whether it should be as 
originally proposed or in modified form.
    (5) Service and effectiveness. (i) Upon issuance, a capital 
directive will be served upon the savings association. It will include 
or be accompanied by a statement of reasons for its issuance and shall 
address the responses received during the response period.
    (ii) A capital directive shall become effective upon the expiration 
of 30 days after service upon the savings association, unless the Office 
determines that a shorter effective period is necessary either on 
account of the public interest or in order to achieve the capital 
directive's purpose. If the savings association has consented to 
issuance of the capital directive, it may become effective immediately. 
A capital directive shall remain in effect and enforceable unless, and 
then only to the extent that, it is stayed, modified, or terminated by 
the Office.
    (6) Change in circumstances. Upon a change in circumstances, a 
savings association may submit a request to the OTS to reconsider the 
terms of the capital directive or consider changes in the savings 
association's capital plan issued under a directive for the savings 
association to achieve its minimum capital requirement. If the OTS 
believes such a change is warranted, the OTS may modify the savings 
association's capital requirement or may refuse to make such 
modification if it determines that there are not significant changes in 
circumstances. Pending a decision on reconsideration, the capital 
directive and capital plan shall continue in full force and effect.
    (b) Relation to other administrative actions. The Office--
    (1) May consider a savings association's progress in adhering to any 
capital plan required under this section

[[Page 338]]

whenever such savings association or any affiliate of such savings 
association (including any company which controls such savings 
association) seeks approval for any proposal that would have the effect 
of diverting earnings, diminishing capital, or otherwise impeding such 
savings association's progress in meeting its minimum capital 
requirement; and
    (2) May disapprove any proposal referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section if the Office determines that the proposal would adversely 
affect the ability of the savings association on a current or pro forma 
basis to satisfy its capital requirement.

Sec. 567.5  Components of capital.

    (a) Core Capital. (1) The following elements,\3\ less the amount of 
any deductions pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, comprise a 
savings association' s core capital:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Stock issues where the dividend is reset periodically based on 
current market conditions and the savings associations's current credit 
rating, including but not limited to, auction rate, money market or 
remarketable preferred stock, are assigned to supplementary capital, 
regardless of cumulative or noncumulative characteristics.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) Common stockholders' equity (including retained earnings);
    (ii) Noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus;\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ Stock issued by subsidiaries that may not be counted by the 
parent savings association on the Thrift Financial Report, likewise 
shall not be considered in calculating capital. For example, preferred 
stock issued by a savings association or a subsidiary that is, in 
effect, collateralized by assets of the savings association or one of 
its subsidiaries shall not be included in capital. Similarly, common 
stock with mandatorily redeemable provisions is not includable in core 
capital.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (iii) Minority interests in the equity accounts of subsidiaries that 
are fully consolidated;
    (iv) Nonwithdrawable accounts and pledged deposits of mutual savings 
associations (excluding any treasury shares held by the savings 
association) meeting the criteria of regulations and memoranda of the 
Office to the extent that such accounts or deposits have no fixed 
maturity date, cannot be withdrawn at the option of the accountholder, 
and do not earn interest that carries over to subsequent periods;
    (v) The remaining goodwill (FSLIC Capital Contributions) resulting 
from prior regulatory accounting practices as provided in paragraph (1) 
of the definition for qualifying supervisory goodwill in Sec. 567.1 of 
this part.
    (2) Deductions from core capital. (i) Intangible assets, as defined 
in Sec. 567.1 of this part, are deducted from assets and capital in 
computing core capital, except as otherwise provided by Sec. 567.12 of 
this part.
    (ii) Mortgage servicing rights (both originated and purchased) that 
are not includable in tangible and core capital pursuant to Sec. 567.12 
of this part are deducted from assets and capital in computing core 
capital.
    (iii) [Reserved]
    (iv) Investments, both equity and debt, in subsidiaries that are not 
includable subsidiaries (including those subsidiaries where the savings 
association has a minority ownership interest) are deducted from assets 
and, thus core capital except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2)(v) and 
(a)(2)(vi) of this section.
    (v) If a savings association has any investments (both debt and 
equity) in one or more subsidiaries engaged as of April 12, 1989 and 
continuing to be engaged in any activity that would not fall within the 
scope of activities in which includable subsidiaries may engage, it must 
deduct such investments from assets and, thus, core capital in 
accordance with this paragraph (a)(2)(v). The savings association must 
first deduct from assets and, thus, core capital the amount by which any 
investments in such subsidiary(ies) exceed the amount of such 
investments held by the savings association as of April 12, 1989. Next 
the savings association must deduct from assets and, thus, core capital 
the lesser of:
    (A) The savings association's investments in and extensions of 
credit to the subsidiary as of April 12, 1989; or
    (B) The savings association's investments in and extensions of 
credit to the subsidiary on the date as of which

[[Page 339]]

the savings association's capital is being determined.
    (vi) If a savings association holds a subsidiary (either directly or 
through a subsidiary) that is itself a domestic depository institution, 
the Office may, in its sole discretion upon determining that the amount 
of core capital that would be required would be higher if the assets and 
liabilities of such subsidiary were consolidated with those of the 
parent savings association than the amount that would be required if the 
parent savings association's investment were deducted pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(2)(iv) and (a)(2)(v) of this section, consolidate the 
assets and liabilities of that subsidiary with those of the parent 
savings association in calculating the capital adequacy of the parent 
savings association, regardless of whether the subsidiary would 
otherwise be an includable subsidiary as defined in Sec. 567.1 of this 
part.
    (b) Supplementary Capital. Supplementary capital counts towards a 
savings association's total capital up to a maximum of 100% of the 
savings association's core capital. The following elements comprise a 
savings association's supplementary capital:
    (1) Permanent Capital Instruments. (i) Cumulative perpetual 
preferred stock and other perpetual preferred stock \5\ issued pursuant 
to regulations and memoranda of the Office;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Preferred stock issued by subsidiaries that may not be counted 
by the parent savings association on the Thrift Financial Report 
likewise may not be considered in calculating capital. Preferred stock 
issued by a savings association or a subsidiary that is, in effect, 
collateralized by assets of the savings association or one of its 
subsidiaries may not be included in capital.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) Mutual capital certificates issued pursuant to regulations and 
memoranda of the Office;
    (iii) Nonwithdrawable accounts and pledged deposits (excluding any 
treasury shares held by the savings association) meeting the criteria of 
12 CFR 561.42 to the extent that such instruments are not included in 
core capital under paragraph (a) of this section;
    (iv) Net worth certificates either issued pursuant to regulations 
and memoranda of the Office, or that the FDIC is committed to purchase;
    (v) Income capital certificates;
    (vi) Perpetual subordinated debt issued pursuant to regulations and 
memoranda of the Office; and
    (vii) Mandatory convertible subordinated debt (capital notes) issued 
pursuant to regulations and memoranda of the Office.
    (2) Maturing Capital Instruments. (i) Subordinated debt issued 
pursuant to regulations and memoranda of the Office;
    (ii) Intermediate-term preferred stock issued pursuant to 
regulations and memoranda of the Office and any related surplus:
    (iii) Mandatory convertible subordinated debt (commitment notes) 
issued pursuant to regulations and memoranda of the Office; and
    (iv) Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock that was issued before 
July 23, 1985 or issued pursuant to regulations and memoranda of the 
Office and approved in writing by the FSLIC for inclusion as regulatory 
capital before or after issuance.
    (3) Transition rules for maturing capital instruments--(i) Maturing 
capital instruments issued on or before November 7, 1989. All maturing 
capital instruments issued on or before November 7, 1989, are includable 
in supplementary capital to the extent such instruments were includable 
in capital pursuant to the regulations of the OTS in effect as of that 
date, including any applicable amortization schedules. With the prior 
approval of the OTS, a savings association may include maturing capital 
instruments issued on or before November 7, 1989, in supplementary 
capital in accordance with the treatment set forth in paragraph 
(b)(3)(ii) of this section.

                                                                        
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              Percent   
                                                            included in 
    Years to maturity of outstanding subordinated debt     supplementary
                                                              capital   
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greater than or equal to 7...............................          100  
Less than 7 but greater than or equal to 6...............           86  
Less than 6 but greater than or equal to 5...............           71  
Less than 5 but greater than or equal to 4...............           57  
Less than 4 but greater than or equal to 3...............           43  
Less than 3 but greater than or equal to 2...............           29  
Less than 2 but greater than or equal to 1...............           14  
Less than 1..............................................            0  

[[Page 340]]

                                                                        
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) Maturing capital instruments issued after November 7, 1989. A 
savings association issuing maturing capital instruments after November 
7, 1989, may choose, subject to paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, 
to include such instruments pursuant to either paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) 
or (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.
    (A) At the beginning of each of the last five years of the life of 
the maturing capital instrument, the amount that is eligible to be 
included as supplementary capital is reduced by 20% of the original 
amount of that instrument (net of redemptions).\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ Capital instruments may be redeemed prior to maturity and 
without the prior approval of the Office, as long as the instruments are 
redeemed with the proceeds of, or replaced by, a like amount of a 
similar or higher quality capital instrument. However, the Office must 
be notified in writing at least 30 days in advance of such redemption.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (B) Only the aggregate amount of maturing capital instruments that 
mature in any one year during the seven years immediately prior to an 
instrument's maturity that does not exceed 20% of an institution's 
capital will qualify as supplementary capital.
    (C) Once a savings association selects either paragraph 
(b)(3)(ii)(A) or (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section for the issuance of a 
maturing capital instrument, it must continue to elect that option for 
all subsequent issuances of maturing capital instruments for as long as 
there is a balance outstanding of such post-November 7, 1989 issuances. 
Only when such issuances have all been repaid and the savings 
association has no balance of such issuances outstanding may the savings 
association elect the other option.
    (4) General valuation loan and lease loss allowances. General 
valuation loan and lease loss allowances established pursuant to 
regulations and memoranda of the Office up to a maximum of 1.25 percent 
of risk-weighted assets.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ The amount of the general valuation loan and lease loss 
allowances that may be included in capital is based on a percentage of 
risk-weighted assets. The gross sum of risk-weighted assets used in this 
calculation includes all risk-weighted assets, with the exception of the 
assets required to be deducted under Sec. 567.6 in establishing risk-
weighted assets--``excess GVA'' defined as assets required to be 
deducted from capital under Sec. 567.5(a)(2). A savings association may 
deduct excess GVA from the gross sum of risk-weighted assets (i.e., 
risk-weighted assets including general valuation allowances) in 
computing the denominator of the risk-based capital standard. Thus, a 
savings association will exclude the same amount of excess GVA from both 
the numerator and the denominator of the risk-based capital ratio.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Total capital. (1) A savings association's total capital equals 
the sum of its core capital and supplementary capital (to the extent 
that such supplementary capital does not exceed 100% of its core 
capital).
    (2) The following assets, in addition to assets required to be 
deducted elsewhere in calculating core capital, are deducted from assets 
for purposes of determining total capital:
    (i) Reciprocal holdings of depository institution capital 
instruments;
    (ii) All equity investments; and
    (iii) That portion of land loans and nonresidential construction 
loans in excess of 80 percent loan-to-value ratio.
    (3) For the purposes of any risk-based capital requirement under 
this part, a savings association's total capital equals the amount 
calculated pursuant to paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, 
minus the amount of its IRR component as calculated pursuant to 
Sec. 567.7 of this part.

Sec. 567.6  Risk-based capital credit risk-weight categories.

    (a) Risk-weighted Assets. Risk-weighted assets equal assets plus 
consolidated off-balance sheet items where each asset or item is 
multiplied by the appropriate risk weight as set forth in this section. 
Before an off-balance sheet item can be assigned a risk weight, it must 
be converted to an on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount in 
accordance with this section. The risk weight assigned to a particular 
asset or on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount determines the 
percentage of that asset/credit equivalent amount that is included in 
the calculation of risk-weighted assets for purposes of

[[Page 341]]

this rule. Assets not included for purposes of calculating capital 
pursuant to Sec. 567.5 of this part are not included in calculating 
risk-weighted assets.
    (1) On-balance sheet assets. The risk categories/weights for on-
balance sheet assets are:
    (i) Zero percent Risk Weight (Category 1). (A) Cash, including 
domestic and foreign currency owned and held in all offices of a savings 
association or in transit. Any foreign currency held by a savings 
association must be converted into U.S. dollar equivalents;
    (B) Securities issued by and other direct claims on the U.S. 
Government or its agencies (to the extent such securities or claims are 
unconditionally backed by the full faith and credit of the United States 
Government) or the central government of an OECD country;

    (E) The book value of paid-in Federal Reserve Bank stock;
    (F) That portion of assets that is fully covered against capital 
loss and/or yield maintenance agreements by the Federal Savings and Loan 
Insurance Corporation or any successor agency.
    (G) That portion of assets directly and unconditionally guaranteed 
by the United States Government or its agencies, or the central 
government of an OECD country.
    (ii) 20 percent Risk Weight (Category 2). (A) Cash items in the 
process of collection;
    (B) That portion of assets collateralized by the current market 
value of securities issued or guaranteed by the United States government 
or its agencies, or the central government of an OECD country;
    (C) That portion of assets conditionally guaranteed by the United 
States Government or its agencies, or the central government of an OECD 
country;
    (D) Securities (not including equity securities) issued by and other 
claims on the U.S. Government or its agencies which are not backed by 
the full faith and credit of the United States Government;
    (E) Securities (not including equity securities) issued by, or other 
direct claims on, United States Government-sponsored agencies;
    (F) That portion of assets guaranteed by United States Government-
sponsored agencies;
    (G) That portion of assets collateralized by the current market 
value of securities issued or guaranteed by United States Government-
sponsored agencies;
    (H) High quality mortgage-related securities, except for 
collateralized mortgage obligation residual classes;
    (I) Claims representing general obligations of any public-sector 
entity in an OECD country, and that portion of any claims guaranteed by 
any such public-sector entity;
    (J) Bonds issued by the Financing Corporation or the Resolution 
Funding Corporation;
    (K) Balances due from and all claims on domestic depository 
institutions. This includes demand deposits and other transaction 
accounts, savings deposits and time certificates of deposit, federal 
funds sold, loans to other depository institutions, including overdrafts 
and term federal funds, holdings of the savings association's own 
discounted acceptances for which the account party is a depository 
institution, holdings of bankers acceptances of other institutions and 
securities issued by depository institutions, except those that qualify 
as capital;
    (L) The book value of paid-in Federal Home Loan Bank stock;
    (M) Deposit reserves at, claims on and balances due from the Federal 
Home Loan Banks;
    (N) Assets collateralized by cash held in a segregated deposit 
account by the reporting savings association;
    (O) Claims on, or guaranteed by, official multilateral lending 
institutions or regional development institutions in

[[Page 342]]

which the United States Government is a shareholder or contributing 
member;\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ These institutions include, but are not limited to, the 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank), the 
Inter-American Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the African 
Development Bank, the European Investments Bank, the International 
Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (P) That portion of assets collateralized by the current market 
value of securities issued by official multilateral lending institutions

    (Q) All claims on depository institutions incorporated in an OECD 
country, and all assets backed by the full faith and credit of 
depository institutions incorporated in an OECD country. This includes 
the credit equivalent amount of participations in commitments and 
standby letters of credit sold to other depository institutions 
incorporated in an OECD country, but only if the originating bank 
remains liable to the customer or beneficiary for the full amount of the 
commitment or standby letter of credit. Also included in this category 
are the credit equivalent amounts of risk participations in bankers' 
acceptances conveyed to other depository institutions incorporated in an 
OECD country. However, bank-issued securities that qualify as capital of 
the issuing bank are not included in this risk category;
    (R) Claims on, or guaranteed by depository institutions other than 
the central bank, incorporated in a non-OECD country, with a residual 
maturity of one year or less;
    (S) That portion of local currency claims conditionally guaranteed 
by central governments of non-OECD countries, to the extent the savings 
association has local currency liabilities in that country.
    (iii) 50 percent Risk Weight (Category 3). (A) Revenue bonds issued 
by any public-sector entity in an OECD country for which the underlying 
obligor is a public- sector entity, but which are repayable solely from 
the revenues generated from the project financed through the issuance of 
the obligations;
    (B) Qualifying mortgage loans and qualifying multifamily mortgage 
loans;
    (C) Non-high-quality mortgage-related securities secured by or 
representing an interest in qualifying mortgage loans and qualifying 
multifamily mortgage loans, except for collateralized mortgage 
obligation residual classes. If the security is backed by qualifying 
multifamily mortgage loans, the institution must receive timely payments 
of principal and interest in accordance with the terms of the security. 
Payments will generally be considered timely if they are not 30 days or 
more past due.
    (D) Qualifying residential construction loans as defined in 
Sec. 567.1 of this part.
    (iv) 100 percent Risk Weight (Category 4). All assets not specified 
above or deducted from calculations of capital pursuant to Sec. 567.5 of 
this part, including, but not limited to:
    (A) Consumer loans;
    (B) Commercial loans;
    (C) Home equity loans;
    (D) Non-qualifying mortgage loans;
    (E) Non-qualifying multifamily mortgage loans;
    (F) Residential construction loans;
    (G) Land loans, except that portion of such loans that are in excess 
of 80% loan-to-value ratio;
    (H) Nonresidential construction loans, except that portion of such 
loans that are in excess of 80% loan-to-value ratio;
    (I) Obligations issued by any state or any politica1 subdivision 
thereof for the benefit of a private party or enterprise where that 
party or enterprise, rather than the issuing state or political 
subdivision, is responsible for the timely payment of principal and 
interest on the obligations, e.g., industrial development bonds;
    (J) Private-issue debt securities except for those qualifying under 
paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section;
    (K) Investments in fixed assets and premises;
    (L) Mortgage servicing rights and intangible assets includable in 
core capital pursuant to Sec. 567.12 of this part;
    (M) Excess servicing receivables;

[[Page 343]]

    (N) Collateralized mortgage obligation residual classes of mortgage-
related securities, regardless of issue or guarantor;
    (O) [Reserved]
    (P) That portion of equity investments not deducted pursuant to 
Sec. 567.5 of this part;
    (Q) The prorated assets of subsidiaries (except for the assets of 
includable, fully consolidated subsidiaries) to the extent such assets 
are included in adjusted total assets;
    (R) All repossessed assets or assets that are more than 90 days past 
due; and
    (S) Equity investments that the Office determines have the same risk 
characteristics as foreclosed real estate by the savings association;
    (T) Equity investments permissible for a national bank.
    (v) [Reserved]
    (vi) Indirect ownership interests in pools of assets. (A) Except as 
provided in paragraph (a)(1)(vi)(C) of this section, assets representing 
an indirect holding of a pool of assets, e.g., mutual funds, are 
assigned to risk-weight categories under this section based upon the 
risk weight that would be assigned to the assets in the portfolio of the 
pool.
    (B) Where the portfolio of the investment company consists of assets 
that would fall into different risk-weight categories, or contains some 
assets that would be deducted in calculations of total capital, the 
entire ownership interest of the savings association will be assigned to 
the category of the asset with the highest risk weight in the portfolio 
or excluded from assets and thus deducted from calculations of total 
capital, as appropriate.
    (C)(1) On a case-by-case basis, the Office may allow the savings 
association to assign the portfolio proportionately to the various risk 
categories based on the proportion in which the risk categories are 
represented by the composition of assets in the portfolio. Before the 
Office will consider a request to proportionately risk-weight such a 
portfolio, the savings association must have and maintain current 
information for the reporting period that details the composition of the 
portfolio of assets.
    (2) The minimum risk weight that may be assigned to an ownership 
interest described in this paragraph (a)(1)(vi) is 20%.
    (2) Off-balance sheet activities. Risk weights for off-balance sheet 
items are determined by a two-step process. First, the face amount of 
the off-balance sheet item must be multiplied by the appropriate credit 
conversion factor listed in this section. This calculation translates 
the face amount of an off-balance sheet exposure into an on-balance 
sheet credit-equivalent amount. Second, the credit-equivalent amount 
must be assigned to the appropriate risk weight category depending on 
the obligor (i.e., the 20 percent risk weight category if the obligor is 
a domestic depository institution or the 100 percent risk category if 
the obligor is a private party) and any underlying collateral, provided 
that, the maximum risk weight assigned to the credit-equivalent amount 
of an interest-rate or exchange-rate contract is 50 percent. Guarantees 
and other direct credit substitutes by savings associations of the 
obligations of their service corporations and subsidiaries that qualify 
as equity investments are assigned a credit-equivalent amount of the 
entire value of the direct credit substitute. The following are the 
credit conversion factors and the off-balance sheet items to which they 
apply:
    (i) 100 percent credit conversion factor (Group A). (A) Direct 
credit substitutes, including financial guarantee-type standby letters 
of credit that support financial claims on the account party. The face 
amount of a direct credit substitute is netted against the amount of any 
participations sold in that item (except as otherwise provided below). 
The amount retained by the savings association is converted to an on-
balance sheet equivalent and assigned to the proper risk-weight category 
using the criteria regarding obligors, guarantors and collateral listed 
herein. Participations are treated as follows:
    (1) If the originating savings association remains liable to the 
beneficiary for the full amount of the standby letter of credit, in the 
event the participant fails to perform under its participation 
agreement, the amount of participations sold are converted to an on-

[[Page 344]]

balance sheet credit equivalent using a credit conversion factor of 
100%, with that amount then being assigned to the risk-weight category 
appropriate for the purchaser of the participation.
    (2) If participations are such that each participant is responsible 
only for its pro-rata share of the risk, and there is no recourse to the 
originating institution, the full amount of the participations sold is 
excluded from the originating institution's risk-weighted assets;
    (B) Risk participations purchased in bankers, acceptances and 
participations purchased in direct credit substitutes;
    (C) Assets sold under an agreement to repurchase and the value of 
assets sold with recourse, to the extent these assets are not included 
in the savings association's total assets, except where the amount of 
recourse liability retained by a savings association is less than the 
capital requirement for credit-risk exposure, in which case capita1 must 
be maintained equal to the amount of credit-risk exposure retained. This 
category includes loan strips sold without direct recourse where the 
maturity of the participation is shorter than the maturity of the 
underlying loan and the ownership of the subordinated portion of a loan 
participation or package of loans. This category includes loans serviced 
by associations where the association is subject to losses on the loans, 
commonly referred to as ``recourse servicing''. This category also 
includes transfers of small business loans or leases of personal 
property with recourse. Such transfers, however, may be subject to the 
alternative capital computation set forth in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section. (Where associations hold a mortgage-related security or a 
participation certificate (PC) in a mortgage loan swap with recourse, or 
a subordinated portion as an on-balance sheet asset, the security, PC, 
or subordinated portion should not be risk-weighted for purposes of the 
risk-based capital requirement except where the amount of capital 
otherwise required against the recourse liability under this paragraph 
would be less than the amount of capital that would otherwise be 
required against the security, PC, or subordinated portion. The savings 
association must hold in capital the greater amount of capital that 
would be required to be held against either the liability or the 
security, PC, or subordinated portion.);
    (D) Forward agreements and other contingent obligations with a 
certain draw down, e.g., legally binding agreements to purchase assets 
at a specified future date. On the date an institution enters into a 
forward agreement or similar obligation, it should convert the principal 
amount of the assets to be purchased at 100 percent as of that date and 
then assign this amount to the risk-weight category appropriate to the 
obligor or guarantor of the item, or the nature of the collateral;
    (E) Indemnification of customers whose securities the savings 
association has lent as agent. If the customer is not indemnified 
against loss by the savings association, the transaction is excluded 
from the risk-based capital calculation. When a savings association 
lends its own securities, the transaction is treated as a loan. When a 
savings association lends its own securities or is acting as agent, 
agrees to indemnify a customer, the transaction is assigned to the risk 
weight appropriate to the obligor or collateral that is delivered to the 
lending or indemnifying institution or to an independent custodian 
acting on their behalf.
    (ii) 50 percent credit conversion factor (Group B). (A) Transaction-
related contingencies, including, among other things, performance bonds 
and performance-based standby letters of credit related to a particular 
transaction. To the extent permitted by law or regulation, performance-
based standby letters of credit include such things as arrangements 
backing subcontractors' and suppliers' performance, labor and materials 
contracts, and construction bids;
    (B) Unused portions of commitments, including home equity lines of 
credit, with an original maturity exceeding one year except those listed 
in paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section; and
    (C) Revolving underwriting facilities, note issuance facilities, and 
similar arrangements pursuant to which the savings association's 
customer can issue short-term debt obligations in its own

[[Page 345]]

name, but for which the savings association has a legally binding 
commitment to either:
    (1) Purchase the obligations the customer is unable to sell by a 
stated date; or
    (2) Advance funds to its customer, if the obligations cannot be 
sold.
    (iii) 20 percent credit conversion factor (Group C). Trade-related 
contingencies, i.e., short-term, self-liquidating instruments used to 
finance the movement of goods and collateralized by the underlying 
shipment. A commercial letter of credit is an example of such an 
instrument.
    (iv) Zero percent credit conversion factor (Group D). (A) unused 
commitments with an original maturity of one year or less;
    (B) Unused commitments with an original maturity greater than one 
year, if they are unconditionally cancelable at any time at the option 
of the savings association and the savings association has the 
contractual right to make, and in fact does make, either:
    (1) A separate credit decision based upon the borrower's current 
financial condition before each drawing under the lending facility; or
    (2) An annual (or more frequent) credit review based upon the 
borrower's current financial condition to determine whether or not the 
lending facility should be continued; and
    (C) The unused portion of retail credit card lines or other related 
plans that are unconditionally cancelable by the savings association in 
accordance with applicable law.
    (v) Off-balance sheet contracts; interest-rate and foreign exchange 
rate contracts (Group E)--(A) Calculation of credit equivalent amounts. 
The credit equivalent amount of an off-balance sheet interest rate or 
foreign exchange rate contract that is not subject to a qualifying 
bilateral netting contract in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(v)(B) of 
this section is equal to the sum of the current credit exposure, i.e., 
the replacement cost of the contract, and the potential future credit 
exposure of the off-balance sheet rate contract. The calculation of 
credit equivalent amounts is measured in U.S. dollars, regardless of the 
currency or currencies specified in the off-balance sheet rate contract.
    (1) Current credit exposure. The current credit exposure of an off-
balance sheet rate contract is determined by the mark-to-market value of 
the contract. If the mark-to-market value is positive, then the current 
credit exposure equals that mark-to-market value. If the mark-to-market 
value is zero or negative, then the current exposure is zero. In 
determining its current credit exposure for multiple off-balance sheet 
rate contracts executed with a single counterparty, a savings 
association may net positive and negative mark-to-market values of off-
balance sheet rate contracts if subject to a bilateral netting contract 
as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(v)(B) of this section.
    (2) Potential future credit exposure. The potential future credit 
exposure of an off-balance sheet rate contract, including a contract 
with a negative mark-to-market value, is estimated by multiplying the 
notional principal \9\ by a credit conversion factor. Savings 
associations, subject to examiner review, should use the effective 
rather than the apparent or stated notional amount in this calculation. 
The conversion factors are: \10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ For purposes of calculating potential future credit exposure for 
foreign exchange contracts and other similar contracts, in which 
notional principal is equivalent to cash flows, total notional principal 
is defined as the net receipts to each party falling due on each value 
date in each currency.
    \10\ No potential future credit exposure is calculated for single 
currency interest rate swaps in which payments are made based upon two 
floating rate indices, so-called floating/floating or basis swaps; the 
credit equivalent amount is measured solely on the basis of the current 
credit exposure.

                                                                        
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               Foreign  
                                                  Interest     exchange

    (B) Off-balance sheet rate contracts subject to bilateral netting 
contracts. In determining its current credit exposure for multiple off-
balance sheet rate contracts executed with a single counterparty, a 
savings association

[[Page 346]]

may net off-balance sheet rate contracts subject to a bilateral netting 
contract by offsetting positive and negative mark-to-market values, 
provided that:
    (1) The bilateral netting contract is in writing;
    (2) The bilateral netting contract creates a single legal obligation 
for all individual off-balance sheet rate contracts covered by the 
bilateral netting contract. In effect, the bilateral netting contract 
provides that the savings association has a single claim or obligation 
either to receive or pay only the net amount of the sum of the positive 
and negative mark-to-market values on the individual off-balance sheet 
rate contracts covered by the bilateral netting contract. The single 
legal obligation for the net amount is operative in the event that a 
counterparty, or a counterparty to whom the bilateral netting contract 
has been validly assigned, fails to perform due to any of the following 
events: default, insolvency, bankruptcy, or other similar circumstances;
    (3) The savings association obtains a written and reasoned legal 
opinion(s) representing, with a high degree of certainty, that in the 
event of a legal challenge, including one resulting from default, 
insolvency, bankruptcy or similar circumstances, the relevant court and 
administrative authorities would find the savings association's exposure 
to be the net amount under:
    (i) The law of the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is 
chartered or the equivalent location in the case of noncorporate 
entities, and if a branch of the counterparty is involved, then also 
under the law of the jurisdiction in which the branch is located;
    (ii) The law that governs the individual off-balance sheet rate 
contracts covered by the bilateral netting contract; and
    (iii) The law that governs the bilateral netting contract;
    (4) The savings association establishes and maintains procedures to 
monitor possible changes in relevant law and to ensure that the 
bilateral netting contract continues to satisfy the requirements of this 
section; and
    (5) The savings association maintains in its files documentation 
adequate to support the netting of an off-balance sheet rate 
contract.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ By netting individual off-balance sheet rate contracts for the 
purpose of calculating its credit equivalent amount, a savings 
association represents that documentation adequate to support the 
netting of an off-balance sheet rate contract is in the savings 
association's files and available for inspection by the OTS. Upon 
determination by the OTS that a savings association's files are 
inadequate or that a bilateral netting contract may not be legally 
enforceable under any one of the bodies of law described in paragraphs 
(a)(2)(v)(B)(3) (i) through (iii) of this section, the underlying 
individual off-balance sheet rate contracts may not be netted for the 
purposes of this section.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (C) Walkaway clause. A bilateral netting contract that contains a 
walkaway clause is not eligible for netting for purposes of calculating 
the current credit exposure amount. The term ``walkaway clause'' means a 
provision in a bilateral netting contract that permits a nondefaulting 
counterparty to make a lower payment than it would make otherwise under 
the bilateral netting contract, or no payment at all, to a defaulter or 
the estate of a defaulter, even if the defaulter or the estate of the 
defaulter is a net creditor under the bilateral netting contract.
    (D) Risk weighting. Once the savings association determines the 
credit equivalent amount for an off-balance sheet rate contract, that 
amount is assigned to the risk-weight category appropriate to the 
counterparty, or, if relevant, to the nature of any collateral or 
guarantee. Collateral held against a netting contract is not recognized 
for capital purposes unless it is legally available for all contracts 
included in the netting contract. However, the maximum risk weight for 
the credit equivalent amount of such off-balance sheet rate contracts is 
50 percent.
    (E) Exceptions. The following off-balance sheet rate contracts are 
not subject to the above calculation, and therefore, are not part of the 
denominator of a savings association's risk-based capital ratio:
    (1) A foreign exchange rate contract with an original maturity of 14 
calendar days or less; and

[[Page 347]]

    (2) Any interest rate or foreign exchange rate contract that is 
traded on an exchange requiring the daily payment of any variations in 
the market value of the contract.
    (3) Alternative capital computation for small business obligations-- 
(i) Definitions. For the purposes of this paragraph (a)(3):
    (A) Qualified savings association means a savings association that:
    (1) Is well capitalized as defined in 12 CFR 565.4 without applying 
the capital treatment described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section; 
or
    (2) Is adequately capitalized as defined in 12 CFR 565.4 without 
applying the capital treatment described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this 
section and has received written permission from the OTS to apply that 
capital calculation.
    (B) Small business means a business that meets the criteria for a 
small business concern established by the Small Business Administration 
in 12 CFR 121 pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 632.
    (ii) Capital requirement. With respect to a transfer of a small 
business loan or lease of personal property with recourse that is a sale 
under generally accepted accounting principles, a qualified savings 
association may elect to include only the amount of its retained 
recourse in its risk-weighted assets for the purposes of paragraph 
(a)(2)(i)(C) of this section. To qualify for this election, the savings 
association must establish and maintain a reserve under generally 
accepted accounting principles sufficient to meet the reasonable 
estimated liability of the savings association under the recourse 
arrangement.
    (iii) Aggregate amount of recourse. The total outstanding amount of 
recourse retained by a qualified savings association with respect to 
transfers of small business loans and leases of personal property and 
included in the risk-weighted assets of the savings association as 
described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, may not exceed 15 
percent of the association's total capital computed under 
Sec. 567.5(c)(4).
    (iv) Savings association that ceases to be a qualified savings 
association or that exceeds aggregate limits. If a savings association 
ceases to be a qualified savings association or exceeds the aggregate 
limit described in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section, the savings 
association may continue to apply the capital treatment described in 
paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section to transfers of small business 
loans and leases of personal property that occurred when the association 
was a qualified savings association and did not exceed the limit.
    (v) Prompt corrective action not affected. (A) A savings association 
shall compute its capital without regard to this paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section for purposes of prompt corrective action (12 U.S.C. 1831o), 
unless the savings association is adequately or well capitalized without 
applying the capital treatment described in this paragraph (a)(3) and 
would be well capitalized after applying that capital treatment.
    (B) A savings association shall compute its capital without regard 
to this paragraph (a)(3) for the purposes of applying 12 U.S.C. 
1831o(g), regardless of the association's capital level.

Sec. 567.7  Interest-rate risk component.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a savings 
association's interest rate risk (IRR) is measured by the decline in the 
Net Portfolio Value (NPV) that would result from a 200 basis point 
increase or decrease in market interest rates (whichever results in the 
lower NPV) divided by the estimated economic value of assets, as 
calculated in accordance with the OTS Model and guidance issued by the 
OTS, which will be provided to savings associations and to others in 
accordance with paragraph (f) of this section. A savings association 
whose measured IRR exposure exceeds .02 (i.e., 2%) must deduct an IRR 
component in calculating its total capital for purposes of determining 
whether it meets its risk-based capital requirement under Sec. 567.2 of 
this part. The IRR component is an

[[Page 348]]

amount equal to one-half of the difference between its measured interest 
rate risk and .02, multiplied by the estimated economic value of its 
total assets. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the 
IRR component deduction becomes effective beginning on the last day of 
the third quarter following the reporting date of the Schedule CMR on 
which the IRR component was based. For the purpose of this section, the 
reporting date is the last business day of each quarter.
    (b) Unless they are exempt from this reporting requirement, all 
saving associations must file information pertaining to their interest 
rate risk exposure on a form or schedule designated by the Director. 
Savings associations with less than $300 million in assets and risk-
based capital ratios in excess of 12 percent are exempt from filing the 
Schedule CMR but will be required to provide selected information in the 
manner determined by the OTS. The Director of the OTS or his designee 
may, within his discretion, require any otherwise exempt savings 
association to file the Schedule CMR on a quarterly basis.
    (c) A savings association's interest rate risk exposure is measured 
by the decline in the NPV that would result from a 200 basis point 
increase or decrease in market interest rates, except when the 3-month 
Treasury bond equivalent yield falls below 400 basis points. In that 
case, the decrease will be equal to one-half of that Treasury rate.
    (d) If a savings association, demonstrates to the OTS that it has 
reduced its IRR, in dollar amount, by the end of the quarter following 
the reporting date of the Schedule CMR on which the savings 
association's IRR component was based, the IRR component shall be 
lowered to that amount.
    (e) Exception. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, upon 
the request by a savings association, the Director of the OTS, or his 
designee, may waive or defer, but not lower except as a result of an 
appeal, a savings association's IRR component. For example, the Director 
may determine that a waiver or deferral is warranted if the savings 
association has taken meaningful steps to reduce or control its interest 
rate risk exposure.
    (f) Manuals describing the OTS Model and guidance issued by the OTS 
will be provided to savings associations and will be available, upon 
request, to others at the address set forth in Sec. 516.1(a) of this 
chapter.

Sec. 567.8  Leverage ratio.

    Savings associations shall have and maintain core capital, as 
defined at 12 CFR 567.5(a), in an amount equal to at least 3.0% of 
adjusted total assets.


<R05>
Sec. 567.9  Tangible capital requirement.

    (a) Savings associations shall have and maintain tangible capital in 
an amount equal to at least 1.5% of adjusted total assets.
    (b) The following elements, less the amount of any deductions 
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, comprise a savings 
association's tangible capital:
    (1) Common stockholders' equity (including retained earnings);
    (2) Noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related earnings;
    (3) Nonwithdrawable accounts and pledged deposits that would qualify 
as core capital under Sec. 567.5 of this part; and
    (4) Minority interests in the equity accounts of fully consolidated 
subsidiaries.
    (c) Deductions from tangible capital. In calculating tangible 
capital, a savings association must deduct from assets, and, thus, from 
capital:
    (1) Intangible assets, as defined in Sec. 567.1 of this part, and 
mortgage servicing rights (purchased or originated) not includable in 
core and tangible capital pursuant to Sec. 567.12 of this part.
    (2) Investments, both equity and debt, in subsidiaries that are not 
includable subsidiaries (including those subsidiaries where the savings 
association has a minority ownership interest), except as provided in 
paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section.
    (3) If a savings association has any investments (both debt and 
equity) in one or more subsidiary(ies) engaged as of April 12, 1989 and 
continuing to be engaged in any activity that would not

[[Page 349]]

fall within the scope of activities in which includable subsidiaries may 
engage, it must deduct such investments from assets and, thus, tangible 
capital in accordance with this paragraph (c)(3). The savings 
association must first deduct from assets and, thus, capital the amount 
by which any investments in such a subsidiary(ies) exceed the amount of 
such investments held by the savings association as of April 12, 1989. 
Next, the savings association must deduct from assets and, thus, 
tangible capital the lesser of:
    (i) The savings association's investments in and extensions of 
credit to the subsidiary as of April 12, 1989; or
    (ii) The savings association's investments in and extensions of 
credit to the subsidiary on the date as of which the savings 
association's capital is being determined.
    (4) If a savings association holds a subsidiary (either directly or 
through a subsidiary) that is itself a domestic depository institution 
the Office may, in its sole discretion upon determining that the amount 
of tangible capital that would be required would be higher if the assets 
and liabilities of such subsidiary were consolidated with those of the 
parent savings association than the amount that would be required if the 
parent savings association's investment were deducted pursuant to 
paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section, consolidate the assets and 
liabilities of that subsidiary with those of the parent savings 
association in calculating the capital adequacy of the parent savings 
association, regardless of whether the subsidiary would otherwise be an 
includable subsidiary as defined in Sec. 567.1 of this part.

Sec. 567.10  Consequences of failure to meet capital requirements.

    (a) Capital plans. (1) [Reserved]
    (2) The Director shall require any savings association not in 
compliance with capital standards to submit a capital plan that:
    (i) Addresses the savings association's need for increased capital;
    (ii) Describes the manner in which the savings association will 
increase capital so as to achieve compliance with capital standards;
    (iii) Specifies types and levels of activities in which the savings 
association will engage;
    (iv) Requires any increase in assets to be accompanied by increase 
in tangible capital not less in percentage amount than the leverage 
limit then applicable;
    (v) Requires any increase in assets to be accompanied by an increase 
in capital not less in percentage amount than required under the risk-
based capital standard then applicable; and
    (vi) Is acceptable to the Director.
    (3) To be acceptable to the Director under this section, a plan 
must, in addition to satisfying all of the requirements set forth in 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(v) of this section, contain a 
certification that while the plan is under review by the Office, the 
savings association will not, without the prior written approval of the 
Regional Director:
    (i) Grow beyond net interest credited;
    (ii) Make any capital distributions; or
    (iii) Act inconsistently with any other limitations on activities 
established by statute, regulation or by the Office in supervisory 
guidance for savings associations not meeting capital standards.
    (4) If the plan submitted to the Director under paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section is not approved by the Office, the savings association 
shall immediately and without any further action, be subject to the 
following restrictions:
    (i) It may not increase its assets beyond the amount held on the day 
it receives written notice of the Director's disapproval of the plan; 
and
    (ii) It must comply with any other restrictions or limitations set 
forth in the written notice of the Director's disapproval of the plan.
    (b) On or after January 1, 1991, the Director shall:
    (1) Prohibit any asset growth by any savings association not in 
compliance with capital standards, except as provided in paragraph (d) 
of this section; and

[[Page 350]]

    (2) Require any savings association not in compliance with capital 
standards to comply with a capital directive issued by the Director 
which may include the restrictions contained in paragraph (e) of this 
section and any other restrictions the Director determines appropriate.
    (c) A savings association that wishes to obtain an exemption from 
the sanctions provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section must file a 
request for exemption with the Regional Director. Such request must 
include a capital plan that satisfies the requirements of paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section.
    (d) The Director may permit any savings association that is subject 
to paragraph (b) of this section to increase its assets in an amount not 
exceeding the amount of net interest credited to the savings 
association's deposit liabilities, if:
    (1) The savings association obtains the Director's prior approval;
    (2) Any increase in assets is accompanied by an increase in tangible 
capital in an amount not less than 3% of the increase in assets;
    (3) Any increase in assets is accompanied by an increase in capital 
not less in percentage amount than required under the risk-based capital 
standards then applicable;
    (4) Any increase in assets is invested in low-risk assets; and
    (5) The savings association's ratio of core capital to total assets 
is not less than the ratio existing on January 1, 1991.
    (e) If a savings association fails to meet any of the regulatory 
capital requirements set forth in Sec. 567.2 of this part, the Director 
may, through enforcement proceedings or otherwise, require such savings 
association to take one or more of the following corrective actions:
    (1) Increase the amount of its regulatory capital to a specified 
level or levels;
    (2) Convene a meeting or meetings with the Office's supervision 
staff for the purpose of accomplishing the objectives of this section;
    (3) Reduce the rate of earnings that may be paid on savings 
accounts;
    (4) Limit the receipt of deposits to those made to existing 
accounts;
    (5) Cease or limit the issuance of new accounts of any or all 
classes or categories, except in exchange for existing accounts;
    (6) Cease or limit lending or the making of a particular type or 
category of loan;
    (7) Cease or limit the purchase of loans or the making of specified 
other investments;
    (8) Limit operational expenditures to specified levels;
    (9) Increase liquid assets and maintain such increased liquidity at 
specified levels; or
    (10) Take such other action or actions as the Director may deem 
necessary or appropriate for the safety and soundness of the savings 
association, or depositors or investors in the savings association.
    (f) The Director shall treat as an unsafe and unsound practice any 
material failure by a savings association to comply with any plan, 
regulation, written agreement undertaken under this section or order or 
directive issued to comply with the requirements of this part.

<R05>
Sec. 567.11  Reservation of authority.

    (a) Transactions for purposes of evasion. The Director or the 
Regional Director for the region in which a savings association is 
located may disregard any transaction entered into primarily for the 
purpose of reducing the minimum required amount of regulatory capital or 
otherwise evading the requirements of this part.
    (b) Average versus period-end figures. The Office reserves the right 
to require a savings association to compute its capital ratios on the 
basis of average, rather than period-end, assets when the Office 
determines appropriate to carry out the purposes of this part.
    (c) Reservation of authority. Notwithstanding the definitions of 
core and supplementary capital in Sec. 567.5 of this part, OTS may find 
that a particular type of purchased intangible asset or capital 
instrument constitutes or may constitute core or supplementary capital, 
and may permit one or more savings associations to include all or a

[[Page 351]]

portion of such intangible asset or funds obtained through such capital 
instrument as core or supplementary capital, permanently or on a 
temporary basis, for the purposes of compliance with this part or for 
any other purposes. Similarly, the Office may find that a particular 
asset or core or supplementary capital component has characteristics or 
terms that diminish its contribution to a savings association's ability 
to absorb losses, and the Office may require the discounting or 
deduction of such asset or component from the computation of core, 
supplementary, or total capital.
[54 FR 49649, Nov. 30, 1989, as amended at 57 FR 33441, July 29, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 567.12  Qualifying intangible assets and mortgage servicing rights.

    (a) Scope. This section prescribes the maximum amount of qualifying 
intangible assets, as defined in Sec. 567.1 of this part, and mortgage 
servicing rights that savings associations may include in calculating 
tangible and core capital.
    (b) Definition. Qualifying intangible assets and mortgage servicing 
rights means purchased credit card relationships and mortgage servicing 
rights (both originated and purchased). Mortgage servicing rights (both 
originated and purchased) may be included (that is, not deducted) in 
computing core and tangible capital. Purchased credit card relationships 
may be included in computing core capital, but must be deducted in 
computing tangible capital. These qualifying intangible assets and 
mortgage servicing rights may be included in capital only in accordance 
with the limitations and restrictions set forth in this section. 
Intangible assets, as defined in Sec. 567.1 of this part, other than 
purchased credit card relationships and core deposit intangibles 
grandfathered by paragraph (g)(3) of this section, must be deducted in 
computing tangible and core capital.
    (c) Market valuations. The OTS reserves the authority to require any 
savings association to perform an independent market valuation of 
qualifying intangible assets and mortgage servicing rights on a case-by-
case basis or through the issuance of policy guidance. An independent 
market valuation, if required, shall be conducted in accordance with any 
policy guidance issued by the OTS. A required valuation shall include 
adjustments for any significant changes in original valuation 
assumptions, including changes in prepayment estimates or attrition 
rates. The valuation shall determine the current fair market value of 
the qualifying intangible assets and mortgage servicing rights by 
applying an appropriate market discount rate to the net cash flows 
expected to be generated from the qualifying intangible assets and 
mortgage servicing rights. This independent market valuation may be 
conducted by an independent valuation expert evaluating the 
reasonableness of the internal calculations and assumptions used by the 
association in conducting its internal analysis. The association shall 
calculate an estimated fair market value for the qualifying intangible 
assets and mortgage servicing rights at least quarterly regardless of 
whether an independent valuation expert is required to perform an 
independent market valuation.
    (d) Value limitation. For purposes of calculating core capital under 
this part (but not for financial statement purposes), qualifying 
intangible assets and mortgage servicing rights must be valued at the 
lesser of:
    (1) 90 percent of their fair market value determined in accordance 
with paragraph (c) of this section; or
    (2) 100 percent of their remaining unamortized book value determined 
in accordance with the instructions for the Thrift Financial Report.
    (e) Core capital limitation.--(1) Aggregate limit. The maximum 
aggregate amount of qualifying intangible assets and mortgage servicing 
rights that may be included in core capital shall be limited to the 
lesser of:
    (i) 50 percent of the amount of core capital computed before the 
deduction of any disallowed qualifying intangible assets or mortgage 
servicing rights; or
    (ii) The amount of qualifying intangible assets and mortgage 
servicing rights determined in accordance with paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (2) Reduction by deferred tax liability. Associations may elect to 
reduce the

[[Page 352]]

amount of their disallowed (i.e., not includable in capital) originated 
mortgage servicing rights exceeding the 50 percent aggregate limit by 
the amount of any associated deferred tax liability.
    (3) Sublimit for purchased credit card relationships. In addition to 
the aggregate limitation on qualifying intangible assets and mortgage 
servicing rights set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, a 
sublimit shall apply to purchased credit card relationships. The maximum 
allowable amount of purchased credit card relationships shall be limited 
to the lesser of:
    (i) 25 percent of the amount of core capital computed before the 
deduction of any disallowed qualifying intangible assets or mortgage 
servicing rights; or
    (ii) the amount of purchased credit card relationships determined in 
accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
    (f) Tangible capital limitation. The maximum amount of mortgage 
servicing rights that may be included in tangible capital shall be the 
same amount includable in core capital in accordance with the 
limitations set by paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (g) Grandfathering. (1) Notwithstanding the core capital and 
tangible capital limitations set forth in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this 
section, any otherwise disallowed purchased mortgage servicing rights 
that were acquired on or before February 9, 1990, and any otherwise 
disallowed purchased mortgage servicing rights for which a contract to 
purchase the servicing rights had been executed on or before February 9, 
1990, may be grandfathered and recognized for regulatory capital 
purposes under this part to the extent permitted by the OTS. 
Grandfathered purchased mortgage servicing rights must be treated in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and the 
requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. Grandfathered 
purchased mortgage servicing rights will count toward the core capital 
and tangible capital limitations described in paragraphs (e) and (f) of 
this section.
    (2)(i) On a case-by-case basis, the OTS may extend grandfathered 
treatment prospectively to all or part of the purchased mortgage 
servicing rights acquired by an association to replace its grandfathered 
purchased mortgage servicing rights if OTS determines that:
    (A) The association is reducing, at an acceptable rate, its level of 
purchased mortgage servicing rights to the levels permitted by this 
section; and
    (B) The granting of such grandfathered treatment is consistent with 
the safe and sound operation of the association.
    (ii) The OTS may terminate or limit such grandfathered treatment at 
any time if it determines that either of the conditions in paragraph 
(g)(2)(i) of this section is not being satisfied.
    (3) Core deposit intangibles resulting from transactions consummated 
or under firm contract on the effective date of this rule may be 
grandfathered and recognized for capital purposes under this part, to 
the extent permitted by OTS, provided that such core deposit intangibles 
are valued in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, 
supported by credible assumptions, and have their amortization adjusted 
at least annually to reflect decay rates (past and projected) in the 
acquired customer base.
    (h) Exemption for certain subsidiaries.--(1) Exemption standard. An 
association holding purchased mortgage servicing rights in separately 
capitalized, nonincludable subsidiaries may submit an application for 
approval by the OTS for an exemption from the deductions and limitations 
set forth in this section. The deductions and limitations will apply to 
such purchased mortgage servicing rights, however, if the OTS determines 
that:
    (i) The thrift and subsidiary are not conducting activities on an 
arm's length basis; or
    (ii) The exemption is not consistent with the association's safe and 
sound operation.
    (2) Applicable requirements. If the OTS determines to grant or to 
permit the continuation of an exemption under paragraph (h)(1) of this 
section, the association receiving the exemption must ensure the 
following:
    (i) The association's investments in, and extensions of credit to, 
the subsidiary are deducted from capital when calculating capital under 
this part;

[[Page 353]]

    (ii) Extensions of credit and other transactions with the subsidiary 
are conducted in compliance with the rules for covered transactions with 
affiliates set forth in sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, 
as applied to thrifts; and
    (iii) Any contracts entered into by the subsidiary include a written 
disclosure indicating that the subsidiary is not a bank or savings 
association; the subsidiary is an organization separate and apart from 
any bank or savings association; and the obligations of the subsidiary 
are not backed or guaranteed by any bank or savings association and are 
not insured by the FDIC.

Sec. 567.13  Obligations of acquirors of savings associations to maintain capital.

    (a) Definitions. As used in this section, the following definitions 
apply, unless the context otherwise requires:
    (1) Acquiror means a person or company that controls a savings 
association.
    (2) Control means control as determined under Sec. 574.4(a) or (b) 
of this chapter.
    (3) Capital means the measure of capital used in the applicable 
capital maintenance obligation.
    (4) Capital maintenance obligation means an obligation to maintain 
the capital of a savings association imposed by means of a resolution 
issued or condition imposed by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance 
Corporation (``FSLIC''), the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (``Board''), 
the Office, or any of their delegates, a stipulation to the FSLIC, the 
Board, the Office, or any of their delegates, or an agreement between 
the acquiror and the FSLIC, the Board, the Office, or any of their 
delegates.
    (5) Deficiency means the amount by which the level at which the 
acquiror is required to maintain the association's capital pursuant to a 
capital maintenance obligation exceeds the savings association's 
capital.
    (6) Divestiture or divest means any action or conduct that would 
result in the acquiror no longer being in control of the savings 
association.
    (7) Savings association means a Federal savings and loan association 
or a Federal savings bank chartered under section 5 of the Home Owners' 
Loan Act, a building and loan, savings and loan or homestead association 
or a cooperative bank (other than a cooperative bank described in 12 
U.S.C. 1813(a)(2)) the deposits of which are insured by the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation, and any corporation (other than a bank) 
the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation that the Office and the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation jointly determine to be operating in substantially the same 
manner as a savings association, and shall include any savings bank or 
cooperative bank which is deemed by the Office to be a savings 
association under 12 U.S.C. 1467a(1).
    (8) Savings and loan holding company means a savings and loan 
holding company as defined in Sec. 574.2(q) of this chapter.
    (b) Notice. Prior to divestiture of a savings association, an 
acquiror that is subject to a capital maintenance obligation shall 
provide written notice of such divestiture to the Office on Form DV, 
including the certifications required therein. If the acquiror is unable 
to provide such certifications, the acquiror may submit alternative 
certifications addressing the subjects of each certification, in a form 
acceptable to the Office.
    (c) Determination of deficiency. Upon receipt of the notice required 
under paragraph (b) of this section, the Office will conduct a full or 
limited scope examination of the savings association, as deemed 
appropriate, to ascertain whether a deficiency exists as of the date of 
the examination. If such examination is not completed within 90 days of 
the notice required under paragraph (b) of this section, or the Office 
has not communicated the results of the examination to the acquiror 
within such period, the deficiency, if any, shall be calculated based on 
the savings association's most recent Thrift Financial Report, filed 
prior to the notice of divestiture, provided, however, that if the 
failure to complete an examination within 90 days is caused by any 
failure of the association or the acquiror to

[[Page 354]]

cooperate, the 90 day period may be extended by the Director of the 
Office for additional periods, including such time as may be needed to 
base a deficiency on the results of a completed examination. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the Office 
determines that fraud or misrepresentation occurred during the course of 
an examination conducted to determine the association's capital, 
compliance with the procedures set forth in this section shall not be 
deemed to have extinguished an acquiror's capital maintenance obligation 
and the Office will seek appropriate enforcement remedies.
    (d) Divestiture. (1) In the event that the examination conducted 
under paragraph (c) of this section indicates that no deficiency exists, 
the acquiror may divest control of the savings association to which the 
capital maintenance obligation relates upon receiving written notice of 
the results of the examination. Where the examination was not completed 
or the results not communicated to the acquiror in a timely manner, and 
the savings association's most recent Thrift Financial Report filed 
before the filing of the notice of divestiture indicates no deficiency 
existed at that time, the acquiror may divest control of the savings 
association to which the capital maintenance obligation relates 91 days 
after the receipt of the notice by the Office, or such longer period as 
established under paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) In the event that a deficiency exists, the acquiror may not 
divest control of the savings association to which the capital 
maintenance obligation relates unless:
    (i) The acquiror provides the office with an agreement to infuse 
into the savings association the amount necessary to remedy the 
deficiency and make arrangements, satisfactory to the Office, to assure 
payment of the deficiency; or
    (ii) The deficiency is satisfied.
    (3) An acquiror may divest control of a savings association to which 
a capital maintenance obligation relates prior to the completion of the 
examination conducted under paragraph (c) of this section if the 
acquiror provides the Office with an agreement to infuse into the 
savings association the amount necessary to remedy the deficiency and 
makes arrangements, satisfactory to the Office, to assure payment of any 
deficiency.
    (e) Effect of regulation on terms of capital maintenance 
obligations. This regulation does not supercede any liability imposed by 
a capital maintenance obligation.
    (f) Exceptions. The Director of the Office may, upon application or 
upon his or her own initiative, grant or deny exemptions from this 
section.

    (3) Tamper-resistent locks on exterior doors and exterior windows 
that may be opened;
    (4) An alarm system or other appropriate device for promptly 
notifying the nearest responsible law enforcement officers of an

    (i) The incidence of crimes against financial institutions in the 
area;
    (ii) The amount of currency and other valuables exposed to robbery, 
burglary, or larceny;
    (iii) The distance of the office from the nearest responsible law 
enforcement officers;

    (vi) The physical characteristics of the structure of the office and 
its surroundings.


<R05>
Sec. 568.4  Report.

    The security officer for each savings association shall report at 
least annually to the association's board of directors on the

    Authority:  12 U.S.C. 1831p-1.

    Source:  60 FR 35686, July 10, 1995, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 570.1  Authority, purpose, scope and preservation of existing authority.

    (a) Authority. This part and the Guidelines in Appendix A to this 
part are issued by the OTS pursuant to section 39 (section 39) of the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) (12

[[Page 357]]

U.S.C. 1831p-1) as added by section 132 of the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) (Pub. L. 102-242, 105 Stat. 
2236 (1991)), and as amended by section 956 of the Housing and Community 
Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-550, 106 Stat. 3895 (1992)), and as 
amended by section 318 of the Community Development Banking Act of 1994 
(Pub. L. 103-325, 108 Stat. 2160 (1994)).
    (b) Purpose. Section 39 of the FDI Act requires the OTS to establish 
safety and soundness standards. Pursuant to section 39, a savings 
association may be required to submit a compliance plan if it is not in 
compliance with a safety and soundness standard established by guideline 
under section 39 (a) or (b). An enforceable order under section 8 of the 
FDI Act may be issued if, after being notified that it is in violation 
of a safety and soundness standard prescribed under section 39, the 
savings association fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or 
fails in any material respect to implement an accepted plan. This part 
establishes procedures for submission and review of safety and soundness 
compliance plans and for issuance and review of orders pursuant to 
section 39. Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and 
Soundness pursuant to section 39 of the FDI Act are set forth in 
Appendix A to this part.
    (c) Scope. This part and the Interagency Guidelines Establishing 
Standards for Safety and Soundness in Appendix A to this part implement 
the provisions of section 39 of the FDI Act as they apply to savings 
associations.
    (d) Preservation of existing authority. Neither section 39 of the 
FDI Act nor this part in any way limits the authority of the OTS under 
any other provision of law to take supervisory actions to address unsafe 
or unsound practices, violations of law, unsafe or unsound conditions, 
or other practices. Action under section 39 and this part may be taken 
independently of, in conjunction with, or in addition to any other 
enforcement action available to the OTS.


<R05>
Sec. 570.2  Determination and notification of failure to meet safety and soundness standards and request for compliance plan.

    (a) Determination of failure to meet safety and soundness standard. 
The OTS may, based upon an examination, inspection, or any other 
information that becomes available to the OTS, determine that a savings 
association has failed to satisfy the safety and soundness standards 
contained in the Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for 
Safety and Soundness as set forth in Appendix A to this part.
    (b) Request for compliance plan. If the OTS determines that a 
savings association has failed to meet a safety and soundness standard 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the OTS may request by letter 
or through a report of examination, the submission of a compliance plan. 
The savings association shall be deemed to have notice of the request 
three days after mailing or delivery of the letter or report of 
examination by the OTS.


<R05>
Sec. 570.3  Filing of safety and soundness compliance plan.

    (a) Schedule for filing compliance plan--(1) In general. A savings 
association shall file a written safety and soundness compliance plan 
with the OTS within 30 days of receiving a request for a compliance plan 
pursuant to Sec. 570.2(b), unless the OTS notifies the savings 
association in writing that the plan is to be filed within a different 
period.
    (2) Other plans. If a savings association is obligated to file, or 
is currently operating under, a capital restoration plan submitted 
pursuant to section 38 of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1831o), a cease-and-
desist order entered into pursuant to section 8 of the FDI Act, a formal 
or informal agreement, or a response to a report of examination, it may, 
with the permission of the OTS, submit a compliance plan under this 
section as part of that plan, order, agreement, or response, subject to 
the deadline provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (b) Contents of plan. The compliance plan shall include a 
description of the

[[Page 358]]

steps the savings association will take to correct the deficiency and 
the time within which those steps will be taken.
    (c) Review of safety and soundness compliance plans. Within 30 days 
after receiving a safety and soundness compliance plan under this 
subpart, the OTS shall provide written notice to the savings association 
of whether the plan has been approved or seek additional information 
from the savings association regarding the plan. The OTS may extend the 
time within which notice regarding approval of a plan will be provided.
    (d) Failure to submit or implement a compliance plan. If a savings 
association fails to submit an acceptable plan within the time specified 
by the OTS or fails in any material respect to implement a compliance 
plan, then the OTS shall, by order, require the savings association to 
correct the deficiency and may take further actions provided in section 
39(e)(2)(B) of the FDI Act. Pursuant to section 39(e)(3), the OTS may be 
required to take certain actions if the savings association commenced 
operations or experienced a change in control within the previous 24-
month period, or the savings association experienced extraordinary 
growth during the previous 18-month period.
    (e) Amendment of compliance plan. A savings association that has 
filed an approved compliance plan may, after prior written notice to and 
approval by the OTS, amend the plan to reflect a change in circumstance. 
Until such time as a proposed amendment has been approved, the savings 
association shall implement the compliance plan as previously approved.


<R05>
Sec. 570.4  Issuance of orders to correct deficiencies and to take or refrain from taking other actions.

    (a) Notice of intent to issue order--(1) In general. The OTS shall 
provide a savings association prior written notice of the OTS's 
intention to issue an order requiring the savings association to correct 
a safety and soundness deficiency or to take or refrain from taking 
other actions pursuant to section 39 of the FDI Act. The savings 
association shall have such time to respond to a proposed order as 
provided by the OTS under paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) Immediate issuance of final order. If the OTS finds it necessary 
in order to carry out the purposes of section 39 of the FDI Act, the OTS 
may, without providing the notice prescribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, issue an order requiring a savings association immediately to 
take actions to correct a safety and soundness deficiency or to take or 
refrain from taking other actions pursuant to section 39. A savings 
association that is subject to such an immediately effective order may 
submit a written appeal of the order to the OTS. Such an appeal must be 
received by the OTS within 14 calendar days of the issuance of the 
order, unless the OTS permits a longer period. The OTS shall consider 
any such appeal, if filed in a timely manner, within 60 days of 
receiving the appeal. During such period of review, the order shall 
remain in effect unless the OTS, in its sole discretion, stays the 
effectiveness of the order.
    (b) Contents of notice. A notice of intent to issue an order shall 
include:
    (1) A statement of the safety and soundness deficiency or 
deficiencies that have been identified at the savings association;
    (2) A description of any restrictions, prohibitions, or affirmative 
actions that the OTS proposes to impose or require;
    (3) The proposed date when such restrictions or prohibitions would 
be effective or the proposed date for completion of any required action; 
and
    (4) The date by which the savings association subject to the order 
may file with the OTS a written response to the notice.
    (c) Response to notice--(1) Time for response. A savings association 
may file a written response to a notice of intent to issue an order 
within the time period set by the OTS. Such a response must be received 
by the OTS within 14 calendar days from the date of the notice unless 
the OTS determines that a different period is appropriate in light of 
the safety and soundness of the savings association or other relevant 
circumstances.
    (2) Contents of response. The response should include:

[[Page 359]]

    (i) An explanation why the action proposed by the OTS is not an 
appropriate exercise of discretion under section 39 of the FDI Act;
    (ii) Any recommended modification of the proposed order; and
    (iii) Any other relevant information, mitigating circumstances, 
documentation, or other evidence in support of the position of the 
savings association regarding the proposed order.
    (d) OTS consideration of response. After considering the response, 
the OTS may:
    (1) Issue the order as proposed or in modified form;
    (2) Determine not to issue the order and so notify the savings 
association; or
    (3) Seek additional information or clarification of the response 
from the savings association, or any other relevant source.
    (e) Failure to file response. Failure by a savings association to 
file with the OTS, within the specified time period, a written response 
to a proposed order shall constitute a waiver of the opportunity to 
respond and shall constitute consent to the issuance of the order.
    (f) Request for modification or rescission of order. Any savings 
association that is subject to an order under this subpart may, upon a 
change in circumstances, request in writing that the OTS reconsider the 
terms of the order, and may propose that the order be rescinded or 
modified. Unless otherwise ordered by the OTS, the order shall continue 
in place while such request is pending before the OTS.


<R05>
Sec. 570.5  Enforcement of orders.

    (a) Judicial remedies. Whenever a savings association fails to 
comply with an order issued under section 39 of the FDI Act, the OTS may 
seek enforcement of the order in the appropriate United States district 
court pursuant to section 8(i)(1) of the FDI Act.
    (b) Administrative remedies. Pursuant to section 8(i)(2)(A) of the 
FDI Act, the OTS may assess a civil money penalty against any savings 
association that violates or otherwise fails to comply with any final 
order issued under section 39 and against any savings association-
affiliated party who participates in such violation or noncompliance.
    (c) Other enforcement action. In addition to the actions described 
in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the OTS may seek enforcement 
of the provisions of section 39 of the FDI Act or this part through any 
other judicial or administrative proceeding authorized by law.

                             I. Introduction

    i. Section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act <SUP>1</SUP> (FDI 
Act) requires each Federal banking agency (collectively, the agencies) 
to establish certain safety and soundness standards by regulation or by 
guideline for all insured depository institutions. Under section 39, the 
agencies must establish three types of standards: (1) Operational and 
managerial standards; (2) compensation standards; and (3) such standards 
relating to asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation as they 
determine to be appropriate.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 
1831p-1) was added by section 132 of the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), Pub. L. 102-242, 105 Stat. 
2236 (1991), and amended by section 956 of the Housing and Community 
Development Act of 1992, Pub. L. 102-550, 106 Stat. 3895 (1992) and 
section 318 of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory 
Improvement Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-325, 108 Stat. 2160 (1994).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 360]]

    ii. Section 39(a) requires the agencies to establish operational and 
managerial standards relating to: (1) Internal controls, information 
systems and internal audit systems, in accordance with section 36 of the 
FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1831m); (2) loan documentation; (3) credit 
underwriting; (4) interest rate exposure; (5) asset growth; and (6) 
compensation, fees, and benefits, in accordance with subsection (c) of 
section 39. Section 39(b) requires the agencies to establish standards 
relating to asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation that the 
agencies determine to be appropriate.
    iii. Section 39(c) requires the agencies to establish standards 
prohibiting as an unsafe and unsound practice any compensatory 
arrangement that would provide any executive officer, employee, 
director, or principal shareholder of the institution with excessive 
compensation, fees or benefits and any compensatory arrangement that 
could lead to material financial loss to an institution. Section 39(c) 
also requires that the agencies establish standards that specify when 
compensation is excessive.
    iv. If an agency determines that an institution fails to meet any 
standard established by guideline under subsection (a) or (b) of section 
39, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an 
acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. In the event 
that an institution fails to submit an acceptable plan within the time 
allowed by the agency or fails in any material respect to implement an 
accepted plan, the agency must, by order, require the institution to 
correct the deficiency. The agency may, and in some cases must, take 
other supervisory actions until the deficiency has been corrected.
    v. The agencies have adopted amendments to their rules and 
regulations to establish deadlines for submission and review of 
compliance plans.<SUP>2</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ For the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, these 
regulations appear at 12 CFR Part 30; for the Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System, these regulations appear at 12 CFR Part 263; for 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, these regulations appear at 
12 CFR Part 308, subpart R, and for the Office of Thrift Supervision, 
these regulations appear at 12 CFR Part 570.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    vi. The following Guidelines set out the safety and soundness 
standards that the agencies use to identify and address problems at 
insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. The 
agencies believe that the standards adopted in these Guidelines serve 
this end without dictating how institutions must be managed and 
operated. These standards are designed to identify potential safety and 
soundness concerns and ensure that action is taken to address those 
concerns before they pose a risk to the deposit insurance funds.

                  A. Preservation of Existing Authority

    Neither section 39 nor these Guidelines in any way limits the 
authority of the agencies to address unsafe or unsound practices, 
violations of law, unsafe or unsound conditions, or other practices. 
Action under section 39 and these Guidelines may be taken independently 
of, in conjunction with, or in addition to any other enforcement action 
available to the agencies. Nothing in these Guidelines limits the 
authority of the FDIC pursuant to section 38(i)(2)(F) of the FDI Act (12 
U.S.C. 1831(o)) and Part 325 of Title 12 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations.

                             B. Definitions

    1. In general. For purposes of these Guidelines, except as modified 
in the Guidelines or unless the context otherwise requires, the terms 
used have the same meanings as set forth in sections 3 and 39 of the FDI 
Act (12 U.S.C. 1813 and 1831p-1).
    2. Board of directors, in the case of a state-licensed insured 
branch of a foreign bank and in the case of a federal branch of a 
foreign bank, means the managing official in charge of the insured 
foreign branch.
    3. Compensation means all direct and indirect payments or benefits, 
both cash and non-cash, granted to or for the benefit of any executive 
officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder, including but not 
limited to payments or benefits derived from an employment contract, 
compensation or benefit agreement, fee arrangement, perquisite, stock 
option plan, postemployment benefit, or other compensatory arrangement.
    4. Director shall have the meaning described in 12 CFR 
215.2(c).<SUP>3</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ In applying these definitions for savings associations, pursuant 
to 12 U.S.C. 1464, savings associations shall use the terms ``savings 
association'' and ``insured savings association'' in place of the terms 
``member bank'' and ``insured bank''.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    5. Executive officer shall have the meaning described in 12 CFR 
215.2(d).<SUP>4</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ See footnote 3 in section I.B.4. of this appendix.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    6. Principal shareholder shall have the meaning described in 12 CFR 
215.2(l).<SUP>5</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See footnote 3 in section I.B.4. of this appendix.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                II. Operational and Managerial Standards

    A. Internal controls and information systems. An institution should 
have internal controls and information systems that are appropriate to 
the size of the institution and the nature, scope and risk of its 
activities and that provide for:

[[Page 361]]

    1. An organizational structure that establishes clear lines of 
authority and responsibility for monitoring adherence to established 
policies;
    2. Effective risk assessment;
    3. Timely and accurate financial, operational and regulatory 
reports;
    4. Adequate procedures to safeguard and manage assets; and
    5. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
    B. Internal audit system. An institution should have an internal 
audit system that is appropriate to the size of the institution and the 
nature and scope of its activities and that provides for:
    1. Adequate monitoring of the system of internal controls through an 
internal audit function. For an institution whose size, complexity or 
scope of operations does not warrant a full scale internal audit 
function, a system of independent reviews of key internal controls may 
be used;
    2. Independence and objectivity;
    3. Qualified persons;
    4. Adequate testing and review of information systems;
    5. Adequate documentation of tests and findings and any corrective 
actions;
    6. Verification and review of management actions to address material 
weaknesses; and
    7. Review by the institution's audit committee or board of directors 
of the effectiveness of the internal audit systems.
    C. Loan documentation. An institution should establish and maintain 
loan documentation practices that:
    1. Enable the institution to make an informed lending decision and 
to assess risk, as necessary, on an ongoing basis;
    2. Identify the purpose of a loan and the source of repayment, and 
assess the ability of the borrower to repay the indebtedness in a timely 
manner;
    3. Ensure that any claim against a borrower is legally enforceable;
    4. Demonstrate appropriate administration and monitoring of a loan; 
and
    5. Take account of the size and complexity of a loan.
    D. Credit underwriting. An institution should establish and maintain 
prudent credit underwriting practices that:
    1. Are commensurate with the types of loans the institution will 
make and consider the terms and conditions under which they will be 
made;
    2. Consider the nature of the markets in which loans will be made;
    3. Provide for consideration, prior to credit commitment, of the 
borrower's overall financial condition and resources, the financial 
responsibility of any guarantor, the nature and value of any underlying 
collateral, and the borrower's character and willingness to repay as 
agreed;
    4. Establish a system of independent, ongoing credit review and 
appropriate communication to management and to the board of directors;
    5. Take adequate account of concentration of credit risk; and
    6. Are appropriate to the size of the institution and the nature and 
scope of its activities.
    E. Interest rate exposure. An institution should:
    1. Manage interest rate risk in a manner that is appropriate to the 
size of the institution and the complexity of its assets and 
liabilities; and
    2. Provide for periodic reporting to management and the board of 
directors regarding interest rate risk with adequate information for 
management and the board of directors to assess the level of risk.
    F. Asset growth. An institution's asset growth should be prudent and 
consider:
    1. The source, volatility and use of the funds that support asset 
growth;
    2. Any increase in credit risk or interest rate risk as a result of 
growth; and
    3. The effect of growth on the institution's capital.
    G. Asset quality. An insured depository institution should establish 
and maintain a system that is commensurate with the institution's size 
and the nature and scope of its operations to identify problem assets 
and prevent deterioration in those assets. The institution should:
    1. Conduct periodic asset quality reviews to identify problem 
assets;
    2. Estimate the inherent losses in those assets and establish 
reserves that are sufficient to absorb estimated losses;
    3. Compare problem asset totals to capital;
    4. Take appropriate corrective action to resolve problem assets;
    5. Consider the size and potential risks of material asset 
concentrations; and
    6. Provide periodic asset reports with adequate information for 
management and the board of directors to assess the level of asset risk.
    H. Earnings. An insured depository institution should establish and 
maintain a system that is commensurate with the institution's size and 
the nature and scope of its operations to evaluate and monitor earnings 
and ensure that earnings are sufficient to maintain adequate capital and 
reserves. The institution should:
    1. Compare recent earnings trends relative to equity, assets, or 
other commonly used benchmarks to the institution's historical results 
and those of its peers;
    2. Evaluate the adequacy of earnings given the size, complexity, and 
risk profile of the institution's assets and operations;
    3. Assess the source, volatility, and sustainability of earnings, 
including the effect

[[Page 362]]

of nonrecurring or extraordinary income or expense;
    4. Take steps to ensure that earnings are sufficient to maintain 
adequate capital and reserves after considering the institution's asset 
quality and growth rate; and
    5. Provide periodic earnings reports with adequate information for 
management and the board of directors to assess earnings performance.
    I. Compensation, fees and benefits. An institution should maintain 
safeguards to prevent the payment of compensation, fees, and benefits 
that are excessive or that could lead to material financial loss to the 
institution.

III. Prohibition on Compensation That Constitutes an Unsafe and Unsound 
                                Practice

                        A. Excessive Compensation

    Excessive compensation is prohibited as an unsafe and unsound 
practice. Compensation shall be considered excessive when amounts paid 
are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an 
executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder, 
considering the following:
    1. The combined value of all cash and non-cash benefits provided to 
the individual;
    2. The compensation history of the individual and other individuals 
with comparable expertise at the institution;
    3. The financial condition of the institution;
    4. Comparable compensation practices at comparable institutions, 
based upon such factors as asset size, geographic location, and the 
complexity of the loan portfolio or other assets;
    5. For postemployment benefits, the projected total cost and benefit 
to the institution;
    6. Any connection between the individual and any fraudulent act or 
omission, breach of trust or fiduciary duty, or insider abuse with 
regard to the institution; and
    7. Any other factors the agencies determines to be relevant.

           B. Compensation Leading to Material Financial Loss

    Compensation that could lead to material financial loss to an 
institution is prohibited as an unsafe and unsound practice.

<R05>
Sec. 571.24  Guidelines relating to nondiscrimination in lending.

    (a) General. Fair housing and equal opportunity in home financing is 
a policy of the United States established by Federal statutes and 
Presidential orders and proclamations. In furtherance of the Federal 
civil rights laws and the economical home financing purposes of the 
statutes administered by the Office, the Office has adopted, in part 528 
of this chapter, nondiscrimination regulations that, among other things, 
prohibit arbitrary refusals to consider loan applications on the basis 
of the age or location of a dwelling, and prohibit discrimination based 
on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status (having one or 
more children under the age of 18), marital status, age (provided the 
person has the capacity to contract), or national origin in fixing the 
amount, interest rate, duration, application procedures, collection or 
enforcement procedures, or other terms or conditions of housing related 
loans. Such discrimination is also prohibited in the purchase of loans 
and securities. This section provides supplementary guidelines to aid 
savings associations in developing and implementing nondiscriminatory 
lending policies. Each savings association should reexamine its 
underwriting standards at least annually in order to ensure equal 
opportunity.
    (b) Loan underwriting standards. The basic purpose of the Office's 
nondiscrimination regulations is to require that every applicant be 
given an equal

[[Page 363]]

opportunity to obtain a loan. Each loan applicant's creditworthiness 
should be evaluated on an individual basis without reference to presumed 
characteristics of a group. The use of lending standards which have no 
economic basis and which are discriminatory in effect is a violation of 
law even in the absence of an actual intent to discriminate. However, a 
standard which has a discriminatory effect is not necessarily improper 
if its use achieves a genuine business need which cannot be achieved by 
means which are not discriminatory in effect or less discriminatory in 
effect.
    (c) Discriminatory practices--(1) Discrimination on the basis of sex 
or marital status. The Civil Rights Act of 1968 and the National Housing 
Act prohibit discrimination in lending on the basis of sex. The Equal 
Credit Opportunity Act, in addition to this prohibition, forbids 
discrimination on the basis of marital status. Refusing to lend to, 
requiring higher standards of creditworthiness of, or imposing different 
requirements on, members of one sex or individuals of one marital 
status, is discrimination based on sex or marital status. Loan 
underwriting decisions must be based on an applicant's credit history 
and present and reasonably foreseeable economic prospects, rather than 
on the basis of assumptions regarding comparative differences in 
creditworthiness between married and unmarried individuals, or between 
men and women.
    (2) Discrimination on the basis of language. Requiring fluency in 
the English language as a prerequisite for obtaining a loan may be a 
discriminatory practice based on national origin.
    (3) Income of husbands and wives. A practice of discounting all or 
part of either spouse's income where spouses apply jointly is a 
violation of section 527 of the National Housing Act. As with other 
income, when spouses apply jointly for a loan, the determination as to 
whether a spouse's income qualifies for credit purposes should depend 
upon a reasonable evaluation of his or her past, present, and reasonably 
foreseeable economic circumstances. Information relating to child-
bearing intentions of a couple or an individual may not be requested.
    (4) Supplementary income. Lending standards which consider as 
effective only the non-overtime income of the primary wage-earner may 
result in discrimination because they do not take account of variations 
in employment patterns among individuals and families. The Office favors 
loan underwriting which reasonably evaluates the credit worthiness of 
each applicant based on a realistic appraisal of his or her own past, 
present, and foreseeable economic circumstances. The determination as to 
whether primary income or additional income qualifies as effective for 
credit purposes should depend upon whether such income may reasonably be 
expected to continue through the early period of the mortgage risk. 
Automatically discounting other income from bonuses, overtime, or part-
time employment, will cause some applicants to be denied financing 
without a realistic analysis of their credit worthiness. Since 
statistics show that minority group members and low- and moderate-income 
families rely more often on such supplemental income, the practice may 
be racially discriminatory in effect, as well as artificially 
restrictive of opportunities for home financing.
    (5) Applicant's prior history. Loan decisions should be based upon a 
realistic evaluation of all pertinent factors respecting an individual's 
creditworthiness, without giving undue weight to any one factor. The 
savings association should, among other things, take into consideration 
that:
    (i) In some instances, past credit difficulties may have resulted 
from discriminatory practices;
    (ii) A policy favoring applicants who previously owned homes may 
perpetuate prior discrimination;
    (iii) A current, stable earnings record may be the most reliable 
indicator of credit-worthiness, and entitled to more weight than factors 
such as educational level attained;
    (iv) Job or residential changes may indicate upward mobility; and
    (v) Preferring applicants who have done business with the lender can 
perpetuate previous discriminatory policies.
    (6) Income level or racial composition of area. Refusing to lend or 
lending on

[[Page 364]]

less favorable terms in particular areas because of their racial 
composition is unlawful. Refusing to lend, or offering less favorable 
terms (such as interest rate, downpayment, or maturity) to applicants 
because of the income level in an area can discriminate against minority 
group persons.
    (7) Age and location factors. Sections 528.2, 528.2a, and 528.3 of 
this chapter prohibit loan denials based upon the age or location of a 
dwelling. These restrictions are intended to prohibit use of unfounded 
or unsubstantiated assumptions regarding the effect upon loan risk of 
the age of a dwelling or the physical or economic characteristics of an 
area. Loan decisions should be based on the present market value of the 
property offered as security (including consideration of specific 
improvements to be made by the borrower) and the likelihood that the 
property will retain an adequate value over the term of the loan. 
Specific factors which may negatively affect its short-range future 
value (up to 3-5 years) should be clearly documented. Factors which in 
some cases may cause the market value of a property to decline are 
recent zoning changes or a significant number of abandoned homes in the 
immediate vicinity of the property. However, not all zoning changes will 
cause a decline in property values, and proximity to abandoned buildings 
may not affect the market value of a property because of rehabilitation 
programs or affirmative lending programs, or because the cause of 
abandonment is unrelated to high risk. Proper underwriting 
considerations include the condition and utility of the improvements, 
and various physical factors such as street conditions, amenities such 
as parks and recreation areas, availability of public utilities and 
municipal services, and exposure to flooding and land faults. However, 
arbitrary decisions based on age or location are prohibited, since many 
older, soundly constructed homes provide housing opportunities which may 
be precluded by an arbitrary lending policy.
    (8) Fair Housing Act (title VIII, Civil Rights Act of 1968, as 
amended). Savings associations, must comply with all regulations 
promulgated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to 
implement the Fair Housing Act, found at 24 CFR part 100 et seq., except 
that they shall use the Equal Housing Lender logo and poster prescribed 
by Office regulations at 12 CFR 528.4 and 528.5 rather than the Equal 
Housing Opportunity logo and poster required by 24 CFR parts 109 and 
110.
    (d) Marketing practices. Savings associations should review their 
advertising and marketing practices to ensure that their services are 
available without discrimination to the community they serve. 
Discrimination in lending is not limited to loan decisions and 
underwriting standards; a savings association does not meet its 
obligations to the community or implement its equal lending 
responsibility if its marketing practices and business relationships 
with developers and real estate brokers improperly restrict its 
clientele to segments of the community. A review of marketing practices 
could begin with an examination of an association's loan portfolio and 
applications to ascertain whether, in view of the demographic 
characteristics and credit demands of the community in which the 
institution is located, it is adequately serving the community on a 
nondiscriminatory basis. The Office will systematically review marketing 
practices where evidence of discrimination in lending is discovered.

    (a) In general. A savings association shall not make, increase, 
extend, or renew any designated loan unless the building or mobile home 
and any personal property securing the loan is covered by flood 
insurance for the term of the loan. The amount of insurance must be at 
least equal to the lesser of the outstanding principal balance of the 
designated loan or the maximum limit of coverage available for the

<R05>
Sec. 572.5  Escrow requirement.

    If a savings association requires the escrow of taxes, insurance 
premiums, fees, or any other charges for a loan secured by residential 
improved real estate or a mobile home that is made, increased, extended, 
or renewed on or after October 1, 1996, the savings association shall 
also require the escrow of all premiums and fees for any flood insurance 
required under Sec. 572.3. The savings association, or a servicer acting 
on behalf of the savings association, shall deposit the flood insurance 
premiums on behalf of the borrower in an escrow account. This escrow 
account will be subject to escrow requirements adopted pursuant to 
section 10 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (12 
U.S.C. 2609) (RESPA), which generally limits the amount that may be 
maintained in escrow accounts for certain types of loans and requires 
escrow account statements for those accounts, only if the loan is 
otherwise subject to RESPA. Following receipt of a notice from the 
Director of FEMA or other provider of flood insurance that premiums are 
due, the savings association, or a servicer acting on behalf of the 
savings association, shall pay the amount owed to the insurance provider 
from the escrow account by the date when such premiums are due.


<R05>
Sec. 572.6  Required use of standard flood hazard determination form.

    (a) Use of form. A savings association shall use the standard flood 
hazard determination form developed by the Director of FEMA (as set 
forth in Appendix A of 44 CFR part 65) when determining whether the 
building or mobile home offered as collateral security for a loan is or 
will be located in a special flood hazard area in which flood insurance 
is available under the Act. The standard flood hazard determination form 
may be used in a printed, computerized, or electronic manner.
    (b) Retention of form. A savings association shall retain a copy of 
the completed standard flood hazard determination form, in either hard 
copy or electronic form, for the period of time the savings association 
owns the loan.


<R05>
Sec. 572.7  Forced placement of flood insurance.

    If a savings association, or a servicer acting on behalf of the 
savings association, determines at any time during the term of a 
designated loan that the building or mobile home and any personal 
property securing the designated loan is not covered by flood insurance 
or is covered by flood insurance in an amount less than the amount 
required under Sec. 572.3, then the savings association or its servicer 
shall notify the borrower that the borrower should obtain flood 
insurance, at the borrower's expense, in an amount at least equal to the 
amount required under Sec. 572.3, for the remaining term of the loan. If 
the borrower fails to obtain flood insurance within 45 days after 
notification, then the savings association or its servicer shall 
purchase insurance on the borrower's behalf. The savings association or 
its servicer may charge the borrower for the cost of premiums and fees 
incurred in purchasing the insurance.


<R05>
Sec. 572.8  Determination fees.

    (a) General. Notwithstanding any Federal or State law other than the 
Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4001-4129), 
any savings association, or a servicer acting on behalf of the savings 
association, may charge a reasonable fee for determining whether the 
building or

[[Page 367]]

mobile home securing the loan is located or will be located in a special 
flood hazard area. A determination fee may also include, but is not 
limited to, a fee for life-of-loan monitoring.
    (b) Borrower fee. The determination fee authorized by paragraph (a) 
of this section may be charged to the borrower if the determination:
    (1) Is made in connection with a making, increasing, extending, or 
renewing of the loan that is initiated by the borrower;
    (2) Reflects the Director of FEMA's revision or updating of 
floodplain areas or flood-risk zones;
    (3) Reflects the Director of FEMA's publication of a notice or 
compendium that:
    (i) Affects the area in which the building or mobile home securing 
the loan is located; or
    (ii) By determination of the Director of FEMA, may reasonably 
require a determination whether the building or mobile home securing the 
loan is located in a special flood hazard area; or
    (4) Results in the purchase of flood insurance coverage by the 
lender or its servicer on behalf of the borrower under Sec. 572.7.
    (c) Purchaser or transferee fee. The determination fee authorized by 
paragraph (a) of this section may be charged to the purchaser or 
transferee of a loan in the case of the sale or transfer of the loan.


<R05>
Sec. 572.9  Notice of special flood hazards and availability of Federal disaster relief assistance.

    (a) Notice requirement. When a savings association makes, increases, 
extends, or renews a loan secured by a building or a mobile home located 
or to be located in a special flood hazard area, the savings association 
shall mail or deliver a written notice to the borrower and to the 
servicer in all cases whether or not flood insurance is available under 
the Act for the collateral securing the loan.
    (b) Contents of notice. The written notice must include the 
following information:
    (1) A warning, in a form approved by the Director of FEMA, that the 
building or the mobile home is or will be located in a special flood 
hazard area;
    (2) A description of the flood insurance purchase requirements set 
forth in section 102(b) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as 
amended (42 U.S.C. 4012a(b));
    (3) A statement, where applicable, that flood insurance coverage is 
available under the NFIP and may also be available from private 
insurers; and
    (4) A statement whether Federal disaster relief assistance may be 
available in the event of damage to the building or mobile home caused 
by flooding in a Federally-declared disaster.
    (c) Timing of notice. The savings association shall provide the 
notice required by paragraph (a) of this section to the borrower within 
a reasonable time before the completion of the transaction, and to the 
servicer as promptly as practicable after the savings association 
provides notice to the borrower and in any event no later than the 
savings association provides other similar notices to the servicer 
concerning hazard insurance and taxes. Notice to the servicer may be 
made electronically or may take the form of a copy of the notice to the 
borrower.
    (d) Record of receipt. The savings association shall retain a record 
of the receipt of the notices by the borrower and the servicer for the 
period of time the savings association owns the loan.
    (e) Alternate method of notice. Instead of providing the notice to 
the borrower required by paragraph (a) of this section, a savings 
association may obtain satisfactory written assurance from a seller or 
lessor that, within a reasonable time before the completion of the sale 
or lease transaction, the seller or lessor has provided such notice to 
the purchaser or lessee. The savings association shall retain a record 
of the written assurance from the seller or lessor for the period of 
time the savings association owns the loan.
    (f) Use of prescribed form of notice. A savings association will be 
considered to be in compliance with the requirement for notice to the 
borrower of this section by providing written notice to the borrower 
containing the language presented in appendix A to this part within a 
reasonable time before the completion of the transaction. The notice 
presented in appendix A to this

[[Page 368]]

part satisfies the borrower notice requirements of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 572.10  Notice of servicer's identity.

    (a) Notice requirement. When a savings association makes, increases, 
extends, renews, sells, or transfers a loan secured by a building or 
mobile home located or to be located in a special flood hazard area, the 
savings association shall notify the Director of FEMA (or the Director's 
designee) in writing of the identity of the servicer of the loan. The 
Director of FEMA has designated the insurance provider to receive the 
savings association's notice of the servicer's identity. This notice may 
be provided electronically if electronic transmission is satisfactory to 
the Director of FEMA's designee.
    (b) Transfer of servicing rights. The savings association shall 
notify the Director of FEMA (or the Director's designee) of any change 
in the servicer of a loan described in paragraph (a) of this section 
within 60 days after the effective date of the change. This notice may 
be provided electronically if electronic transmission is satisfactory to 
the Director of FEMA's designee. Upon any change in the servicing of a 
loan described in paragraph (a) of this section, the duty to provide 
notice under this paragraph (b) shall transfer to the transferee 
servicer.

    We are giving you this notice to inform you that:
    The building or mobile home securing the loan for which you have 
applied is or will be located in an area with special flood hazards.
    The area has been identified by the Director of the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as a special flood hazard area using 
FEMA's Flood Insurance Rate Map or the Flood Hazard Boundary Map for the 
following community: ________________. This area has at least a one 
percent (1%) chance of a flood equal to or exceeding the base flood 
elevation (a 100-year flood) in any given year. During the life of a 30-
year mortgage loan the risk of a 100-year flood in a special flood 
hazard area is 26 percent (26%).
    Federal law allows a lender and borrower jointly to request the 
Director of FEMA to review the determination of whether the property 
securing the loan is located in a special flood hazard area. If you 
would like to make such a request, please contact us for further 
information.
    ______ The community in which the property securing the loan is 
located participates in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). 
Federal law will not allow us to make you the loan that you have applied 
for if you do not purchase flood insurance. The flood insurance must be 
maintained for the life of the loan. If you fail to purchase or renew 
flood insurance on the property, Federal law authorizes and requires us 
to purchase the flood insurance for you at your expense.
    <bullet> Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP may be purchased 
through an insurance agent who will obtain the policy either directly 
through the NFIP or through an insurance company that participates in 
the NFIP. Flood insurance also may be available from private insurers 
that do not participate in the NFIP.
    <bullet> At a minimum, flood insurance purchased must cover the 
lesser of:
    (1) the outstanding principal balance of the loan; or
    (2) the maximum amount of coverage allowed for the type of property 
under the NFIP.
    Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP is limited to the overall 
value of the property securing the loan minus the value of the land on 
which the property is located.
    <bullet> Federal disaster relief assistance (usually in the form of 
a low-interest loan) may be available for damages incurred in excess of 
your flood insurance if your community's participation in the NFIP is in 
accordance with NFIP requirements.
    ______ Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP is not available for 
the property securing the loan because the community in which the 
property is located does not participate in the NFIP. In addition, if 
the non-participating community has been identified for at least one 
year as containing a special flood hazard area, properties located in 
the community will not be eligible for Federal disaster relief 
assistance in the event of a Federally-declared flood disaster.

preponderant economic risk in the underlying voting stock. Securities 
immediately convertible into voting stock at the option of the holder 
without payment of additional consideration shall be deemed to 
constitute the voting stock into which they are convertible; other 
convertible securities and rights to acquire voting stock shall not be 
deemed to vest the holder with the preponderant economic risk in the 
underlying voting stock if the holder has paid less than 50 percent of 
the consideration required to directly acquire the voting stock and has 
no other economic interest in the underlying voting stock. For purposes 
of calculating the percentage of voting stock held by a particular 
acquiror, stock or other securities convertible into voting stock or 
exercisable to acquire voting stock which are deemed voting stock under 
this paragraph (u)(3) shall be included in calculating the amount of

1985, shall not be subject to this Sec. 574.3 unless the acquiror 
acquires additional stock of the savings association or obtains a

Provided, That an acquiror shall not be deemed to have acquired control 
of a savings association on the basis of actions taken prior to December

specifically request.
    (2) The exemptions provided by paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through

    (i) The acquiror shall file an application, notice or rebuttal, as 
appropriate, with the Office within 90 days of acquisition of control;

[[Page 374]]

by management of the savings association until the Office has acted 
favorably upon the acquiror's application or notice, and the Office may 
require that the acquiror take such steps as the Office deems necessary 
to insure that control is not exercised; and
    (iii) If the Office disapproves the acquiror's application or 
notice, the acquiror shall divest such portion of the stock held by the 
acquiror so as to cause the acquiror not to be determined to be in 
control of the savings association under Sec. 574.4 of this part, within 
one year or such shorter period of time and in the manner that the 
Office may order.
    (e) Prohibited acquisitions. No acquisition shall be approved by the 
Office pursuant to Sec. 574.3(a) which would result in the formation by 
any company, through one or more subsidiaries or through one or more 
transactions, of a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling 
savings associations in more than one state where the acquisition causes 
a savings association to become an affiliate of another savings 
association with which it was not previously affiliated unless:
    (1) Such company, or a savings association subsidiary of such 
company, is authorized to acquire control of a savings association 
subsidiary, or to operate a home or branch office, in the additional 
state or states pursuant to section 13(k) of the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1823(k) (or section 408(m) of the National 
Housing Act as in effect immediately prior to enactment of the Financial 
Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989);
    (2) Such company controls a savings association subsidiary which 
operated a home or branch office in the additional state or states as of 
March 5, 1987; or
    (3) The statute laws of the state in which the savings association, 
control of which is to be acquired, is located are such that a savings 
association chartered by such state could be acquired by a savings 
association chartered by the state where the acquiring savings 
association or savings and loan holding company is located (or by a 
holding company that controls such a state chartered savings 
association), and such statute laws specifically authorize such an 
acquisition by language to that effect and not merely by implication.

acquired control of a savings association, if the acquiror directly or 
indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries or transactions or 
acting in concert with one or more persons or companies, holds any 
combination of voting stock and revocable and/or irrevocable proxies, 
representing more than 25 percent of any class of voting stock of a 
savings association, excluding such proxies held in connection with a 
solicitation by, or in opposition to, a solicitation on behalf of 
management of the savings association, but including a solicitation in 
connection with an election of directors, and such proxies would enable 
the acquiror to:
    (i) Elect one-third or more of the savings association's board of 
directors, including nominees or representatives of the acquiror 
currently serving on such board;
    (ii) Cause the savings association's stockholders to approve the 
acquisition or corporate reorganization of the savings association; or
    (iii) Exert a continuing influence on a material aspect of the 
business operations of the savings association.
    (c) Control factors. For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, the following constitute control factors. References to the 
acquiror include actions taken directly or indirectly, or through one or 
more subsidiaries or transactions or acting in concert with one or more 
persons or companies:
    (1) The acquiror would be one of the two largest holders of any 
class of voting stock of the savings association.
    (2) The acquiror would hold more than 25 percent of the total 
stockholders' equity of the savings association.
    (3) The acquiror would hold more than 35 percent of the combined 
debt securities and stockholders' equity of the savings association.
    (4) The acquiror is party to any agreement:
    (i) Pursuant to which the acquiror possesses a material economic 
stake in the savings association resulting from a profit-sharing 
arrangement, use of common names, facilities or personnel, or the 
provision of essential services to the savings association; or
    (ii) That enables the acquiror to influence a material aspect of the 
management or policies of the savings association, other than agreements 
to which the savings association is a party where the restrictions are 
customary under the circumstances and in the case of an acquisition 
agreement, which apply only during the period when the acquiror is 
seeking the Office's approval to acquire the savings association, the 
agreement prohibits transactions between the acquiror and the savings 
association and their respective affiliates without approval by the 
Regional Director during the pendency of the application process, and 
the agreement contains no material forfeiture provisions applicable to 
the savings association in the event the acquisition is not approved or 
not approved by a specified date.
    (5) The acquiror would have the ability, other than through the 
holding of revocable proxies, to direct the votes of more than 25 
percent of a class of the savings association's voting stock or to

[[Page 376]]

vote more than 25 percent of a class of the savings association's voting 
stock in the future upon the occurrence of a future event.
    (6) The acquiror would have the power to direct the disposition of 
more than 25 percent of a class of the savings association's voting 
stock in a manner other than a widely dispersed or public offering.
    (7) The acquiror and/or the acquiror's representatives or nominees 
would constitute more than one member of the savings association's board 
of directors.
    (8) The acquiror or a nominee or management official of the acquiror 
would serve as the chairman of the board of directors, chairman of the 
executive committee, chief executive officer, chief operating officer, 
chief financial officer or in any position with similar policymaking 
authority in the savings association.
    (d) Rebuttable presumptions of concerted action. An acquiror will be 
presumed to be acting in concert with the following persons and 
companies:
    (1) A company will be presumed to be acting in concert with a 
controlling shareholder, partner, trustee or management official of such 
company with respect to the acquisition of stock of a savings 
association, if
    (i) Both the company and the person own stock in the savings 
association,
    (ii) The company provides credit to the person to purchase the 
savings association's stock, or
    (iii) The company pledges its assets or otherwise is instrumental in 
obtaining financing for the person to acquire stock of the savings 
association;
    (2) A person will be presumed to be acting in concert with members 
of the person's immediate family;
    (3) Persons will be presumed to be acting in concert with each other 
where
    (i) Both own stock in a savings association and both are also 
management officials, controlling shareholders, partners, or trustees of 
another company, or
    (ii) One person provides credit to another person or is instrumental 
in obtaining financing for another person to purchase stock of the 
savings association;
    (4) A company controlling or controlled by another company and 
companies under common control will be presumed to be acting in concert;
    (5) Persons or companies will be presumed to be acting in concert 
where they constitute a group under the beneficial ownership reporting 
rules under section 13 or the proxy rules under section 14 of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, promulgated by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission.
    (6) A person or company will be presumed to be acting in concert 
with any trust for which such person or company serves as trustee, 
except that a tax-qualified employee stock benefit plan as defined in 
Sec. 563b.2(a)(39) shall not be presumed to be acting in concert with 
its trustee or person acting in a similar fiduciary capacity solely for 
the purposes of determining whether to combine the holdings of a plan 
and its trustee or fiduciary.
    (7) Persons or companies will be presumed to be acting in concert 
with each other and with any other person or company with which they 
also are presumed to act in concert.
    (e) Procedures for rebuttal--(1) Rebuttal of control determination. 
An acquiror attempting to rebut a determination of control that would 
arise under paragraph (b) of this section shall file a submission with 
the Office setting forth the facts and circumstances which support the 
acquiror's contention that no control relationship would exist if the 
acquiror acquires stock or obtains a control factor with respect to a 
savings association. The rebuttal must be filed and accepted in 
accordance with this section before the acquiror acquires such stock or 
control factor.
    (i) An acquiror seeking to rebut the determination of control 
arising under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall submit to the 
Office an executed agreement materially conforming to the agreement set 
forth at Sec. 574.100 of this part. Unless agreed to by the Office in 
writing, no other agreement or filing shall be deemed to rebut the 
determination of control arising under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. 
If accepted by the Office, the acquiror shall furnish a copy of the 
executed agreement to

[[Page 377]]

the association to which the rebuttal pertains.
    (ii) An acquiror seeking to rebut the determination of control with 
respect to holding of proxies arising under paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section shall be subject to the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section, except that in the case of a rebuttal of the presumption of 
control arising under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Office may 
require the acquiror to furnish information in response to a specific 
request for information and depending upon the particular facts and 
circumstances, to provide an executed rebuttal agreement materially 
conforming to the agreement set forth at Sec. 574.100 of this part, with 
any modifications deemed necessary by the Office.
    (2) Presumptions of concerted action. An acquiror attempting to 
rebut the presumption of concerted action arising under paragraph (d) of 
this section shall file a submission with the Office setting forth facts 
and circumstances which clearly and convincingly demonstrate the 
acquiror's contention that no action in concert exists. Such a statement 
must be accompanied by an affidavit, in form and content satisfactory to 
the Office, executed by each person or company presumed to be acting in 
concert, stating that such person or company does not and shall not, 
without having made necessary filings and obtained approval or clearance 
thereof under the Holding Company Act or the Control Act, as applicable, 
have any agreements or understandings, written or tacit, with respect to 
the exercise of control, directly or indirectly, over the management or 
policies of the savings association, including agreements relating to 
voting, acquisition or disposition of the savings association's stock. 
The affidavit shall also recite that the signatory is aware that the 
filing of a false affidavit may subject the person or company to 
criminal sanctions, would constitute a violation of the Office's 
regulations at 12 CFR 563.180(b), and would be considered a 
``presumptive disqualifier'' under 12 CFR 574.7(g)(1)(v).
    (3) Determination. A rebuttal filed pursuant to paragraph (e) of 
this section shall not be deemed sufficient unless it includes all the 
information, agreements, and affidavits required by the Office and this 
part, as well as any additional relevant information as the Office may 
require by written request to the acquiror. Within 20 calendar days 
after proper filing of a rebuttal submission, the Office will provide 
written notification of its determination to accept or reject the 
submission; request additional information in connection with the 
submission; or return the submission to the acquiror as materially 
deficient. Within 15 calendar days after proper filing of any additional 
information furnished in response to a specific request by the Office, 
the Office shall notify the acquiror in writing as to whether the 
rebuttal is thereby deemed to be sufficient. If the Office fails to 
notify an acquiror within such time, the rebuttal shall be deemed to be 
accepted. The Office may reject any rebuttal which is inconsistent with 
facts and circumstances known to it or where the rebuttal does not 
clearly and convincingly refute the rebuttable determination of control 
or presumption of action in concert, and may determine to reject a 
submission solely on such bases.
    (f) Safe harbor. Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
section, where an acquiror has no intention to participate in or to seek 
to exercise control over a savings association's management or policies, 
the acquiror may seek to qualify for a safe harbor with respect to its 
ownership of stock of a savings association.
    (1) In order to qualify for the safe harbor, an acquiror must submit 
a certification to the OTS that shall be signed by the acquiror or an 
authorized representative thereof and shall read as follows:

    The undersigned makes this submission pursuant to Sec. 574.4(f) of 
the regulations of the Office of Thrift Supervision (``Office'') with 
respect to [name of savings association] and hereby certifies to the 
Office the following:
    The undersigned is not in control of [name of savings association] 
under Sec. 574.4(a);
    The undersigned is not subject to any control factor as enumerated 
in Sec. 574.4(c) with respect to the [name of savings association];
    The undersigned will not solicit proxies relating to the voting 
stock of [name of savings association];

[[Page 378]]

    Before any change in status occurs that would bring the undersigned 
within the scope of Sec. 574.4 (a) or (b), the undersigned will file and 
obtain approval of a rebuttal, notice or application, as appropriate.
    The undersigned has not acquired stock of [name of savings 
association] for the purpose or effect of changing or influencing the 
control of [name of savings association] or in connection with or as a 
participant in any transaction having such purpose or effect.

    (2) An acquiror claiming safe-harbor status may vote freely and 
dissent with respect to its own stock. Certifications provided for in 
this paragraph shall be submitted to the Office in accordance with 
Sec. 516.1(c) of this chapter.

Sec. 574.5  Certifications of ownership.

    (a) Acquisition of stock. (1) Upon the acquisition of beneficial 
ownership that exceeds, in the aggregate, 10 percent of any class of 
stock of a savings association or additional stock above 10 percent of 
the stock of a savings association occurring after December 26, 1985, an 
acquiror shall file with the OTS a certification as described in this 
section.
    (2) The certification filed pursuant to this section shall be signed 
by the acquiror or an authorized representative thereof and shall read 
as follows:

    The undersigned is the beneficial owner of 10 percent or more of a 
class of stock of [name of savings association or holding company]. The 
undersigned is not in control of such association or company, as defined 
in 12 CFR 574.4(a), and is not subject to a rebuttable determination of 
control under Sec. 574.4(b), and will take no action that would result 
in a determination of control or a rebuttable determination of control 
without first filing and obtaining approval of an application under the 
Savings and Loan Holding Company Act, 12 U.S.C. 1467a, or notice under 
the Change in Bank Control Act, 12 U.S.C. 1817(j), or filing and 
obtaining acceptance by the Office of Thrift Supervision of a rebuttal 
of the rebuttable determination of control.

    (3) Notwithstanding anything contained in this paragraph (a), an 
acquiror is not required to file a certification if (i) the Office has 
approved the acquisition of the savings association or (ii) the acquiror 
has filed a materially complete application or notice pursuant to 
Sec. 574.3 of this part.
    (b) Privacy. All certifications filed under this Sec. 574.5 shall be 
for the information of the Office in connection with its examination 
functions and shall be provided confidential treatment by the Office.

    (ii) The OTS may determine as a general matter or on a case-by-case 
basis not to require application information not relevant to 
transactions described in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) (C) and (D) of this

Sec. 574.3(c)(1)(ii) of this part.
    (6) Notice Form 1393, parts A and B. This form shall be used for all 
notices filed under Sec. 574.3(b) of this part regarding the acquisition

    (2) H-(e)4 Information filing. Any information filing required to be

    (c) Sufficiency and waiver. (1) Except as provided in 
Sec. 574.6(c)(5), an application or notice filed pursuant to Sec. 574.3 
(a) or (b) shall not be deemed sufficient unless it includes all of the 
information required by the form prescribed by the Office and this part, 
including a complete description of the acquiror's proposed plan for 
acquisition of control whether pursuant to one or more transactions, and 
any additional relevant information as the Office may require by written 
request to the applicant. Unless an application or notice specifically 
indicates otherwise, the application or notice shall be considered to 
pertain to acquisition of 100 percent of a savings association's voting 
stock. Where an application or notice pertains to a lesser amount of 
stock, the Office may condition its approval or non-disapproval to apply 
only to such amount, in which case additional acquisitions may be made 
only by amendment to the acquiror's application or notice and the 
Office's approval or non-disapproval thereof. Failure by an applicant to 
respond completely to a written request by the Office for additional 
information within 30 calendar days of the date of such request may be 
deemed to constitute withdrawal of the application, notice, or rebuttal 
filing or may be treated as grounds for denial of an application, 
issuance of a notice of disapproval of a notice, or rejection of a 
rebuttal.
    (2) The period for the Office's review of any proposed acquisition 
will commence upon receipt by the Office of a notice or application 
deemed sufficient under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The Office 
shall notify an acquiror in

[[Page 380]]

writing within 30 calendar days after proper filing of an application or 
notice as to whether an application or notice--
    (i) Is sufficient;
    (ii) Is insufficient, and what additional information is requested 
in order to render the application or notice sufficient; or
    (iii) Is materially deficient and will not be processed: Provided, 
That if the public comment period specified in paragraph (e) of this 
section is extended, the 30 day period shall be extended for the same 
number of days the public comment period is extended. The Office also 
shall notify an acquiror in writing within 15 calendar days after proper 
filing of any additional information furnished in response to a specific 
request by the Office as to whether the application or notice is thereby 
deemed to be sufficient. If the Office fails to so notify an acquiror 
within such times, the application or notice shall be deemed to be 
sufficient as of the expiration of the applicable period.
    (3) After additional information has been requested and supplied, 
the Office may request additional information only with respect to 
matters derived from or prompted by information already furnished, or 
information of a material nature that was not reasonably available from 
the acquiror, was concealed, or pertains to developments subsequent to 
the time of the Office's initial request for additional information. 
With regard to information of a material nature that was not reasonably 
available from the acquiror or was concealed at the time an application 
or notice was deemed to be sufficient or which pertains to developments 
subsequent to the time an application or notice was deemed to be 
sufficient, the Office, at its option, may request such additional 
information as it considers necessary, or may deem the application or 
notice not to be sufficient until such additional information is 
furnished and cause the review period to commence again in its entirety 
upon receipt of such additional information.
    (i) The 60-day period for the Office's review of an application or 
notice deemed to be sufficient also may be extended by the Office for up 
to an additional 30 days.
    (ii) The period for the Office's review of a notice may be further 
extended not to exceed two additional times for not more than 45 days 
each time if--
    (A) The Office determines that any acquiring party has not furnished 
all the information required under this part;
    (B) In the Office's judgment, any material information submitted is 
substantially inaccurate;
    (C) The Office has been unable to complete an investigation of each 
acquiror because of any delay caused by, or the inadequate cooperation 
of, such acquiror; or
    (D) The Office determines that additional time is needed to 
investigate and determine that no acquiring party has a record of 
failing to comply with the requirements of subchapter II of chapter 53 
of title 31 of the United States Code.
    (4) With respect to an H-(e)4 information filing, the Chief Counsel 
or his or her designee shall have 30 days after receipt of a filing 
deemed sufficient to disapprove the assertion that the company qualifies 
for the exemption provided in Sec. 574.3(c)(1)(ii). After the expiration 
of such 30-day period without response from the Chief Counsel, the 
filing shall be deemed to be approved.
    (5) The Office may waive any requirements of this paragraph (c) 
determined to be unnecessary by the Office, upon its own initiative, 
upon the written request of an acquiring person, or in a supervisory 
case.
    (d) Publication. (1) An acquiror shall publish a notification as 
provided in this section no earlier than three calendar days before and 
no later than three calendar days after filing an application under 
Sec. 574.3(a) or 574.8 or notice under Sec. 574.3(b) and shall mail a 
copy of the notification to the association whose stock is sought to be 
acquired. Publication shall be made in the business section of a 
newspaper printed in the English language in:
    (i) The community in which the home office of the savings 
association is located; and
    (ii) If applicable, the community in which the home office of the 
largest subsidiary savings association of the acquiror is located.

[[Page 381]]


If it is determined that the primary language of a significant number of 
adult residents of either community is a language other than English, 
the acquiror may be required to publish the notification simultaneously 
in the appropriate language(s).
    (2) Notice published pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section shall 
be published in a manner that is conspicuous to the average reader and 
shall be made in substantially the following form:

 Notice of Filing of Application or Notice for Acquisition of a Savings 
                               Association

    This is to inform the public that under Sec. 574.3 of the 
Regulations of the Office of Thrift Supervision (``OTS'') for

control of/purchase a qualified stock issuance of] savings association, 
located in [location], on [date, or intended date of filing].
    Anyone may write in favor of or protest against the [application/
notice] and in so doing may submit such information as he or she deems 
relevant. Three copies of all submissions must be sent to OTS [give 
Region name and address] within 20 calendar days of the filing of the 
[application/notice]. Up to an additional 20 calendar days to submit 
comments may be obtained upon a showing of good cause, if a written 
request is received by the OTS within the initial 20-day period.
    You may inspect the non-confidential portion of the [application/
notice] and non-confidential portions of all comments filed with the OTS 
by contacting [give name and address.] If you have any questions 
concerning these procedures, contact the OTS Regional Office at (____) 
________.

    (3) Promptly after publication, the acquiror shall transmit copies 
of each notice, and a publisher's affidavit of publication in the same 
manner as the original filing in accordance with Sec. 574.6(b)(1).
    (4) Notice shall be provided to the appropriate state supervisor and 
to persons whose request for announcements under Sec. 563e.6 of this 
chapter have been received in time for such notification; these notices 
shall be in addition to legal notification as set forth in paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section. Any other persons who might have an interest in 
the application or notice may also be notified.
    (5) Disclosure of any part of an application or notice shall be made 
only in compliance with paragraph (f) of this section.
    (e) Public comment. Comments by the public shall be submitted only 
as provided in this paragraph (e) or as requested by the Office. Within 
20 calendar days of the date of filing (or up to 40 calendar days after 
such date if an extension is requested in writing within the initial 20-
day period) anyone may file comments in favor of or in protest of the 
application or notice and in so doing may submit such information as he 
or she deems relevant. Comments received after the comment period, 
unverified accusations, or materials pertaining to an application, 
notice, other filing or public comment which the commenter is unwilling 
to have disclosed to the party making such submission, shall not be part 
of the record and need not be considered by the Office. Comments shall 
be filed in the manner and in the locations provided in paragraph (b) of 
this section for the application or notice to which the comments 
pertain.
    (f) Disclosure. (1) Any application, notice, other filings, public 
comment, or portion thereof, made pursuant to this part for which 
confidential treatment is not requested in accordance with this 
paragraph (f), shall be immediately available to the public and not 
subject to the procedures set forth herein. Public disclosure shall be 
made of other portions of an application, notice, other filing or public 
comment in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) and parts 
503 and 505 of this chapter. Applicants and other submitters should 
provide confidential and non-confidential versions of their filings, as 
described in Sec. 574.6(f) (2) and (3) in order to facilitate this 
process.

[[Page 382]]

    (2) Any person who submits any information or causes or permits any 
information to be submitted to the Office pursuant to this part may 
request that the Office afford confidential treatment under the Freedom 
of Information Act to such information for reasons of personal privacy 
or business confidentiality, which shall include such information that 
would be deemed to result in the commencement of a tender offer under 
Sec.  240.14d-2 of title 17 of the Code of Federal Regulations, or for 
any other reason permitted by Federal law. Such request for 
confidentiality must be made and justified in accordance with paragraph 
(f)(5) of this section at the time of filing, and must, to the extent 
practicable, identify with specificity the information for which 
confidential treatment may be available and not merely indicate portions 
of documents or entire documents in which such information is contained. 
Failure to specifically identify information for which confidential 
treatment is requested, failure to specifically justify the bases upon 
which confidentiality is claimed in accordance with paragraph (f)(5) of 
this section, or overbroad and indiscriminate claims for confidential 
treatment, may be bases for denial of the request. In addition, the 
filing party should take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure, as 
nearly as practicable, that at the time the information is first 
received by the Office (i) it is supplied segregated from information 
for which confidential treatment is not being requested, (ii) it is 
appropriately marked as confidential, and (iii) it is accompanied by a 
written request for confidential treatment which identifies with 
specificity the information as to which confidential treatment is 
requested. Any such request must be substantiated in accordance with 
paragraph (f)(5) of this section.
    (3) All documents which contain information for which a request for

thereof shall be marked by the person submitting the records with a 
prominent stamp, typed legend, or other suitable form of notice on each 
page or segregable portion of each page, stating ``Confidential 
Treatment Requested by [name].'' If such marking is impracticable under 
the circumstances, a cover sheet prominently marked ``Confidential 
Treatment Requested by [name]'' should be securely attached to each 
group of records submitted for which confidential treatment is 
requested. Each of the records transmitted in this manner should be 
individually marked with an identifying number and code so that they are 
separately identifiable.
    (4) A determination as to the validity of any request for 
confidential treatment may be made when a request for disclosure of the 
information under the Freedom of Information Act is received, or at any 
time prior thereto. Five business days notice will be provided to the 
filing party if the Office receives a request for the information under 
the Freedom of Information Act and determines to disclose material for 
which confidential treatment has been requested.
    (5) Substantiation of a request for confidential treatment shall 
consist of a statement setting forth, to the extent appropriate or 
necessary for the determination of the request for confidential 
treatment, the following information regarding the request:

exemptive provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, why the 
information should be withheld from access under the Freedom of 
Information Act;
    (ii) The applicability of any specific statutory or regulatory 
provisions which govern or may govern the treatment of the information;
    (iii) The existence and applicability of any prior determination by 
the Office, other Federal agencies, or a court, concerning confidential 
treatment of the information;

    (vi) The ease or difficulty of a competitor's obtaining or compiling 
the commercial or financial information;
    (vii) Whether commercial or financial information was voluntarily 
submitted to the Office, and, if so, whether and how disclosure of the 
information would tend to impede the availability of similar information 
to the Office;
    (viii) The extent, if any, to which portions of the substantiation 
of the request for confidential treatment should be afforded 
confidential treatment;
    (ix) The amount of time after the consummation of the proposed 
acquisition for which the information should remain confidential and a 
justification thereof;
    (x) Such additional facts and such legal and other authorities as 
the requesting person may consider appropriate.
    (6) Any person requesting access to an application, notice, other 
filing, or public comment made pursuant to this part for purposes of 
commenting on a pending submission may prominently label such request: 
``Request for Disclosure of Filing(s) Made Under part 574/Priority 
Treatment Requested.''
    (g) Supervisory cases. The provisions of paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) 
of this section may be waived by the Office in connection with a 
transaction approved by the Office for supervisory reasons.
    (h) Notification of State supervisor. Upon receiving a notice 
relating to an acquisition of control of a state-chartered savings 
association, the Office shall forward a copy of the notice to the 
appropriate state savings and loan association supervisory agency, and 
shall allow 30 days within which the views and recommendations of such 
state supervisory agency may be submitted. The Office shall give due 
consideration to the views and recommendations of such state agency in 
determining whether to disapprove any proposed acquisition. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (h), if the Office 
determines that it must act immediately upon any notice of a proposed 
acquisition in order to prevent the default of the association involved 
in the proposed acquisition, the Office may dispense with the 
requirement of this paragraph (h) or, if a copy of the notice is 
forwarded to the state supervisory agency, the Office may request that 
the views and recommendations of such state supervisory agency be 
submitted immediately in any form or by any means acceptable to the 
Office.
    (i) Additional procedures for acquisitions involving mergers. 
Acquisitions of control involving mergers (including mergers with an 
interim association) shall also be subject to the procedures set forth 
in Sec. 563.22 of this chapter to the extent applicable, except as 
provided in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (j) Additional procedures for acquisitions of recently converted 
savings associations. Applications, notices and rebuttals involving 
acquisitions of the stock of a recently converted savings association 
under Sec. 563b.3(i)(3) of this chapter shall also address the criteria 
for approval set forth at Sec. 563b.3(i)(5) of this chapter.

(g)(1) or (i), such provisions shall be applicable to any holding

representing) more than 25 percent of the voting stock of a savings and 
loan holding company to acquire control of a savings association, or by 
a savings and loan holding company to acquire a qualified stock issuance 
by a savings association pursuant to Sec. 574.8 of this part, except in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Before approving any such 
acquisition, except a transaction under section 13(k) of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Act, the Office shall request from the Attorney 
General and consider any report rendered within 30 days of such request 
on the competitive factors involved. Acquisitions involving mergers 
(including mergers with an interim association) shall also be subject to 
Secs. 546.2, 552.13, and 563.22 of this chapter.
    (c) Application criteria. (1) The OTS may deny an application by a 
company or certain persons, described in paragraph (b) of this section, 
affiliated with a savings and loan holding company, to acquire control 
of a savings association, or by a savings and loan holding company to 
acquire a qualified stock issuance pursuant to Sec. 574.8 of this part:
    (i) If the OTS finds that the financial and managerial resources and 
future prospects of the acquiror and association involved would be 
detrimental to the association or the insurance risk of the SAIF or BIF; 
or
    (ii) If the acquiror fails or refuses to furnish information 
requested by the OTS.
    (2) Consideration of the managerial resources of a company or 
savings association shall include consideration of the competence, 
experience, and integrity of the officers, directors, and controlling 
shareholders of the company or association. In connection with the 
applications filed pursuant to Secs. 574.6 (a)(3) and 574.8 of this 
part, the OTS will also consider the convenience and needs of the 
community to be served. Moreover, the OTS shall not approve any proposed 
acquisition:
    (i) Which would result in a monopoly, or which would be in 
furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or to attempt 
to monopolize the savings and loan business in any part of the United 
States;
    (ii) The effect of which on any section of the country may be 
substantially to lessen competition, or tend to create a monopoly, or 
which in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the OTS 
finds that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed acquisition are 
clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the 
acquisition in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be 
served;
    (iii) If the company fails to provide adequate assurances to the OTS 
that the company will make available to the OTS such information on the 
operations or activities of the company, and any affiliate of the 
company, as the OTS determines to be appropriate to determine and 
enforce compliance with the Home Owners' Loan Act; or
    (iv) In the case of an application by a foreign bank, if the foreign 
bank is not subject to comprehensive supervision or regulation on a 
consolidated basis by the appropriate authorities in the home country of 
the foreign bank. For

[[Page 386]]

purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iv), ``comprehensive supervision or 
regulation on a consolidated basis by the appropriate authorities'' 
shall be determined using the standards set forth at 12 CFR 
211.24(c)(1)(ii).
    (d) Notice criteria. In making its determination whether to 
disapprove a notice, the Office may disapprove any proposed acquisition, 
if the Office determines that:
    (1) The proposed acquisition of control would result in a monopoly 
or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to 
monopolize or to attempt to monopolize the banking business in any part 
of the United States;
    (2) The effect of the proposed acquisition of control in any section 
of the country may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to 
create a monopoly or the proposed acquisition of control would in any 
other manner be in restraint of trade, and the anticompetitive effects 
of the proposed acquisition of control are not clearly outweighed in the 
public interest by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the 
convenience and needs of the community to be served;
    (3) The financial condition of the acquiring person is such as might 
jeopardize the financial stability of the association or prejudice the 
interests of the depositors of the association;
    (4) The competence, experience, or integrity of the acquiring person 
or any of the proposed management personnel indicates that it would not 
be in the interests of the depositors of the association, the Office, or 
the public to permit such person to control the association;
    (5) The acquiring person fails or refuses to furnish information 
requested by the Office; or
    (6) The Office determines that the proposed acquisition would have 
an adverse effect on the SAIF or the BIF.
    (e) Failure to disapprove a notice. If, upon expiration of the 60-
day review period of any notice deemed to be sufficient filed pursuant 
to Sec. 574.6(c), or extension thereof, the Office has failed to 
disapprove such notice, the proposed acquisition may take place: 
Provided, That it is consummated within one year and in accordance with 
the terms and representations in the notice and that there is no 
material change in circumstances prior to the acquisition.
    (f) [Reserved]
    (g) Presumptive disqualifiers--(1) Integrity factors. The following 
factors shall give rise to a rebuttable presumption that an acquiror may 
fail to satisfy the managerial resources and future prospects tests of 
paragraph (c) of this section or the integrity test of paragraph (d)(4) 
of this section:
    (i) During the 10-year period immediately preceding filing of the 
application or notice, criminal, civil or administrative judgments, 
consents or orders, and any indictments, formal investigations, 
examinations, or civil or administrative proceedings (excluding routine 
or customary audits, inspections and investigations) that terminated in 
any agreements, undertakings, consents or orders, issued against,

in control statute;
    (iii) The acquiror or affiliates of the acquiror were placed in 
receivership or conservatorship during the preceding 10 years, or any

director (other than an official or director serving at the request of 
the Office, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Resolution 
Trust Corporation, or the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance 
Corporation) or controlling shareholder of a company or savings 
association that was placed into receivership, conservatorship, or a 
management consignment program, or was liquidated during his or her 
tenure or control or within two years thereafter;
    (iv) Felony conviction of the acquiror, an affiliate of the acquiror 
or a management official of the acquiror or an affiliate of the

presumption that an acquiror may fail to satisfy the financial-resources 
and future-prospects tests of paragraph (c) of this section, or the 
financial condition test of paragraph (d)(3) of this section:
    (i) Liability for amounts of debt which, in the opinion of the

granted by the Office under this Sec. 574.8, unless the acquiring 
savings and loan holding company, directly or indirectly, or acting in 
concert with 1 or more other persons, or through 1 or more subsidiaries, 
owns, controls, or holds with power to vote, or holds proxies 
representing, more than 15 percent of the voting shares of such savings 
association or holding company.
    (b) Qualification. For purposes of this section, any issuance of 
shares of stock shall be treated as a qualified stock issuance if the

this paragraph (b)(1)(i) shall mean any savings association--
    (A) The assets of which exceed the liabilities of such association; 
and

in effect under section 5(t) of the Home Owners' Loan Act; or
    (ii) A savings and loan holding company which is not a bank holding

at the time of issuance, the savings and loan holding company is legally 
obligated to contribute the net proceeds from the issuance of such stock 
to the capital of an undercapitalized savings

[[Page 388]]

association subsidiary of such holding company.
    (2) All shares of stock issued consist of previously unissued stock

National Housing Act, as in effect immediately prior to enactment of the 
Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989) has 
capital (after deducting any subordinated debt, intangible assets, and 
deferred, unamortized gains or losses) of not less than 6\1/2\ percent 
of the total assets of such savings association.

over, or participates in, major policy decisions of a savings 
association or a savings and loan holding company without regard to 
title, salary, or compensation. The term also includes employees of 
entities retained by a savings association or savings and loan holding 
company to perform such functions in lieu of directly hiring the 
individuals, who are similarly identified by the OTS to the savings 
association or savings and loan holding company.
    (3) Complete Notice. The term complete notice means a notice that 
provides all the information requested in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section, including legible fingerprints, complete explanations where 
material issues arise regarding the competence, experience, character, 
or integrity of proposed directors or senior executive officers, and any 
additional information that the OTS may request following a 
determination that the original submission of the notice was not 
complete.
    (4) Complete Notice Date. The term complete notice date means the 
date on which the OTS has received a complete notice.
    (5) Troubled Condition. The term troubled condition means:

notice date.
    (c) Savings associations and holding companies covered. The 
requirements of paragraph (b) of this section shall apply:
    (1) In the case of a savings association, a savings association that 
has been chartered less than two years, excluding a savings association 
that has operated as an insured depository institution for at least two 
years as determined by the OTS upon written request;
    (2) In the case of a savings association or savings and loan holding

    (d) Procedures--(1) Filing Requirements. (i) Except where otherwise 
provided in this section, notices shall be filed in accordance with the 
filing procedures set forth at 12 CFR 516.1. Except as noted in 
paragraph (d)(5) of this section, the appropriate OTS form(s) shall be 
used for all notices. A notice is required to contain all the 
information set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. A notice 
shall comply with all applicable regulations and guidelines. The OTS 
will provide written notification to the filer of a notice of the 
complete notice date when the OTS has received a complete notice. The 
30-day review period begins on the complete notice date.
    (ii) The notice shall be submitted by the savings association or 
savings and loan holding company that proposes a particular individual 
to serve as a director or senior executive officer; each individual on 
whose behalf a notice is filed must certify that, to the best of his or 
her knowledge and belief, all the information filed is true, correct, 
complete, and made in good faith; and a senior official of the savings 
association or savings and loan holding company must certify that 
information pertaining to that individual has been reviewed by the 
filing savings association or savings and loan holding company and that 
the information submitted is consistent with information obtained by the 
savings association or savings and loan holding company. Where the 
interests of the individual and the savings association or savings and 
loan holding company may be at odds, such as in the case of a proxy 
contest, the notice may be submitted to the OTS directly by the 
individual. In such case, the individual must certify that he or she 
provided the savings association or savings and loan holding company all 
non-confidential information contained in the notice and likewise 
certify that, to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, all of the 
information filed is true, correct, complete, and made in good faith. If 
a notice for such an individual has not been submitted to the OTS prior 
to the election, the individual and the savings association or savings 
and loan holding

[[Page 391]]

company have the alternative of relying on the automatically granted 
waiver under paragraph (d)(8)(ii) of this section.
    (2) Content of Notice. A notice must contain the identity, personal 
history, business background, and experience of each person whose 
designation as a director or senior executive officer is subject to this 
section. The notice must include:
    (i) A description of his or her material business activities and 
affiliations during the 5 years preceding the date of the notice;
    (ii) A description of any material pending legal or administrative 
proceedings in which he or she is a party;
    (iii) Any criminal indictment or conviction by a State or Federal 
court; and
    (iv) Legible fingerprints of such person, except that fingerprints 
are not required with respect to any person who, within the three years 
immediately preceding the date of the present notice, has been subject 
to a notice filed with the OTS pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1831i or this 
section and has previously submitted fingerprints.
    (3) Requests for Additional Information. (i) If the original 
submission of a notice is considered not complete, the OTS will provide 
written notification to the filer of the notice that the notice is not 
complete, set forth the reasons for this determination, and may request 
that the filer of the notice submit additional information.
    (ii) Following receipt of a complete notice, the OTS may make a 
written request, when feasible, for additional information and may 
specify a time period during which such information must be provided.
    (4) Suspension of the 30-day Review Period. (i) When the OTS makes a 
request for additional information under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this 
section, the savings association or savings and loan holding company 
must provide the information within the time period specified by the OTS 
or the savings association or savings and loan holding company may 
request in writing that the OTS suspend processing of the notice. To 
enable the savings association or savings and loan holding company to 
provide such information, the OTS may suspend processing for a period of 
up to 60 days from the date of the request. If the savings association 
or savings and loan holding company has not provided the requested 
information within the latest applicable time period specified by the 
OTS:
    (A) The OTS may make its decision based on the information then 
before it and may draw any reasonable inferences from the savings 
association or savings and loan holding company's failure to provide the 
requested information; or
    (B) The OTS may treat the notice as withdrawn and inform the savings 
association or savings and loan holding company in writing.
    (ii) If the OTS does not receive a report that it requested from 
another government agency concerning an individual proposed by the 
savings association or savings and loan holding company within the 30-
day review period, the OTS may request that the savings association or 
savings and loan holding company and the proposed individual certify, by 
signing a letter provided by the OTS, that the individual will not 
assume the proposed position until the OTS has received and reviewed the 
report and has issued a notice of intent not to disapprove. In making 
this request, the OTS will notify the savings association or savings and 
loan holding company and the individual of the basis for its 
unwillingness to issue a notice of intent not to disapprove before the 
end of the 30-day review period without receipt and review of the 
report. If either the savings association or savings and loan holding 
company or the individual do not sign the certification before the end 
of the 30-day review period, the OTS will decide whether to issue a 
notice of disapproval based on the information then before it.
    (5) Special Notice Rule for Multi-Tiered Savings and Loan Holding 
Companies. (i) With respect to multi-tiered savings and loan holding 
companies, the notification required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section 
will only be required for the savings and loan holding company that 
directly controls a savings association; provided that if such company 
is without substantial assets other than the ownership of the subsidiary

[[Page 392]]

savings association, then the company that directly controls such 
savings and loan holding company shall also be subject to the 
notification requirement of paragraph (d)(1) of this section; further 
provided that, in the event the first indirect savings and loan holding 
company also is without substantial assets other than the ownership of 
the direct savings and loan holding company, then each company that 
directly and/or indirectly holds the indirect savings and loan holding 
company shall be subject to the notification requirement of paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section until a savings and loan holding company in the 
line of ownership that has substantial assets other than the indirect 
ownership of the savings association is subject to the notification 
requirement of paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (ii) Other savings and loan holding companies in a multi-tiered 
ownership structure described in paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section may 
satisfy the notification requirement of paragraph (d)(1) of this section 
by submitting:
    (A) An executed copy of the OTS's RB 20 certification regarding the 
subject individual's involvement in certain types of legal proceedings; 
and
    (B) A certification from the individual and the highest-ranking 
official of the company, certifying that the appointment of the 
individual as a senior executive officer would not raise grounds for 
disapproval of the notice under 12 U.S.C. 1831i or this section.
    (iii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (d)(5)(i) and 
(ii) of this section, the OTS may require submission of a complete 
notice under this section for any savings and loan holding company in a 
multi-tiered ownership structure.
    (6) Notice of Disapproval. The OTS may disapprove an individual 
proposed as a member of the board of directors or as a senior executive 
officer of a savings association or savings and loan holding company 
upon determining that, on the basis of the individual's competence, 
experience, character, or integrity, it would not be in the best 
interests of the depositors of the savings association or savings and 
loan holding company or of the public to permit the individual to be 
employed by, or associated with, the savings association or savings and 
loan holding company. The OTS will send a notice of disapproval to both 
the savings association or savings and loan holding company and the 
disapproved individual. The notice of disapproval will contain a 
statement of the basis for disapproval.
    (7) Notice of Intent Not to Disapprove. An individual proposed as a 
member of the board of directors or as a senior executive officer of a 
savings association or savings and loan holding company may begin 
service before the expiration of the 30-day review period if the OTS 
notifies the savings association or savings and loan holding company of 
an intention not to disapprove the proposed director or senior executive 
officer.
    (8) Waiver of Prior Notice. (i) A savings association or savings and 
loan holding company may file with the OTS a written request for a 
waiver of the prior notice requirement. The OTS may waive the prior 
notice requirement but not the filing of a notice under this section, if 
the OTS finds that waiver would be in the best interest of the savings 
association or the savings and loan holding company, would be in the 
public interest, or that other extraordinary circumstances justify 
waiving the prior notice requirement of this provision. The length of 
any waiver depends on the circumstances in each individual case. If a 
waiver is granted, the required notice shall be filed within the time 
period specified in the waiver and the proposed individual may assume 
the position on an interim basis until the individual and the savings 
association or savings and loan holding company receive a notice of 
disapproval. If the required notice is not filed within the time period 
specified in the waiver, the proposed individual must immediately resign 
his or her position. The individual can assume the position on a 
permanent basis only after the savings association or savings and loan 
holding company receives a notice of intent not to disapprove or after 
the 30-day review period elapses. A waiver shall not affect the 
authority of the OTS to subsequently issue a notice of disapproval

[[Page 393]]

within 30 days of the expiration of such waiver.
    (ii) In the case of the election at a meeting of the shareholders of 
a new director not proposed by the board of directors of the savings 
association or savings and loan holding company, if the individual has 
not submitted a notice directly to OTS under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of 
this section, a waiver is automatically granted and the proposed 
individual may begin service as a director. However, under these 
circumstances, the savings association or savings and loan holding 
company must file the required notice with the OTS as soon as practical 
but not later than seven days from the date the individual is notified 
of the election to the board of directors.
    (9) Commencement of Service. An individual proposed as a member of 
the board of directors or as a senior executive officer may assume the 
office following the end of the 30-day review period, which begins on 
the complete notice date, unless:
    (i) The OTS issues a notice of disapproval during the 30-day review 
period;
    (ii) The OTS suspends the 30-day review period pursuant to paragraph 
(d)(4)(i) of this section;
    (iii) The savings association or savings and loan holding company 
and the individual certify, pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this 
section, that the individual will not assume the proposed position; or
    (iv) The savings association or savings and loan holding company 
does not provide additional information within the time period required 
by the OTS pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section and the OTS 
treats the notice as withdrawn.

Sec. 575.3  Mutual holding company reorganizations.

    A mutual savings association may reorganize to become a mutual 
holding company, or join in a mutual holding company reorganization as 
an acquiree association, only upon satisfaction of the following 
conditions:
    (a) A Reorganization Plan is approved by a majority of the board of 
directors of the reorganizing association and any acquiree association;
    (b) A Reorganization Notice is filed with the OTS and either:
    (1) The OTS has given written notice of its intent not to disapprove 
the proposed reorganization; or
    (2) Sixty days have passed since the OTS received the Reorganization 
Notice and deemed it sufficient under

[[Page 397]]

Sec. 516.2(c) of this chapter, and the OTS has not:
    (i) Given written notice that the proposed reorganization is 
disapproved; or
    (ii) Extended for an additional 30 days the period during which 
disapproval may be issued;
    (c) The Reorganization Plan is submitted to the members of the 
reorganizing association and any acquiree association pursuant to a 
proxy statement cleared in advance by the OTS and such Reorganization 
Plan is approved by a majority of the total votes of the members of each 
association eligible to be cast at a meeting held at the call of each 
association's directors in accordance with the procedures prescribed by 
each association's charter and bylaws; and
    (d) All necessary regulatory approvals have been obtained and all 
conditions specified in Sec. 575.9(c)(5) of this part or otherwise 
imposed by the OTS in connection with the issuance of a notice of intent 
not to disapprove under Sec. 575.3(b)(1) of this part or by the OTS in 
connection with the granting of the approvals specified in this 
paragraph have been satisfied.


<R05>
Sec. 575.4  Grounds for disapproval of reorganizations.

    (a) Basic standards. The OTS may disapprove a proposed mutual 
holding company reorganization pursuant to Sec. 575.3(b) of this part 
if:
    (1) Disapproval is necessary to prevent unsafe or unsound practices;
    (2) The financial or managerial resources of the reorganizing 
association or any acquiree association warrant disapproval;
    (3) The proposed capitalization of the mutual holding company fails 
to meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section;
    (4) A stock issuance is proposed in connection with the 
reorganization pursuant to Sec. 575.7 of this part that fails to meet 
the standards established by that section;
    (5) The reorganizing association or any acquiree association fails 
to furnish the information required to be included in the Reorganization 
Notice or any other information requested by the OTS in connection with 
the proposed reorganization; or
    (6) The proposed reorganization would violate any provision of law, 
including (without limitation) Sec. 575.3 (a) and (c) of this part 
(regarding board of directors and membership approval) or Sec. 575.5(a) 
of this part (regarding continuity of membership rights).
    (b) Capitalization. (1) The OTS shall disapprove a proposal by a 
reorganizing association or any acquiree association to capitalize a 
mutual holding company in an amount in excess of a nominal amount if 
immediately following the reorganization, the resulting association or 
the acquiree association would fail to be ``adequately capitalized'' as 
defined under 12 CFR part 565.
    (2) Proposals by reorganizing associations and acquiree associations 
to capitalize mutual holding companies shall also comply with any 
applicable statutes, and with regulations or written policies of the OTS 
governing capital distributions by savings associations in effect at the 
time of the reorganization. (Issuance by the OTS of a notice of intent 
not to disapprove a mutual holding company reorganization pursuant to 
Sec. 575.3(b) of this part, or failure by the OTS to disapprove such a 
reorganization within the time prescribed in Sec. 575.3(b) of this part, 
shall also be deemed to constitute OTS approval under any regulation or 
written policy of the OTS governing capital distributions by savings 
associations, if such approval is required, of the capitalization 
proposal set forth in the Reorganization Notice, subject to any 
conditions imposed by Sec. 575.4(d)(2) of this part.)
    (c) Presumptive disqualifiers--(1) Managerial resources. The factors 
specified in Sec. 574.7 (g)(1)(i)-(g)(1)(vi) of this chapter shall give 
rise to a rebuttable presumption that the managerial resources test of 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section is not met. For this purpose, each 
place the term acquiror appears in Sec. 574.7 (g)(1)(i)-(g)(1)(vi) of 
this chapter, it shall be read to mean the reorganizing association or 
any acquiree association, and the reference in Sec. 574.7(g)(1)(v) of 
this chapter to filings under this part shall be deemed to include 
filings under either part 574 of this chapter or this part.

[[Page 398]]

    (2) Safety and soundness and financial resources. Failure by a 
reorganizing association and any acquiree association to submit a 
business plan in connection with a Reorganization Notice, or submission 
of a business plan that projects activities that are inconsistent with 
economical home financing or that fails to demonstrate that the capital 
of the mutual holding company will be deployed in a safe and sound 
manner, shall give rise to a rebuttable presumption that the safety and 
soundness and financial resources tests of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) 
of this section are not met.
    (d) Failure of the OTS to act on a Reorganization Notice within the 
prescribed time period. A proposed reorganization that obtains 
regulatory clearance from the OTS due to the operation of 
Sec. 575.3(b)(2) of this part may take place in the manner proposed, 
subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The reorganization shall be consummated within one year of the 
date of the expiration of the OTS's review period under Sec. 575.3(b)(2) 
of this part;
    (2) The mutual holding company shall not be capitalized in an amount 
in excess of what is permissible under Sec. 575.4(b) of this part;
    (3) No request for regulatory waivers or forbearances shall be 
deemed granted;
    (4) The following information shall be submitted within the 
specified time frames:
    (i) On the business day prior to the date of the reorganization, the 
chief financial officers of the reorganizing association and any 
acquiree association shall certify to the OTS in writing that no 
material adverse events or material adverse changes have occurred with 
respect to the financial condition or operations of their respective 
associations since the date of the financial statements submitted with 
the Reorganization Notice;
    (ii) No later than thirty days after the reorganization, the mutual 
holding company shall file with the OTS a certification by legal counsel 
stating the effective date of the reorganization, the exact number of 
shares of stock of the resulting association and any acquiree 
association acquired by the mutual holding company and by any other 
persons, and that the reorganization has been consummated in accordance 
with Sec. 575.3 of this part and all other applicable laws and 
regulations and the Reorganization Notice;
    (iii) No later than thirty days after the reorganization, the mutual 
holding company shall file with the OTS an opinion from its independent 
auditors certifying that the reorganization was consummated in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; and
    (iv) No later than thirty days after the reorganization, the mutual 
holding company shall file with the OTS a certification stating that the 
mutual holding company will not deviate materially, or cause its savings 
association subsidiaries to deviate materially, from the business plan 
submitted in connection with the Reorganization Notice, unless prior 
written approval from the Regional Director is obtained.


<R05>
Sec. 575.5  Membership rights.

    (a) Depositors and borrowers of resulting associations, acquiree 
associations, and associations in mutual form when acquired. The charter 
of a mutual holding company must:
    (1) Confer upon existing and future depositors of the resulting 
association the same membership rights in the mutual holding company as 
were conferred upon depositors by the charter of the reorganizing 
association as in effect immediately prior to the reorganization;
    (2) Confer upon existing and future depositors of any acquiree 
association or any association that is in the mutual form when acquired 
by the mutual holding company the same membership rights in the mutual 
holding company as were conferred upon depositors by the charter of the 
acquired association immediately prior to acquisition, provided that if 
the acquired association is merged into another association from which 
the mutual holding company draws members, the depositors of the acquired 
association shall receive the same membership rights as the depositors 
of the association into which the acquired association is merged;
    (3) Confer upon the borrowers of the resulting association who are 
borrowers at the time of reorganization the

[[Page 399]]

same membership rights in the mutual holding company as were conferred 
upon them by the charter of the reorganizing association immediately 
prior to reorganization, but shall not confer any membership rights in 
connection with any borrowings made after the reorganization; and
    (4) Confer upon the borrowers of any acquiree association or any 
association that is in the mutual form when acquired by the mutual 
holding company who are borrowers at the time of the acquisition the 
same membership rights in the mutual holding company as were conferred 
upon them by the charter of the acquired association immediately prior 
to acquisition, but shall not confer any membership rights in connection 
with any borrowings made after the acquisition, provided that if the 
acquired association is merged into another association from which the 
mutual holding company draws members, the borrowers of the acquired 
association shall instead receive the same grandfathered membership 
rights as the borrowers of the association into which the acquired 
association is merged received at the time that association became a 
subsidiary of the mutual holding company.
    (b) Depositors and borrowers of associations in the stock form when 
acquired. A mutual holding company that acquires a savings association 
in the stock form, other than a resulting association or an acquiree 
association, shall not confer any membership rights upon the depositors 
and borrowers of such association, unless such association is merged 
into an association from which the mutual holding company draws members, 
in which case the depositors of the stock association shall receive the 
same membership rights as other depositors of the association into which 
the stock association is merged.


<R05>
Sec. 575.6  Contents of Reorganization Plans.

    Each Reorganization Plan shall contain a complete description of all 
significant terms of the proposed reorganization, shall attach and 
incorporate any Stock Issuance Plan proposed in connection with the 
Reorganization Plan, and shall:
    (a) Provide for amendment of the charter and bylaws of the 
reorganizing association to read in the form of the charter and bylaws 
of a mutual holding company, and attach and incorporate such charter and 
bylaws;
    (b) Provide for the organization of the resulting association, which 
shall be an interim federal or state savings association subsidiary of 
the reorganizing association, and attach and incorporate the proposed 
charter and bylaws of such association;
    (c) Provide for amendment of the charter and bylaws of any acquiree 
association to read in the form of the charter and bylaws of a state or 
federal savings association in the stock form (as modified by 
Sec. 575.9(b) of this part), and attach and incorporate such charter and 
bylaws;
    (d) Provide that, upon consummation of the reorganization, 
substantially all of the assets and liabilities (including all savings 
accounts, demand accounts, tax and loan accounts, United States Treasury 
General Accounts, or United States Treasury Time Deposit Open Accounts, 
as defined in part 561 of this chapter) of the reorganizing association 
shall be transferred to the resulting association, which shall thereupon 
become an operating savings association subsidiary of the mutual holding 
company;
    (e) Provide that all assets, rights, obligations, and liabilities of 
whatever nature of the reorganizing association that are not expressly 
retained by the mutual holding company shall be deemed transferred to 
the resulting association;
    (f) Provide that each depositor in the reorganizing association or 
any acquiree association immediately prior to the reorganization shall 
upon consummation of the reorganization receive, without payment, an 
identical account in the resulting association or the acquiree 
association, as the case may be (Appropriate modifications should be 
made to this provision if savings associations are being merged as a 
part of the reorganization);
    (g) Provide that the Reorganization Plan as adopted by the boards of 
directors of the reorganizing association and any acquiree association 
may be substantively amended by those boards

[[Page 400]]

of directors as a result of comments from regulatory authorities or 
otherwise prior to the solicitation of proxies from the members of the 
reorganizing association and any acquiree association to vote on the 
Reorganization Plan and at any time thereafter with the concurrence of 
the OTS; and that the reorganization may be terminated by the board of 
directors of the reorganizing association or any acquiree association at 
any time prior to the meeting of the members of the association called 
to consider the Reorganization Plan and at any time thereafter with the 
concurrence of the OTS;
    (h) Provide that the Reorganization Plan shall be terminated if not 
completed within a specified period of time (The time period shall not 
be more than 24 months from the date upon which the members of the 
reorganizing association or the date upon which the members of any 
acquiree association, whichever is earlier, approve the Reorganization 
Plan and may not be extended by the reorganizing or acquiree 
association); and
    (i) Provide that the expenses incurred in connection with the 
reorganization shall be reasonable.


<R05>
Sec. 575.7  Issuances of stock by savings association subsidiaries of mutual holding companies.

    (a) Approval requirements. No savings association subsidiary of a 
mutual holding company (including any resulting association or acquiree 
association) may issue stock to persons other than its mutual holding 
company parent in connection with a mutual holding company 
reorganization, or at any time subsequent to the association's 
acquisition by the mutual holding company, unless the association 
obtains advance approval of each such issuance from the OTS. Issuance by 
the OTS of a notice of intent not to disapprove a mutual holding company 
reorganization pursuant to Sec. 575.3(b) of this part, or failure by the 
OTS to disapprove such a reorganization within the time prescribed in 
Sec. 575.3(b) of this part, shall be deemed to constitute approval of 
any stock issuance specifically applied for pursuant to this section in 
connection with the reorganization, unless otherwise specified by the 
OTS. The OTS shall approve any proposed issuance that meets each of the 
criteria set forth below in paragraphs (a)(1)-(a)(7) of this section.
    (1) The proposed issuance is to be made pursuant to a Stock Issuance 
Plan that contains all the provisions required by Sec. 575.8 of this 
part.
    (2) The Stock Issuance Plan is consistent with the terms of the 
association's charter (or any proposed amendments thereto), including 
terms governing the type and amount of stock that may be issued.
    (3) The Stock Issuance Plan would provide the association, its 
mutual holding company parent, and any other savings association 
subsidiaries of the mutual holding company with fully sufficient capital 
and would not be inequitable or detrimental to the association or its 
mutual holding company parent or to members of the mutual holding 
company parent.
    (4) The proposed price or price range of the stock to be issued is 
reasonable. (The OTS shall review the reasonableness of the proposed 
price or price range in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.)
    (5) The aggregate amount of outstanding common stock of the 
association owned or controlled by persons other than the association's 
mutual holding company parent at the close of the proposed issuance 
shall be less than 50% of the association's total outstanding common 
stock, unless the association was a stock association when acquired by 
the mutual holding company and is not a resulting association or an 
acquiree association, in which case the foregoing restriction shall not 
apply. Any amount of preferred stock may be issued by any savings 
association subsidiary of a mutual holding company to persons other than 
the association's mutual holding company, consistent with any other 
applicable laws and regulations.
    (6) The association furnishes the information required by the OTS in 
connection with the proposed issuance.
    (7) The proposed stock issuance would fail to meet the convenience 
and needs standard of Sec. 563b.11 of this chapter.

[[Page 401]]

    (8) The proposed issuance complies with all other applicable laws 
and regulations.
    (b) Pricing and sale of securities. (1) All of the provisions of 
Sec. 563b.7 of this chapter shall apply to a stock issuance applied for 
pursuant to this section, unless otherwise provided for in this part or 
clearly inapplicable, as determined by the OTS. For purposes of this 
paragraph (b)(1), the term conversion as it appears in the provisions of 
Sec. 563b.7 of this chapter shall be deemed to refer to the stock 
issuance, and the term converted or converting savings association shall 
be deemed to refer to the savings association undertaking the stock 
issuance.
    (2) Unless otherwise determined by the OTS, the limitations on the 
minimum and maximum amounts of the estimated price range required by 
Sec. 563b.7(c) of this chapter shall not apply.
    (3) To the extent the pricing materials submitted pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section include any discount due to the 
minority status of the stock to be offered, the materials must indicate 
the amount of the discount and how that amount was determined.
    (c) Related approvals. Approval by the OTS of any stock issuance 
pursuant to this section shall also be deemed to constitute:
    (1) Approval under Sec. 563.1 of this chapter of the form of stock 
certificate proposed to be utilized in connection with the stock 
issuance, provided such form was included in the application materials 
filed pursuant to this section; and
    (2) Preliminary approval under Sec. 552.4 of this chapter and 
approval under Sec. 563.1 of this chapter of any charter or bylaw 
amendment required to authorize issuance of the stock, provided such 
amendment was proposed in the application materials filed pursuant to 
this section.
    (d) Offering restrictions. (1) No representations may be made in any 
manner in connection with the offer or sale of any stock issued pursuant 
to this section that the price, price range or any other pricing 
information related to such stock issuance has been approved by the OTS 
or that the stock has been approved or disapproved by the OTS or that 
the OTS has endorsed the accuracy or adequacy of any securities offering 
documents disseminated in connection with such stock.
    (2) The sale of minority stock of the reorganized stock savings 
association to be made under the minority stock issuance plan, including 
any sale in a public offering or direct community marketing, shall be 
completed as promptly as possible and within 45 calendar days after the 
last day of the subscription period, unless extended by the OTS.
    (3) In the offer, sale, or purchase of stock issued pursuant to this 
section, no person shall:
    (i) Employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud;
    (ii) Make any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a 
material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the 
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; 
or
    (iii) Engage in any act, practice, or course of business which 
operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon a purchaser or 
seller.
    (4) Prior to the completion of a stock issuance pursuant to this 
section, no person shall transfer, or enter into any agreement or 
understanding to transfer, the legal or beneficial ownership of the 
stock to be issued to any other person.
    (5) Prior to the completion of a stock issuance pursuant to this 
section, no person shall make any offer, or any announcement of any 
offer, to purchase any stock to be issued, or knowingly acquire any 
stock in the issuance, in excess of the maximum purchase limitations 
established in the Stock Issuance Plan.
    (6) All stock issuances pursuant to this section must:
    (i) Comply with 12 CFR part 563g and, to the extent applicable, 12 
CFR 563b.102; and
    (ii) Provide that the offering be structured in a manner similar to 
a standard conversion under 12 CFR part 563b, including the stock 
purchase priorities accorded members of the issuing association's mutual 
holding company, unless the association would qualify for a supervisory 
conversion if it were to undertake a conversion

[[Page 402]]

under 12 CFR part 563b; or demonstrates to the satisfaction of the OTS 
that a non-conforming issuance would be more beneficial to the 
association compared to a conforming offering, considering, in the 
aggregate, the effect of each on the association's financial and 
managerial resources and future prospects, the effect of the issuance 
upon the association, the insurance risk to the relevant Federal deposit 
insurance fund, and the convenience and needs of the community to be 
served.
    (e) Procedural and substantive requirements. The procedural and 
substantive requirements of Secs. 563b.3 through 563b.8 of this chapter 
shall apply to all mutual holding company stock issuances under this 
section, unless clearly inapplicable.

<R05>
Sec. 575.8  Contents of Stock Issuance Plans.

    (a) Mandatory provisions. Each of the provisions mandatory for all 
stock issuance plans under this paragraph shall be deemed regulatory 
requirements. Each Stock Issuance Plan shall contain a complete 
description of all significant terms of the proposed stock issuance 
(including the information specified in Sec. 563b.27(a) of this chapter 
to the extent known), shall attach and incorporate the proposed form of 
stock certificate, the proposed stock order form, and any agreements or 
other documents defining the rights of the stockholders, and shall:
    (1) Provide that the stock shall be sold at a total price equal to 
the estimated pro forma market value of such stock, based upon an 
independent valuation, as provided in Sec. 575.7(b) of this part;
    (2) Provide that the aggregate amount of outstanding common stock of 
the association owned or controlled by persons other than the 
association's mutual holding company parent at the close of the proposed 
issuance shall be less than fifty percent of the association's total 
outstanding common stock (This provision may be omitted if the proposed 
issuance will be conducted by an association that was in the stock form 
when acquired by its mutual holding company parent, provided the 
association is not a resulting association or an acquiree association);
    (3) Provide that the aggregate amount of common stock acquired in 
the proposed issuance, plus all prior issuances of the association, by 
any non-tax-qualified employee stock benefit plan of the association or 
any insider of the association and his or her associates, exclusive of 
any stock acquired by said plan or insider and his or her associates in 
the secondary market, shall not exceed ten percent of the outstanding 
shares of common stock of the association held by persons other than the 
association's mutual holding company parent at the close of the proposed 
issuance. In calculating the number of shares held by any insider or 
associate under this provision or the provision in paragraph (a)(4) of 
this section, shares held by any tax-qualified or non-tax-qualified 
employee stock benefit plan of the association that are attributable to 
such person shall not be counted;
    (4) Provide that the aggregate amount of stock, whether common or 
preferred, acquired in the proposed issuance, plus all prior issuances 
of the association, by any non-tax-qualified employee stock benefit plan 
of the association or any insider of the association and his or her 
associates, exclusive of any stock acquired by said plan or insider and 
his or her associates in the secondary market, shall not exceed ten 
percent of the stockholders' equity of the association held by persons 
other than the association's mutual holding company parent at the close 
of the proposed issuance;
    (5) Provide that the aggregate amount of common stock acquired in 
the proposed issuance, plus all prior issuances of the association, by 
any one or more tax-qualified employee stock benefit plans of the 
association, exclusive of any stock acquired by such plans in the 
secondary market, shall not exceed ten percent of the outstanding shares 
of common stock of the association held by persons other than the 
association's mutual holding company parent at the close of the proposed 
issuance;
    (6) Provide that the aggregate amount of stock, whether common or

[[Page 403]]

preferred, acquired in the proposed issuance, plus all prior issuances 
of the association, by any one or more tax-qualified employee stock 
benefit plans of the association, exclusive of any stock acquired by 
such plans in the secondary market, shall not exceed ten percent of the 
stockholders' equity of the association held by persons other than the 
association's mutual holding company parent at the close of the proposed 
issuance;
    (7) Provide that the aggregate amount of common stock acquired in 
the proposed issuance, plus all prior issuances of the association, by 
all non-tax-qualified employee stock benefit plans of the association, 
insiders of the association, and associates of insiders of the 
association, exclusive of any stock acquired by said plans, insiders, 
and associates in the secondary market, shall not exceed thirty-five 
percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of the association 
held by persons other than the association's mutual holding company 
parent at the close of the proposed issuance if the association has less

percent of such outstanding shares if the association has more than $500 
million in total assets prior to the issuance. If the association has 
between $50 million and $500 million in total assets prior to the 
issuance, the maximum percentage shall be equal to thirty-five percent 
minus one percent multiplied by the quotient of total assets less $50 
million divided by $45 million. (See example calculation set forth in 
Sec. 563b.3(c)(8) of this chapter.) In calculating the number of shares 
held by insiders and their associates under this provision or the 
provision in paragraph (a)(8) of this section, shares held by any tax-
qualified or non-tax qualified employee stock benefit plan of the 
association that are attributable to such persons shall not be counted;
    (8) Provide that the aggregate amount of stock, whether common or 
preferred, acquired in the proposed issuance, plus all prior issuances 
of the association, by all non-tax-qualified employee stock benefit 
plans of the association, insiders of the association, and associates of 
insiders of the association, exclusive of any stock acquired by said 
plans, insiders, and associates in the secondary market, shall not 
exceed thirty-five percent of the stockholders' equity of the 
association held by persons other than the association's mutual holding 
company parent at the close of the proposed issuance if the association 
has less than $50 million in total assets prior to the issuance or 
twenty-five percent of such stockholders' equity if the association has 
more than $500 million in total assets prior to the issuance. If the 
association has between $50 million and $500 million in total assets 
prior to the proposed issuance, the maximum percentage shall be equal to 
thirty-five percent minus one percent multiplied by the quotient of 
total assets less $50 million divided by $45 million. (See example 
calculation set forth in Sec. 563b.3(c)(8) of this chapter.);
    (9) Provide that the issuance shall be conducted in compliance with 
12 CFR part 563g and, to the extent applicable, 12 CFR 563b.102;

stock, the association shall promptly register that class of stock 
pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (15 U.S.C. 
78a-78jj), and undertake not to deregister such stock for a period of 
three years thereafter;
    (12) Provide that, if at the close of the stock issuance the

market for that class of stock; and
    (ii) List that class of stock on a national or regional securities 
exchange or on the NASDAQ quotation system;
    (13) Provide that, for a period of three years following the 
proposed issuance, no insider of the association or his or her 
associates shall purchase, without the prior written approval of the 
OTS, any stock of the association except from a broker dealer registered

[[Page 404]]

with the Securities and Exchange Commission, except that the foregoing 
restriction shall not apply to:
    (i) Negotiated transactions involving more than one percent of the 
outstanding stock in the class of stock; or
    (ii) Purchases of stock made by and held by any tax-qualified or 
non-tax-qualified employee stock benefit plan of the association even if 
such stock is attributable to insiders of the association or their 
associates;
    (14) Provide that stock purchased by insiders of the association and 
their associates in the proposed issuance shall not be sold for a period

Sec. 575.9  Charters and bylaws for mutual holding companies and their savings association subsidiaries.

    (a) Charters and bylaws for mutual holding companies--(1) Charters. 
The charter of a mutual holding company shall be in the form set forth 
in this paragraph (a)(1) and may include any of the additional 
provisions permitted pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

                                 Charter

    Section 1: Corporate title. The name of the mutual holding company 
is ______(the ``Mutual Company'').
    Section 2: Duration. The duration of the Mutual Company is 
perpetual.
    Section 3: Purpose and powers. The purpose of the Mutual Company is 
to pursue any or all of the lawful objectives of a federal mutual 
savings and loan holding company chartered under section 10(o) of the 
Home Owners' Loan Act, 12 U.S.C. 1467a(o), and to exercise all of the 
express, implied, and incidental powers conferred thereby and all acts 
amendatory thereof and supplemental thereto, subject to the Constitution 
and the laws of the United States as they are now in effect, or as they 
may hereafter be amended, and subject to all lawful and applicable 
rules, regulations, and orders of the Office of Thrift Supervision 
(``OTS'').
    Section 4: Capital. The Mutual Company shall have no capital stock.
    Section 5: Members. [The content of this section 5 shall be 
identical to the content of the parallel section in the charter of the 
reorganizing association, with the following exceptions: (A) Any 
provisions conferring membership rights upon borrowers of the 
reorganizing association shall be eliminated and replaced with 
provisions grandfathering those rights in accordance with 12 CFR 575.5; 
and (B) appropriate changes shall be made to indicate that membership 
rights in the mutual holding company derive from deposit accounts in 
and, to the extent of any grandfather provisions, borrowings from the 
resulting association. Set forth below is an example of how section 5 
should appear in the charter of a mutual holding company formed by a 
reorganizing association whose charter conforms to the model charter 
prescribed for federal mutual savings associations for calendar year 
1989. Additional changes to this section 5 may be required whenever a 
mutual holding company reorganization involves an acquiree association, 
or a mutual holding company makes a post-reorganization acquisition of a 
mutual savings association, so as to preserve the membership rights of 
the members of the acquired association consistent with 12 CFR 575.5.]
    All holders of the savings, demand, or other authorized accounts of 
____________ [insert the name of the resulting association] (the 
``Association'') are members of the Mutual Company. With respect to all 
questions requiring action by the members of the Mutual Company, each 
holder of an account in the Association shall be permitted to cast one 
vote for each $100, or fraction thereof, of the withdrawal value of the 
member's account. In addition, borrowers from the Association as of 
____________ [insert the date of the reorganization or any earlier date 
as of which new borrowings ceased to result in membership rights] shall 
be entitled to one vote for the period of time during which such 
borrowings are in existence. [The foregoing sentence should be included 
only if the charter of the reorganizing association confers voting 
rights on any borrowers.] No member, however, shall cast more than one 
thousand votes. All accounts shall be nonassessable.
    Section 6. Directors. The Mutual Company shall be under the 
direction of a board of directors. The authorized number of directors 
shall not be fewer than five nor more than fifteen, as fixed in the 
Mutual Company's bylaws, except that the number of directors may be 
decreased to a number less than five or increased to a number greater 
than fifteen with the prior approval of the Director of the Office or 
his or her delegate.
    Section 7: Capital, surplus, and distribution of earnings. [The 
content of this section 7 shall be identical to the content of the 
parallel section in the charter of the reorganizing association, except 
for changes made to indicate that distribution rights in the mutual 
holding company derive from deposit accounts in the resulting 
association, any changes required to provide that the Director of the 
OTS shall be the approving authority in instances where the charter 
requires regulatory approval of distributions, and any other changes 
necessary to accommodate the mutual holding company format. Set forth 
below is an example of how section 7 should appear in the charter of a 
mutual holding company formed by a reorganizing association whose 
charter conforms to the model charter prescribed for federal mutual 
savings associations for calendar year 1989. Additional changes to this 
section 7 may be required whenever a mutual holding company 
reorganization involves an acquiree association, or a mutual holding 
company makes a post-reorganization acquisition of a mutual savings 
association, so as to preserve the membership rights of the members of 
the acquired association consistent with 12 CFR 575.5.]

[[Page 406]]

    The Mutual Company shall distribute net earnings to account holders 
of the Association on such basis and in accordance with such terms and 
conditions as may from time to time be authorized by the Director of the 
OTS, provided that the Mutual Company may establish minimum account 
balance requirements for account holders to be eligible for 
distributions of earnings.
    All holders of accounts of the Association shall be entitled to 
equal distribution of the assets of the Mutual Company, pro rata to the 
value of their accounts in the Association, in the event of voluntary or 
involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Mutual 
Company.
    Section 8. Amendment. Adoption of any preapproved charter amendment 
shall be effective after such preapproved amendment has been approved by 
the members at a legal meeting. Any other amendment, addition, change, 
or repeal of this charter must be approved by the Office prior to 
approval by the members at a legal meeting and shall be effective upon 
filing with the Office in accordance with regulatory procedures.

 Attest:________________________________________________________________
      Secretary of the Association

 By:____________________________________________________________________
      President or Chief Executive Officer of the Association

 Attest:________________________________________________________________
      Secretary of the Office of Thrift Supervision

 Effective Date:________________________________________________________

    (2) Charter amendments. The rules and regulations set forth in 
Sec. 544.2 of this chapter regarding charter amendments and reissuances 
of charters (including delegations and filing instructions) shall be 
applicable to mutual holding companies to the same extent as if mutual 
holding companies were Federal mutual savings associations, except that, 
with respect to the pre-approved charter amendments set forth in 
Sec. 544.2 of this chapter, Secs. 544.2(b)(1) and (b)(3) of this chapter 
shall not apply to mutual holding companies, and mutual holding 
companies changing their corporate title pursuant to Sec. 544.2(b)(2) of 
this chapter shall be required to comply with Sec. 575.9(a)(3) of this 
part as well as Sec. 543.1(b) of this chapter.
    (3) Corporate title. The corporate title of each mutual holding 
company shall include the term ``mutual'' or the abbreviation ``M.H.C.''
    (4) Bylaws. The rules and regulations set forth in Sec. 544.5 of 
this chapter regarding bylaws (including their content, any amendments 
thereto, delegations, and filing instructions) shall be applicable to 
mutual holding companies to the same extent as if mutual holding 
companies were federal mutual savings associations. The model bylaws for 
Federal mutual savings associations set forth in the OTS Applications 
Processing Handbook shall also serve as the model bylaws for mutual 
holding companies, except that the term ``association'' each time it 
appears therein shall be replaced with the term ``Mutual Company''; 
section 11(e) (extending leniency to borrowing members) and section 
11(f) (rejection of applications for accounts or membership) shall be 
removed and the remaining paragraphs of section 12 redesignated 
accordingly.
    (5) Availability of charter and bylaws. A mutual holding company 
shall make available to its members at all times in the offices of each 
subsidiary savings association from which the mutual holding company 
draws members a true copy of its charter and bylaws, including any 
amendments, and shall deliver such a copy to any member upon request. 
Mutual holding companies shall also be subject to the provisions of 
Sec. 544.8 of this chapter.
    (b) Charters and bylaws of subsidiary savings associations of mutual 
holding companies. Except as specified otherwise by the OTS in any 
notice of intent not to disapprove a mutual holding company 
reorganization or in any regulation or order, each subsidiary savings 
association of a mutual holding company shall be subject to the same 
rules and regulations regarding charters and bylaws as are applicable to 
stock savings associations that are chartered by the OTS, 12 CFR part 
552, or by the appropriate state chartering authority, as the case may 
be, provided that the charter of each resulting association, each 
acquiree association, and each mutual savings association that is 
acquired by a mutual holding company shall contain the provision set 
forth below:

In any situation in which the priority of the accounts of the 
association is in controversy, all such accounts shall, to the extent of 
their

[[Page 407]]

withdrawable value, be debts of the association having at least as high 
a priority as the claims of general creditors of the association not 
having priority (other than any priority arising or resulting from 
consensual subordination) over other general creditors of the 
association.

    (c) Approval of charters and bylaws of mutual holding companies and 
their savings association subsidiaries in connection with Reorganization 
Plans--(1) Issuance by the OTS of a notice of intent not to disapprove a 
reorganization pursuant to Sec. 575.3(b) of this part, or failure by the 
OTS to disapprove such a reorganization within the time prescribed in 
Sec. 575.3(b) of this part, shall be deemed to constitute:
    (i) Approval pursuant to Sec. 575.3(d) of this part and this section 
for the reorganizing association to amend its charter and bylaws in 
their entirety to read in the form of the mutual holding company charter 
and bylaws proposed in the Reorganization Notice (as modified by any 
conditions imposed by the OTS in its notice of intent not to disapprove 
or paragraph (c)(2) of this section and subject to paragraph (c)(5) of 
this section);
    (ii) If the Reorganization Plan provides that the resulting 
association is to be federally chartered, approval pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 
1464 (a) and (e) and Secs. 552.2-1 and 552.2-2 of this chapter of the 
organization of the resulting association and the proposed charter and 
bylaws of such association (as modified by any conditions imposed by the 
OTS in its notice of intent not to disapprove or by paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section and subject to paragraph (c)(5) of this section); and
    (iii) If the Reorganization Plan provides that the acquiree 
association is to be federally chartered, approval pursuant to 
Sec. 552.4 of this chapter of the amendment of the existing charter of 
the acquiree association in its entirety to read in the form of the 
proposed charter and bylaws of such association (as modified by any 
conditions imposed by the OTS in its notice of intent not to disapprove 
or paragraph (c)(2) of this section and subject to paragraph (c)(5) of 
this section).
    (2) In the event the charter and bylaws of a mutual holding company 
and of any federally-chartered resulting association or acquiree 
association are approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
due to failure of the OTS to disapprove a Reorganization Notice within 
the time prescribed in Sec. 575.3(b) of this part, such approval shall 
be subject to the condition that such charter(s) and bylaws shall 
conform in every particular to the model charter(s) and bylaws for 
mutual holding companies and/or federal stock savings associations, as 
the case may be, as set forth in the OTS's regulations.
    (3) Promptly after approval of the amendment of the charter of a 
reorganizing association to read in the form of a mutual holding company 
charter pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the OTS shall 
issue an executed copy of such charter to the reorganizing association. 
Such charter shall not become effective until consummation of the 
Reorganization Plan, at which point in time it shall replace and nullify 
the charter of the reorganizing association. The charter of the 
reorganizing association shall be surrendered to the OTS within five 
days after consummation of the Reorganization Plan. If the 
Reorganization Plan is terminated for any reason, the charter of the 
mutual holding company shall become immediately null and void and shall 
be returned to the OTS within five days.
    (4) Promptly after approval of any federal charter for a resulting 
association pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section or approval of 
the amendment of any federal charter of an acquiree association pursuant 
to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the OTS shall issue an executed 
copy of such charter(s) to the reorganizing association and/or the 
acquiree association, as the case may be.
    (i) Prior to consummation of the Reorganization Plan, the resulting 
association (whether chartered under federal or state law) shall 
constitute an interim savings association subsidiary of the reorganizing 
association and shall not accept any deposits or engage in any other 
business activities except for those activities necessary to consummate 
the Reorganization Plan. If the Reorganization Plan is terminated for 
any reason, the charter of the resulting association shall immediately

[[Page 408]]

become null and void and, if the resulting association is federally 
chartered, the charter shall be returned to the OTS within five days.
    (ii) Any amended charter issued to an acquiree association (whether 
by the OTS or the appropriate state authority) shall not become 
effective until consummation of the Reorganization Plan, at which point 
in time it shall replace and nullify the prior charter of the acquiree 
association. The prior charter of any federally-chartered acquiree 
association shall be surrendered to the OTS within five days after 
consummation of the Reorganization Plan. If the Reorganization Plan is 
terminated for any reason, the amended charter of the acquiree 
association shall become immediately null and void and, if the acquiree 
association is federally chartered, the amended charter shall be 
returned to the OTS within five days.
    (5) Approval of the amendment of the charter and bylaws of the 
reorganizing association to read in the form of the charter and bylaws 
of a mutual holding company and of any acquiree association to read in 
the form of a stock association and approval of the organization of any 
resulting association and of its charter and bylaws pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be subject to any conditions 
subsequent that the OTS may impose in connection therewith or with its 
notice of intent not to disapprove the reorganization.

    (5) Non-controlling acquisitions of savings association stock. A

    (6) Other corporations. A mutual holding company may acquire control 
of, and make non-controlling investments in the stock of, any

Sec. 575.11  Operating restrictions.

    (a) Activities restrictions. A mutual holding company may engage in 
any business activity specified in 12 U.S.C. 1467a (c)(2)(A) or 
(c)(2)(C)-(c)(2)(G). In addition, the business activities of 
subsidiaries of mutual holding companies may include the activities 
specified in Sec. 575.10(a)(6) of this part. A mutual holding company or 
its subsidiaries may engage in the foregoing activities only upon 
compliance with the procedures specified in Secs. 584.2-1(c) or 584.2-
2(b) of this chapter.
    (b) Pledging stock--(1) No mutual holding company may pledge the 
stock of its resulting association, an acquiree association, or any 
subsidiary savings association that was in the mutual

[[Page 410]]

form when acquired by the mutual holding company unless the proceeds of 
the loan secured by the pledge are infused into the association whose 
stock is pledged. Any amount of the stock of such association may be 
pledged for this purpose. Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to 
prohibit:
    (i) The payment of dividends from a subsidiary savings association 
to its mutual holding company parent to the extent otherwise 
permissible; or
    (ii) A mutual holding company from pledging the stock of more than 
one savings association subsidiary provided that the stock pledged of 
each such subsidiary association is proportionate to the proceeds of the 
loan infused into each subsidiary association.
    (2) Within ten days after any pledge of stock pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, a mutual holding company shall provide written 
notice to the OTS regarding the terms of the transaction (including the 
amount of principal and interest, repayment terms, maturity date, the 
nature and amount of collateral, and the terms governing seizure of the 
collateral) and shall include in such notice a certification that the 
proceeds of the loan have been transferred to the subsidiary savings 
association whose stock has been pledged.
    (3) Any mutual holding company that fails to make any payment on a 
loan secured by the pledge of stock pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section on or before the date on which such payment is due shall, on the 
first day after such payment is due, provide written notice of 
nonpayment to the Regional Director.
    (c) Restrictions on stock repurchases. No subsidiary savings 
association of a mutual holding company that has any stockholders other 
than the association's mutual holding company shall repurchase any share 
of stock within three years of its date of issuance, unless the 
repurchase:
    (1) Is part of a general repurchase made on a pro rata basis 
pursuant to an offer approved by the OTS and made to all stockholders of 
the association (except that the association's mutual holding company 
may be excluded from the repurchase with the OTS's approval);
    (2) Is limited to the repurchase of qualifying shares of a director; 
or
    (3) Is purchased in the open market by a tax-qualified or non-tax-
qualified employee stock benefit plan of the association in an amount 
reasonable and appropriate to fund such plan.
    (d) Restrictions on waiver of dividends. No mutual holding company 
may waive its right to receive any dividend declared by a subsidiary 
unless either:
    (1) No insider of the mutual holding company, associate of an 
insider, or tax-qualified or non-tax-qualified employee stock benefit 
plan of the mutual holding company holds any share of stock in the class 
of stock to which the waiver would apply; or
    (2) The mutual holding company provides the OTS with written notice 
of its intent to waive its right to receive dividends 30 days prior to 
the proposed date of payment of the dividend, and the OTS does not 
object. The OTS shall not object to a notice of intent to waive 
dividends if:
    (i) The waiver would not be detrimental to the safe and sound 
operation of the savings association; and
    (ii) The board of directors of the mutual holding company expressly 
determines that waiver of the dividend by the mutual holding company is 
consistent with the directors' fiduciary duties to the mutual members of 
such company. A dividend waiver notice shall include a copy of the 
resolution of the board of directors of the mutual holding company, in 
form and substance satisfactory to the OTS, together with any supporting 
materials relied upon by the board, concluding that the proposed 
dividend waiver is consistent with the board's fiduciary duties to the 
mutual members of the mutual holding company.
    (e) Restrictions on issuance of stock to insiders. A subsidiary of a 
mutual holding company that is not a savings association may issue stock 
to any insider, associate of an insider or tax-qualified or non-tax-
qualified employee stock benefit plan of the mutual holding company or 
any subsidiary of the mutual holding company, provided that such persons 
or plans provide written notice to the OTS at least 30 days prior to the 
stock issuance. Subsidiary savings associations may issue stock to

[[Page 411]]

such persons only in accordance with Sec. 575.7 of this part.
    (f) Restrictions on indemnification. The provisions of Sec. 545.121 
of this chapter shall apply to mutual holding companies in the same 
manner as if they were federal savings associations.
    (g) Restrictions on employment contracts. The provisions of 
Sec. 563.39 of this chapter and any policies of the OTS thereunder shall 
apply to mutual holding companies in the same manner as if they were 
savings associations.

    (a) Conversion--(1) Generally. A mutual holding company may convert 
to the stock form in accordance with the rules and regulations set forth 
in part 563b of this chapter.
    (2) Exchange of savings association stock. Any stock issued pursuant 
to Sec. 575.7 of this part by a subsidiary savings association of a 
mutual holding company to persons other than the parent mutual holding 
company may be exchanged for the stock issued by the mutual holding 
company in connection with the conversion of the holding company to 
stock form provided that the holding company and the subsidiary savings 
association demonstrate to the satisfaction of the OTS that the basis 
for the exchange is fair and reasonable.
    (b) Involuntary liquidation--(1) The OTS may file a petition with 
the federal bankruptcy courts requesting the liquidation of a mutual 
holding company pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1467a(o)(9) and title 11, United 
States Code, upon the occurrence of any of the following events:
    (i) The default of the resulting association, any acquiree 
association, or any subsidiary savings association of the mutual holding 
company that was in the mutual form when acquired by the mutual holding 
company;
    (ii) The default of the mutual holding company; or
    (iii) Foreclosure on any pledge by the mutual holding company of 
subsidiary savings association stock pursuant to Sec. 575.11(b) of this 
part.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the net 
proceeds of any liquidation of any mutual holding company shall be 
transferred to the members of the mutual holding company in accordance 
with the charter of the mutual holding company.
    (3) If the FDIC incurs a loss as a result of the default of any 
savings association subsidiary of a mutual holding company and that 
mutual holding company is liquidated pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section, the FDIC shall succeed to the membership interests of the 
depositors of such savings association in the mutual holding company, to 
the extent of the FDIC's loss.
    (c) Voluntary liquidation. The provisions of Sec. 546.4 of this 
chapter shall apply to mutual holding companies in the same manner as if

<R05>
Sec. 575.13  Procedural requirements.

    (a) Proxies and proxy statements--(1) Solicitation of proxies. The 
provisions of Secs. 563b.5 and 563b.6 of this chapter (exclusive of 
Sec. 563b.6(c)(2)(iii), (d), and (e)) shall apply to all solicitations 
of proxies by any person in connection with any membership vote required 
under this part. All proxy materials utilized in connection with such 
solicitations shall be authorized for use by the OTS and shall be in the 
form and contain the information specified in Sec. 563b.5(d) of this 
chapter and Form PS, 12 CFR 563b.101, to the extent such information is 
relevant to the action that members are being asked to approve, with 
such additions, deletions, and other modifications as are necessary or 
appropriate under the disclosure standard set forth in Sec. 563b.5(g) of 
this chapter. Proxies and proxy statements shall be filed in accordance 
with Sec. 563b.5(e) of this chapter and shall be addressed to the 
Corporate and Securities Division, Chief Counsel's Office, Office of 
Thrift Supervision, at the address set forth in Sec. 516.1(a) of this 
chapter. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(1), the term conversion as 
it appears in the provisions

[[Page 412]]

of part 563b of this chapter cited above in this paragraph (a)(1) shall 
be deemed to refer to the reorganization or the stock issuance, as 
appropriate.
    (2) Additional proxy disclosure requirements. In addition to all 
disclosure required by Form PS, all proxies requesting accountholder 
approval of a mutual holding company reorganization shall address in 
detail:
    (i) The reasons for the reorganization, including the relative 
advantages and disadvantages of undertaking the transaction proposed 
instead of a standard conversion;
    (ii) Whether management believes the reorganization is in the best 
interests of the association and its accountholders and the basis of 
that belief;
    (iii) The fiduciary duties owed to accountholders by the 
association's officers and directors and why the reorganization is in 
accord with those duties and is otherwise equitable to the 
accountholders and the association;
    (iv) Any compensation agreements that will be entered into by 
management in connection with the reorganization; and
    (v) Whether the mutual holding company intends to waive dividends, 
the implications to accountholders, and the reasons such waivers are 
consistent with the fiduciary duties of the directors of the mutual 
holding company.
    (3) Nonconforming minority stock issuances. Savings associations 
proposing non-conforming minority stock issuances pursuant to 
Sec. 575.7(d)(6)(ii)(2) of this part must include in the proxy materials 
to accountholders seeking approval of a proposed reorganization an 
additional disclosure statement that serves as a cover sheet that 
clearly addresses:
    (i) The consequences to accountholders of voting to approve a 
reorganization in which their subscription rights are prioritized 
differently and potentially eliminated; and
    (ii) Any intent by the mutual holding company to waive dividends, 
and the implications to accountholders.
    (4) Use of ``running'' proxies. A mutual savings association or 
mutual holding company may make use of any proxy conferring general 
authority to vote on any and all matters at any meeting of members, 
provided that the member granting such proxy has been furnished a proxy 
statement regarding the matters and the member does not grant a later-
dated proxy to vote at the meeting at which the matter will be 
considered or attend such meeting and vote in person, and further 
provided that ``running'' proxies or similar proxies may not be used to 
vote for a mutual holding company reorganization, mutual-to-stock 
conversion undertaken either by a mutual savings association or a mutual 
holding company or any other material transaction. Subject to the 
limitations set forth in this paragraph, any proxy conferring on the 
board of directors or officers of a mutual savings association general 
authority to cast a member's votes on any and all matters presented to 
the members shall be deemed to cover the member's votes as a member of 
the mutual holding company and such authority shall be conferred on the 
board of directors or officers of a mutual holding company.
    (b) Applications pursuant this part. Except as provided in paragraph 
(c) of this section, any application, notice or certification required 
to be filed with the OTS pursuant to this part shall be filed in 
accordance with Sec. 516.1 of this chapter.
    (c) Reorganization Notices and stock issuance applications--(1) 
Contents. Each Reorganization Notice submitted to the OTS pursuant to 
Sec. 575.3(b) of this part and each application for approval of the 
issuance of stock submitted to the OTS pursuant to Sec. 575.7(a) of this 
part shall be in the form and contain the information specified by the 
OTS.
    (2) Filing instructions. Any Reorganization Notice submitted 
pursuant to Sec. 575.3(b) of this part shall be filed in accordance with 
Sec. 516.1 of this chapter. Any stock issuance application submitted 
pursuant to Sec. 575.7(a) of this part shall be filed in accordance with 
Sec. 563b.8 of this chapter.
    (3) Public notice, agency reports, and related matters. (i) Sections 
563.22(e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3), and (e)(4) of this chapter shall apply to 
all mutual holding company reorganizations.

    (b) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall apply to

prior to April l, 1983) on which the state adopts a law or certifies 
that the voters of such state have voted in favor of any law, 
constitutional or otherwise, which states explicitly and by its terms 
that such state does not want the provisions of paragraph (a) of this 
section to apply with respect to loans made in such state, except that--

<R05>
Sec. 590.4  Consumer protection rules for federally-related loans, mortgages, credit sales and advances secured by first liens on residential mobile homes.

    (a) Definitions. As used in this section:
    (1) Prepayment. A ``prepayment'' occurs upon--
    (i) Refinancing or consolidation of the indebtedness;
    (ii) Actual prepayment of the indebtedness by the debtor, whether 
voluntarily or following acceleration of the payment obligation by the 
creditor; or
    (iii) The entry of a judgment for the indebtedness in favor of the 
creditor.
    (2) Actuarial method. The term actuarial method means the method of 
allocating payments made on a debt between the outstanding balance of 
the obligation and the finance charge pursuant to which a payment is 
applied first to the accumulated finance charge and any remainder is 
subtracted from, or any deficiency is added to, the outstanding balance 
of the obligation.
    (3) Precomputed Finance Charge. The term precomputed finance charge 
means interest or a time/price differential as computed by the add-on or 
discount method. Precomputed finance charges do not include loan fees, 
points, finder's fees, or similar charges.

[[Page 426]]

    (4) Creditor. The term creditor means any entity covered by this 
part, including those which regularly extend or arrange for the 
extension of credit and assignees that are creditors under section 
501(a)(1)(C)(v) of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary 
Control Act of 1980.
    (b) General. (1) The provisions of the constitution or the laws of 
any state expressly limiting the rate or amount of interest, discount 
points, finance charges, or other charges which may be charged, taken, 
received, or reserved shall not apply to any loan, mortgage, credit 
sale, or advance which is secured by a first lien on a residential 
mobile home if a creditor covered by this part complies with the 
consumer protection regulations of this section.
    (2) Relation to state law. (i) In making loans or credit sales 
subject to this section, creditors shall comply with state and Federal 
law in accordance with the following:
    (A) State law regulating matters not covered by this section. When 
state law regulating matters not covered by this section is otherwise 
applicable to a loan or credit sale subject to this section, creditors 
shall comply with such state law provisions.
    (B) State law regulating matters covered by this section. Creditors 
need comply only with the provisions of this section, unless the Office 
determines that an otherwise applicable state law regulating matters 
covered by this section provides greater protection to consumers. Such 
determinations shall be published in the Federal Register and shall 
operate prospectively.
    (ii) Any interested party may petition the Office for a 
determination that state law requirements are more protective of 
consumers than the provisions of this section. Petitions shall be sent 
to: Secretary to the Office of Thrift Supervision, 1700 G Street, NW., 
Washington, DC 20552, and shall include:
    (A) A copy of the state law to be considered;
    (B) Copies of any relevant judicial, regulatory, or administrative 
interpretations of the state law; and
    (C) An opinion or memorandum from the state Attorney General or 
other appropriate state official having primary enforcement 
responsibilities for the subject state law provision, indicating how the 
state law to be considered offers greater protection to consumers than 
the Office's regulation.
    (c) Refund of precomputed finance charge. In the event the entire 
indebtedness is prepaid, the unearned portion of the precomputed finance 
charge shall be refunded to the debtor. This refund shall be in an 
amount not less than the amount which would be refunded if the unearned 
precomputed finance charge were calculated in accordance with the 
actuarial method, except that the debtor shall not be entitled to a 
refund which, is less than one dollar. The unearned portion of the 
precomputed finance charge is, at the option of the creditor, either:
    (1) That portion of the precomputed finance charge which is 
allocable to all unexpired payment periods as originally scheduled, or 
if deferred, as deferred. A payment period shall be deemed unexpired if 
prepayment is made within 15 days after the payment period's scheduled 
due date. The unearned precomputed finance charge is the total of that 
which would have been earned for each such period had the loan not been 
precomputed, by applying to unpaid balances of principal, according to 
the actuarial method, an annual percentage rate based on those charges 
which are considered precomputed finance charges in this section, 
assuming that all payments were made as originally scheduled, or as 
deferred, if deferred. The creditor, at its option, may round this 
annual percentage rate to the nearest one-quarter of one percent; or
    (2) The total precomputed finance charge less the earned precomputed 
finance charge. The earned precomputed finance charge shall be 
determined by applying an annual percentage rate based on the total 
precomputed finance charge (as that term is defined in this section), 
under the actuarial method, to the unpaid balances for the actual time 
those balances were unpaid up to the date of prepayment. If a late 
charge or deferral fee has been collected, it shall be treated as a 
payment.

[[Page 427]]

    (d) Prepayment penalties. A debtor may prepay in full or in part the 
unpaid balance of the loan at any time without penalty. The right to 
prepay shall be disclosed in the loan contract in type larger than that 
used for the body of the document.
    (e) Balloon payments--(1) Federal savings associations. Federal 
savings association creditors may enter into agreements with debtors 
which provide for non-amortized and partially-amortized loans on 
residential manufactured homes, and such loans shall be governed by the 
provisions of this section and Sec. 560.220 of this chapter.
    (2) Other creditors. All other creditors may enter into agreements 
with debtors which provide for non-amortized and partially-amortized 
loans on residential manufactured homes to the extent authorized by 
applicable Federal or state law or regulation.
    (f) Late charges. (1) No late charge may be assessed, imposed, or 
collected unless provided for by written contract between the creditor 
and debtor.
    (2) To the extent that applicable state law does not provide for a 
longer period of time, no late charge may be collected on an installment 
which is paid in full on or before the 15th day after its scheduled or 
deferred due date even though an earlier maturing installment or a late 
charge on an earlier installment may not have been paid in full. For 
purposes of assessing late charges, payments received are deemed to be 
applied first to current installments.
    (3) A late charge may be imposed only once on an installment; 
however, no such charge may be collected for a late installment which 
has been deferred.
    (4) To the extent that applicable state law does not provide for a 
lower charge or longer grace period, a late charge on any installment 
not paid in full on or before the 15th day after its scheduled or 
deferred due date may not exceed the lesser of $5.00 or five percent of 
the unpaid amount of the installment.
    (5) If, at any time after imposition of a late charge, the lender 
provides the borrower with written notice regarding amounts claimed to 
be due but unpaid, the notice shall separately state the total of all 
late charges claimed.
    (6) Interest after the final scheduled maturity date may not exceed 
the maximum rate otherwise allowable under State law for such contracts, 
and if such interest is charged, no separate late charge may be made on 
the final scheduled installment.
    (g) Deferral fees. (1) With respect to mobile home credit 
transactions containing precomputed finance charges, agreements 
providing for deferral of all or part of one or more installments shall 
be in writing, signed by the parties, and
    (i) Provide, to the extent that applicable state law does not 
provide for a lower charge, for a charge not exceeding one percent of 
each installment or part thereof for each month from the date when such 
installment was due to the date when it is agreed to become payable and 
proportionately for a part of each month, counting each day as 1/30th of 
a month;
    (ii) Incorporate by reference the transaction to which the deferral 
applied;
    (iii) Disclose each installment or part thereof in the amount to be 
deferred, the date or dates originally payable, and the date or dates 
agreed to become payable: and
    (iv) Set forth the fact of the deferral charge, the dollar amount of 
the charge for each installment to be deferred, and the total dollar 
amount to be paid by the debtor for the privilege of deferring payment.
    (2) No term of a writing executed by the debtor shall constitute 
authority for a creditor unilaterally to grant a deferral with respect 
to which a charge is to be imposed or collected.
    (3) The deferral period is that period of time in which no payment 
is required or made by reason of the deferral.
    (4) Payments received with respect to deferred installments shall be 
deemed to be applied first to deferred installments.
    (5) A charge may not be collected for the deferral of an installment 
or any part thereof if, with respect to that installment, a refinancing 
or consolidation agreement is concluded by the

[[Page 428]]

parties, or a late charge has been imposed or collected, unless such 
late charge is refunded to the borrower or credited to the deferral 
charge.
    (h) Notice before repossession, foreclosure, or acceleration. (1) 
Except in the case of abandonment or other extreme circumstances, no 
action to repossess or foreclose, or to accelerate payment of the entire 
outstanding balance of the obligation, may be taken against the debtor 
until 30 days after the creditor sends the debtor a notice of default in 
the form set forth in paragraph (h)(2) of this section. Such notice 
shall be sent by registered or certified mail with return receipt 
requested. In the case of default on payments, the sum stated in the 
notice may only include payments in default and applicable late or 
deferral charges. If the debtor cures the default within 30 days of the 
postmark of the notice and subsequently defaults a second time, the 
creditor shall again give notice as described in this paragraph (h)(1). 
The debtor is not entitled to notice of default more than twice in any 
one-year period.
    (2) The notice in the following form shall state the nature of the 
default, the action the debtor must take to cure the default, the 
creditor's intended actions upon failure of the debtor to cure the 
default, and the debtor's right to redeem under state law.

Sec. 590.100  Status of Interpretations issued under Public Law 96-161.

    The Office continues to adhere to the views expressed in the formal 
Interpretations issued under the authority of section 105(c) of Pub. L. 
96-161, 93 Stat. 1233 (l979). These interpretations, which relate to the 
temporary preemption of state interest ceilings contained in Pub. L. 96-
161, may be found at 45 FR 2840 (Jan. 15, 1980); 45 FR 6165 (Jan. 25, 
1980); 45 FR 8000 (Feb. 6, 1980); 45 FR 15921 (Mar. 12, 1980).


<R05>
Sec. 590.101  State criminal usury statutes.

    (a) Section 501 provides that ``the provisions of the constitution 
or laws of any state expressly limiting the rate or amount of interest, 
discount points, finance charges, or other charges shall not apply to 
any'' federally-related loan secured by a first lien on residential real 
property, a residential manufactured home, or all the stock allocated to 
a dwelling unit in a residential housing cooperative. 12 U.S.C. 1735f-7 
note (Supp. IV 1980). The question has arisen as to whether the federal 
statute preempts a state law which deems it a criminal offense to charge 
interest at a rate in excess of that specified in the state law.
    (b) In the Office's view, section 501 preempts all state laws which 
expressly limit the rate or amount of interest chargeable on a 
federally-related residential first mortgage. It does not matter whether 
the statute in question imposes criminal or civil sanctions; section 
501, by its terms, preempts ``any'' state law which imposes a ceiling on 
interest rates. The wording of the federal statute clearly expresses an 
intent to displace all direct state law restraints on interest. Any 
state law that

[[Page 429]]

conflicts with this Congressional purpose must yield.

prohibition terminated under state law or October 15, 1982.

fifteen days after written request by the lender, the successor or 
transferee of the borrower fails to provide information requested by the 
lender pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(i) or (d)(1)(ii) of this section, to 
determine whether such successor or transferee of the borrower meets the 
lender's customary credit standards.
    (3) The lender shall, within thirty days of receipt of a completed 
credit

application and any other related information provided by the successor 
or transferee of the borrower, determine whether such successor or 
transferee meets the customary credit standards of the lender and 
provide written notice to the successor or transferee of its decision, 
and the reasons in the event of a disapproval. Failure of the lender to 
provide such notice shall preclude the lender from exercise of its due-
on-sale clause upon the sale or transfer of the property securing the 
loan.
    (4) The lender's right to exercise a due-on-sale clause pursuant to 
this paragraph (d)(4) is in addition to any other rights afforded the 
lender by state law regulating window-period loans with regard to the 
exercise of due-on-sale clauses and loan assumptions.


<R05>
Sec. 591.5  Limitation on exercise of due-on-sale clauses.

    (a) General. Except as provided in Sec. 591.4 (c) and (d)(4) of this 
part, due-on-sale practices of Federal savings associations and other 
lenders shall be governed exclusively by the Office's regulations, in 
preemption of and without regard to any limitations imposed by state law 
on either their inclusion or exercise including, without limitation, 
state law prohibitions against restraints on alienation, prohibitions 
against penalties and forfeitures, equitable restrictions and state law 
dealing with equitable transfers.
    (b) Specific limitations. With respect to any loan on the security 
of a home occupied or to be occupied by the borrower,
    (1) A lender shall not (except with regard to a reverse mortgage) 
exercise its option pursuant to a due-on-sale clause upon:
    (i) The creation of a lien or other encumbrance subordinate to the 
lender's security instrument which does not relate to a transfer of 
rights of occupancy in the property: Provided, That such lien or 
encumbrance is not created pursuant to a contract for deed;
    (ii) The creation of a purchase-money security interest for 
household appliances;
    (iii) A transfer by devise, descent, or operation of law on the 
death of a joint tenant or tenant by the entirety;
    (iv) The granting of a leasehold interest which has a term of three 
years or less and which does not contain an option to purchase (that is, 
either a lease of more than three years or a lease with an option to 
purchase will allow the exercise of a due-on-sale clause);
    (v) A transfer, in which the transferee is a person who occupies or 
will occupy the property, which is:
    (A) A transfer to a relative resulting from the death of the 
borrower;
    (B) A transfer where the spouse or child(ren) becomes an owner of 
the property; or
    (C) A transfer resulting from a decree of dissolution of marriage, 
legal separation agreement, or from an incidental property settlement 
agreement by which the spouse becomes an owner of the property; or
    (vi) A transfer into an inter vivos trust in which the borrower is 
and remains the beneficiary and occupant of the property, unless, as a 
condition precedent to such transfer, the borrower refuses to provide 
the lender with reasonable means acceptable to the lender by which the 
lender will be assured of timely notice of any subsequent transfer of 
the beneficial interest or change in occupancy.
    (2) A lender shall not impose a prepayment penalty or equivalent fee 
when the lender or party acting on behalf of the lender
    (i) Declares by written notice that the loan is due pursuant to a 
due-on-sale clause or
    (ii) Commences a judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceeding to 
enforce a due-on-sale clause or to seek payment in full as a result of 
invoking such clause.
    (3) A lender shall not impose a prepayment penalty or equivalent fee 
when the lender or party acting on behalf of the lender fails to approve 
within 30 days the completed credit application of a qualified 
transferee of the security property to assume the loan in accordance 
with the terms of the loan, and thereafter the borrower transfers the 
security property to such transferee and prepays the loan in full within 
120 days after receipt by the lender

[[Page 433]]

of the completed credit application. For purposes of this paragraph 
(b)(3), a qualified transferee is a person who qualifies for the loan 
under the lender's applicable underwriting standards and who occupies or 
will occupy the security property.
    (4) A lender waives its option to exercise a due-on-sale clause as 
to a specific transfer if, before the transfer, the lender and the 
existing borrower's prospective successor in interest agree in writing 
that the successor in interest will be obligated under the terms of the 
loan and that interest on sums secured by the lender's security interest 
will be payable at a rate the lender shall request. Upon such agreement 
and resultant waiver, a lender shall release the existing borrower from 
all obligations under the loan instruments, and the lender is deemed to 
have made a new loan to the existing borrower's successor in interest. 
The waiver and release apply to all loans secured by homes occupied by 
borrowers made by a Federal savings association after July 31, 1976, and 
to all loans secured by homes occupied by borrowers made by other 
lenders after the effective date of this regulation.
    (5) Nothing in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be construed 
to restrict a lender's right to enforce a due-on-sale clause upon the 
subsequent occurrence of any event which disqualifies a transfer for a 
previously-applicable exception under that paragraph (b)(1).
    (c) Policy considerations. Paragraph (b) of this section does not 
prohibit a lender from requiring, as a condition to an assumption, 
continued maintenance of mortgage insurance by the existing borrower's 
successor in interest, whether by endorsement of the existing policy or 
by entrance into a new contract of insurance.
