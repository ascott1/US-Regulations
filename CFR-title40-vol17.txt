                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2003), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

<R05>
Sec. 86.603-88  Test orders.

    (a) The Administrator will require any testing under this subpart by 
means of a test order addressed to the manufacturer.
    (b) The test order will be signed by the Assistant Administrator for 
Air and Radiation or his designee. The test order will be delivered in 
person by an EPA Enforcement Officer to a company representative or sent 
by registered mail, return receipt requested, to the manufacturer's 
representative who signs the Application for Certification submitted by 
the manufacturer pursuant to the requirements of the applicable sections 
of subpart A of this part. Upon receipt of a test order, the 
manufacturer shall comply with all of the provisions of this subpart and 
instructions in the test order.
    (c)(1) The test order will specify the vehicle configuration 
selected for testing, the time and location at which vehicles must be 
selected, and the procedure by which vehicles of the specified 
configuration must be selected. The test order may specify the number of 
vehicles to be selected per day and may include alternative 
configurations (primary, secondary, etc.) to be selected for testing in 
the event that vehicles of the first specified configuration are not 
available for testing because those vehicles are not being manufactured 
at the specified assembly plant, not being manufactured during the 
specified time, or not being stored at the specified assembly plant or 
associated storage facility. If total production of the specified 
vehicle configuration is less than the number specified in the test 
order, the manufacturer will select the actual number of vehicles 
produced per day. If the first specified configuration is not being 
manufactured at a rate of at least four vehicles per day over the 
expected duration of the audit, the Assistant Administrator for Air and 
Radiation or his designated representative may select vehicles of a 
primary alternate configuration for testing in lieu of the first 
specified configuration. Likewise, vehicles of a secondary alternate 
configuration may be selected in lieu of vehicles of the first specified 
configuration or primary alternate configuration. In addition, the test 
order may include other directions or information essential to the 
administration of the required testing.
    (2) The following instructions are applicable to each test order 
issued under this subpart:
    (i) The manufacturer shall make the following documents available to 
an EPA Enforcement Officer upon request:
    (A) A properly filed and current Application for Certification 
following

[[Page 13]]

the format prescribed by the EPA for the appropriate model year; and
    (B) A copy of the shop manual, dealer service bulletins, and pre-
delivery inspection procedures for the configuration being tested.
    (ii) Only one mechanic at a time per vehicle shall make authorized 
checks, adjustments, or repairs, unless a particular check, adjustment, 
or repair requires a second mechanic as indicated in the shop manual or 
dealer service bulletins.
    (iii) A mechanic shall not perform any check, adjustment, or repair 
without an Enforcement Officer present unless otherwise authorized.
    (iv) The manufacturer shall utilize only those tools and test 
equipment utilized by its dealers when performing authorized checks, 
adjustments, or repairs.
    (d) A manufacturer may indicate preferred assembly plants for the 
various engine families produced by the manufacturer for selection of 
vehicles in response to a test order. This shall be accomplished by 
submitting a list of engine families and the corresponding assembly 
plants from which the manufacturer desires to have vehicles selected to 
the Administrator. In order that a manufacturer's preferred location for 
issuance of a test order for a configuration of a particular engine 
family be considered, the list must be submitted prior to issuance of 
the test order. Notwithstanding the fact that a manufacturer has 
submitted the above list, the Administrator may, upon making the 
determination that evidence exists indicating noncompliance at other 
than the manufacturer's preferred plant, order testing at such other 
plant where vehicles of the configuration specified in the test order 
are assembled.
    (e) During a given model year, the Administrator shall not issue to 
a manufacturer more SEA test orders than an annual limit determined by 
dividing the projected sales bound for the U.S. market for that model 
year, as made by the manufacturer in its report submitted under 
paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 600.207-80 of the Automobile Fuel Economy 
Regulations, by 300,000 and rounding to the nearest whole number, unless 
the projected sales are less than 150,000, in which case the annual 
limit is one. However, the annual limit for SEA test orders will be 
recalculated if a manufacturer submits to EPA in writing prior to or 
during the model year a sales projection update.
    (1) Any SEA test order for which the configuration fails in 
accordance with Sec. 86.610 or for which testing is not completed does 
not count against the annual limit.
    (2) When the annual limit has been met, the Administrator may issue 
additional test orders for those configurations for which evidence 
exists indicating noncompliance. An SEA test order issued on this basis 
will include a statement as to the reason for its issuance.

hours warm-up for the CO, CO<INF>2</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF> analyzers. 
(Power is normally left on infrared and chemiluminescent analyzers. When 
not in use, the chopper motors of the infrared analyzers are turned off 
and the phototube high voltage supply to the

[[Page 19]]

chemiluminescent analyzers is placed in the standby position.)
    (B) The manufacturer shall exercise care to prevent moisture from 
condensing in the sample collection bags.
    (viii) The manufacturer need not comply with Sec. 86.142, since the 
records required therein are provided under other provisions of subpart 
G of this part.
    (ix) In addition to the requirements of subpart B of this part, the 
manufacturer shall prepare gasoline-fueled vehicles as follows prior to 
exhaust emission testing:
    (A) The manufacturer shall inspect the fuel system to insure the 
absence of any leaks of liquid or vapor to the atmosphere by applying a 
pressure of 14.5<plus-minus>0.5 inches of water to the fuel system, 
allowing the pressure to stabilize, and isolating the fuel system from 
the pressure source. Following isolation of the fuel system, pressure 
must not drop more than 2.0 inches of water in 5 minutes. If required, 
the manufacturer shall perform corrective action in accordance with 
paragraph Sec. 86.608(d) and report this action in accordance with 
paragraph Sec. 86.609(d).
    (B) When performing this pressure check, the manufacturer shall 
exercise care to neither purge nor load the evaporative emission control 
system.
    (C) The manufacturer shall not modify the test vehicle's evaporative 
emission control system by component addition, deletion, or 
substitution, except to comply with paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section 
if approved in advance by the Administrator.
    (b)(1) The manufacturer shall not adjust, repair, prepare, or modify 
the vehicles selected for testing and shall not perform any emission 
tests on vehicles selected for testing pursuant to the test order unless 
this adjustment, repair, preparation, modification, and/or tests are 
documented in the manufacturer's vehicle assembly and inspection 
procedures and are actually performed or unless these adjustments and/or 
tests are required or permitted under this subpart or are approved in 
advance by the Administrator.
    (2) For 1981 and later model years the Administrator may adjust or 
cause to be adjusted any engine or vehicle parameter which the 
Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment for new vehicle 
compliance testing (e.g., for certification or Selective Enforcement 
Audit testing) in accordance with Sec. 86.081-22(c)(1), to any setting 
within the physically adjustable range of that parameter, as determined 
by the Administrator in accordance with Sec. 86.081-22(e)(3)(ii), prior 
to the performance of any tests. However, if the idle speed parameter is 
one which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment, 
the Administrator shall not adjust it to a setting which causes a lower 
engine idle speed than will be possible within the physically adjustable 
range of the idle speed parameter on the vehicle when it has accumulated 
4,000 miles, all other parameters being adjusted identically for the 
purpose of comparison. The Administrator, in making or specifying such 
adjustments, will consider the effect of the deviation from the 
manufacturer's recommended setting on emissions performance 
characteristics as well as the likelihood that similar settings will 
occur on in-use light-duty vehicles or light-duty trucks. In determining 
likelihood, the Administrator will consider factors such as, but not 
limited to, the effect of the adjustment on vehicle performance 
characteristics and surveillance information from similar in-use 
vehicles.
    (c) Prior to performing exhaust emission testing on an SEA test 
vehicle, the manufacturer may accumulate on each vehicle a number of 
miles equal to the greater of 4,000 miles, or the number of miles the 
manufacturer accumulated during certification on the emission-data 
vehicle corresponding to the configuration specified in the test order.
    (1) Mileage accumulation must be performed in any manner using good 
engineering judgment to obtain emission results representative of normal 
production vehicles. This mileage accumulation must be consistent with 
the new vehicle break-in instructions contained in the applicable 
vehicle owner's manual, if any.
    (2) The manufacturer shall accumulate mileage at a minimum rate of 
300 miles per vehicle during each 24 hour period, unless otherwise 
provided by the Administrator.

[[Page 20]]

    (i) The first 24 hour period for mileage accumulation shall begin as 
soon as authorized vehicle checks, inspections and preparations are 
completed on each vehicle.
    (ii) The minimum mileage accumulation rate does not apply on 
weekends or holidays.
    (iii) If the manufacturer's mileage accumulation target is less than 
the minimum rate specified (300 miles per day), then the minimum daily 
accumulation rate shall be equal to the manufacturer's mileage 
accumulation target.
    (3) Mileage accumulation shall be completed on a sufficient number 
of test vehicles during consecutive 24 hour periods to assure that the 
number of vehicles tested per day fulfills the requirements of paragraph 
(g) of this section.
    (d) The manufacturer shall not perform any maintenance on test 
vehicles after selection for testing nor shall the Administrator allow 
deletion of any test vehicle from the test sequence, unless requested by 
the manufacturer and approved by the Administrator before any test 
vehicle maintenance or deletion.
    (e) The manufacturer will be allowed 24 hours to ship test vehicles 
from the assembly plant or storage facility to the test facility if the 
test facility is not located at the plant or storage facility or in 
close proximity to the plant or storage facility: Except, That the 
Administrator may approve more time based upon a request by the 
manufacturer accompanied by a satisfactory justification.
    (f) If a vehicle cannot complete the mileage accumulation or 
emission tests because of vehicle malfunction, the manufacturer may 
request the Administrator to authorize the repair of that vehicle or its 
deletion from the test sequence.
    (g) Whenever the manufacturer conducts testing pursuant to a test 
order issued under this subpart, the manufacturer shall notify the 
Administrator within one working day of receipt of the test order, which 
test facility will be used to comply with the test order and the number 
of available test cells at that facility. If no test cells are available 
at the desired facility, the manufacturer must provide alternate testing 
capability satisfactory to the Administrator. The manufacturer shall 
complete emission testing on a minimum of four vehicles per 24 hour 
period including voided tests for each available test cell at his 
testing facility: Except, That the Administrator may approve a longer 
period based upon a request by the manufacturer accompanied by 
satisfactory justification.
    (h) The manufacturer shall perform test vehicle selection, 
preparation, mileage accumulation, shipping, and testing in such a 
manner as to assure that the audit is performed in an expeditious 
manner.
    (i) The manufacturer may retest any test vehicle after a fail 
decision has been reached in accordance with paragraph (d) of 
Sec. 86.610 based on the first test on each vehicle; except, that the 
Administrator may approve retesting at other times during the audit 
based upon a request by the manufacturer accompanied by a satisfactory 
justification. The manufacturer may test each vehicle a total of three 
times. The manufacturer shall test each vehicle the same number of 
times. The manufacturer may accumulate additional mileage on test 
vehicles before conducting retests, subject to the provisions of 
paragraph (c) of this section.

in Sec. 86.131-96(a) with only a single temperature sensor, and may 
drain the test fuel from other than the lowest point of the tank, as 
specified in Sec. 86.131-96(b) and Sec. 86.152-98(a), provided an 
equivalent method is used. Equivalency documentation shall be maintained 
by the

[[Page 26]]

manufacturers and shall be made available to the Administrator upon 
request. Additionally, for any test vehicle that has remained under 
laboratory ambient temperature conditions for at least 6 hours prior to 
testing, the vehicle soak described in Sec. 86.132-96(c) may be 
eliminated upon approval of the Administrator. In such cases, the 
vehicle shall be operated through the preconditioning drive described in 
Sec. 86.132-96(c) immediately following the fuel drain and fill 
procedure described in Sec. 86.132-96(b).
    (iii) The manufacturer may perform additional preconditioning on 
Selective Enforcement Audit test vehicles other than the preconditioning 
specified in Sec. 86.132, or Sec. 86.1773, for vehicles certified to the 
National LEV standards only if the additional preconditioning was 
performed on certification test vehicles of the same configuration.
    (iv) If the Administrator elects to use the evaporative/refueling 
canister preconditioning procedure described in Sec. 86.132-96(k), the 
manufacturer shall perform the heat build procedure 11 to 34 hours 
following vehicle preconditioning rather than according to the time 
period specified in Sec. 86.133-90(a). All references to an evaporative 
emission enclosure and analyzing for HC during the heat build can be 
ignored.
    (v) The manufacturer may substitute slave tires for the drive wheel 
tires on the vehicle as specified in paragraph Sec. 86.135-90(e): 
Provided, that the slave tires are the same size.
    (vi) If the Administrator elects to use the evaporative/refueling 
canister preconditioning procedure described in Sec. 86.132-96(k), the 
cold start exhaust emission test described in Sec. 86.137-96 shall 
follow the heat build procedure described in Sec. 86.133-90 by not more 
than one hour.
    (vii) In performing exhaust sample analysis under Sec. 86.140-94.
    (A) When testing diesel vehicles, or methanol-fueled Otto-cycle 
vehicles, the manufacturer shall allow a minimum of 20 minutes warm-up 
for the HC analyzer, and for diesel vehicles, a minimum of two hours 
warm-up for the CO, CO<INF>2</INF>, and NO<INF>X</INF> analyzers. (Power 
is normally left on infrared and chemiluminescent analyzers. When not in 
use, the chopper motors of the infrared analyzers are turned off and the 
phototube high voltage supply to the chemiluminescent analyzers is 
placed in the standby position.)
    (B) The manufacturer shall exercise care to prevent moisture from 
condensing in the sample collection bags.
    (viii) The manufacturer need not comply with Sec. 86.142, 
Sec. 86.155, or Sec. 86.1775, since the records required therein are 
provided under other provisions of this subpart G.
    (ix) If a manufacturer elects to perform the background 
determination procedure described in paragraph (a)(2)(xi) of this 
section in addition to performing the refueling emissions test 
procedure, the elapsed time between the initial and final FID readings 
shall be recorded, rounded to the nearest second rather than minute as 
described in Sec. 86.154-98(e)(8). In addition, the vehicle soak 
described in Sec. 86.153-98(e) shall be conducted with the windows and 
luggage compartment of the vehicle open.
    (x) The Administrator may elect to perform a seal test, described in 
Sec. 86.153-98(b), of both integrated and non-integrated systems instead 
of the full refueling test. When testing non-integrated systems, an 
manufacturer may conduct the canister purge described in Sec. 86.153-
98(b)(1) directly following the preconditioning drive described in 
Sec. 86.132-96(e) or directly following the exhaust emissions test 
described in Sec. 86.137-96.
    (xi) In addition to the refueling test, a manufacturer may elect to 
perform the following background emissions determination immediately 
prior to the refueling measurement procedure described in Sec. 86.154-
98, provided EPA is notified of this decision prior to the start of 
testing in an SEA.
    (A) The SHED shall be purged for several minutes immediately prior 
to the background determination. Warning: If at any time the 
concentration of hydrocarbons, of methanol, or of methanol and 
hydrocarbons exceeds 15,000 ppm C, the enclosure should be immediately 
purged. This concentration provides a 4:1 safety factor against the lean 
flammability limit.
    (B) The FID (or HFID) hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and 
spanned immediately prior to the background

[[Page 27]]

determination. If not already on, the enclosure mixing fan and the 
spilled fuel mixing blower shall be turned on at this time.
    (C) Place the vehicle in the SHED. The ambient temperature level 
encountered by the test vehicle during the entire background emissions 
determination shall be 80  deg.F <plus-minus>3  deg.F. The windows and 
luggage compartment of the vehicle must be open and the gas cap must be 
secured.
    (D) Seal the SHED. Immediately analyze the ambient concentration of 
hydrocarbons in the SHED and record. This is the initial background 
hydrocarbon concentration.
    (E) Soak the vehicle for ten minutes <plus-minus>1 minute.
    (F) The FID (or HFID) hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and 
spanned immediately prior to the end of the background determination.
    (G) Analyze the ambient concentration of hydrocarbons in the SHED 
and record. This is the final background hydrocarbon concentration.
    (H) The total hydrocarbon mass emitted during the background 
determination is calculated according to Sec. 86.156-98. To obtain a 
per-minute background emission rate, divide the total hydrocarbon mass 
calculated in this paragraph by the duration of the soak, rounded to the 
nearest second, described in paragraph (a)(2)(xi)(G) of this section.
    (I) The background emission rate is multiplied by the duration of 
the refueling measurement obtained in paragraph (a)(2)(ix) of this 
section. This number is then subtracted from the total grams of 
emissions calculated for the refueling test according to Sec. 86.156-
98(a) to obtain the adjusted value for total refueling emissions. The 
final results for comparison with the refueling emission standard shall 
be computed by dividing the adjusted value for total refueling mass 
emissions by the total gallons of fuel dispensed in the refueling test 
as described in Sec. 86.156-98(b).
    (xii) In addition to the requirements of subpart B of this part, the 
manufacturer shall prepare gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled vehicles 
as follows prior to emission testing:
    (A) The manufacturer shall inspect the fuel system to ensure the 
absence of any leaks of liquid or vapor to the atmosphere by applying a 
pressure of 14.5<plus-minus>0.5 inches of water (3.6<plus-minus>0.1 Kpa) 
to the fuel system allowing the pressure to stabilize and isolating the 
fuel system from the pressure source. Following isolation of the fuel 
system, pressure must not drop more than 2.0 inches of water (0.5 Kpa) 
in five minutes. If required, the manufacturer shall perform corrective 
action in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and report this 
action in accordance with Sec. 86.609-98(d).
    (B) When performing this pressure check, the manufacturer shall 
exercise care to neither purge nor load the evaporative or refueling 
emission control systems.
    (C) The manufacturer may not modify the test vehicle's evaporative 
or refueling emission control systems by component addition, deletion, 
or substitution, except to comply with paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this 
section if approved in advance by the Administrator.
    (3) The following exceptions to the test procedures in subpart C of 
this part are applicable to Selective Enforcement Audit testing:
    (i) The manufacturer may measure the temperature of the test fuel at 
other than the approximate mid-volume of the fuel tank, as specified in 
Sec. 86.131-90(a), and may drain the test fuel from other than the 
lowest point of the fuel tank as specified in Sec. 86.131-90(b), 
provided an equivalent method is used. Equivalency documentation shall 
be maintained by the manufacturer and shall be made available to the 
Administrator upon request.
    (ii) In performing exhaust sample analysis under Sec. 86.140-94, the 
manufacturer shall exercise care to prevent moisture from condensing in 
the sample collection bags.
    (iii) The manufacturer need not comply with Sec. 86.142-90 since the 
records required therein are provided under other provisions of this 
subpart G.
    (iv) In addition to the requirements of subpart C of this part, the 
manufacturer shall prepare gasoline-fueled vehicles as follows prior to 
exhaust emission testing:
    (A) The manufacturer shall inspect the fuel system to ensure the 
absence

[[Page 28]]

of any leaks of liquid or vapor to the atmosphere by applying a pressure 
of 14.5<plus-minus>0.5 inches of water (3.6<plus-minus>0.1 Kpa) to the 
fuel system allowing the pressure to stabilize and isolating the fuel 
system from the pressure source. Following isolation of the fuel system, 
pressure must not drop more than 2.0 inches of water (0.5 Kpa) in five 
minutes. If required, the manufacturer shall perform corrective action 
in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and report this action 
in accordance with Sec. 86.609-98(d).
    (B) When performing this pressure check, the manufacturer shall 
exercise care to neither purge nor load the evaporative or refueling 
emission control system.
    (C) The manufacturer shall not modify the test vehicle's evaporative 
or refueling emission control system by component addition, deletion, or 
substitution, except if approved in advance by the Administrator, to 
comply with paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.
    (4) The exceptions to the test procedures in subpart O of this part 
applicable to Selective Enforcement Audit testing are listed in 
paragraphs (a)(4) (i) and (ii) of this section.
    (i) The manufacturer need not comply with Sec. 86.1442, since the 
records required therein are provided under provisions of this subpart 
G.
    (ii) In addition to the requirements of subpart O of this part, the 
manufacturer must prepare vehicles as in paragraphs (a)(4)(ii) (A) 
through (C) of this section prior to exhaust emission testing.
    (A) The manufacturer must inspect the fuel system to insure the 
absence of any leaks of liquid or vapor to the atmosphere by applying a 
pressure of 14.5<plus-minus>0.5 inches of water (3.6<plus-minus>0.1 Kpa) 
to the fuel system, allowing the pressure to stabilize, and isolating 
the fuel system from the pressure source. Pressure must not drop more 
than 2.0 inches of water (0.5 Kpa) in five minutes. If required, the 
manufacturer performs corrective action in accordance with paragraph (d) 
of this section and must report this action in accordance with 
Sec. 86.609-98(d).
    (B) When performing this pressure check, the manufacturer must 
exercise care to neither purge nor load the evaporative or refueling 
emission control system.
    (C) The manufacturer may not modify the test vehicle's evaporative 
or refueling emission control system by component addition, deletion, or 
substitution.
    (b)(1) The manufacturer shall not adjust, repair, prepare, or modify 
the vehicles selected for testing and shall not perform any emission 
tests on vehicles selected for testing pursuant to the test order unless 
this adjustment repair, preparation, modification, and/or tests are 
documented in the manufacturer's vehicle assembly and inspection 
procedures and are actually performed or unless these adjustments and/or 
tests are required or permitted under this subpart or are approved in 
advance by the Administrator.
    (2) For 1981 and later model years the Administrator may adjust or 
cause to be adjusted any engine or vehicle parameter which the 
Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment for new vehicle 
compliance testing (e.g., for certification or Selective Enforcement 
Audit testing) in accordance with Sec. 86.081-22(c)(1), to any setting 
within the physically adjustable range of that parameter, as determined 
by the Administrator in accordance with Sec. 86.081-22(e)(3)(ii), prior 
to the performance of any tests. However, if the idle speed parameter is 
one which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment, 
the Administrator shall not adjust it to a setting which causes a lower 
engine idle speed than will be possible within the physically adjustable 
range of the idle speed parameter on the vehicle when it has accumulated 
4,000 miles, all other parameters being adjusted identically for the 
purpose of comparison. The Administrator, in making or specifying such 
adjustments, will consider the effect of the deviation from the 
manufacturer's recommended setting on emissions performance 
characteristics as well as the likelihood that similar settings will 
occur on in-use light-duty vehicles or light-duty trucks. In determining 
likelihood, the Administrator will consider factors such as, but not 
limited to, the

[[Page 29]]

effect of the adjustment on vehicle performance characteristics and 
surveillance information from similar in-use vehicles.
    (c) Prior to performing emission testing pursuant to paragraph (a) 
of this section on an SEA test vehicle, the manufacturer may accumulate 
on each vehicle a number of miles equal to the greater of 4,000 miles, 
or the number of miles the manufacturer accumulated during certification 
on the emission-data vehicle corresponding to the configuration 
specified in the test order.
    (1) Mileage accumulation must be performed in any manner using good 
engineering judgment to obtain emission results representative of normal 
production vehicles. This mileage accumulation must be consistent with 
the new vehicle break-in instructions contained in the applicable 
vehicle owner's manual, if any.
    (2) The manufacturer shall accumulate mileage at a minimum rate of 
300 miles per vehicle during each 24-hour period, unless otherwise 
provided by the Administrator.
    (i) The first 24-hour period for mileage accumulation shall begin as 
soon as authorized vehicle checks, inspections and preparations are 
completed on each vehicle.
    (ii) The minimum mileage accumulation rate does not apply on 
weekends or holidays.
    (iii) If the manufacturer's mileage accumulation target is less than 
the minimum rate specified (300 miles per day), then the minimum daily 
accumulation rate shall be equal to the manufacturer's mileage 
accumulation target.
    (3) Mileage accumulation shall be completed on a sufficient number 
of test vehicles during consecutive 24-hour periods to assure that the 
number of vehicles tested per day fulfills the requirements of paragraph 
(g) of this section.
    (d) The manufacturer shall not perform any maintenance on test 
vehicles after selection for testing nor shall the Administrator allow 
deletion of any test vehicle from the test sequence, unless requested by 
the manufacturer and approved by the Administrator before any test 
vehicle maintenance of deletion.
    (e) The manufacturer will be allowed 24 hours to ship test vehicles 
from the assembly plant or storage facility to the test facility if the 
test facility is not located at the plant or storage facility or in 
close proximity to the plant or storage facility: Except, that the 
Administrator may approve more time based upon a request by the 
manufacturer accompanied by a satisfactory justification.
    (f) If a vehicle cannot complete the mileage accumulation or 
emission tests because of vehicle malfunction, the manufacturer may 
request the Administrator to authorize the repair of that vehicle or its 
deletion from the test sequence.
    (g) Whenever the manufacturer conducts testing pursuant to a test 
order issued under this subpart, the manufacturer shall notify the 
Administrator within one working day of receipt of the test order, which 
test facility will be used to comply with the test order and the number 
of available test cells at that facility. If no test cells are available 
at the desired facility, the manufacturer must provide alternate testing 
capability satisfactory to the Administrator.
    (1) The manufacturer shall perform a combination of tests pursuant 
to paragraph (a) of this section so that a minimum of four tests are 
performed per 24 hour period, including voided tests, for each available 
test cell.
    (2) The Administrator may approve a longer period based upon a 
request by a manufacturer accompanied by satisfactory justification.
    (h) The manufacturer shall perform test vehicle selection, 
preparation, mileage accumulation, shipping, and testing in such a 
manner as to assure that the audit is performed in an expeditious 
manner.
    (i) The manufacturer may retest any test vehicle after a fail 
decision has been reached in accordance with Sec. 86.610-98(d) based on 
the first test on each vehicle; except that the Administrator may 
approve retests at other times during the audit based upon a request by 
the manufacturer accompanied by a satisfactory justification. The 
manufacturer may test each vehicle a total of three times. The 
manufacturer shall test each vehicle the

[[Page 30]]

same number of times. The manufacturer may accumulate additional mileage 
on test vehicles before conducting retests, subject to the provisions of 
paragraph (c) of this section.

specific test has been conducted on the vehicle, and rounding to the 
same number of decimal places contained in the applicable standard 
expressed to one additional significant figure. Rounding is done in 
accordance with ASTM E 29-67, (reapproved 1980) (as referenced in 
Sec. 86.094-28 (a)(4)(i)(B)(2)(ii).
    (c) Final deteriorated test results--(1) For each test vehicle. The 
final deteriorated test results for each light-duty vehicle tested for 
exhaust emissions and/or refueling emissions according to subpart B, 
subpart C, or subpart R of this part are calculated by first multiplying 
or adding, as appropriate, the final test results by or to the 
appropriate deterioration factor derived from the certification process 
for the engine or evaporative/refueling family

[[Page 33]]

and model year to which the selected configuration belongs, and then by 
multiplying by the appropriate reactivity adjustment factor, if 
applicable, and rounding to the same number of decimal places contained 
in the applicable emission standard. Rounding is done in accordance with 
the Rounding-Off Method specified in ASTM E29-90, Standard Practice for 
Using Significant Digits in Test Data to Determine Conformance with 
Specifications. This procedure has been incorporated by reference (see 
Sec. 86.1). For the purpose of this paragraph (c), if a multiplicative 
deterioration factor as computed during the certification process is 
less than one, that deterioration factor is one. If an additive 
deterioration factor as computed during the certification process is 
less than zero, that deterioration factor will be zero.
    (2) Exceptions. There are no deterioration factors for light-duty 
vehicle emissions obtained during testing in accordance with subpart O 
of this part or with Sec. 86.146-96. Accordingly, for the CST and the 
fuel dispensing spitback test the term ``final deteriorated test 
results'' means the final test results derived in paragraph (b) of this 
section for each test vehicle, rounded to the same number of decimal 
places contained in the applicable emission standard. Rounding is done 
in accordance with ASTM E 29-67, (reapproved 1980) (as referenced in 
Sec. 86.094-28 (a)(4)(i)(B)(2)(ii).
    (d) Within five working days after completion of testing of all 
vehicles pursuant to a test order, the manufacturer shall submit to the 
Administrator a report which includes the following information:
    (1) The location and description of the manufacturer's emission test 
facilities which were utilized to conduct testing reported pursuant to 
this section.
    (2) The applicable standards against which the vehicles were tested.
    (3) Deterioration factors for the selected configuration.
    (4) A description of the vehicle selection method used.
    (5) For each test conducted.
    (i) Test vehicle description including:
    (A) Configuration, engine family, and refueling family 
identification.
    (B) Year, make, build date, and model of vehicle.
    (C) Vehicle Identification Number.
    (D) Miles accumulated on vehicle.
    (ii) Location where mileage accumulation was conducted and 
description of accumulation schedule.
    (iii) Test number, date initial test results, final results and 
final deteriorated test results for all valid and invalid exhaust 
emission tests, and the reason for invalidation.
    (iv) A complete description of any modification, repair, 
preparation, maintenance and/or testing which was performed on the test 
vehicle and:
    (A) Has not been reported pursuant to any other paragraph of this 
subpart; and
    (B) Will not be performed on all other production vehicles.
    (v) Carbon dioxide emission values for all valid and invalid exhaust 
emission tests.
    (vi) Where a vehicle was deleted from the test sequence by 
authorization of the Administrator, the reason for the deletion.
    (vii) Any other information the Administrator may request relevant 
to the determination as to whether the new motor vehicles being 
manufactured by the manufacturer do in fact conform with the regulations 
with respect to which the certificate of conformity was issued.
    (6) The following statement and endorsement:

    This report is submitted pursuant to sections 206 and 208 of the 
Clean Air Act. This Selective Enforcement Audit was conducted in 
complete conformance with all applicable regulations under 40 CFR part 
86 and the conditions of the test order. No emission related change(s) 
to production processes or quality control procedures for the vehicle 
configuration tested have been made between receipt of this test order 
and conclusion of the audit. All data and information reported herein

Sec. 86.610-96  Compliance with acceptable quality level and passing and 
failing criteria for Selective Enforcement Audits.

    (a) The prescribed acceptable quality level is 40 percent.
    (b) A failed vehicle is one whose final deteriorated test results 
pursuant to Sec. 86.609-96(c), for one or more of the applicable 
pollutants, including fuel spitback, exceed the applicable emission 
standard. For the CST as described in subpart O of this part, a vehicle 
fail determination is made if the final deteriorated test results for HC 
and/or CO emissions from any CST exceed the applicable emission 
standard.
    (c) Pass/fail criteria--(1) FTP criteria. The manufacturer must test 
vehicles comprising the test sample until a pass decision is reached for 
all pollutants, or a fail decision is reached for one pollutant. A pass 
decision is reached when the cumulative number of failed vehicles, as 
defined in paragraph (b) of this section, for each pollutant is less 
than or equal to the fail decision number appropriate to the cumulative 
number of vehicles tested. A fail decision is reached when the 
cumulative number of failed vehicles for one pollutant is greater than 
or equal to the fail decision number appropriate to the cumulative 
number of vehicles tested. The pass and fail decision numbers associated 
with the cumulative number of vehicles tested are determined by use of 
the tables in appendix XI to this part appropriate for the annual 
projected sales as made by the manufacturer in its report submitted 
under Sec. 600.207-80(a)(2) of this chapter (Automobile Fuel Economy 
Regulations). In the tables in appendix XI to this part, sampling plan 
``stage'' refers to the cumulative number of vehicles tested. Once a 
pass decision has been made for a particular pollutant, the number of 
vehicles whose final deteriorated test results exceed the emission 
standard for that pollutant may not be considered any further for 
purposes of the audit.
    (2) CST criteria. A pass/fail decision is based on the CST in its 
entirety rather than on a per pollutant basis. The manufacturer must 
test vehicles comprising the test sample until a pass or fail decision 
is reached based on CST testing. A pass decision is reached when the 
cumulative number of failed vehicles, as defined in paragraph (b) of 
this section, based on CST testing is less than or equal to the pass 
decision number appropriate to the cumulative number of vehicles tested. 
A fail decision is reached when the cumulative number of failed vehicles 
based on CST testing is greater than or equal to the fail decision 
number appropriate to the cumulative number of vehicles tested. The pass 
and fail decision numbers associated with the cumulative number of 
vehicles tested are determined by use of the tables in appendix XI to 
this part appropriate for the annual projected sales as made by the 
manufacturer in its report submitted under Sec. 600.207-80(a)(2) of this 
chapter (Automobile Fuel Economy Regulations). In the tables in appendix 
XI to this part, sampling plan ``stage'' refers to the cumulative number 
of vehicles tested. Once a pass decision has been made based on CST 
testing, the number of vehicles whose final deteriorated test results 
exceed any of the emission standards for any CST may not be considered 
any further for purposes of the audit.
    (d) Passing or failing of an SEA occurs when the decision is made on 
the last vehicle required to make a decision under paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (e) The Administrator may terminate testing earlier than required in 
paragraph (c) of this section.

Sec. 86.610-98  Compliance with acceptable quality level and passing and 
failing criteria for Selective Enforcement Audits.

    (a) The prescribed acceptable quality level is 40 percent.
    (b) A failed vehicle is one whose final deteriorated test results 
pursuant to Sec. 86.609-98(c) exceed at least one of the applicable 
emission standards associated with the test procedures pursuant to 
Sec. 86.608-98(a).
    (c)(1) Pass/fail criteria. The manufacturer shall test vehicles 
comprising the test sample until a pass decision is reached for all of 
the pollutants associated with all of the test procedures

[[Page 35]]

pursuant to Sec. 86.608-98(a) or a fail decision is reached for one of 
these pollutants. A pass decision is reached when the cumulative number 
of failed vehicles, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, for 
each pollutant is less than or equal to the fail decision number 
appropriate to the cumulative number of vehicles tested. A fail decision 
is reached when the cumulative number of failed vehicles for one 
pollutant is greater than or equal to the fail decision number 
appropriate to the cumulative number of vehicles tested. The pass and 
fail decision numbers associated with the cumulative number of vehicles 
tested are determined by use of the tables in appendix XI of this part 
appropriate for the annual projected sales as made by the manufacturer 
in its report submitted under Sec. 600.207-80(a)(2) of this chapter 
(Automobile Fuel Economy Regulations). In the tables in appendix XI of 
this part, sampling plan ``stage'' refers to the cumulative number of 
vehicles tested. Once a pass decision has been made for a particular 
pollutant associated with a particular test procedure pursuant to 
Sec. 86.608-98(a), the number of vehicles whose final deteriorated test 
results exceed the emission standard for that pollutant may not be 
considered any further for purposes of the audit.
    (2) CST criteria only. For CST testing pursuant to subpart O, a pass 
or fail decision is determined according to the pass/fail criteria 
described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, except that for each 
vehicle, the CST in its entirety is considered one pollutant.
    (d) Passing or failing of an SEA audit occurs when the decision is 
made on the last vehicle required to make a decision under paragraph (c) 
of this section.
    (e) The Administrator may terminate testing earlier than required in 
paragraph (c) of this section.

Sec. 86.612-84  Suspension and revocation of certificates of conformity.

    (a) The certificate of conformity is suspended with respect to any 
vehicle failing pursuant to paragraph (b) of Sec. 86.610 effective from 
the time that testing of that vehicle is completed.
    (b) The Administrator may suspend the certificate of conformity for 
a configuration which does not pass a Selective Enforcement Audit 
pursuant to paragraph Sec. 86.610(c) based on the first test, or all 
tests, conducted on each vehicle. This suspension will not occur before 
ten days after failure to pass the audit.
    (c) If the results of vehicle testing pursuant to these regulations 
indicate the vehicles of a particular configuration produced at more 
than one plant do not conform to the regulations with respect to which 
the certificate of conformity was issued, the Administrator may suspend 
the certificate of conformity with respect to that configuration for 
vehicles manufactured by the manufacturer in other plants of the 
manufacturer.
    (d) The Administrator will notify the manufacturer in writing of any 
suspension or revocation of a certificate of conformity in whole or in 
part: Except, That the certificate of conformity is immediately 
suspended with respect to any vehicle failing pursuant to Sec. 86.610(a) 
and as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (e) The Administrator may revoke a certificate of conformity for a 
configuration when the certificate has been suspended pursuant to 
paragraph (b) or (c) of this section if the proposed remedy for the 
nonconformity, as reported by the manufacturer to the Administrator, is 
one requiring a design change(s) to the engine and/or emission control 
system as described in the Application for Certification of the affected 
configuration.
    (f) Once a certificate has been suspended for a failed vehicle as 
provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, the manufacturer must 
take the following actions:
    (1) Before the certificate is reinstated for that failed vehicle,
    (i) Remedy the nonconformity, and
    (ii) Demonstrate that the vehicle's final deteriorated test results 
conform to the applicable emission standards or family particulate 
emission limits, as defined in part 86 by retesting the vehicle in 
accordance with these regulations.
    (2) Submit a written report to the Administrator within thirty days 
after

[[Page 36]]

successful completion of testing on the failed vehicle, which contains a 
description of the remedy and test results for the vehicle in addition 
to other information that may be required by this regulation.
    (g) Once a certificate has been suspended pursuant to paragraph (b) 
or (c) of this section, the manufacturer must take the following actions 
before the Administrator will consider reinstating such certificate:
    (1) Submit a written report to the Administrator which identifies 
the reason for the noncompliance of the vehicles, describes the proposed 
remedy, including a description of any proposed quality control and/or 
quality assurance measures to be taken by the manufacturer to prevent 
the future occurrence of the problem, and states the date on which the 
remedies will be implemented, and
    (2) Demonstrate that the vehicle configuration for which the 
certificate of conformity has been suspended does in fact comply with 
these regulations by testing vehicles selected from normal production 
runs of that vehicle configuration, at the plant(s) or the facilities 
specified by the Administrator, in accordance with the conditions 
specified in the initial test order; except, that if the Administrator 
has not revoked the certificate pursuant to paragraph (e) of this 
section and if the manufacturer elects to continue testing individual 
vehicles after suspension of a certificate, the certificate is 
reinstated for any vehicle actually determined to have its final 
deteriorated test results in conformance with the applicable standards 
through testing in accordance with the applicable test procedures.
    (h) Once a certificate for a failed configuration has been revoked 
under paragraph (e) of this section and the manufacturer desires to 
introduce into commerce a modified version of that configuration, the 
following actions will be taken before the Administrator may issue a 
certificate for the new configuration:
    (1) If the Administrator determines that the proposed change(s) in 
vehicle design may have an effect on emission performance deterioration 
and/or fuel economy, he shall notify the manufacturer within 5 working 
days after receipt of the report in paragraph (g) of this section 
whether subsequent testing under this subpart will be sufficient to 
evaluate the proposed change(s) or whether additional testing will be 
required; and
    (2) After implementing the change(s) intended to remedy the 
nonconformity, the manufacturer shall demonstrate that the modified 
vehicle configuration does in fact conform with these regulations by 
testing vehicles selected from normal production runs of that modified 
vehicle configuration in accordance with the conditions specified in the 
initial test order. The Administrator shall consider this testing to 
satisfy the testing requirements of Sec. 86.079-32 or Sec. 86.079-33 if 
the Administrator had so notified the manufacturer. If the subsequent 
testing results in passing of the audit, the Administrator shall reissue 
or amend the certificate, if necessary, to include that configuration: 
Provided, That the manufacturer has satisfied the testing requirements 
specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. If the subsequent audit 
is failed, the revocation remains in effect. Any design change approvals 
under this subpart are limited to the modification of the configuration 
specified by the test order.
    (i) A manufacturer may at any time subsequent to an initial 
suspension of a certificate of conformity with respect to a test vehicle 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, but not later than fifteen 
(15) days or such other period as may be allowed by the Administrator 
after notification of the Administrator's decision to suspend or revoke 
a certificate of conformity in whole or in part pursuant to paragraph 
(b), (c) or (e) of this section, request that the Administrator grant 
such manufacturer a hearing as to whether the tests have been properly 
conducted or any sampling methods have been properly applied.
    (j) After the Administrator suspends or revokes a certificate of 
conformity pursuant to this section or notifies a manufacturer of his 
intent to suspend, revoke or void a certificate of conformity under 
paragraph (d) of Sec. 86.084-30, and prior to the commencement of a

[[Page 37]]

hearing under Sec. 86.614, if the manufacturer demonstrates to the 
Administrator's satisfaction that the decision to suspend, revoke or 
void the certificate was based on erroneous information, the 
Administrator shall reinstate the certificate.
    (k) To permit a manufacturer to avoid storing non-test vehicles when 
conducting an audit of a configuration subsequent to suspension or 
revocation of the certificate of conformity for that configuration, 
resulting from failure of the initial audit of that configuration, he 
may request that the Administrator conditionally reinstate the 
certificate for that configuration. The Administrator may reinstate the 
certificate subject to the condition that the manufacturer consents to 
recall all vehicles of that configuration produced from the time the 
certificate is conditionally reinstated if the configuration fails the 
subsequent audit and to remedy any nonconformity at no expense to the 
owner.

Regulatory Requirements Applicable to the National Low Emission Vehicle 
Program (October, 1996), if the results of vehicle testing conducted by 
the manufacturer do not meet the acceptable quality level criteria 
pursuant to Sec. 86.610. The California Regulatory Requirements 
Applicable to the National Low Emission Vehicle Program (October, 1996) 
are incorporated by reference (see Sec. 86.1). A vehicle that is tested 
by the manufacturer pursuant to California Assembly-Line Quality Audit 
Test Procedures, in accordance with procedures prescribed under 
Sec. 86.608, and determined to be a failing vehicle will be treated as a 
failed vehicle described in Sec. 86.610(b), unless the manufacturer can 
show that the vehicle would not be considered a failed vehicle using the 
test procedures specified in Sec. 86.608. This suspension will not occur 
before ten days after the manufacturer receives written notification 
that the Administrator has determined the 50-state family or 
configuration exceeds one or more applicable federal standards.
    (c)(1) Selective Enforcement Audits. If the results of vehicle 
testing pursuant to the requirements of this subpart indicates the 
vehicles of a particular configuration produced at more than one plant 
do not conform to the regulations with respect to which the certificate

    (ii) The conditions specified in a test order pursuant to 
Sec. 86.603 for an engine family or configuration suspended pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(2) or (c)(2) of this section.
    (3) If the Administrator has not revoked the certificate pursuant to 
paragraph (e) of this section and if the manufacturer elects to continue 
testing individual vehicles after suspension of a certificate, the 
certificate is reinstated for any vehicle actually determined to have 
its final deteriorated test results in conformance with the applicable 
standards through testing in accordance with the applicable test 
procedures.

[[Page 39]]

    (4) In cases where the Administrator has suspended a certificate of 
conformity for a 50-state engine family or configuration pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(2) or (c)(2) of this section, manufacturers may request in 
writing that the Administrator reinstate the certificate of an engine 
family or configuration when, in lieu of the actions described in 
paragraphs (g) (1) and (2) of this section, the manufacturer has agreed 
to comply with Chapter 3 of the California Regulatory Requirements 
Applicable to the National Low Emission Vehicle Program (October, 1996), 
provided an Executive Order is in place for the engine family or 
configuration. The California Regulatory Requirements Applicable to the 
National Low Emission Vehicle Program (October, 1996) are incorporated 
by reference (see Sec. 86.1).
    (h) Once a certificate for a failed engine family or configuration 
has been revoked under paragraph (e) (1) or (2) of this section and the 
manufacturer desires to introduce into commerce a modified version of 
that engine family or configuration, the following actions will be taken 
before the Administrator may issue a certificate for the new engine 
family or configuration:
    (1) If the Administrator determines that the proposed change(s) in 
vehicle design may have an effect on emission performance deterioration 
and/or fuel economy, he/she shall notify the manufacturer within five 
working days after receipt of the report in paragraph (g)(1) of this 
section or after receipt of information pursuant to paragraph (g)(4) of 
this section whether subsequent testing under this subpart will be 
sufficient to evaluate the proposed change(s) or whether additional 
testing will be required.
    (2) After implementing the change(s) intended to remedy the 
nonconformity, the manufacturer shall demonstrate:
    (i) If the certificate was revoked pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section, that the modified vehicle configuration does in fact 
conform with the requirements of this subpart by testing vehicles 
selected from normal production runs of that modified vehicle 
configuration in accordance with the conditions specified in the initial 
test order pursuant to Sec. 86.603. The Administrator shall consider 
this testing to satisfy the testing requirements of Sec. 86.079-32 or 
Sec. 86.079-33 if the Administrator had so notified the manufacturer. If 
the subsequent testing results in a pass decision pursuant to the 
criteria in Sec. 86.610-96(c), the Administrator shall reissue or amend 
the certificate, if necessary, to include that configuration: Provided, 
that the manufacturer has satisfied the testing requirements specified 
in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. If the subsequent audit results in 
a fail decision pursuant to the criteria in Sec. 86.610(c), the 
revocation remains in effect. Any design change approvals under this 
subpart are limited to the modification of the configuration specified 
by the test order.
    (ii) If the certificate was revoked pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of 
this section, that the modified engine family or configuration does in 
fact conform with the requirements of this subpart by testing vehicles 
selected from normal production runs of that modified engine family or 
configuration in accordance with the conditions specified in a test 
order pursuant to Sec. 86.603. The Administrator shall consider this 
testing to satisfy the testing requirements of Sec. 86.079-32 or 
Sec. 86.079-33 if the Administrator had so notified the manufacturer. If 
the subsequent testing results in a pass decision pursuant to 
Sec. 86.610(c), the Administrator shall reissue or amend the certificate 
as necessary: Provided, That the manufacturer has satisfied the testing 
requirements specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. If the 
subsequent testing results in a fail decision pursuant to 
Sec. 86.610(c), the revocation remains in effect. Any design change 
approvals under this subpart are limited to the modification of engine 
family or configuration specified by the test order.
    (3) In cases where the Administrator has revoked a certificate of 
conformity for a 50-state engine family or configuration pursuant to 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section, manufacturers may request in writing 
that the Administrator reissue the certificate of an engine family or 
configuration when, in lieu of the actions described in paragraphs (h) 
(1) and (2) of this section, the manufacturer has complied with Chapter 
3 of the California Regulatory

    (k) To permit a manufacturer to avoid storing non-test vehicles when 
conducting testing of an engine family or configuration subsequent to 
suspension or revocation of the certificate of conformity for that 
engine family or configuration pursuant to paragraph (b), (c), or (e) of 
this section, the manufacturer may request that the Administrator 
conditionally reinstate the certificate for that engine family or 
configuration. The Administrator may reinstate the certificate subject 
to the condition that the manufacturer consents to recall all vehicles 
of that engine family or configuration produced from the time the 
certificate is conditionally reinstated if the engine family or 
configuration fails the subsequent testing and to remedy any 
nonconformity at no expense to the owner.

[62 FR 31236, June 6, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 86.614-84  Hearings on suspension, revocation, and voiding of 
certificates of conformity.

    (a) Applicability. The procedures prescribed by this section apply 
whenever a manufacturer requests a hearing under Sec. 86.084-
30(d)(6)(i), Sec. 86.084-30(d)(7), or Sec. 86.612(i).
    (b) Definitions. The following definitions shall be applicable to 
this section:
    (1) Hearing Clerk shall mean the Hearing Clerk of the Environmental 
Protection Agency.
    (2) Manufacturer refers to a manufacturer contesting a suspension or 
revocation order directed at the manufacturer.
    (3) Party shall include the Agency and the manufacturer.
    (4) Presiding Officer shall mean an Administrative Law Judge 
appointed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 3105 (see also 5 CFR part 930 as 
amended).
    (5) Environmental Appeals Board shall mean the Board within the 
Agency described in section 1.25 of this title. The Administrator 
delegates to the Environmental Appeals Board authority to issue final 
decisions in appeals filed under this subpart. Appeals directed by the 
Administrator, rather than to the Environmental Appeals Board, will not 
be considered. This delegation of authority to the Environmental Appeals 
Board does not preclude the Environmental Appeals Board from referring 
an appeal or a motion filed under this subpart to the Administrator for 
decision when the Environmental Appeals Board, in its discretion, deems 
it appropriate to do so. When an appeal or motion is referred to the 
Administrator, all parties shall be so notified and the rules in this 
part referring to the Environmental Appeals Board shall be interpreted 
as referring to the Administrator.
    (c) Request for public hearing. (1) If the manufacturer disagrees 
with the Administrator's decision to suspend, revoke, or void a 
certificate or disputes the basis for an automatic suspension under 
Sec. 86.612(a), it may request a public hearing as described in this 
section.

[[Page 41]]

Requests for such a hearing shall be filed with the Administrator not 
later than 15 days after the Administrator's notification of his 
decision to suspend or revoke unless otherwise specified by the 
Administrator. Two copies of such request shall simultaneously be served 
upon the Director of the Manufacturers Operations Division and two 
copies filed with the Hearing Clerk. Failure of the manufacturer to 
request a hearing within the time provided shall constitute a waiver of 
his right to such a hearing. Subsequent to the expiration of the period 
for requesting a hearing as of right, the Administrator may, in his 
discretion and for good cause shown, grant the manufacturer a hearing to 
contest the suspension or revocation.
    (2) The request for a public hearing shall contain:
    (i) A statement as to which vehicle configurations or engine 
families are to be the subject of the hearing;
    (ii) A concise statement of the issues to be raised by the 
manufacturer at the hearing for each vehicle configuration or engine 
family or vehicle for which the manufacturer has requested the hearing: 
Provided, however, That in the case of a hearing request under paragraph 
Sec. 86.612(i), the hearing is restricted to the following issues:
    (A) Whether tests were conducted in accordance with applicable 
regulations under this part;
    (B) Whether test equipment was properly calibrated and functioning;
    (C) Whether sampling procedures specified in appendix XI of this 
part were followed; and
    (D) Whether there exists a basis for distinguishing vehicles 
produced at plants other than the one from which vehicles were selected 
which would invalidate the Administrator's decision under 
Sec. 86.612(c);
    (iii) A statement specifying reasons the manufacturer believes he 
will prevail on the merits on each of the issues so raised; and
    (iv) A summary of the evidence which supports the manufacturer's 
position on each of the issues so raised.
    (3) A copy of all requests for public hearings shall be kept on file 
in the Office of the Hearing Clerk and shall be made available to the 
public during Agency business hours.
    (d) Summary decision. (1) In the case of a hearing requested under 
Sec. 86.612(i), when it clearly appears from the data and other 
information contained in the request for a hearing that there is no 
genuine and substantial question of fact with respect to the issues 
specified in Sec. 86.614(c)(2)(ii), the Administrator shall enter an 
order denying the request for a hearing. In addition, if the original 
decision to suspend or revoke a certificate of conformity was made under 
Sec. 86.612(d) prior to the decision to deny the request for a hearing, 
the order denying the request will reaffirm the suspension or 
revocation.
    (2) In the case of a hearing requested under Sec. 86.084-
30(d)(6)(i), to challenge a proposed suspension of a certificate of 
conformity for the reasons specified in Sec. 86.084-30(d)(1) (i) or 
(ii), when it clearly appears from the data and other information 
contained in the request for a hearing that there is no genuine and 
substantial question of fact with respect to the issue of whether the 
refusal to comply with the provisions of a test order or any other 
requirement of Sec. 86.603 was caused by conditions and circumstances 
outside the control of the manufacturer, the Administrator will enter an 
order denying the request for a hearing, and suspending the certificate 
of conformity.
    (3) Any order issued under paragraph (d) (1) or (2) of this section 
shall have the force and effect of a final decision of the 
Administrator, as issued pursuant to paragraph (w)(4) of this section.
    (4) If the Administrator determines that a genuine and substantial 
question of fact does exist with respect to any of the issues referred 
to in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, he shall grant the 
request for a hearing and publish a notice of public hearing in 
accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.
    (e) Filing and service. (1) An original and two copies of all 
documents or papers required or permitted to be filed pursuant to this 
section shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk. Filing shall be deemed 
timely if mailed, as determined by the postmark, to the Hearing Clerk 
within the time allowed by this section. If filing is to be accomplished 
by

[[Page 42]]

mailing, the documents shall be sent to the address set forth in the 
notice of public hearing as described in paragraph (h) of this section.
    (2) To the maximum extent possible, testimony shall be presented in 
written form. Copies of written testimony shall be served upon all 
parties as soon as practicable prior to the start of the hearing. A 
certificate of service shall be provided on or accompany each document 
or paper filed with the Hearing Clerk. Documents to be served upon the 
Director of the Manufacturers Operations Division shall be sent by 
registered mail to: Director, Manufacturers Operations Division, U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EN-340), 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., 
WSM, Washington, DC 20460. Service by registered mail is complete upon 
mailing.
    (f) Time. (1) In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed 
by this section, except as otherwise provided, the day of the act or 
event from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not 
be included. Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal legal holidays shall be 
included in computing any such period allowed for the filing of any 
document or paper, except that when such period expires on a Saturday, 
Sunday, or Federal legal holiday, such period shall be extended to 
include the next following business day.
    (2) A prescribed period of time within which a party is required or 
permitted to do an act shall be computed from the time of service, 
except that when service is accomplished by mail, three days shall be 
added to the prescribed period.
    (g) Consolidation. The Administrator or the Presiding Officer in his 
discretion may consolidate two or more proceedings to be held under this 
section for the purpose of resolving one or more issues whenever it 
appears that such consolidation will expedite or simplify consideration 
of such issues. Consolidation shall not affect the right of any party to 
raise issues that could have been raised if consolidation had not 
occurred.
    (h) Notice of public hearings. (1) Notice of a public hearing under 
this section shall be given by publication in the Federal Register and 
by such other means as the Administrator finds appropriate to provide 
notice to the public. To the extent possible hearings under this section 
shall be scheduled to commence within 14 days of receipt of the 
application in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (i) Amicus curiae. Persons not parties to the proceeding wishing to 
file briefs may do so by leave of the Presiding Officer granted on 
motion. A motion for leave shall identify the interest of the applicant 
and shall state the reasons why the proposed amicus brief is desirable.
    (j) Presiding Officer. The Presiding Officer shall have the duty to 
conduct a fair and impartial hearing in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 
sections 554, 556 and 557 and to take all necessary action to avoid 
delay in the disposition of the proceedings and to maintain order. He 
shall have all power consistent with Agency rule and with the 
Administrative Procedure Act necessary to this end, including the 
following:
    (1) To administer oaths and affirmations;
    (2) To rule upon offers of proof and exclude irrelevant or 
repetitious material;
    (3) To regulate the course of the hearings and the conduct of the 
parties and their counsel therein;
    (4) To hold conferences for simplification of the issues or any 
other proper purpose;
    (5) To consider and rule upon all procedural and other motions 
appropriate in such proceedings;
    (6) To require the submission of direct testimony in written form 
with or without affidavit whenever, in the opinion of the Presiding 
Officer, oral testimony is not necessary for full and true disclosure of 
the facts;
    (7) To enforce agreements and orders requiring access as authorized 
by law;
    (8) To require the filing of briefs on any matter on which he is 
required to rule;
    (9) To require any party or any witness, during the course of the 
hearing, to state his position on any issue;
    (10) To take or cause depositions to be taken whenever the ends of 
justice would be served thereby;
    (11) To make decisions or recommend decisions to resolve the 
disputed issues on the record of the hearing;

[[Page 43]]

    (12) To issue, upon good cause shown, protective orders as described 
in paragraph (n) of this section.
    (k) Conferences. (1) At the discretion of the Presiding Officer, 
conferences may be held prior to or during any hearing. The Presiding 
Officer shall direct the Hearing Clerk to notify all parties of the time 
and location of any such conference. At the discretion of the Presiding 
Officer, persons other than parties may attend. At a conference the 
Presiding Officer may:
    (i) Obtain stipulations and admissions, receive requests and order 
depositions to be taken, identify disputed issues of fact and law, and 
require or allow the submission of written testimony from any witness or 
party;
    (ii) Set a hearing schedule for as many of the following as are 
deemed necessary by the Presiding Officer:
    (A) Oral and written statements;
    (B) Submission of written direct testimony as required or authorized 
by the Presiding Officer;
    (C) Oral direct and cross-examination of a witness where necessary 
as prescribed in paragraph (p) of this section: and
    (D) Oral argument, if appropriate.
    (iii) Identify matters of which official notice may be taken;
    (iv) Consider limitation of the number of expert and other 
witnesses;
    (v) Consider the procedure to be followed at the hearing; and
    (vi) Consider any other matter that may expedite the hearing or aid 
in the disposition of the issue.
    (2) The results of any conference including all stipulations shall, 
if not transcribed, be summarized in writing by the Presiding Officer 
and made part of the record.
    (l) Primary discovery (exchange of witness lists and documents). (1) 
At a prehearing conference or within some reasonable time set by the 
Presiding Officer prior to the hearing, each party shall make available 
to the other parties the names of the expert and other witnesses the 
party expects to call, together with a brief summary of their expected 
testimony and a list of all documents and exhibits which the party 
expects to introduce into evidence. Thereafter, witnesses, documents, or 
exhibits may be added and summaries of expected testimony amended upon 
motion by a party.
    (2) The Presiding Officer, may, upon motion by a party or other 
person, and for good cause shown, by order (i) restrict or defer 
disclosure by a party of the name of a witness or a narrative summary of 
the expected testimony of a witness, and (ii) prescribe other 
appropriate measures to protect a witness. Any party affected by any 
such action shall have an adequate opportunity, once he learns the name 
of a witness and obtains the narrative summary of his expected 
testimony, to prepare for the presentation of his case.
    (m) Other discovery. (1) Except as so provided by paragraph (l) of 
this section, further discovery, under this paragraph, shall be 
permitted only upon determination by the Presiding Officer:
    (i) That such discovery will not in any way unreasonably delay the 
proceeding;
    (ii) That the information to be obtained is not obtainable 
voluntarily; and
    (iii) That such information has significant probative value. The 
Presiding Officer shall be guided by the procedures set forth in the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, where practicable, and the precedents 
thereunder, except that no discovery shall be undertaken except upon 
order of the Presiding Officer or upon agreement of the parties.
    (2) The Presiding Officer shall order depositions upon oral 
questions only upon a showing of good cause and upon a finding that:
    (i) The information sought cannot be obtained by alternative 
methods; or
    (ii) There is a substantial reason to believe that relevant and 
probative evidence may otherwise not be preserved for presentation by a 
witness at the hearing.
    (3) Any party to the proceeding desiring an order of discovery shall 
make a motion or motions therefor. Such a motion shall set forth:
    (i) The circumstances warranting the taking of the discovery;
    (ii) The nature of the information expected to be discovered; and
    (iii) The proposed time and place where it will be taken.

[[Page 44]]


If the Presiding Officer determines the motion should be granted, he 
shall issue an order for the taking of such discovery together with the 
conditions and terms thereof.
    (4) Failure to comply with an order issued pursuant to this 
paragraph may lead to the inference that the information to be 
discovered would be adverse to the person or party from whom the 
information was sought.
    (n) Protective orders, in camera proceedings. (1) Upon motion by a 
party or by the person from whom discovery is sought, and upon a showing 
by the movant that the disclosure of the information to be discovered, 
or a particular part thereof, (other than emission data) would result in 
methods or processes entitled to protection as trade secrets of such 
person being divulged, the Presiding Officer may enter a protective 
order with respect to such material. Any protective order shall contain 
such terms governing the treatment of the information as may be 
appropriate under the circumstances to prevent disclosure outside the 
hearing: Provided, That the order shall state that the material shall be 
filed separately from other evidence and exhibits in the hearing. 
Disclosure shall be limited to parties to the hearing, their counsel and 
relevant technical consultants, and authorized representatives of the 
United States concerned with carrying out the Act. Except in the case of 
the government, disclosure may be limited to counsel for parties who 
shall not disclose such information to the parties themselves. Except in 
the case of the government, disclosure to a party or his counsel shall 
be conditioned on execution of a sworn statement that no disclosure of 
the information will be made to persons not entitled to receive it under 
the terms of the protective order. (No such provision is necessary where 
government employees are concerned because disclosure by them is subject 
to the terms of 18 U.S.C. 1905.)
    (2)(i) A party or person seeking a protective order may be permitted 
to make all or part of the required showing in camera. A record shall be 
made of such in camera proceedings. If the Presiding Officer enters a 
protective order following a showing in camera, the record of such 
showing shall be sealed and preserved and made available to the agency 
or court in the event of appeal.
    (ii) Attendance at any in camera proceeding may be limited to the 
Presiding Officer, the agency, and the person or party seeking the 
protective order.
    (3) Any party, subject to the terms and conditions of any protective 
order issued pursuant to paragraph (n)(1) of this section, desiring for 
the presentation of his case to make use of any in camera documents or 
testimony shall make application to the Presiding Officer by motion 
setting forth the justification therefor. The Presiding Officer, in 
granting any such motion, shall enter an order protecting the rights of 
the affected persons and parties and preventing unnecessary disclosure 
of such information, including the presentation of such information and 
oral testimony and cross-examination concerning it in executive session, 
as in his discretion is necessary and practicable.
    (4) In the submittal of proposed findings, briefs, or other papers, 
counsel for all parties shall make a good faith attempt to refrain from 
disclosing the specific details of in camera documents and testimony. 
This shall not preclude references in such proposed findings, briefs, or 
other papers to such documents or testimony including generalized 
statements based on their contents. To the extent that counsel considers 
it necessary to include specific details in their presentations, such 
data shall be incorporated in separate proposed findings, briefs, or 
other papers marked ``confidential,'' which shall become part of the in 
camera record.
    (o) Motions. (1) All motions, except those made orally during the 
course of the hearing, shall be in writing and shall state with 
particularity the grounds therefore, shall set forth the relief or order 
sought, and shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk and served upon all 
parties.
    (2) Within such time as may be fixed by the Environmental Appeals 
Board or the Presiding Officer, as appropriate, any party may serve and 
file an answer to the motion. The movant

[[Page 45]]

shall, if requested by the Environmental Appeals Board or the Presiding 
Officer, as appropriate, serve and file reply papers within the time set 
by the request.
    (3) The Presiding Officer shall rule upon all motions filed or made 
prior to the filing of his decision or accelerated decision, as 
appropriate. The Environmental Appeals Board shall rule upon all motions 
filed prior to the appointment of a Presiding Officer and all motions 
filed after the filing of the decision of the Presiding Officer or 
accelerated decision. Oral argument of motions will be permitted only if 
the Presiding Officer or the Environmental Appeals Board, as 
appropriate, deems it necessary.
    (p) Evidence. (1) The official transcripts and exhibits, together 
with all papers and requests filed in the proceeding, shall constitute 
the record. Immaterial or irrelevant parts of an admissible document 
shall be segregated and excluded so far as practicable. Documents or 
parts thereof subject to a protective order under paragraph (n) of this 
section shall be segregated. Evidence may be received at the hearing 
even though inadmissible under the rules of evidence applicable to 
judicial proceedings. The weight to be given evidence shall be 
determined by its reliability and probative value.
    (2) The Presiding Officer shall allow the parties to examine and 
cross-examine a witness to the extent that such examination and cross-
examination is necessary for a full and true disclosure of the facts.
    (3) Rulings of the Presiding Officer on the admissibility of 
evidence, the propriety of examination and cross-examination and other 
procedural matters shall appear in the record.
    (4) Parties shall automatically be presumed to have taken exception 
to an adverse ruling.
    (q) Record. (1) Hearings shall be stenographically reported and 
transcribed and the original transcripts shall be part of the record and 
the sole official transcript. Copies of the record shall be filed with 
the Hearing Clerk and made available during Agency business hours for 
public inspection. Any person desiring a copy of the record of the 
hearing or any part thereof, except as provided in paragraph (n) of this 
section, shall be entitled to the same upon payment of the cost thereof.
    (2) The official transcripts and exhibits, together with all papers 
and requests filed in the proceeding, shall constitute the record.
    (r) Proposed findings, conclusions. (1) Within 4 days of the close 
of the reception of evidence, or within such longer time as may be fixed 
by the Presiding Officer, any party may submit for the consideration of 
the Presiding Officer proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and 
a proposed order, together with reasons therefor and briefs in support 
thereof. Such proposals shall be in writing, shall be served upon all 
parties, and shall contain adequate references to the record and 
authorities relied upon.
    (2) The record shall show the Presiding Officer's ruling on the 
proposed findings and conclusions except when his order disposing of the 
proceeding otherwise informs the parties of the action taken by him 
thereon.
    (s) Decision of the Presiding Officer. (1) Unless extended by the 
Environmental Appeals Board, the Presiding Officer shall issue and file 
with the Hearing Clerk his decision within 14 days (or within 7 days in 
the case of a hearing requested under Sec. 86.612(i)) after the period 
for filing proposed findings as provided for in paragraph (r) of this 
section has expired.
    (2) The Presiding Officer's decision shall become the decision of 
the Environmental Appeals Board (i) when no notice of intention to 
appeal as described in paragraphs (t) and (u) of this section is filed, 
10 days after issuance thereof, unless in the interim the Environmental 
Appeals Board shall have taken action to review or stay the effective 
date of the decision; or (ii), when a notice of intention to appeal is 
filed but the appeal is not perfected as required by paragraphs (t) or 
(u) of this section, 5 days after the period allowed for perfection of 
an appeal has expired unless within that 5 day period, the Environmental 
Appeals Board shall have taken action to review or stay the effective 
date of the decision.
    (3) The Presiding Officer's decision shall include a statement of 
findings

[[Page 46]]

and conclusions, as well as the reasons or basis therefore, upon all the 
material issues of fact or law presented on the record and an 
appropriate rule or order. Such decision shall be supported by 
substantial evidence and based upon a consideration of the whole record.
    (4) At any time prior to the issuance of his decision, the Presiding 
Officer may reopen the proceeding for the reception of further evidence. 
Except for the correction of clerical errors, the jurisdication of the 
Presiding Officer is terminated upon the issuance of his decision.
    (t) Appeal from the decision of the Presiding Officer. (1) Any party 
to a proceeding may appeal the Presiding Officer's decision to the 
Environmental Appeals Board, Provided, That within 10 days after 
issuance of the Presiding Officer's decision such party files a notice 
of intention to appeal and an appeal brief within 20 days of such 
decision.
    (2) When an appeal is taken from the decision of the Presiding 
Officer, any party may file a brief with respect to such appeal. The 
brief shall be filed within 15 days of the date of the filing of the 
appellant's brief.
    (3) Any brief filed pursuant to this paragraph shall contain in the 
order indicated, the following:
    (i) A subject index of the matter in the brief, with page 
references, and a table of cases (alphabetically arranged) textbooks, 
statutes, and other material cited, with page references thereto;
    (ii) A specification of the issues intended to be urged: Provided, 
however, That in the case of a hearing requested under Sec. 86.612(i), 
the brief shall be restricted to the issues specified in paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii) of this section;
    (iii) The argument presenting clearly the points of fact and law 
relied upon in support of the position taken on each issue, with 
specific page references to the record and the legal or other material 
relied upon; and
    (iv) A proposed order for the Environmental Appeals Board's 
consideration if different from the order contained in the Presiding 
Officer's decision.
    (4) No brief in excess of 40 pages shall be filed without leave of 
the Environmental Appeals Board.
    (5) Oral argument shall be allowed only in the discretion of the 
Environmental Appeals Board.
    (u) Summary appeal. (1) In the case of a hearing requested under 
Sec. 86.612(i), any appeal taken from the decision of the Presiding 
Officer shall be conducted under this paragraph.
    (2) Any party to the proceeding may appeal the Presiding Officer's 
decision to the Environmental Appeals Board by filing a notice of appeal 
within 10 days.
    (3) The notice appeal shall be in the form of a brief, and shall 
conform to the requirements of paragraph (t)(3) of this section.
    (4) Within 10 days after a notice of appeal from the decision of the 
Presiding Officer is filed under this paragraph, any party may file a 
brief with respect to such appeal.
    (5) No brief in excess of 15 pages shall be filed without leave of 
the Environmental Appeals Board.
    (v) Review of the Presiding Officer's decision in absence of appeal. 
(1) If after the expiration of the period for taking an appeal as 
provided for by paragraph (t) or (u) of this section no notice of 
intention to appeal the decision of the Presiding Officer has been 
filed, or if filed, not perfected, the Hearing Clerk shall so notify the 
Environmental Appeals Board.
    (2) The Environmental Appeals Board, upon receipt of notice from the 
Hearing Clerk that no notice of intention to appeal the decision of the 
Presiding Officer has been filed, or if filed, not perfected pursuant to 
paragraph (t) or (u) of this section, may, on its own motion, within the 
time limits specified in paragraph (s)(2) of this section, review the 
decision of the Presiding Officer. Notice of the intention of the 
Environmental Appeals Board to review the decision of the Presiding 
Officer shall be given to all parties and shall set forth the scope of 
such review and the issues which shall be considered and shall make 
provision for filing of briefs.
    (w) Decision of appeal or review. (1) Upon appeal from or review of 
the Presiding Officer's decision, the Environmental Appeals Board shall 
consider such parts of the record as are cited or as may be necessary to 
resolve the

[[Page 47]]

issues presented and in addition shall, to the extent necessary or 
desirable, exercise all the powers which it could have exercised if it 
had presided at the hearing.
    (2) In rendering its decision, the Environmental Appeals Board shall 
adopt, modify or set aside the findings, conclusions, and order 
contained in the decision of the Presiding Officer and shall set forth 
in its decision a statement of the reasons or bases for its action.
    (3) In those cases where the Environmental Appeals Board determines 
that it should further information or additional views of the parties as 
to the form and content of the rule or order to be issued, the 
Environmental Appeals Board, in its discretion, may withhold final 
action pending the receipt of such additional information or views, or 
may remand the case to the Presiding Officer.
    (4) Any decision rendered under this paragraph which completes 
disposition of a case shall be a final decision of the Environmental 
Appeals Board.
    (x) Reconsideration. Within twenty (20) days after issuance of the 
Environmental Appeals Board's decision, any party may file with the 
Environmental Appeals Board a petition for reconsideration of such 
decision, setting forth the relief desired and the grounds in support 
thereof. Any petition filed under this subsection must be confined to 
new questions raised by the decision or final order and upon which the 
petitioner had no opportunity to argue before the Presiding Officer or 
the Environmental Appeals Board; Provided, however, That in the case of 
a hearing requested under Sec. 86.612(i) such new questions shall be 
limited to the issues specified in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. 
Any party desiring to oppose such a petition shall file an answer 
thereto within ten (10) days after the filing of the petition. The 
filing of a petition for reconsideration shall not operate to stay the 
effective date of the decision or order or to toll the running of any 
statutory time period affecting such decision or order unless 
specifically so ordered by the Environmental Appeals Board.
    (y) Accelerated decision, dismissal. (1) The Presiding Officer, upon 
motion of any party or sua sponte, may at any time render an accelerated 
decision in favor of the Agency or the manufacturer as to all or any 
part of the proceeding, without further hearing or upon such limited 
additional evidence such as affidavits as he may require, or dismiss any 
party with prejudice, for any of the following reasons:
    (i) Failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, or 
direct or collateral estoppel;
    (ii) The lack of any genuine issue of material fact, causing a party 
to be entitled to judgment as a matter of law; or
    (iii) Such other and further reasons as are just, including 
specifically failure to obey a procedural order of the Presiding 
Officer.
    (2) If under this paragraph an accelerated decision is issued as to 
all the issues and claims joined in the proceeding, the decision shall 
be treated for the purposes of these procedures as the decision of the 
Presiding Officer as provided in paragraph (s) of this section.
    (3) If under this paragraph, judgment is rendered on less than all 
issues or claims in the proceeding, the Presiding Officer shall 
determine what material facts exist without substantial controversy and 
what material facts are actually and in good faith controverted. He 
shall thereupon issue an order specifying the facts which appear without 
substantial controversy, and the issues and claims upon which the 
hearing will proceed.
    (z) Conclusion of hearing. (1) If, after the expiration of the

    (a) Any manufacturer may assert that some or all of the information 
submitted pursuant to this subpart is entitled to confidential treatment 
as provided by 40 CFR part 2, subpart B.
    (b) Any claim of confidentiality must accompany the information at 
the time it is submitted to EPA.
    (c) To assert that information submitted pursuant to this subpart is 
confidential, a manufacturer must indicate clearly the items of 
information claimed confidential by marking, circling, bracketing, 
stamping, or otherwise specifying the confidential information. 
Furthermore, EPA requests, but does not require, that the submitter also 
provide a second copy of its submittal from which all confidential 
information has been deleted. If a need arises to publicly release 
nonconfidential information, EPA will assume that the submitter has 
accurately deleted the confidential information from this second copy.
    (d) If a claim is made that some or all of the information submitted 
pursuant to this subpart is entitled to confidential treatment, the 
information covered by that confidentiality claim will be disclosed by 
the Environmental Appeals Board only to the extent and by means of the 
procedures set forth in part 2, subpart B, of this chapter.
    (e) Information provided without a claim of confidentiality at the 
time of submission may be made available to the public by EPA without 
further notice to the submitter, in accordance with 40 CFR 
2.204(c)(2)(i)(A).

    (a)(1) Standards. (i) In-use exhaust emissions from 1994 and later 
model year light-duty vehicles shall meet all standards in tables H94-3 
and H94-4 in the rows designated with the applicable fuel type, 
according to the implementation schedules in tables H94-1 and H94-2, and 
shall meet all standards in tables H94-6 and H94-7 in the rows 
designated with the applicable fuel type, according to the 
implementation schedules in table H94-5, as follows:
    (A)(1)(i) For model years 1994 and 1995, a minimum of the percentage 
shown in table H94-1 of a manufacturer's sales of the applicable model 
year's light-duty vehicles shall not exceed the applicable Tier 
1<INF>I</INF> standards in table H94-3. The remaining vehicles, if any, 
shall not exceed the applicable Tier 0 standards in table H94-3.
    (ii) For model years 1996 and beyond, a minimum of the percentages 
shown in table H94-2 of a manufacturer's sales of the applicable model 
year's light-duty vehicles shall not exceed the applicable Tier 1 
standards in tables H94-3 and H94-4. The remaining vehicles, if any, 
shall not exceed the applicable Tier 1<INF>I</INF> standards in table

    (B)(1)(i) Sales percentages for the purposes of determining 
compliance with paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section shall be based on 
total actual U.S. sales of light-duty vehicles of the applicable model 
year by a manufacturer to a dealer, distributor, fleet operator, broker, 
or any other entity which comprises the point of first sale. If the 
option of paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A)(3) is taken, such sales percentages 
shall be based on the total actual combined U.S. sales of light-duty 
vehicles and light light-duty trucks of the applicable model year by a 
manufacturer to a dealer, distributor, fleet operator, broker, or any 
other entity which comprises the point of first sale.
    (ii) The manufacturer may petition the Administrator to allow actual 
volume produced for U.S. sales to be used in lieu of actual U.S. sales 
for purposes of determining compliance with the implementation schedule 
sales percentages of tables H94-1, H94-2 and H94-5 of this section. Such 
petition shall be submitted within 30 days of the end of the model year 
to the Manufacturers Operations Division. For the petition to be 
granted, the manufacturer must establish to the satisfaction of the 
Administrator that actual production volume is functionally equivalent 
to actual sales volume.
    (iii) The vehicles that are counted toward the implementation 
schedule sales percentage, or toward the total on which such percentage 
is based, for certification purposes as prescribed by Sec. 86.094-8 
(a)(1)(i)(B)(1)(iii) of subpart A of this part, shall be the same 
vehicles that are counted toward the implementation schedule sales 
percentage, or the total on which it is based, for in-use purposes.
    (iv) Small volume manufacturers, as defined in Sec. 86.092-14 (b) 
(1) and (2), are exempt from the implementation schedules of tables H94-
1 and H94-2 of this section for model years 1994 through 1997, and from 
the implementation schedule of table H94-5 of this section for model 
years 1994 and 1995. For small volume manufacturers, Tier 0 standards of 
table H94-6 continue to apply until model year 1996 and Tier 0 standards 
of table H94-3 continue to apply until model year 1998, when one hundred 
percent compliance with the Tier 1 standards of tables H94-3, H94-4, 
H94-6, and H94-7 is required. This exemption does not apply to small 
volume engine families as defined in Sec. 86.092-14 (b)(5).
    (2)(i) For 1994 and 1995 model year light-duty vehicles, the engine 
families which comprise the required implementation schedule percentage 
of sales meeting Tier 1 standards for HCs, CO, and NO<INF>X</INF>, for 
purposes of certification, shall be the same engine families which 
comprise the required implementation schedule percentage of sales 
meeting the interim in-use standards (labeled ``Tier 1<INF>I</INF>'' in 
the tables of in-use standards) for in-use purposes.
    (ii) For 1996 and 1997 model year light-duty vehicles the engine 
families which comprise the required implementation schedule percentage 
of sales meeting interim in-use standards (labeled ``Tier 
1<INF>I</INF>'' in the tables of in-use standards) and final in-use 
standards (labeled ``Tier 1'' in the tables of in-use standards) 
respectively, for HCs, CO, and NO<INF>X</INF>, for in-use purposes, 
shall be designated by the manufacturer at the time of Application for 
Certification.
    (iii) For 1994 and 1995 model year light-duty vehicles, the engine 
families

[[Page 52]]

which comprise the required implementation schedule percentage of sales 
meeting Tier 1 standards, for PM, for purposes of certification, shall 
be the same engine families which comprise the required implementation 
schedule percentage of sales meeting the final in-use standards (labeled 
``Tier 1'' in the tables of in-use standards) for PM for in-use 
purposes.
    (3) The manufacturer must state at the time of Application for 
Certification, based on projected U.S. sales or projected production for 
U.S. sale, which families will be used to attain the required 
implementation schedule sales percentages for in-use purposes.
    (4) A manufacturer cannot use one set of engine families to meet its 
in-use intermediate useful life standards and another to meet its in-use 
full useful life standards. The same families which are used to meet the 
intermediate useful life standards will be required without deviation to 
meet the corresponding full useful life standards.
    (ii) Engine families participating in the particulate averaging 
program as specified in Sec. 86.094-8 (a)(1)(ii) shall be subject, for 
purposes of in-use compliance, to the particulate family emission limit 
determined for that engine family for certification purposes, in lieu of 
the appropriate particulate standard shown in the tables of in-use 
standards in this section.
    (iii) CST emissions from model year 1996 and later gasoline-fueled 
Otto-cycle light-duty vehicles measured and calculated in accordance 
with subpart O of this part may not exceed the standards listed in 
paragraphs (a)(1)(iii) (A) and (B) of this section.
    (A) Hydrocarbons: 220 ppm as hexane.
    (B) Carbon monoxide: 1.2 percent.
    (2) The standards set forth in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section 
refer to the exhaust emitted over a driving schedule as set forth in 
subpart B of this part and measured and calculated in accordance with 
those procedures. The test weight basis for light-duty vehicles, for the 
purposes of determining equivalent test weight as prescribed in 
Sec. 86.129-94, shall be loaded vehicle weight.
    (3) The standards set forth in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section 
refer to the exhaust emitted during the CST as set forth in subpart O of 
this part and measured and calculated in accordance with those 
provisions.
    (b) The provisions of Sec. 86.090-8(b) through (h) of subpart A of 
this part apply to this section. The provisions of Sec. 86.096-8(i) 
through (k) of subpart A of this part apply to this section.

Sec. 86.709-94  In-use emission standards for 1994 and later model year light-duty trucks.

    Section 86.709-94 includes text that specifies requirements that 
differ from Sec. 86.091-9 of subpart A of this part. Where a paragraph 
in Sec. 86.091-9 is identical and applicable to Sec. 86.709-94, this may 
be indicated by specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement 
``[Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.091-9.'' Where a corresponding 
paragraph of Sec. 86.091-9 is not applicable, this is indicated by the 
statement ``[Reserved].''
    (a)(1) Standards--(i) Light light-duty trucks. In-use exhaust 
emissions from 1994 and later model year light light-duty trucks shall 
meet all standards in tables H94-9 and H94-10 in the rows designated 
with the applicable fuel type and loaded vehicle weight, according to 
the implementation schedule in table H94-8, and shall meet all standards 
in tables H94-12 and H94-13 in the rows designated with the applicable 
fuel type and loaded vehicle weight, according to the implementation 
schedules in table H94-11, as follows:
    (A)(1)(i) For model year 1994 and 1995, a minimum of the respective 
percentages shown in the Tier 1<INF>I</INF> column of table H94-8 of a 
manufacturer's sales of the applicable model year's light light-duty 
trucks shall not exceed the applicable Tier 1<INF>I</INF> standards in 
tables H94-9 and H94-10. The remaining vehicles, if any, shall not 
exceed the applicable Tier 0 standards in tables H94-9 and H94-10.
    (ii) For model years 1996 and 1997, a minimum of the percentages 
shown in the Tier 1 percentage column of table H94-8 of a manufacturer's 
sales of the applicable model year's light light-duty trucks shall not 
exceed the applicable Tier 1 standards in table H94-9 and H94-10, and 
the remaining vehicles,

[[Page 54]]

if any, shall not exceed the applicable Tier 1<INF>I</INF> standards in 
tables H94-9 and H94-10.
    (iii) For model year 1998 and beyond, a minimum of the percentage 
shown in the Tier 1 percentage column of table H94-8 of a manufacturer's 
sales of the applicable model year's light light-duty trucks shall not 
exceed the applicable Tier 1 standards in tables H94-9 and H94-10.
    (2) Particulates. For in-use exhaust emissions for 1994 and later, a 
minimum of the percentage shown in table H94-11 of a manufacturer's 
sales of the applicable model year's light light-duty trucks shall not 
exceed the applicable Tier 1 standards in tables H94-12 and H94-13. The 
remaining light light-duty trucks, if any, shall not exceed the 
applicable Tier 0 standards in tables H94-12 and H94-13.
    (3) Optionally, compliance with the Tier 1<INF>I</INF> and Tier 1 
implementation schedules of this section may be based on the combined 
sales of light-duty vehicles and light light-duty trucks, if such option 
was taken for certification as allowed in Sec. 86.094-8 and Sec. 86.094-
9 of subpart A of this part. Vehicles meeting Tier 1<INF>I</INF> in-use 
standards shall only be combined for this purpose with other vehicles 
meeting Tier 1<INF>I</INF> standards, and those meeting Tier 1 standards 
shall only be combined with those meeting the Tier 1 standards.

\1\ The applicable useful life is 10 years or 100,000 miles, whichever
  first occurs, except that no enforcement testing will be done beyond 7
  years or 75,000 miles, whichever first occurs.
\2\ Applicable only to diesel-cycle vehicles.

    (B)(1)(i) Sales percentages for the purposes of determining 
compliance with paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section shall be based on 
total actual U.S. sales of light-duty vehicles of the applicable model 
year by a manufacturer to a dealer, distributor, fleet operator, broker, 
or any other entity which comprises the point of first sale. If the 
option of paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A)(3) is taken, such sales percentages 
shall be based on the total actual combined U.S. sales of light-duty 
vehicles and light light-duty trucks of the applicable model year by a 
manufacturer to a dealer, distributor, fleet operator, broker, or any 
other entity which comprises the point of first sale.
    (ii) The manufacturer may petition the Administrator to allow actual 
volume produced for U.S. sale to be used in lieu of actual U.S. sales 
for purposes of determining compliance with the implementation schedule 
sales percentages of tables H94-8 and H94-11 of this section. Such 
petition shall be submitted within 30 days of the end of the model year 
to the Manufacturers Operations Division. For the petition to be 
granted, the manufacturer must establish to the satisfaction of the 
Administrator that actual production volume is functionally equivalent 
to actual sales volume.
    (iii) The vehicles that are counted toward the implementation 
schedule sales percentage, or toward the total on which such percentage 
is based, for certification purposes as prescribed by Sec. 86.094-
9(a)(1)(i)(B)(1)(iii) of subpart A of this part, shall be the same 
vehicles that are counted toward the implementation schedule sales 
percentage, or the total on which it is based, for in-use purposes.
    (iv) Small volume manufacturers, as defined in Sec. 86.092-14(b) (1) 
and (2), are exempt from the implementation schedules of table H94-8 of 
this section for model years 1994 through 1997 and from the 
implementation schedules of table H94-11 of this section for model years 
1995 and 1996. For small volume manufacturers, Tier 0 standards of 
tables H94-9 and H94-10 continue to apply until model year 1998 and the 
Tier 0 standards of tables H94-12 and H94-13 continue to apply until 
model year 1997, when one hundred percent compliance with the Tier 1 
standards of such tables is required. This exemption does not apply to 
small volume engine families as defined in Sec. 86.092-14 (b)(5).
    (2)(i) For 1994 and 1995 model year light light-duty trucks, the 
engine families which comprise the required implementation schedule 
percentage of sales meeting Tier 1 standards for HCs, CO, and 
NO<INF>X</INF>, for purposes of certification, shall be the same engine 
families which comprise the required implementation schedule percentage 
of sales meeting the interim in-use standards

[[Page 57]]

(labeled ``Tier 1<INF>I</INF>'' in the tables of in-use standards) for 
in-use purposes.
    (ii) For 1996 and 1997 model year light light-duty trucks, the 
engine families which comprise the required implementation schedule 
percentage of sales meeting interim in-use standards (labeled ``Tier 
1<INF>I</INF>'' in the tables of in-use standards) and final in-use 
standards (labeled ``Tier 1'' in the tables of in-use standards) 
respectively, for HCs, CO, and NO<INF>X</INF>, for in-use purposes, 
shall be designated by the manufacturer at the time of certification.
    (iii) For 1995 and 1996 model year light light-duty trucks, the 
engine families which comprise the required implementation schedule 
percentage of sales meeting Tier 1 standards, for PM, for purposes of 
certification, shall be the same engine families which comprise the 
required implementation schedule percentage of sales meeting the final 
in-use standards (labeled ``Tier 1'' in the tables of in-use standards) 
for PM for in-use purposes.
    (3) The manufacturer must state at the time of Application for 
Certification, based on projected U.S. sales or projected production for 
U.S. sale, which families will be used to attain the required 
implementation schedule sales percentages for in-use purposes.
    (4) A manufacturer can not use one set of engine families to meet 
its in-use intermediate useful life standards and another to meet its 
in-use full useful life standards. The same families which are used to 
meet the intermediate useful life standards will be required without 
deviation to meet the corresponding full useful life standards.
    (ii) Heavy light-duty trucks. In-use exhaust emissions from 1994 and 
later model year heavy light-duty trucks shall meet all standards in 
tables H94-15 and H94-16 in the rows designated with the applicable fuel 
type and loaded vehicle weight or adjusted loaded vehicle weight, as 
applicable, according to the implementation schedule in table H94-14, 
and shall meet all standards in tables H94-18 and H94-19 in the rows 
designated with the applicable fuel type and loaded vehicle weight or 
adjusted loaded vehicle weight, as applicable, according to the 
implementation schedules in table H94-17, as follows:
    (A)(1)(i) For model years 1994 through 1997, a minimum of the 
percentage shown in the Tier 1<INF>I</INF> column of table H94-14 of a 
manufacturer's sales of the applicable model year's heavy light-duty 
trucks shall not exceed the applicable Tier 1<INF>I</INF> standards in 
tables H94-15 and H94-16. The remaining vehicles, if any, shall not 
exceed the applicable Tier 0 standards in tables H94-15 and H94-16.
    (ii) For model year 1998, a minimum of the percentage shown in table 
H94-14 of a manufacturer's sales of the applicable model year's heavy 
light-duty trucks shall not exceed the applicable Tier 1 standards in 
tables H94-15 and H94-16. The remaining vehicles shall not exceed the 
applicable Tier 1<INF>I</INF> standards in tables H94-15 and H94-16.
    (iii) For model years 1999 and later, a minimum of the percentage 
shown in table H94-14 of a manufacturer's sales of the applicable model 
year's heavy light-duty trucks shall not exceed the applicable Tier 1 
standards in tables H94-15 and H94-16.
    (2) Particulates. For in-use exhaust emissions for model year 1994 
and later, a minimum of the percentage shown in table H94-17 of a 
manufacturer's sales of the applicable model year's heavy light-duty 
trucks shall not exceed the applicable Tier 1 standards in tables H94-18 
and H94-19. The remaining heavy light-duty trucks, if any, shall not 
exceed the applicable Tier 0 standards in tables H94-18 and H94-19.

    (B)(1)(i) Sales percentages for the purposes of determining 
compliance with paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section shall be based 
on total actual U.S. sales of light-duty vehicles of the applicable 
model year by a manufacturer to a dealer, distributor, fleet operator, 
broker, or any other entity which comprises the point of first sale.
    (ii) The manufacturer may petition the Administrator to allow actual 
volume produced for U.S. sales to be used in lieu of actual U.S. sales 
for purposes of determining compliance with the implementation schedule 
sales percentages of tables H94-14 and H94-17 of this section. Such 
petition shall be submitted within 30 days of the end of the model year 
to the Manufacturers Operations Division. For the petition to be 
granted, the manufacturer must establish to the satisfaction of the 
Administrator that actual production volume is functionally equivalent 
to actual sales volume.
    (iii) The vehicles that are counted toward the implementation 
schedule sales percentage, or toward the total on which such percentage 
is based, for certification purposes as prescribed by Sec. 86.094-
9(a)(1)(ii)(B)(1)(iii) of subpart A of this part, shall be the same 
vehicles that are counted toward the implementation schedule sales 
percentage, or the total on which it is based, for in-use purposes.
    (iv) Small volume manufacturers, as defined in Sec. 86.092-14(b) (1) 
and (2), are exempt from the implementation schedules of tables H94-14 
of this section for model years 1996 through 1998 and from the 
implementation schedules of table H94-17 of this section for model year 
1996. For small volume manufacturers, Tier 0 standards of tables H94-15 
and H94-16 continue to apply until model year 1999 and the Tier 0 
standards of tables H94-18 and H94-19 continue to apply until model year 
1997, when one hundred percent compliance with the Tier 1 standards of 
such tables is required. This exemption does not apply to small volume 
engine families as defined in Sec. 86.092-14(b)(5).
    (2)(i) For 1996 and 1997 model year heavy light-duty trucks, the 
engine families which comprise the required implementation schedule 
percentage of sales meeting Tier 1 standards for HCs, CO, and 
NO<INF>X</INF>, for purposes of certification, shall be the same engine 
families which comprise the required implementation schedule percentage 
of sales meeting the interim in-use standards (labeled ``Tier 
1<INF>I</INF>'' in the tables of in-use standards) for in-use purposes.
    (ii) For 1998 model year heavy light-duty trucks the engine families 
which comprise the required implementation schedule percentage of sales 
meeting interim in-use standards (labeled ``Tier 1<INF>I</INF>'' in the 
tables of in-use standards) and final in-use standards (labeled ``Tier 
1'' in the tables of in-use standards) for HCs, CO, and NO<INF>X</INF>, 
for in-use purposes, shall be designated by the manufacturer at the time 
of certification.
    (iii) For 1996 model year heavy light-duty trucks, the engine 
families which comprise the required implementation schedule percentage 
of sales meeting Tier 1 standards, for PM, for purposes of 
certification, shall be the same engine families which comprise the 
required implementation schedule percentage of sales meeting the final 
in-use standards (labeled ``Tier 1'' in the tables of in-use standards) 
for PM for in-use purposes.

[[Page 61]]

    (3) The manufacturer must state at the time of Application for 
Certification, based on projected U.S. sales or projected production for 
U.S. sale, which families will be used to attain the required 
implementation schedule sales percentages.
    (4) A manufacturer can not use one set of engine families to meet 
its in-use intermediate useful life standards and another to meet its 
in-use full useful life standards. The same families which are used to 
meet the intermediate useful life standards will be required without 
deviation to meet the corresponding full useful life standards.
    (iii) Exhaust emissions of carbon monoxide from 1994 and later model 
year light-duty trucks shall not exceed 0.50 percent of exhaust gas flow 
at curb idle at a useful life of 11 years or 120,000 miles, whichever 
first occurs (for Otto-cycle and methanol-fueled diesel-cycle light-duty 
trucks only).
    (iv)(A) Engine families participating in the applicable 
NO<INF>X</INF> averaging program as specified in Sec. 86.094-
9(a)(1)(iv)(A) shall be subject, for purposes of in-use compliance, to 
the NO<INF>X</INF> family emission limit determined for that engine 
family for certification purposes, in lieu of the appropriate 
NO<INF>X</INF> standard shown in the tables of in-use standards in this 
section.
    (B) Engine families participating in the applicable particulate 
averaging program as specified in Sec. 86.094-9(a)(1)(iv)(B) shall be 
subject, for purposes of in-use compliance, to the particulate family 
emission limit determined for that engine family for certification 
purposes, in lieu of the appropriate particulate standard shown in the 
tables of in-use standards in this section.
    (v) CST emissions from model year 1996 and later gasoline-fueled 
Otto-cycle light-duty trucks measured and calculated in accordance with 
subpart O of this part may not exceed the standards listed in paragraphs 
(a)(1)(v) (A) and (B) of this section.
    (A) Hydrocarbons: 220 ppm as hexane.
    (B) Carbon monoxide: 1.2 percent.
    (2) The standards set forth in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(ii) 
of this section refer to the exhaust emitted over a driving schedule as 
set forth in subpart B of this part and measured and calculated in 
accordance with those procedures. The test weight basis for light light-
duty trucks, and for heavy light-duty trucks certified to the Tier 0 
standards of this section, for the purposes of determining equivalent 
test weight as prescribed in Sec. 86.129-94, shall be loaded vehicle 
weight. The test weight basis for heavy light-duty trucks certified to 
the Tier 1 or Tier 1<INF>I</INF> standards of this section, for the 
purposes of determining equivalent test weight as prescribed in 
Sec. 86.129-94, shall be adjusted loaded vehicle weight. The standard 
set forth in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section refers to the exhaust 
emitted at curb idle and measured and calculated in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in subpart P of this part.
    (3) The standards set forth in paragraph (a)(1)(v) of this section 
refer to the exhaust emitted during the CST as set forth in subpart O of 
this part and measured and calculated in accordance with those 
provisions.
    (b) The provision of Sec. 86.090-8(b) through (k) of subpart A of 
this part apply to this section.

Sec. 86.884-5  Test procedures.

    The procedures described in this and subsequent sections will be the 
test program to determine the conformity of engines with the standards 
set forth in Sec. 86.084-11(b).
    (a) The test consists of a prescribed sequence of engine operating 
conditions on an engine dynamometer with continuous examination of the 
exhaust gases. The test is applicable equally to controlled engines 
equipped with means for preventing, controlling, or eliminating smoke 
emissions and to uncontrolled engines.
    (b) The test is designed to determine the opacity of smoke in 
exhaust emissions during those engine operating conditions which tend to 
promote smoke from diesel vehicles.
    (c) The test procedure begins with a preconditioned engine which is 
then run through preloading and preconditioning operations. After an 
idling period, the engine is operated through acceleration and lugging 
modes during which smoke emission measurements are made to compare with 
the standards. The engine is then returned to the idle condition and the 
acceleration and lugging modes are repeated. Three consecutive sequences 
of acceleration and lugging constitutes the full set of operating 
conditions for smoke emission measurement.
    (d)(1) Except in cases of component mulfunction or failure, all 
emission control systems installed on, or incorporated in, a new motor 
vehicle engine shall be functioning during all procedures in this 
subpart.
    (2) Maintenance to correct component malfunction or failure shall be 
authorized in accordance with Sec. 86.084-25.

<R05>
Sec. 86.884-7  Dynamometer operation cycle for smoke emission tests.

    (a) The following sequence of operations shall be performed during 
engine dynamometer testing of smoke emissions, starting with the 
dynamometer preloading determined and the engine preconditioned 
(Sec. 86.884-12(c)).
    (1) Idle Mode. The engine is caused to idle for 5.0 to 5.5 minutes 
at the manufacturer's recommended curb idle speed. The dynamometer 
controls shall be set to provide the speed and load necessary to comply 
with the heavy-duty ``curb idle'' definition per Sec. 86.084-2, in 
accordance with predominant engine application.
    (2) Acceleration mode. (i) The engine speed shall be increased to 
200 <plus-minus>50 rpm above the measured free idle speed measured at 
the point where the throttle begins to move from part-throttle to the 
full throttle position. The speed anywhere during this mode should not 
exceed this checkpoint speed by more than 50 rpm. The duration of this 
first acceleration shall be three seconds or less measured from the 
point where the speed first begins to increase above idle to the point 
where the throttle reaches full open position.
    (ii) Immediately upon completion of the mode specified in paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) of this section, the throttle shall be moved rapidly to, and 
held in, the fully open position. The inertia of the engine and the 
dynamometer, or alternately a preselected dynamometer load, shall be 
used to control the acceleration of the engine so that the speed 
increases to 85 percent of the rated speed in 5 <plus-minus>1.5 seconds. 
This acceleration shall be linear within 100 rpm as specified in 
Sec. 86.884-13(c).

[[Page 65]]

    (iii) After the engine reaches the speed required in paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii) of this section the throttle shall be moved rapidly to, and 
held in, the fully closed position. Immediately after the throttle is 
closed, the preselected load required to perform the acceleration in 
paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section shall be applied. For electric 
motoring dynamometer operation in speed mode, the deceleration shall be 
performed in 2<plus-minus>1.5 seconds.
    (iv) When the engine decelerates to the intermediate speed (within 
50 rpm), the throttle shall be moved rapidly to, and held in, the fully 
open position. The preselected dynamometer load which was applied during 
the preceding transition period shall be used to control the 
acceleration of the engine so that the speed increases to at least 95 
percent of the rated speed in 10 <plus-minus>2 seconds.
    (v) For electric dynamometer operation in speed mode, motoring 
assist may be used to offset excessive dynamometer inertia load when 
necessary. No negative flywheel torque shall occur during any of the 
three acceleration modes in paragraph (a)(2) of this section except for 
a maximum of 10ft-lbs. for the first 0.5 second of the mode.
    (3) Lugging mode. (i) Immediately upon the completion of the 
preceding acceleration mode, the dynamometer controls shall be adjusted 
to permit the engine to develop maximum horsepower at rated speed. This 
transition period shall be 50 to 60 seconds in duration. During the last 
10 seconds of this period, the average engine speed shall be maintained 
within 50 rpm of the rated speed, and the average observed power 
(corrected, if necessary, to rating conditions) shall be no less than 95 
percent of the maximum horsepower developed during the preconditioning 
prior to the smoke cycle.
    (ii) With the throttle remaining in the fully open position, the 
dynamometer controls shall be adjusted gradually so that the engine 
speed is reduced to the intermediate speed. This lugging operation shall 
be performed smoothly over a period of 35<greek-i>5 seconds. The rate of 
slowing of the engine shall be linear, within 100 rpm, as specified in 
Sec. 86.884-13(c).
    (4) Engine unloading. Within five seconds of completing the 
preceding lugging mode, the dynamometer and engine controls shall be 
returned to the idle position described in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section. The engine must be at free idle condition within one minute 
after completion of the lugging mode.
    (b) The procedures described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of 
this section shall be repeated until three consecutive valid cycles have 
been completed. If three valid cycles have not been completed after a 
total of six consecutive cycles have been run, the engine shall be 
preconditioned by operation at maximum horsepower at rated speed for 10 
minutes before the test sequence is repeated.

Sec. 86.884-8  Dynamometer and engine equipment.

    The following equipment shall be used for smoke emission testing of 
engines on engine dynamometers:
    (a) An engine dynamometer with adequate characteristics to perform 
the test cycle described in Sec. 86.884-7.
    (b) An engine cooling system having sufficient capacity to maintain 
the engine at normal operating temperatures during conduct of the 
prescribed engine tests.
    (c) An exhaust system with an appropriate type of smokemeter placed 
10 to 32 feet from the exhaust manifold(s), turbocharger outlet(s), 
exhaust aftertreatment device(s), or crossover junction (on Vee 
engines), whichever is farthest downstream. The smoke exhaust system can 
share the same hardware required in part 86, subpart N, Sec. 86.1327-
84(f)(2), insofar as that hardware also meets the following smoke test 
requirements. The smoke exhaust system shall present an exhaust 
backpressure within +0.2 inch Hg of the upper limit at maximum rated 
horsepower, as established by the engine manufacturer in his sales and 
service literature for vehicle application. The following options may 
also be used:
    (1) For engines with multiple exhaust outlets, join the exhaust 
outlets together into a single exhaust system

[[Page 66]]

and install the smokemeter 10 to 32 feet downstream from the junction of 
the individual exhaust outlets, or exhaust aftertreatment device(s), 
whichever is farthest downstream.
    (2) For engines with multiple exhaust outlets, install a smokemeter 
in each of the exhaust pipes 10 to 32 feet downstream from each exhaust 
manifold, turbocharger outlet, or exhaust aftertreatment device, 
whichever is farthest downstream.
    (3) For engines with multiple exhaust outlets, install a smokemeter 
on the exhaust pipe which produces the highest smoke levels 10 to 32 
feet downstream from the exhaust manifold, turbocharger outlet, or 
exhaust aftertreatment device, whichever is farthest downstream. It may 
be required to make smoke measurements from other exhaust outlets if 
deemed appropriate by the Administrator.
    (4) When utilizing an end-of-line smokemeter, the terminal two feet 
of the exhaust pipe used for smoke measurement shall be of a circular 
cross section and be free of elbows and bends. The end of the pipe shall 
be cut off squarely. The terminal two feet of the exhaust pipe shall 
have a nominal inside diameter in accordance with the engine being 
tested, as specified below:

    (a) Schematic drawing. The Figure I84-1 is a schematic drawing of 
the optical system of the light extinction meter.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.182

    (b) Equipment. The following equipment shall be used in the system.
    (1) Adapter--the smokemeter optical unit may be mounted on a fixed 
or

[[Page 67]]

movable frame. The normal unrestricted shape of the exhaust plume shall 
not be modified by the adaptor, the meter, or any ventilatory system 
used to remove the exhaust from the test site.
    (2) Smokemeter (light extinction meter)--continuous recording, full-
flow light obscuration meter.
    (i) It is positioned so that a built-in light beam traverses the 
exhaust smoke plume at right angles to the axis of the exhaust stream.
    (ii) The smokemeter light source shall be an incandescent lamp with 
a color temperature range of 2800K to 3250K, or a light source with a 
spectral peak between 550 to 570 nanometers.
    (iii) The light output is collimated to a beam with a maximum 
diameter of 1.125 inches and an included angle of divergence within a 
6 deg. included angle.
    (iv) The light detector shall be a photocell or photodiode. If the 
light source is an incandescent lamp, the detector shall have a spectral 
response similar to the photopic curve of the human eye (a maximum 
response in the range of 550 to 570 nanometers, to less than 4 percent 
of that maximum response below 430 nanometers and above 680 nanometers).
    (v) A collimating tube with apertures equal to the beam diameter is 
attached to the detector to restrict the viewing angle of the detector 
to within a 16 deg. included angle.
    (vi) An amplified signal corresponding to the amount of light 
blocked is recorded continuously on a remote recorder.
    (vii) An air curtain across the light source and detector window 
assemblies may be used to minimize deposition of smoke particles on 
those surfaces provided that it does not measurably affect the opacity 
of the plume.
    (viii) The smokemeter consists of two units; an optical unit and a 
remote control unit.
    (ix) Light extinction meters employing substantially identical 
measurement principles and producing substantially equivalent results, 
but which employ other electronic and optical techniques, may be used 
only after having been approved in advance by the Administrator.
    (3) Recorder--a continuous recorder, with variable chart speed over 
a minimal range of 0.5 to 8.0 inches per minute (or equivalent) and an 
automatic marker indicating 1-second intervals continuously records the 
exhaust gas opacity, engine rpm and throttle position.
    (i) The recorder is equipped to indicate only when the throttle is 
in the fully open or fully closed position.
    (ii) The recorder scale for opacity is linear and calibrated to read 
from 0 to 100 percent opacity full scale.
    (iii) The opacity trace has a resolution within one percent opacity.
    (iv) The recorder scale for engine rpm is linear and has a 
resolution of 30 rpm.

provided it produces a permanent visual data record of quality equal to 
or better than that described above (e.g., tabulated data, traces, or 
plots).
    (4) The recorder used with the smokemeter shall be capable of full-
scale deflection in 0.5 second or less. The smokemeter-recorder 
combination may be damped so that signals with a frequency higher than 
10 cycles per second are attenuated. A separate lowpass electronic 
filter with the following performance characteristics may be installed 
between the smokemeter and the recorder to achieve the high-frequency 
attenuation:
    (i) Three decibel point--10 cycles per second.
    (ii) Insertion loss--zero <plus-minus>0.5 decibel.
    (iii) Selectivity--12 decibels per octave above 10 cycles per 
second.
    (iv) Attenuation--27 decibels down at 40 cycles per second minimum.
    (5) In lieu of the use of chart recorders, automatic data collection 
equipment may be used to record all required data. Automatic data 
processing equipment may then be used to perform the data analysis 
specified in Sec. 86.884-13. The automatic data collection equipment 
must be capable of sampling at least two records per second.
    (c) Assembling equipment. (1) The optical unit of the smokemeter 
shall be mounted radially to the exhaust pipe

[[Page 68]]

so that the measurement will be made at right angles to the axis of the 
exhaust plume. For an end-of-line smokemeter the distance from the 
optical centerline to the exhaust pipe outlet shall be 1 
<plus-minus>0.25 inch. The full flow of the exhaust stream shall be 
centered between the source and the detector apertures (or windows and 
lenses) and on the axis of the light beam.
    (2) Power shall be supplied to the control unit of the smokemeter in 
time to allow at least 15 minutes for stabilization prior to testing.

<R05>
Sec. 86.884-13  Data analysis.

    The following procedure shall be used to analyze the test data:
    (a) Locate the modes specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(1) through (a)(4) 
by applying the following starting and ending criteria:
    (1) The idle mode specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(1) starts when 
engine preconditioning or the lugging mode of a preceding cycle has been 
completed and ends when the engine speed is raised above the idle speed.
    (2) The acceleration mode specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(2)(i) starts 
when the preceding idle mode has been completed and ends when the 
throttle is in the fully open position, as indicated by the throttle 
position trace as specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(2)(ii).
    (3) The acceleration mode specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(2)(ii) 
starts when the preceding acceleration mode has been completed and ends 
when the engine speed reaches 85 percent of the rated speed.
    (4) The transition period specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(2)(iii) 
starts when the preceding acceleration mode has been completed and ends 
when the throttle is in the fully open position as indicated by the 
throttle position trace, as specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(2)(iv).
    (5) The acceleration mode specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(2)(iv) 
starts when the preceding transition period has been completed and ends 
when the engine speed reaches 95 percent of the rated speed.
    (6) The transition period specified in Sec. 86.884-7 (a)(3)(i) 
starts when the preceding acceleration mode has been completed and ends 
when the engine speed is 50 rpm below the rated speed and the provisions 
of Sec. 86.884-7 (a)(3)(i) are met.
    (7) The lugging mode specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(3)(ii) starts 
when the preceding transition period has been completed and ends when 
the engine speed is at the intermediate speed.
    (b) Determine if the test requirements of Sec. 86.884-7 are met by 
applying the following modal criteria:
    (1) Idle mode as specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(1):
    (i) Duration: 5 to 5.5 minutes.
    (ii) Speed: within specification during the last four minutes of the 
mode.
    (2) Acceleration mode as specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(2)(i).
    (i) Duration: three seconds or less.
    (ii) Speed increase: 200<plus-minus>50 rpm.
    (3) Acceleration mode as specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(2)(ii);

closed position.
    (5) Acceleration mode as specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(2)(iv):
    (i) Duration: 8 to 12 seconds.
    (ii) Throttle position: fully open when speed is at intermediate 
speed.
    (6) Transition period as specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(3)(i):
    (i) Duration: 50 to 60 seconds.
    (ii) Average speed during the last 10 seconds shall be within 
<plus-minus>50 rpm of rated speed.
    (iii) Average observed power during the last 10 seconds shall be at 
least 95 percent of the horsepower developed during the preconditioning 
mode.

[[Page 71]]

starting and ending points specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section.
    (2) For the lugging mode specified in Sec. 86.884-7(a)(3)(ii), note 
the maximum deflection of the rpm trace from a straight line drawn from 
the starting and ending points specified in paragraph (a)(7) of this 
section.
    (3) The test results will be invalid if any deflection is greater 
than 100 rpm.
    (4) This linearity check may be performed by direct analysis of the 
recorder traces, or by computer analysis of data collected by automatic 
data collection equipment.
    (d) Analyze the smoke trace by means of the following procedure:
    (1) Starting at the beginning of the first acceleration, as defined 
in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and stopping at the end of the 
second acceleration, as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, 
divide the smoke trace into half-second intervals. Similarly, subdivide 
into half-second intervals the third acceleration mode and the lugging 
mode as defined by paragraphs (a) (5) and (7) respectively, of this 
section.
    (2) Determine the average smoke reading during each half-second 
interval.
    (3) Locate and record the 15 highest half-second readings during the 
acceleration mode of each dynamometer cycle.
    (4) Locate and record the five highest half-second readings during 
the lugging mode of each dynamometer cycle.
    (5) Examine the average half-second values which were determined in 
paragraphs (d)(3) and (d)(4) of this section and record the three 
highest values for each dynamometer cycle.
    (6) This smoke trace analysis may be performed by direct analysis of 
the recorder traces, or by computer analysis of data collected by 
automatic data collection equipment.

<R05>
Sec. 86.884-14  Calculations.

    (a) If the measured half-second opacity values were obtained with a 
smokemeter with an optical path length different than shown in the table 
in Sec. 86.884-8(c), then convert the measured half-second values or the 
original instantaneous values to the appropriate equivalent optical path 
length values specified in the table. Convert the opacity values 
according to the following equations:

N<INF>s</INF>=100x(1-(1-N<INF>m</INF>/100)<SUP>L</SUP>s/Lm)

L<INF>m</INF> and L<INF>s</INF> must use consistent units in the above 
    equation


Where:

N<INF>m</INF>=Measured half-second value for conversion, percent opacity
L<INF>m</INF>=Measuring smokemeter optical path length, meters
L<INF>s</INF>=Standard optical path length corresponding with engine 
    power, n
N<INF>s</INF>=Standard half-second value, percent opacity

    (b) Average the 45 readings in Sec. 86.884-13(d)(3) or the 
equivalent converted values from paragraph (a) of this section if 
appropriate, and designate the value as ``A''. This is the value for the 
engine acceleration mode.
    (c) Average the 15 readings in Sec. 86.884-13(d)(4) or the 
equivalent converted values from paragraph (a) of this section if 
appropriate, and designate the value as ``B''. This is the value for the 
engine lugging mode.
    (d) Average the 9 readings in Sec. 86.884-13(d)(5) or the equivalent 
converted values from paragraph (a) of this section if appropriate, and 
designate the value as ``C''. This is the value for the peaks in either 
mode.
    (e)(1) If multiple smokemeters were used, the half-second values for 
each mode from each smokemeter shall be combined and the calculated 
average based upon the total number of combined values.
    (2) For example, if two smokemeters were used for acceleration mode 
data, 45 half-second values in each data set from both smokemeters would 
be combined to form a data set of 90 values, which would then be 
averaged.

Sec. 86.908-93  Waivers and refunds.

    (a) Request for waiver. The Administrator may waive part of any fee 
imposed by Sec. 86.907 of this subpart.
    (1) A waiver will be granted to an applicant if the Administrator 
determines that:
    (i) The certificate is to be used for sale of vehicles or engines 
within the United States; and
    (ii) The full fee for a certification request for a MY exceeds 1% of 
the aggregate projected retail sales price of all vehicles covered by 
that certificate.
    (iii) For converted vehicles that are dual- or flexible-fuel 
vehicles and can operate on a gaseous fuel, the full fee

[[Page 74]]

for a certification request for a MY exceeds 1% of the value added to 
the vehicle by the conversion, for MY 2000 through 2003.
    (2) The request for waiver must be submitted prior to the payment of 
any fee and shall include evidence, such as prior actual sales, retail 
sales price, and previous waiver requests, clearly showing that the 
applicant satisfies the two waiver criteria. The retail sales price will 
be based on the total projected sales of all vehicles under a 
certificate, including vehicles modified under the modification and test 
option in 40 CFR 85.1509. For an ICI certificate, the retail sales price 
shall be based on the applicable National Automobile Dealer's 
Association (NADA) appraisal guide and/or other evidence of the actual 
market value.
    (3) If a waiver is granted, the fee to be paid by the applicant 
shall be 1% of the aggregate projected retail sales price of the 
vehicles or engines to be covered by the certification request.
    (4) The waiver request will be reviewed by EPA.
    (i) EPA or its designee will analyze each waiver request to 
determine whether the applicant has met the standards for a waiver and 
then will notify the applicant of its grant or denial.
    (ii) If the request is denied, the applicant will have 30 days from 
the date of notification of the denial to submit the appropriate fee to 
EPA or appeal the denial.
    (5) Whenever the aggregate projected retail sales price of the 
vehicles or engines to be covered by the certification request changes 
and/or the certificate which is under a fee waiver expires, the 
applicant, as appropriate:
    (i) Shall submit a filing form with payment of the additional waiver 
fee; or
    (ii) May submit a request for a refund.
    (6) The total waiver fee shall not exceed the full fee amount for 
the applicable certification request type.
    (b) Request for refund. The Administrator may refund a specified 
part of any fee imposed by Sec. 86.907 of this subpart if the applicant 
fails to obtain a signed certificate and requests a refund.
    (1) That portion of the total fee to be refunded will be as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) For a refund of a portion of a waiver payment due to a decrease 
in the projected retail sales price of the vehicles or engines to be 
covered by the certification request the applicant should submit 
documentation to EPA detailing the waiver fee adjustment.
    (c) Waiver and refund address. A request for a waiver or refund of 
part of a fee shall be submitted in writing by the applicant to the 
Environmental Protection Agency, Motor Vehicle and Engine Compliance 
Program, Certification Division, 2565 Plymouth Road, Ann Arbor, MI 
48105.
    (d)(1) For model years 2000 through 2003, the required fees under 
this subpart shall be waived for any light-duty vehicle, light-duty 
truck, or heavy-duty engine family that meets the small volume sales 
requirements of Sec. 86.1838-01 and:
    (i) Is a dedicated gaseous-fueled vehicle or engine OR;
    (ii) Receives a certificate of conformity with the LEV, ILEV, ULEV, 
or ZEV emissions standards in 40 CFR part 88.
    (2) If the manufacturer does not receive a certificate of conformity 
with the LEV, ILEV, ULEV, or ZEV emissions standards in 40 CFR part 88 
as required in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section, the fee 
requirements of this section will apply. Before any certificate can be 
issued, the applicable fee must be paid.
    (3) Manufacturers that have paid certification fees for model year 
2000 vehicle and engine families that meet the criteria in paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section may request a refund of such fees. EPA shall 
refund such fees if it determines that the vehicle or engine family 
meets the criteria of paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

Sec. 86.1003-90  Test orders.

    (a) The Administrator shall require any testing under this subpart 
by means of a test order addressed to the manufacturer.
    (b) The test order will be signed by the Assistant Administrator for 
Air and Radiation or his designee. The test order will be delivered in 
person by an EPA Enforcement Officer to a company representative or sent 
by registered mail, return receipt requested, to the manufacturer's 
representative who signs the Application for Certification submitted by 
the manufacturer pursuant to the requirements of this applicable section 
of subpart A of this part. Upon receipt of a test order, the 
manufacturer shall comply with all of the provisions of this subpart and 
instructions in the test order.
    (c)(1) The test order will specify the engine or vehicle 
configuration selected for testing, the manufacturer's vehicle or engine 
assembly plant or associated storage facility from which the engines or 
vehicles must be selected, the time and location at which engines or 
vehicles must be selected, and the procedure by which engines or 
vehicles of the specified configuration must be selected. The test order 
may specify the number of vehicles or engines to be selected per day.
    (i) If the total production of the specified vehicle configuration 
is less than the number specified in the test order, the manufacturer 
will select the actual number of vehicles produced per day.
    (ii) Heavy-duty engine manufacturers will be required to select a 
minimum of four engines per day unless an alternate selection procedure 
is approved pursuant to Sec. 86.1007-84(a) or unless total production of 
the specified configuration is less than four engines per day. If total 
production of the specified configuration is less than four engines per 
day, the manufacturer will select the actual number of engines produced 
that day.
    (2) The test order may include alternative configurations to be 
selected for testing in the event that engines or vehicles of the 
specified configuration are not available for testing because those 
engines or vehicles are not being manufactured during the specified 
time, or not being stored at the specified assembly plant or associated 
storage facilities.

[[Page 78]]

    (3) If the specified configuration is not being manufactured at a 
rate of at least four vehicles per day, in the case of light-duty truck 
manufacturers, two engines per day, in the case of heavy-duty engine 
manufacturers specified in paragraph (g)(1) of Sec. 86.1008-84 or one 
engine per day, in the case of heavy-duty engine manufacturers specified 
in paragraph (g)(2) of Sec. 86.1008-90, over the expected duration of 
the audit, the Assistant Administrator or his designated representative 
may select engines or vehicles of the alternate configuration for 
testing.
    (4) In addition, the test order may include other directions or 
information essential to the administration of the required testing.
    (d) A manufacturer may submit a list of engine families and the 
corresponding assembly plants or associated storage facilities from 
which the manufacturer prefers to have engines or vehicles selected for 
testing or response to a test order. In order that a manufacturer's 
preferred location be considered for inclusion in a test order for a 
configuration of a particular engine family, the list must be submitted 
prior to issuance of the test order. Notwithstanding the fact that a 
manufacturer has submitted the above list, the Administrator may order 
selection at other than a preferred location.
    (e) Upon receipt of a test order, a manufacturer shall proceed in 
accordance with the provisions of this subpart.
    (f)(1) During a given model year, the Administrator shall not issue 
to a manufacturer more Selective Enforcement Audit (SEA) test orders 
than an annual limit determined by the following:
    (i) For manufacturers of heavy-duty engines, either petroleum-fueled 
or methanol-fueled, the number determined by dividing the projected 
heavy-duty engine sales bound for the United States market for that 
year, as made by the manufacturer in its Application for Certification, 
by 30,000 and rounding to the nearest whole number, unless the projected 
sales are less than 15,000, in which case the number is one;
    (ii) For manufacturers of petroleum-fueled or methanol-fueled light-
duty trucks, the number determined by dividing the projected light-duty 
truck sales bound for the United States market for that model year, as 
made by the manufacturer in its report submitted under paragraph (a)(2) 
of Sec. 600.207-80 of the Automobile Fuel Economy Regulations, by 
300,000 and rounding to the nearest whole number, unless the projected 
sales are less than 150,000, in which case the number is one.
    (iii) If a manufacturer submits to EPA in writing prior to or during 
the model year a reliable sales projection update, that update will be 
used for recalculating the manufacturer's annual limit of SEA test 
orders.
    (2) Any SEA test order for which the configuration fails in 
accordance with Sec. 86.1010 or for which testing is not completed will 
not be counted against the annual limit.
    (3) When the annual limit has been met, the Administrator may issue 
additional test orders for those configurations for which evidence 
exists indicating noncompliance. An SEA test order issued on this basis 
will include a statement as to the reason for its issuance.

vehicles manufactured by the manufacturer conform with the regulations 
with respect to which the certificate of conformity was issued.
    (b)(1) Whenever the Administrator conducts a test on a test engine 
or vehicle or the Administrator and manufacturer each conduct a test on 
the same test engine or vehicle, the results of the Administrator's test 
will comprise the official data for that engine or vehicle.
    (2) Whenever the manufacturer conducts all tests on a test engine or 
vehicle, the manufacturer's test data will be accepted as the official 
data: Provided, That if the Administrator makes a determination based on 
testing under paragraph (a) of this section that there is a substantial 
lack of agreement between the manufacturer's test results and the 
Administrator's test results, no manufacturer's test data from the 
manufacturer's test facility will be accepted for purposes of this 
subpart.
    (c) If testing conducted under paragraph (a) of this section 
demonstrates a lack of agreement under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, 
the Administrator shall:
    (1) Notify the manufacturer in writing of his determination that the 
test facility is inappropriate for conducting the tests required by this 
subpart and the reasons therefor; and
    (2) Reinstate any manufacturer's data upon a showing by the 
manufacturer that the data acquired under paragraph (a) of this section 
was erroneous and the manufacturer's data was correct.
    (d) The manufacturer may request in writing that the Administrator 
reconsider his determination in paragraph (b)(2) of this section based 
on data or information which indicates that changes have been made to 
the test facility and these changes have resolved the reasons for 
disqualification.

Sec. 86.1007-84  Sample selection.

    (a) Engines or vehicles comprising a test sample which are required 
to be tested, pursuant to a test order issued in accordance with this 
subpart, will be selected at the location and in the manner specified in 
the test order. If a manufacturer determines that the test engines or 
vehicles cannot be selected in the manner specified in the test order, 
an alternative selection procedure may be employed: Provided, That the 
manufacturer requests approval of the alternative procedure in advance 
of the start of test sample selection and that the Administrator 
approves the procedure.
    (b) The manufacturer shall have assembled the test engines or 
vehicles of the configuration selected for testing using its normal mass 
production process for engines or vehicles to be distributed into 
commerce. During the audit, the manufacturer shall inform the 
Administrator of any change(s) implemented in its production processes, 
including quality control, which may reasonably be expected to affect 
the emissions of the vehicles or engines selected, between the time the 
manufacturer is notified of a test order and the time the manufacturer 
finishes selecting test vehicles or engines. In the case of heavy-duty 
engines, if the test engines are selected at a location where they do 
not have their operational and emission control systems installed, the 
test order will specify the manner and location for selection of 
components to complete assembly of the engines. The manufacturer shall 
assemble these components onto the test engines using normal assembly 
and quality control procedures as documented by the manufacturer.
    (c) No quality control, testing, or assembly procedures will be used 
on the completed test engine or vehicle or any portion thereof, 
including parts and subassemblies, that has not been or will not be used 
during the production and assembly of all other engines or vehicles of 
that configuration, except, that the Administrator may approve a 
modification in the normal assembly procedures pursuant to paragraph (b) 
of this section.
    (d) The test order may specify that EPA Enforcement Officers, rather 
than the manufacturer, will select the test engines or vehicles 
according to the method specified in the test order.
    (e) The order in which test engines or vehicles are selected 
determines the order in which test results are to be used in applying 
the sampling plan in accordance with Sec. 86.1010-84.
    (f) The manufacturer shall keep on hand all untested engines or 
vehicles, if any, comprising the test sample until such time as a pass 
or fail decision is reached in accordance with Sec. 86.1010-84(d). The 
manufacturer may ship any tested engine or vehicle which has not failed 
in accordance with Sec. 86.1010-84(b). However, once the manufacturer 
ships any test engine or vehicle, it relinquishes the prerogative to 
conduct retests as provided in Sec. 86.1008-84(i).

<R05>
Sec. 86.1008-90  Test procedures.

    (a)(1)(i) For heavy-duty engines, the prescribed test procedure is 
the Federal Test Procedure, as described in subparts N, I, and P of this 
part.
    (ii) For heavy-duty vehicles with a GVW of less than 14,000 pounds 
(6,400 kilograms), the prescribed test procedure is the Fuel Dispensing 
Spitback Test as described in 86.1246-96 of this part. The test for fuel 
spitback is conducted as a stand-alone test, thus all references to the 
test sequence described in figure M96-1 of subpart M of this part can be 
ignored.
    (iii) During the testing of heavy-duty diesel engines, the 
manufacturer shall decide for each engine, prior to the start of the 
initial cold cycle, whether the measurement of background particulate is 
required for the cold and hot cycles to be valid. The manufacturer may 
choose to have different requirements for the cold and hot cycles. If a 
manufacturer chooses to require the measurement of background 
particulate, failure to measure background particulate shall void the 
test cycle regardless of the test results. If a test cycle is void, the 
manufacturer shall

[[Page 84]]

retest using the same validity requirements of the initial test.
    (2) For light-duty trucks, the prescribed test procedure is the 
Federal Test Procedure as described in subparts B, P, and/or C of this 
part. The manufacturer shall not perform the evaporative emission test 
procedures contained in subpart B of this part. The Administrator may, 
based on advance application by a manufacturer, approve optional test 
procedures for use in Selective Enforcement Audit testing.
    (3) When testing light-duty trucks the following exceptions to the 
test procedures in subpart B are applicable:
    (i) For mileage accumulation, the manufacturer may use test fuel 
meeting the specifications of mileage and service accumulation fuels of 
Sec. 86.113. Otherwise, the manufacturer may use fuels other than those 
specified in this section only with the advance approval of the 
Administrator.
    (ii) The manufacturer may measure the temperature of the test fuel 
at other than the approximate mid-volume of the fuel tank, as specified 
in Sec. 86.131-96(a) with only a single temperature sensor, and may 
drain the test fuel from other than the lowest point of the tank, as 
specified in Sec. 86.131-96(b), provided an equivalent method is used. 
Equivalency documentation shall be maintained by the manufacturers and 
shall be made available to the Administrator upon request.
    (iii) The manufacturer may perform additional preconditioning on SEA 
test vehicles other than the preconditioning specified in Sec. 86.132 
only if the additional preconditioning had been performed on 
certification test vehicles of the same configuration.
    (iv) If the Administrator elects to use the evaporative canister 
preconditioning procedure described in Sec. 86.132-96(k), the 
manufacturer shall perform the heat build procedure 11 to 34 hours 
following vehicle preconditioning rather than according to the time 
period specified in Sec. 86.133-90(a). All references in Sec. 86.133-90 
to an evaporative emission enclosure (SHED) and analyzing for HC during 
the heat build can be ignored.

tires on the vehicle as specified in paragraph (e) of Sec. 86.135-90: 
Provided, that the slave tires are the same size.
    (vi) If the Administrator elects to use the evaporative canister 
preconditioning procedure described in Sec. 86.132-96(k), the cold start 
exhaust test described in Sec. 86.137 shall follow the heat build 
procedure described in Sec. 86.133-90 by not more than one hour.
    (vii) In performing exhaust sample analysis under Sec. 86.140.
    (A) When testing diesel vehicles or methanol-fueled vehicles, the 
manufacturer shall allow a minimum of 20 minutes warm-up for the HC 
analyzer, and a minimum of 2 hours warm-up for the CO, CO<INF>2</INF> 
and NO<INF>X</INF> analyzers. (Power is normally left on infrared and 
chemiluminescent analyzers. When not in use, the chopper motors of the 
infrared analyzers are turned off and the phototube high voltage supply 
to the chemiluminescent analyzers is placed in the standby position.)
    (B) The manufacturer shall exercise care to prevent moisture from 
condensing in the sample collection bags.
    (viii) The manufacturer need not comply with Sec. 86.142, since the 
records required therein are provided under other provisions of subpart 
K of this part.
    (ix) In addition to the requirements of subpart B of this part, the 
manufacturer shall prepare gasoline-fueled vehicles and methanol-fueled 
vehicles as follows prior to exhaust emission testing:
    (A) The manufacturer shall inspect the fuel system to insure the 
absence of any leaks of liquid or vapor to the atmosphere by applying a 
pressure of 14.5 + 0.5 inches of water to the fuel system, allowing the 
pressure to stabilize, and isolating the fuel system from the pressure 
source. Following isolation of the fuel system, pressure must not drop 
more than 2.0 inches of water in five minutes. If required, the 
manufacturer shall perform corrective action in accordance with 
Sec. 86.1008 and report this action in accordance with Sec. 86.1009.
    (B) When performing this pressure check, the manufacturer shall 
exercise care to neither purge nor load the evaporative emission control 
system.

[[Page 85]]

    (C) The manufacturer shall not modify the test vehicle's evaporative 
emission control system by component addition, deletion, or 
substitution, except to comply with paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section 
if approved in advance by the Administrator.
    (4) The Administrator, may on the basis of a written application by 
a manufacturer, prescribe minor test procedure variations from those set 
forth in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section for any heavy-duty 
engine.
    (5) When testing light-duty trucks, the following exceptions to the 
test procedures in subpart C of this part are applicable:
    (i) The manufacturer may measure the temperature of the test fuel at 
other than the approximate mid-volume of the fuel tank as specified in 
Sec. 86.231(a) and may drain the test fuel from other than the lowest 
point of the fuel tank as specified in Sec. 86.231(b) provided an 
equivalent method is used. Equivalency documentation shall be maintained 
by the manufacturer and shall be made available to the Administrator 
upon request.
    (ii) In performing exhaust sample analysis under Sec. 86.240, the 
manufacturer shall exercise care to prevent moisture from condensing in 
the sample collection bags.
    (iii) The manufacturer need not comply with Sec. 86.242 since the 
records required therein are provided under other provisions of subpart 
K of this part.
    (iv) In addition to the requirements of subpart C of this part, the 
manufacturer shall prepare gasoline-fueled vehicles as follows prior to 
exhaust emission testing.
    (A) The manufacturer shall inspect the fuel system to ensure the 
absence of any leaks of liquid or vapor to the atmosphere by applying a 
pressure of 14.5<plus-minus>0.5 inches of water (3.6<plus-minus>0.1 kPa) 
in the fuel system allowing the pressure to stabilize and isolating the 
fuel system from the pressure sources. Following isolation of the fuel 
system, pressure must not drop more than 2.0 inches of water (0.5 kPa) 
in 5 minutes. If required, the manufacturer shall perform corrective 
action in accordance with paragraph Sec. 86.1008(d) and report this 
action in accordance with paragraph Sec. 86.1009(d).
    (B) When performing this pressure check, the manufacturer shall 
exercise care to neither purge nor load the evaporative emission control 
system.
    (C) The manufacturer shall not modify the test vehicle's evaporative 
emission control system by component addition, deletion, or 
substitution, except if approved in advance by the Administrator to 
comply with paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section.
    (b)(1) The manufacturer shall not adjust, repair, prepare, or modify 
the engines or vehicles selected for testing and shall not perform any 
emission tests on engines or vehicles selected for testing and shall not 
perform any emission tests on engines or vehicles selected for testing 
pursuant to the test order unless this adjustment, repair, preparation, 
modification, and/or tests are documented in the manufacturer's engine 
or vehicle assembly and inspection procedures and are actually performed 
or unless these adjustments and/or test are required or permitted under 
this subpart or are approved in advance by the Administrator.
    (2) For 1984 and later model years the Administrator may adjust or 
cause to be adjusted any engine parameter which the Administrator has 
determined to be subject to adjustment for certification, Selective 
Enforcement Audit, and Production Compliance Audit testing in accordance 
with Sec. 86.090-22(e)(1), to any setting within the physically 
adjustable range of that parameter, as determined by the Administrator 
in accordance with Sec. 86.090-22(e)(3)(ii), prior to the performance of 
any tests. However, if the idle speed parameter is one which the 
Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment, the 
Administrator shall not adjust it to any setting which causes a lower 
engine idle speed than would have been possible within the physically 
adjustable range of the idle speed parameter if the manufacturer had 
accumulated 125 hours of service on the engine or 4,000 miles on the 
vehicle under paragraph (c) of this section, all other parameters being 
identically adjusted for the purpose of the comparison. The manufacturer 
may be requested to supply information to establish such an alternative 
minimum

[[Page 86]]

idle speed. The Administrator, in making or specifying these 
adjustments, may consider the effect of the deviation from the 
manufacturer's recommended setting on emissions performance 
characteristics as well as the likelihood that similar settings will 
occur on in-use heavy-duty engines or light-duty trucks. In determining 
likelihood, the Administrator may consider factors such as, but not 
limited to, the effect of the adjustment on engine or vehicle 
performance characteristics and surveillance information from similar 
in-use engines or vehicles.
    (c) Prior to performing exhaust emission testing on an SEA test 
engine, the manufacturer may accumulate on each engine a number of hours 
of service equal to the greater of 125 hours or the number of hours the 
manufacturer accumulated during certification on the emission-data 
engine corresponding to the configuration specified in the test order. 
Prior to performing exhaust emission testing on an SEA test vehicle, the 
manufacturer may accumulate a number of miles equal to the greater of 
4,000 miles or the number of miles the manufacturer accumulated during 
certification on the emission data vehicle corresponding to the 
configuration specified in the test order.
    (1) Service or mileage accumulation must be performed in a manner 
using good engineering judgment to obtain emission results 
representative of normal production vehicles. This service or mileage 
accumulation must be consistent with the new vehicle break-in 
instructions contained in the applicable vehicle owner's manual, if any.
    (2) The manufacturer shall accumulate service at a minimum rate of 
16 hours per engine or mileage at a minimum rate of 300 miles per 
vehicle during each 24-hour period, unless otherwise provided by the 
Administrator.
    (i) The first 24 hour period for service or mileage accumulation 
shall begin as soon as authorization checks, inspections and 
preparations are completed on each engine or vehicle.
    (ii) The minimum service or mileage accumulation rate does not apply 
on weekends or holidays.
    (iii) If the manufacturer's service or mileage accumulation target 
is less than the minimum rate specified (16 hours or 300 miles per day), 
then the minimum daily accumulation rate shall be equal to the 
manufacturer's service or mileage accumulation target.
    (3) Service or mileage accumulation shall be completed on a 
sufficient number of test engines or vehicles during consecutive 24-hour 
periods to assure that the number of engines or vehicles tested per day 
fulfills the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section.
    (d) The manufacturer shall not perform any maintenance on test 
vehicles or engines after selection for testing, nor shall the 
Administrator allow deletion of any test vehicle or engine from the test 
sequence, unless requested by the manufacturer, and approved by the 
Administrator before any test vehicle or engine maintenance or deletion.
    (e) The manufacturer shall expeditiously ship test engines or 
vehicles from the point of selection to the test facility. If the test 
facility is not located at or in close proximity to the point of 
selection, the manufacturer shall assure that test engines or vehicles 
arrive at the test facility within 24 hours of selection: Except, that 
the Administrator may approve more time based upon a request by the 
manufacturer accompanied by a satisfactory justification.
    (f) If an engine or vehicle cannot complete the service or mileage 
accumulation or emission test because of a malfunction, the manufacturer 
may request that the Administrator authorize the repair of that engine 
or vehicle or its deletion from the test sequence.
    (g) Whenever a manufacturer conducts testing pursuant to a test 
order issued under this subpart, the manufacturer shall notify the 
Administrator within one working day of receipt of the test order which 
test facility will be used to comply with the test order. If no test 
cells are available at a desired facility, the manufacturer must provide 
alternate testing capability satisfactory to the Administrator.
    (1) Heavy-duty engine manufacturers with projected sales for the 
United States market for that year of 30,000 or greater shall complete 
emission testing at their facility on a minimum of two engines per 24-
hour period, including

[[Page 87]]

each voided test and each diesel engine smoke test.
    (2) Heavy-duty engine manufacturers with projected sales for the 
United States market for that year of less than 30,000 shall complete

Sec. 86.1008-2001  Test procedures.

    (a)(1)(i) For heavy-duty engines, the prescribed test procedure is 
the Federal Test Procedure as described in subparts N, I, and P of this 
part. The Administrator, may on the basis of a written application by a 
manufacturer, approve optional test procedures other than those in 
subparts N, I, and P of this part for any heavy-duty vehicle which is 
not susceptible to satisfactory testing using the procedures in subparts 
N, I, and P of this part.
    (ii) For heavy-duty vehicles the prescribed test procedures are the 
Fuel Dispensing Spitback Test as described in Sec. 86.1246-96 (for HDVs 
with a GVW of less than 14,000 pounds (6,400 kilograms)); this test for 
fuel spitback is conducted as a stand alone test, thus all references to 
the test sequence described in figure M96-1 of subpart M of this part 
can be ignored. Further, the Administrator may, on the basis of a 
written application by a manufacturer, approve optional test procedures 
other than those in subpart M of this part for any heavy-duty vehicle 
which is not susceptible to satisfactory testing using the procedures in 
subpart M of this part.
    (iii) During the testing of heavy-duty diesel engines, the 
manufacturer shall decide for each engine, prior to the start of the 
initial cold cycle, whether the measurement of background particulate is 
required for the cold and hot cycles to be valid. The manufacturer may 
choose to have different requirements for the cold and hot cycles. If a 
manufacturer chooses to require the measurement of background 
particulate, failure to measure background particulate shall void the 
test cycle regardless of the test results. If a test cycle is void, the 
manufacturer shall retest using the same validity requirements of the 
initial test.
    (2) For light-duty trucks, the prescribed test procedures are the 
Federal Test Procedure as described in subpart B and/or subpart R of 
this part, whichever is applicable, the idle CO test procedure as 
described in subpart P of this part, the cold temperature CO test 
procedure as described in subpart C of this part, and the Certification 
Short Test procedure as described in subpart O of this part. For 
purposes of Selective Enforcement Audit Testing, the manufacturer shall 
not be required to perform any of the test procedures in subpart B of 
this part relating to evaporative emission testing, other than refueling 
emissions testing, except as specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section. The Administrator may select and prescribe the sequence of any 
CSTs. Further, the Administrator may, on the basis of a written 
application by a manufacturer, approve optional test procedures other 
than those in subparts B, C, P, O, and R of this part for any motor 
vehicle which is not susceptible to satisfactory testing using the 
procedures in subparts B, C, P, O, and R of this part.
    (3) When testing light-duty trucks, the following exceptions to the 
test procedures in subpart B and/or subpart R of this part are 
applicable to Selective Enforcement Audit testing:
    (i) For mileage accumulation, the manufacturer may use test fuel 
meeting the specifications for mileage and service accumulation fuels of 
Sec. 86.113, or, for vehicles certified to the National LEV standards, 
the specifications of Sec. 86.1771. Otherwise, the manufacturer may use 
fuels other than those specified in this section only with the advance 
approval of the Administrator.
    (ii) The manufacturer may measure the temperature of the test fuel 
at other than the approximate mid-volume of the fuel tank, as specified 
in Sec. 86.131-96(a) with only a single temperature sensor, and may 
drain the test fuel from other than the lowest point of the tank, as 
specified in Sec. 86.131-96(b) and Sec. 86.152-98(a), provided an 
equivalent method is used. Equivalency documentation shall be maintained 
by the manufacturer and shall be made available upon request.

[[Page 90]]

    (iii) The manufacturer may perform additional preconditioning on SEA 
test vehicles other than the preconditioning specified in Sec. 86.132, 
or Sec. 86.1773 for vehicles certified to the National LEV standards, 
only if the additional preconditioning was performed on certification 
test vehicles of the same configuration.
    (iv) If the Administrator elects to use the evaporative/refueling 
canister preconditioning procedure described in Sec. 86.132-96(k), the 
manufacturer shall perform the heat build procedure 11 to 34 hours 
following vehicle preconditioning rather than according to the time 
period specified in Sec. 86.133-90(a). All references to an evaporative 
emission enclosure and analyzing for HC during the heat build can be 
ignored.
    (v) The manufacturer may substitute slave tires for the drive wheel 
tires on the vehicle as specified in paragraph Sec. 86.135-90(e): 
Provided, that the slave tires are the same size.
    (vi) If the Administrator elects to use the evaporative/refueling 
canister preconditioning procedure described in Sec. 86.132-96(k), the 
cold start exhaust emission test described in Sec. 86.137-96 shall 
follow the heat build procedure described in Sec. 86.133-90 by not more 
than one hour.
    (vii) In performing exhaust sample analysis under Sec. 86.140-94.
    (A) When testing diesel vehicles, or methanol-fueled Otto-cycle 
vehicles, the manufacturer shall allow a minimum of 20 minutes warm-up 
for the HC analyzer, and for diesel vehicles, a minimum of two hours 
warm-up for the CO, CO<INF>2</INF>, and NO<INF>X</INF> analyzers. (Power 
is normally left on infrared and chemiluminescent analyzers. When not in 
use, the chopper motors of the infrared analyzers are turned off and the 
phototube high voltage supply to the chemiluminescent analyzers is 
placed in the standby position.)
    (B) The manufacturer shall exercise care to prevent moisture from 
condensing in the sample collection bags.
    (viii) The manufacturer need not comply with Sec. 86.142, 
Sec. 86.155, or Sec. 86.1775 since the records required therein are 
provided under other provisions of this subpart K.
    (ix) If a manufacturer elects to perform the background 
determination procedure described in paragraph (a)(3)(xi) of this 
section in addition to performing the refueling emissions test 
procedure, the elapsed time between the initial and final FID readings 
shall be recorded, rounded to the nearest second rather than minute as 
described in Sec. 86.154-98(e)(8). In addition, the vehicle soak 
described in Sec. 86.153-98(e) shall be conducted with the windows and 
luggage compartment of the vehicle open.
    (x) The Administrator may elect to perform a seal test, described in 
Sec. 86.153-98(b), of both integrated and non-integrated systems instead 
of the full refueling test. When testing non-integrated systems, a 
manufacturer may conduct the canister purge described in Sec. 86.153-
98(b)(1) directly following the preconditioning drive described in 
Sec. 86.132-96(e) or directly following the exhaust emissions test 
described in Sec. 86.137-96.
    (xi) In addition to the refueling test, a manufacturer may elect to 
perform the following background emissions determination immediately 
prior to the refueling measurement procedure described in Sec. 86.154-
98, provided EPA is notified of this decision prior to the start of 
testing in an SEA.
    (A) The SHED shall be purged for several minutes immediately prior 
to the background determination. Warning: If at any time the 
concentration of hydrocarbons, of methanol, or of methanol and 
hydrocarbons exceeds 15,000 ppm C, the enclosure should be immediately 
purged. This concentration provides a 4:1 safety factor against the lean 
flammability limit.
    (B) The FID (or HFID) hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and 
spanned immediately prior to the background determination. If not 
already on, the enclosure mixing fan and the spilled fuel mixing blower 
shall be turned on at this time.
    (C) Place the vehicle in the SHED. The ambient temperature level 
encountered by the test vehicle during the entire background emissions 
determination shall be 80  deg.F <plus-minus>3  deg.F. The windows and 
luggage compartment of the vehicle must be open and the gas cap must be 
secured.

[[Page 91]]

    (D) Seal the SHED. Immediately analyze the ambient concentration of 
hydrocarbons in the SHED and record. This is the initial background 
hydrocarbon concentration.
    (E) Soak the vehicle for ten minutes <plus-minus>1 minute.
    (F) The FID (or HFID) hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and 
spanned immediately prior to the end of the background determination.
    (G) Analyze the ambient concentration of hydrocarbons in the SHED 
and record. This is the final background hydrocarbon concentration.
    (H) The total hydrocarbon mass emitted during the background 
determination is calculated according to Sec. 86.156-98. To obtain a 
per-minute background emission rate, divide the total hydrocarbon mass 
calculated in this paragraph by the duration of the soak, rounded to the 
nearest second, described in paragraph (a)(3)(xi)(G) of this section.
    (I) The background emission rate is multiplied by the duration of 
the refueling measurement obtained in paragraph (a)(3)(ix) of this 
section. This number is then subtracted from the total grams of 
emissions calculated for the refueling test according to Sec. 86.156-
98(a) to obtain the adjusted value for total refueling emissions. The 
final results for comparison with the refueling emission standard shall 
be computed by dividing the adjusted value for total refueling mass 
emissions by the total gallons of fuel dispensed in the refueling test 
as described in Sec. 86.156-98(b).
    (xii) In addition to the requirements of subpart B of this part, the 
manufacturer shall prepare gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled vehicles 
as follows prior to emission testing:
    (A) The manufacturer shall inspect the fuel system to ensure the 
absence of any leaks of liquid or vapor to the atmosphere by applying a 
pressure of 14.5<plus-minus>0.5 inches of water (3.6<plus-minus>0.1 Kpa) 
to the fuel system allowing the pressure to stabilize and isolating the 
fuel system from the pressure source. Following isolation of the fuel 
system, pressure must not drop more than 2.0 inches of water (0.5 Kpa) 
in five minutes. If required, the manufacturer shall perform corrective 
action in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and report this 
action in accordance with Sec. 86.1009-2001(d).
    (B) When performing this pressure check, the manufacturer shall 
exercise care to neither purge nor load the evaporative or refueling 
emission control systems.
    (C) The manufacturer may not modify the test vehicle's evaporative 
or refueling emission control systems by component addition, deletion, 
or substitution, except to comply with paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this 
section if approved in advance by the Administrator.
    (4) When testing light-duty trucks, the following exceptions to the 
test procedures in subpart C of this part are applicable to Selective 
Enforcement Audit testing:
    (i) The manufacturer may measure the temperature of the test fuel at 
other than the approximate mid-volume of the fuel tank, as specified in 
Sec. 86.131-90(a), and may drain the test fuel from other than the 
lowest point of the fuel tank as specified in Sec. 86.131-90(b), 
provided an equivalent method is used. Equivalency documentation shall 
be maintained by the manufacturer and shall be made available to the 
Administrator upon request.
    (ii) In performing exhaust sample analysis under Sec. 86.140-94, the 
manufacturer shall exercise care to prevent moisture from condensing in 
the sample collection bags.
    (iii) The manufacturer need not comply with Sec. 86.142-90 since the 
records required therein are provided under other provisions of this 
subpart K.
    (iv) In addition to the requirements of subpart C of this part, the 
manufacturer shall prepare gasoline-fueled vehicles as follows prior to 
exhaust emission testing:
    (A) The manufacturer shall inspect the fuel system to ensure the 
absence of any leaks of liquid or vapor to the atmosphere by applying a 
pressure of 14.5<plus-minus>0.5 inches of water (3.6<plus-minus>0.1 Kpa) 
to the fuel system allowing the pressure to stabilize and isolating the 
fuel system from the pressure source. Following isolation of the fuel 
system, pressure must not drop more than 2.0 inches of water (0.5 Kpa) 
in five minutes. If required, the manufacturer

[[Page 92]]

shall perform corrective action in accordance with paragraph (d) of this 
section and report this action in accordance with Sec. 86.1009-2001(d).
    (B) When performing this pressure check, the manufacturer shall 
exercise care to neither purge nor load the evaporative or refueling 
emission control system.
    (C) The manufacturer shall not modify the test vehicle's evaporative 
or refueling emission control system by component addition, deletion, or 
substitution, except if approved in advance by the Administrator, to 
comply with paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section.
    (5) When testing light-duty trucks, the exceptions to the test 
procedures in subpart O of this part applicable to Selective Enforcement 
Audit testing are listed in paragraphs (a)(5) (i) and (ii) of this 
section.
    (i) The manufacturer need not comply with Sec. 86.1442, since the 
records required therein are provided under provisions of this subpart 
K.
    (ii) In addition to the requirements of subpart O of this part, the 
manufacturer must prepare vehicles as in paragraphs (a)(5)(ii) (A) 
through (C) of this section prior to exhaust emission testing.
    (A) The manufacturer must inspect the fuel system to insure the 
absence of any leaks of liquid or vapor to the atmosphere by applying a 
pressure of 14.5<plus-minus>0.5 inches of water (3.6<plus-minus>0.1 Kpa) 
to the fuel system, allowing the pressure to stabilize, and isolating 
the fuel system from the pressure source. Pressure must not drop more 
than 2.0 inches of water (0.5 Kpa) in five minutes. If required, the 
manufacturer performs corrective action in accordance with this section 
and must report this action in accordance with Sec. 86.1009-2001.
    (B) When performing this pressure check, the manufacturer must 
exercise care to neither purge nor load the evaporative or refueling 
emission control system.
    (C) The manufacturer may not modify the test vehicle's evaporative 
or refueling emission control system by component addition, deletion, or 
substitution.
    (b)(1) The manufacturer shall not adjust, repair, prepare, or modify 
the vehicles selected for testing and shall not perform any emission 
tests on vehicles selected for testing pursuant to the test order unless 
this adjustment repair, preparation, modification, and/or tests are 
documented in the manufacturer's vehicle assembly and inspection 
procedures and are actually performed or unless these adjustments and/or 
tests are required or permitted under this subpart or are approved in 
advance by the Administrator.
    (2) For 1984 and later model years the Administrator may adjust or 
cause to be adjusted any engine or vehicle parameter which the 
Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment for 
certification, Selective Enforcement Audit testing, and Production 
Compliance Audit testing in accordance with Sec. 86.090-22(c)(1), to any 
setting within the physically adjustable range of that parameter, as 
determined by the Administrator in accordance with Sec. 86.090-
22(e)(3)(ii), prior to the performance of any tests. However, if the 
idle speed parameter is one which the Administrator has determined to be 
subject to adjustment, the Administrator shall not adjust it to a 
setting which causes a lower engine idle speed than will be possible 
within the physically adjustable range of the idle speed parameter if 
the manufacturer had accumulated 125 hours of service on the engine or 
4,000 miles on the vehicle under paragraph (c) of this section, all 
other parameters being identically adjusted for the purpose of 
comparison. The manufacturer may be requested to supply information to 
establish such an alternative minimum idle speed. The Administrator, in 
making or specifying such adjustments, will consider the effect of the 
deviation from the manufacturer's recommended setting on emissions 
performance characteristics as well as the likelihood that similar 
settings will occur on in-use heavy-duty engines or light-duty trucks. 
In determining likelihood, the Administrator will consider factors such 
as, but not limited to, the effect of the adjustment on engine or 
vehicle performance characteristics and surveillance information from 
similar in-use vehicles.

[[Page 93]]

    (c) Prior to performing emission testing on an SEA test engine, the 
manufacturer may accumulate on each engine a number of hours of service 
equal to the greater of 125 hours or the number of hours the 
manufacturer accumulated during certification on the emission-data 
engine corresponding to the configuration specified in the test order. 
Prior to performing emission testing on an SEA test vehicle, the 
manufacturer may accumulate on each vehicle a number of miles equal to 
the greater of 4,000 miles, or the number of miles the manufacturer 
accumulated during certification on the emission-data vehicle 
corresponding to the configuration specified in the test order.
    (1) Service or mileage accumulation must be performed in a manner 
using good engineering judgment to obtain emission results 
representative of normal production vehicles. This service or mileage 
accumulation must be consistent with the new vehicle break-in 
instructions contained in the applicable vehicle owner's manual, if any.
    (2) The manufacturer shall accumulate service at a minimum rate of 
16 hours per engine or mileage at a minimum rate of 300 miles per 
vehicle during each 24-hour period, unless otherwise provided by the 
Administrator.
    (i) The first 24-hour period for service or mileage accumulation 
shall begin as soon as authorization checks, inspections and 
preparations are completed on each engine or vehicle.
    (ii) The minimum service or mileage accumulation rate does not apply 
on weekends or holidays.
    (iii) If the manufacturer's service or mileage accumulation target 
is less than the minimum rate specified (16 hours or 300 miles per day), 
then the minimum daily accumulation rate shall be equal to the 
manufacturer's service or mileage accumulation target.
    (3) Service or mileage accumulation shall be completed on a 
sufficient number of test engines or vehicles during consecutive 24-hour 
periods to assure that the number of engines or vehicles tested per day 
fulfills the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section.
    (d) The manufacturer shall not perform any maintenance on test 
vehicles or engines after selection for testing, nor shall the 
Administrator allow deletion of any test vehicle or engine from the test 
sequence, unless requested by the manufacturer, and approved by the 
Administrator before any test vehicle or engine maintenance or deletion.
    (e) The manufacturer shall expeditiously ship test engines or 
vehicles from the point of selection to the test facility. If the test 
facility is not located at or in close proximity to the point of 
selection, the manufacturer shall assure that the test engines or 
vehicles arrive at the test facility within 24 hours of selection: 
Except, that the Administrator may approve more time based upon a 
request by the manufacturer accompanied by a satisfactory justification.
    (f) If an engine or vehicle cannot complete the service or mileage 
accumulation or emission test because of a malfunction, the manufacturer 
may request that the Administrator authorize the repair of that engine 
or vehicle or its deletion from the test sequence.
    (g) Whenever the manufacturer conducts testing pursuant to a test 
order issued under this subpart, the manufacturer shall notify the 
Administrator within one working day of receipt of the test order, which 
test facility will be used to comply with the test order and the number 
of available test cells at that facility. If no test cells are available 
at the desired facility, the manufacturer must provide alternate testing 
capability satisfactory to the Administrator.
    (1) Heavy-duty engine manufacturers with projected sales for the 
United States market for that year of 30,000 or greater shall complete 
emission testing at their facility on a minimum of two engines per 24-
hour period, including each voided test and each diesel engine smoke 
test.
    (2) Heavy-duty engine manufacturers with projected sales for the 
United States market for that year of less than 30,000 shall complete 
emission testing at their facility on a minimum of one engine per 24-
hour period, including each voided test and each diesel engine smoke 
test.
    (3) Light-duty truck and heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers shall 
perform a

[[Page 94]]

combination of tests pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section so that a 
minimum of four tests are performed per 24 hour period, including voided 
tests, for each available test cell.
    (4) The Administrator may approve a longer period based upon a 
request by a manufacturer accompanied by satisfactory justification.
    (h) The manufacturer shall perform test engine or vehicle selection, 
shipping, preparation, service or mileage accumulation, and testing in

Sec. 86.1010-96  Compliance with acceptable quality level and passing and 
failing criteria for Selective Enforcement Audits.

    (a) The prescribed acceptable quality level is 40 percent.
    (b) A failed engine or vehicle is one whose final deteriorated test 
results pursuant to Sec. 86.1009(c), for one or more of the applicable 
pollutants, including fuel spitback, exceed the applicable emission 
standard or compliance level. For the CST as described in subpart O of 
this part, a vehicle fail determination is made if the final 
deteriorated test results for HC and/or CO emissions from any CST exceed 
the applicable emission standard.
    (c) Pass/fail criteria. (1) The manufacturer must test heavy-duty 
engines, heavy duty vehicles, or light-duty trucks comprising the test 
sample until a pass decision is reached for all pollutants, or a fail 
decision is reached for one pollutant. A pass decision is reached when 
the cumulative number of failed engines or vehicles, as defined in 
paragraph (b) of this section, for each pollutant is less than or equal 
to the pass decision number appropriate to the cumulative number of 
engines or vehicles tested. A fail decision is reached when the 
cumulative number of failed engines or vehicles for one or more 
pollutants is greater than or equal to the fail decision number 
appropriate to the cumulative number of engines or vehicles tested. The 
pass and fail decision numbers associated with the cumulative number of 
engines or vehicles tested are determined by use of the tables in 
appendix X to this part appropriate to the projected sales as made by 
the heavy-duty engine or heavy-duty vehicle manufacturer in its 
Application for Certification, or as

[[Page 99]]

made by the light-duty truck manufacturer as made in its report 
submitted under Sec. 600.207-80(a)(2) of this chapter (Automobile Fuel 
Economy Regulations). In the tables in appendix X to this part, sampling 
plan ``stage'' refers to the cumulative number of engines or vehicles 
tested. Once a pass or fail decision has been made for a particular 
pollutant, the number of engines or vehicles whose final deteriorated 
test results exceed the emission standard or compliance level, if 
applicable, for that pollutant may not be considered any further for 
purposes of the audit.
    (2) CST criteria only. A pass/fail decision is made based on the CST 
in its entirety rather than on a per pollutant basis. The manufacturer 
must test vehicles comprising the test sample until a pass or fail 
decision is reached for the CST. A pass decision is reached when the 
cumulative number of failed vehicles, as defined in paragraph (b) of 
this section, based on CST testing, is less than or equal to the pass 
decision number appropriate to the cumulative number of vehicles tested. 
A fail decision is reached when the cumulative number of failed vehicles 
based on CST testing is greater than or equal to the fail decision 
number appropriate to the cumulative number of vehicles tested. The pass 
and fail decision numbers associated with the cumulative number of 
vehicles tested are determined by use of the tables in appendix X to 
this part appropriate to the projected sales as made by the light-duty 
truck manufacturer as made in its report submitted under Sec. 600.207-
80(a)(2) of this chapter (Automobile Fuel Economy Regulations). In the 
tables in appendix X to this part, sampling plan ``stage'' refers to the 
cumulative number of engines or vehicles tested. Once a pass or fail 
decision has been made based on CST testing, the number of vehicles 
whose final deteriorated test results exceed any of the emission 
standards for any CST may not be considered any further for purposes of 
the audit.
    (d) Passing or failing of a SEA occurs when the decision is made on 
the last engine or vehicle required to make a decision under paragraph 
(c) of this section.
    (e) The Administrator may terminate testing earlier than required in 
paragraph (c) of this section.

Sec. 86.1010-2001  Compliance with acceptable quality level and passing and 
failing criteria for Selective Enforcement Audits.

    (a) The prescribed acceptable quality level is 40 percent.
    (b) A failed vehicle or engine is one whose final deteriorated test 
results pursuant to Sec. 86.1009-2001(c) exceed at least one of the 
applicable emission standards associated with the test procedures 
pursuant to Sec. 86.1008-2001(a).
    (c)(1) Pass/fail criteria. The manufacturer shall test light-duty 
trucks, heavy-duty engines, or heavy-duty vehicles comprising the test 
sample until a pass decision is reached for all of the pollutants 
associated with all of the test procedures pursuant to Sec. 86.1008-
2001(a) or a fail decision is reached for one of these pollutants. A 
pass decision is reached when the cumulative number of failed vehicles 
or engines, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, for each 
pollutant is less than or equal to the fail decision number appropriate 
to the cumulative number of vehicles tested. A fail decision is reached 
when the cumulative number of failed vehicles or engines for one 
pollutant is greater than or equal to the fail decision number 
appropriate to the cumulative number of vehicles tested. The pass and 
fail decision numbers associated with the cumulative number of vehicles 
tested are determined by use of the tables in appendix X of this part 
appropriate to the projected sales as made by the heavy-duty engine or 
heavy-duty vehicle manufacturer in its Application for Certification, or 
as made by the light-duty truck manufacturer in its report submitted 
under Sec. 600.207-80(a)(2) of this chapter (Automobile Fuel Economy 
Regulations). In the tables in appendix X of this part, sampling plan 
``stage'' refers to the cumulative number of vehicles or engines tested. 
Once a pass decision has been made for a particular pollutant associated 
with a particular test procedure pursuant to Sec. 86.1008-2001(a), the 
number of vehicles or engines whose final deteriorated test results 
exceed the

[[Page 100]]

emission standard for that pollutant may not be considered any further 
for purposes of the audit.
    (2) CST criteria only. For CST testing pursuant to subpart O, a pass 
or fail decision is determined according to the pass/fail criteria 
described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, except that for each 
vehicle, the CST in its entirety is considered one pollutant.
    (d) Passing or failing of an SEA audit occurs when the decision is 
made on the last vehicle or engine required to make a decision under 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (e) The Administrator may terminate testing earlier than required in 
paragraph (c) of this section.

storage facilities specified by the Administrator, in accordance with 
the conditions specified in the initial test order. If the manufacturer 
elects to continue testing individual engines or vehicles after 
suspension of a certificate, the certificate is reinstated for any 
engine or vehicle actually determined to be in conformance with the 
applicable standards or compliance levels through testing in accordance 
with the applicable test procedures, provided that the Administrator has 
not revoked the certificate pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section.
    (k) Once the certificate has been revoked for a configuration and 
the manufacturer desires to continue introduction into commerce of a 
modified version of that configuration, the following actions shall be 
taken before the Administrator may consider issuing a certificate for 
that modified configuration:
    (1) If the Administrator determines that the proposed change(s) in 
engine or vehicle design may have an effect on emission performance 
deterioration or, in the case of light-duty trucks, on fuel economy, the 
Administrator shall notify the manufacturer, within five (5) working 
days after receipt of the report in paragraph (h) of this section, 
whether subsequent testing under this subpart will be sufficient to 
evaluate the proposed change or changes or whether additional testing 
will be required; and
    (2) After implementing the change or changes intended to remedy the 
nonconformity, the manufacturer shall demonstrate that the modified 
engine or vehicle configuration does in fact conform with these 
regulations by testing engines or vehicles selected from normal 
production runs of that modified engine or vehicle configuration in 
accordance with the conditions specified in the initial test order. This 
testing will be considered by the Administrator to satisfy the testing 
requirements of Sec. 86.078-32 or Sec. 86.079-33 if the Administrator 
has so notifed the manufacturer. If the subsequent audit results in 
passing of the audit at the level of the standards or compliance levels, 
if applicable, the Administrator shall reissue or amend the certificate, 
as the case may be, to include that configuration, provided that the 
manufacturer has satisfied the testing requirements of paragraph (k)(1) 
of this section. If the subsequent audit is failed, the revocation 
remains in effect. Any design change approvals under this subpart are 
limited to the configuration affected by the test order.
    (l) At any time subsequent to an initial suspension of a certificate 
of conformity for a test engine or vehicle pursuant to paragraph (a) of 
this section, but not later than fifteen (15) days or such other period 
as may be allowed by the Administrator after notification of the 
Administrator's decision to suspend or revoke a certificate of 
conformity in whole or in part pursuant to paragraphs (b), (c), (d), 
(e), or (h) of this section, a manufacturer may request a hearing as to 
whether the tests have been properly conducted or any sampling methods 
have been properly applied.
    (m) After the Administrator suspends or revokes a certificate of 
conformity pursuant to this section or notifies a manufacturer of his 
intent to suspend, revoke or void a certificate of conformity under 
paragraph Sec. 86.087-30(e), and prior to the commencement of a hearing 
under Sec. 86.1014-84, if the manufacturer demonstrates to the 
Administrator's satisfaction that the decision to suspend, revoke or 
void the certificate was based on erroneous information, the 
Administrator shall reinstate the certificate.
    (n) To permit a manufacturer to avoid storing non-test engines or 
vehicles when conducting an audit of a configuration subsequent to 
suspension or revocation of the certificate of conformity for that 
configuration resulting from failure of an SEA, it may request that the 
Administrator conditionally reinstate the certificate for that 
configuration. The Administrator may reinstate the certificate subject 
to the condition that the manufacturer consents to recall all engines or 
vehicles of that configuration produced from the time the certificate is 
conditionally reinstated if the configuration fails the subsequent audit 
at the level

of the standard and to remedy any nonconformity at no expense to the 
owner.

Sec. 86.1012-97  Suspension and revocation of certificates of conformity.

    (a) The certificate of conformity is immediately suspended with 
respect to any engine or vehicle failing pursuant to Sec. 86.1010(b) 
effective from the time that testing of that engine or vehicle is 
completed.
    (b)(1) Selective Enforcement Audits. The Administrator may suspend 
the certificate of conformity for a configuration that does not pass a 
Selective Enforcement Audit pursuant to Sec. 86.1010(c) based on the 
first test, or all tests, conducted on each engine or vehicle. This 
suspension will not occur before ten days after failure to pass the 
audit.
    (2) California Assembly-Line Quality Audit Testing. The 
Administrator may suspend the certificate of conformity for a 50-state 
engine family or configuration tested in accordance with procedures 
prescribed under Sec. 86.1008 that the Executive Officer has determined 
to be in non-compliance with one or more applicable pollutants based on 
Chapter 1 or Chapter 2 of the California Regulatory Requirements 
Applicable to the National Low Emission Vehicle Program (October, 1996), 
if the results of vehicle testing conducted by the manufacturer do not 
meet the acceptable quality level criteria pursuant to Sec. 86.1010. The 
California Regulatory Requirements Applicable to the National Low 
Emission Vehicle Program (October, 1996) are incorporated by reference 
(see Sec. 86.1). A vehicle that is tested by the manufacturer in 
accordance with procedures prescribed under Sec. 86.1008 and determined 
to be a failing vehicle pursuant to Chapter 1 or Chapter 2 of the 
California Regulatory Requirements Applicable to the National Low 
Emission Vehicle Program (October, 1996) will be treated as a failed 
vehicle described in Sec. 86.1010(b), unless the manufacturer can show 
that the vehicle would not be considered a failed vehicle using the test 
procedures specified in Sec. 86.1008. This suspension will not occur 
before ten days after the manufacturer receives written notification 
that the Administrator has determined the 50-state engine family or 
configuration exceeds one or more applicable federal standards.
    (c)(1) Selective Enforcement Audits. If the results of engine or 
vehicle testing pursuant to the requirements of this subpart indicate 
that engines or vehicles of a particular configuration produced at more 
than one plant do not conform to the regulations with respect to which 
the certificate of conformity was issued, the Administrator may suspend 
the certificate of conformity with respect to that configuration for 
engines or vehicles manufactured by the manufacturer in other plants of 
the manufacturer.
    (2) California Assembly-Line Quality Audit Testing. If the 
Administrator determines that the results of vehicle testing pursuant to 
Chapter 1 or Chapter 2 of the California Regulatory Requirements 
Applicable to the National Low Emission Vehicle Program (October, 1996) 
and the procedures prescribed in Sec. 86.1008 indicate the vehicles of a 
particular 50-state engine family or configuration produced at more than 
one plant do not conform to applicable regulations with respect to which 
a certificate of conformity was issued, the Administrator may suspend, 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the certificate of 
conformity with respect to that engine family or configuration for 
vehicles manufactured by the manufacturer in other plants of the 
manufacturer. The California Regulatory Requirements Applicable to the 
National Low Emission Vehicle Program (October, 1996) are incorporated 
by reference (see Sec. 86.1).
    (d) The Administrator will notify the manufacturer in writing of any 
suspension or revocation of a certificate of conformity in whole or in 
part: Except, that the certificate is immediately suspended with respect 
to any failed engines or vehicles as provided for in paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (e)(1) Selective Enforcement Audits. The Administrator may revoke a 
certificate of conformity for a configuration when the certificate has 
been suspended pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) or (c)(1) of this section if 
the proposed

[[Page 103]]

remedy for the nonconformity, as reported by the manufacturer to the 
Administrator is one requiring a design change(s) to the engine and/or 
emission control system as described in the Application for 
Certification of the affected configuration.
    (2) California Assembly-Line Quality Audit Testing. The 
Administrator may revoke a certificate of conformity for an engine 
family or configuration when the certificate has been suspended pursuant 
to paragraph (b)(2) or (c)(2) of this section if the proposed remedy for 
the nonconformity, as reported by the manufacturer to the Executive 
Officer and/or the Administrator, is one requiring a design change(s) to 
the engine and/or emission control system as described in the 
Application for Certification of the affected engine family or 
configuration.
    (f) Once a certificate has been suspended for a failed engine or 
vehicle as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, the 
manufacturer must take the following actions:
    (1) Before the certificate is reinstated for that failed engine or 
vehicle--
    (i) Remedy the nonconformity; and
    (ii) Demonstrate that the engine or vehicle's final deteriorated 
test results conform to the applicable emission standards or family 
particulate emission limits, as defined in this part 86 by retesting the 
engine or vehicle in accordance with the requirements of this subpart.
    (2) Submit a written report to the Administrator within thirty days 
after successful completion of testing on the failed engine or vehicle, 
which contains a description of the remedy and test results for the 
engine or vehicle in addition to other information that may be required 
by this subpart.
    (g) Once a certificate has been suspended pursuant to paragraph (b) 
or (c) of this section, the manufacturer must take the following actions 
before the Administrator will consider reinstating such certificate:
    (1) Submit a written report to the Administrator which identifies 
the reason for the noncompliance of the vehicles, describes the proposed 
remedy, including a description of any proposed quality control and/or 
quality assurance measures to be taken by the manufacturer to prevent 
the future occurrence of the problem, and states the date on which the 
remedies will be implemented.
    (2) Demonstrate that the engine family or configuration for which 
the certificate of conformity has been suspended does in fact comply 
with the requirements of this subpart by testing engines or vehicles 
selected from normal production runs of that engine family or 
configuration at the plant(s) or the facilities specified by the 
Administrator, in accordance with:
    (i) The conditions specified in the initial test order pursuant to 
Sec. 86.1003 for a configuration suspended pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) 
or (c)(1) of this section; or
    (ii) The conditions specified in a test order pursuant to 
Sec. 86.1003 for an engine family or configuration suspended pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(2) or (c)(2) of this section.
    (3) If the Administrator has not revoked the certificate pursuant to 
paragraph (e) of this section and if the manufacturer elects to continue 
testing individual engines or vehicles after suspension of a 
certificate, the certificate is reinstated for any engine or vehicle 
actually determined to have its final deteriorated test results in 
conformance with the applicable standards through testing in accordance 
with the applicable test procedures.
    (4) In cases where the Administrator has suspended a certificate of 
conformity for a 50-state engine family or configuration pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(2) or (c)(2) of this section, manufacturers may request in 
writing that the Administrator reinstate the certificate of an engine 
family or configuration when, in lieu of the actions described in 
paragraphs (g) (1) and (2) of this section, the manufacturer has 
complied with Chapter 3 of the California Regulatory Requirements 
Applicable to the National Low Emission Vehicle Program (October, 1996), 
provided an Executive Order is in place for the engine family or 
configuration. The California Regulatory Requirements Applicable to the 
National Low Emission Vehicle Program (October, 1996) are incorporated 
by reference (see Sec. 86.1).
    (h) Once a certificate for a failed engine family or configuration 
has been

[[Page 104]]

revoked under paragraph (e) (1) or (2) of this section and the 
manufacturer desires to introduce into commerce a modified version of 
that engine family or configuration the following actions will be taken 
before the Administrator may issue a certificate for the new engine 
family or configuration:
    (1) If the Administrator determines that the proposed change(s) in 
engine or vehicle design may have an effect on emission performance 
deterioration and/or fuel economy, he/she shall notify the manufacturer 
within 5 working days after receipt of the report in paragraph (g)(1) of 
this section or after receipt of information pursuant to paragraph 
(g)(4) of this section whether subsequent testing under this subpart 
will be sufficient to evaluate the proposed change(s) or whether 
additional testing will be required.
    (2) After implementing the change(s) intended to remedy the 
nonconformity, the manufacturer shall demonstrate:
    (i) If the certificate was revoked pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section, that the modified configuration does in fact conform with 
the requirements of this subpart by testing engines or vehicles selected 
from normal production runs of that modified configuration in accordance 
with the conditions specified in the initial test order pursuant to 
Sec. 86.1003. The Administrator shall consider this testing to satisfy 
the testing requirements of Sec. 86.079-32 or Sec. 86.079-33 if the 
Administrator had so notified the manufacturer. If the subsequent 
testing results in a pass decision pursuant to the criteria in 
Sec. 86.1010(c), the Administrator shall reissue or amend the 
certificate, if necessary, to include that configuration: Provided, that 
the manufacturer has satisfied the testing requirements specified in 
paragraph (h)(1) of this section. If the subsequent audit results in a 
fail decision pursuant to the criteria in Sec. 86.1010(c), the 
revocation remains in effect. Any design change approvals under this 
subpart are limited to the modification of the configuration specified 
by the test order.
    (ii) If the certificate was revoked pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of 
this section, that the modified engine family or configuration does in 
fact conform with the requirements of this subpart by testing vehicles 
selected from normal production runs of that modified engine family or 
configuration in accordance with the conditions specified in a test 
order pursuant to Sec. 86.1003. The Administrator shall consider this 
testing to satisfy the testing requirements of Sec. 86.079-32 or 
Sec. 86.079-33 if the Administrator had so notified the manufacturer. If 
the subsequent testing results in a pass decision pursuant to 
Sec. 86.1010(c), the Administrator shall reissue or amend the 
certificate as necessary: Provided, that the manufacturer has satisfied 
the testing requirements specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. 
If the subsequent testing results in a fail decision pursuant to 
Sec. 86.1010(c), the revocation remains in effect. Any design change 
approvals under this subpart are limited to the modification of the 
engine family or configuration specified by the test order.
    (3) In cases where the Administrator has revoked a certificate of 
conformity for a 50-state engine family or configuration pursuant to 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section, manufacturers may request in writing 
that the Administrator reissue the certificate for an engine family or 
configuration when, in lieu of the actions described in paragraphs (h) 
(1) and (2) of this section, the manufacturer has complied with Chapter 
3 of the California Regulatory Requirements Applicable to the National 
Low Emission Vehicle Program (October, 1996), provided an Executive 
Order is in place for the engine family or configuration. The California 
Regulatory Requirements Applicable to the National Low Emission Vehicle

    (i) through (k) [Reserved]
    (l) At any time subsequent to an initial suspension of a certificate 
of conformity for a test engine or vehicle pursuant to paragraph (a) of 
this section, but not later than fifteen (15) days or such other period 
as may be allowed by the Administrator after notification of the 
Administrator's decision to suspend or revoke a certificate of 
conformity in whole or in part pursuant to paragraphs (b), (c), (d), 
(e), or (h) of this section, a manufacturer may request a hearing as to 
whether the

[[Page 105]]

tests have been properly conducted or any sampling methods have been 
properly applied.
    (m) After the Administrator suspends or revokes a certificate of 
conformity pursuant to this section or notifies a manufacturer of his 
intent to suspend, revoke or void a certificate of conformity under 
paragraph Sec. 86.087-30(e), and prior to the commencement of a hearing 
under Sec. 86.1014, if the manufacturer demonstrates to the 
Administrator's satisfaction that the decision to suspend, revoke or 
void the certificate was based on erroneous information, the 
Administrator shall reinstate the certificate.
    (n) To permit a manufacturer to avoid storing non-test engines or 
vehicles when conducting testing of an engine family or configuration 
subsequent to suspension or revocation of the certificate of conformity 
for that engine family or configuration pursuant to paragraph (b), (c),

<R05>
Sec. 86.1014-84  Hearings on suspension, revocation and voiding of certificate 
of conformity.

    (a) Applicability. The procedures prescribed by this section apply 
whenever a manufacturer requests a hearing pursuant to Sec. 86.087-30 
(e)(6)(i), Sec. 86.087-30(e)(7), or Sec. 86.1012-84(1).
    (b) Definitions. The following definitions are applicable to this 
section:
    (1) Hearing Clerk shall mean the Hearing Clerk of the Environmental 
Protection Agency.
    (2) Manufacturer means a manufacturer contesting a suspension or 
revocation order directed at the manufacturer.
    (3) Party means the Agency and the manufacturer.
    (4) Presiding Officer means an Administrative Law Judge appointed 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 3105 (see also 5 CFR part 930 as amended).
    (5) Environmental Appeals Board shall mean the Board within the 
Agency described in Sec. 1.25 of this title. The Administrator delegates 
authority to the Environmental Appeals Board to issue final decisions in 
appeals filed under this subpart. Appeals directed to the Administrator, 
rather than to the Environmental Appeals Board, will not be considered. 
This delegation of authority to the Environmental Appeals Board does not 
preclude the Environmental Appeals Board from referring an appeal or a 
motion filed under this subpart to the Administrator for decision when 
the Environmental Appeals Board, in its discretion, deems it appropriate 
to do so. When an appeal or motion is referred to the Administrator, all 
parties shall be so notified and the rules in this part referring to the 
Environmental Appeals Board shall be interpreted as referring to the 
Administrator.
    (c) Request for public hearing. (1) If the manufacturer disagrees 
with the Administrator's decision to suspend, revoke or void a 
certificate or disputes the basis for an automatic suspension pursuant 
to Sec. 86.1012-84(a), the manufacturer may request a public hearing as 
described in this section. The manufacturer shall file with the 
Administrator a request for this hearing not later than fifteen (15) 
days after the Administrator's notification of his decision to suspend 
or revoke unless otherwise specified by the Administrator. The 
manufacturer shall simultaneously serve two copies of this request upon 
the Director of the Manufacturers Operations Division and file two 
copies with the Hearing Clerk. Failure of the manufacturer to request a 
hearing within the time provided constitutes a waiver of the right to a 
hearing. Subsequent to the expiration of the period for requesting a 
hearing as of right, the Administrator may, in his discretion and for 
good cause shown, grant the manufacturer a hearing to contest the 
suspension or revocation.

[[Page 106]]

    (2) A manufacturer shall include in the request for a public 
hearing--
    (i) A statement as to which engine or vehicle configuration is to be 
the subject of the hearing;
    (ii) A concise statement of the issues to be raised by the 
manufacturer at the hearing: Provided, however, That in the case of the 
hearing requested under Sec. 86.1012-84(1), the hearing is restricted to 
the following issues:
    (A) Whether tests have been properly conducted, specifically, 
Whether the tests were conducted in accordance with applicable 
regulations under this part and whether test equipment was properly 
calibrated and functioning; and
    (B) Whether sampling plans have been properly applied, specifically, 
whether sampling procedures specified in appendix X were followed and 
whether there exists a basis for distinguishing engines or vehicles 
produced at plants other than the one from which engines or vehicles 
were selected for testing which would invalidate the Administrator's 
decision under Sec. 86.1012-84(e);
    (iii) A statement specifying reasons why the manufacturer believes 
it will prevail on the merits of each of the issues raised; and
    (iv) A summary of the evidence which supports the manufacturer's 
position on each of the issues raised.
    (3) A copy of all requests for public hearings will be kept on file 
in the Office of the Hearing Clerk and will be made available to the 
public during Agency business hours.
    (d) Summary decision. (1) In the case of a hearing requested under 
Sec. 86.1012-84(1), when it clearly appears from the data and other 
information contained in the request for a hearing that there is no 
genuine and substantial question of fact with respect to the issues 
specified in Sec. 86.1014-84(c)(2)(ii), the Administrator shall enter an 
order denying the request for a hearing and reaffirming the original 
decision to suspend or revoke a certificate of conformity, if this 
decision has been made pursuant to Sec. 86.1012-84(g) at any time prior 
to the decision to deny the request for a hearing.
    (2) In the case of a hearing requested under Sec. 86.087-
30(e)(6)(i), to challenge a proposed suspension of a certificate of 
conformity for the reasons specified in Sec. 86.087-30(e)(1)(i) or 
(e)(1)(ii), when it clearly appears from the data and other information 
contained in the request for the hearing that there is no genuine and 
substantial question of fact with respect to the issue of whether the 
refusal to comply with the provisions of a test order or any other 
requirement of Sec. 86.1003-84 was caused by conditions and 
circumstances outside the control of the manufacturer, the Administrator 
shall enter an order denying the request for a hearing and suspending 
the certificate of conformity.
    (3) Any order issued under paragraph (d) (1) or (2) of this section 
has the force and effect of a final decision of the Administrator, as 
issued pursuant to paragraph (w)(4) of this section.
    (4) If the Administrator determines that a genuine and substantial 
question of fact does exist with respect to any of the issues referred 
to in paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section, he shall grant the 
request for a hearing and publish a notice of public hearing in 
accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.
    (e) Filing and service. (1) An original and two copies of all 
documents or papers required or permitted to be filed pursuant to this 
section must be filed with the Hearing Clerk. Filing is considered 
timely if mailed, as determined by the postmark, to the Hearing Clerk 
within the time allowed by this section. If filing is to be accomplished 
by mailing, the documents must be sent to the address set forth in the 
notice of public hearing as described in paragraph (h) of this section.
    (2) To the maximum extent possible, testimony will be presented in 
written form. Copies of written testimony will be served upon all 
parties as soon as practicable prior to the start of the hearing. A 
certificate of service will be provided on or accompany each document or 
paper filed with the Hearing Clerk. Documents to be served upon the 
Director of the Manufacturers Operations Division must be sent by 
registered mail to:

    (f) Time. (1) In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed 
by this section, except as otherwise provided, the day of the act or 
event from which the designated period of time begins to run is not 
included. Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal legal holidays are included in 
computing the period allowed for the filing of any document or paper, 
except that when the period expires on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal 
legal holiday, the period is extended to include the next following 
business day.
    (2) A prescribed period of time within which a party is required or 
permitted to do an act is computed from the time of service, except that 
when service is accomplished by mail, three days will be added to the 
prescribed period.
    (g) Consolidation. The Administrator or the Presiding Officer in his 
discretion may consolidate two or more proceedings to be held under this 
section for the purpose of resolving one or more issues whenever it 
appears that consolidation will expedite or simplify consideration of 
these issues. Consolidation does not affect the right of any party to 
raise issues that could have been raised if consolidation had not 
occurred.
    (h) Notice of public hearings. Notice of a public hearing under this 
section is given by publication in the Federal Register and by such 
other means as the Administrator finds appropriate to provide notice to 
the public. To the extent possible hearings under this section will be 
scheduled to commence within fourteen (14) days of receipt of the 
application in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (i) Amicus curiae. Persons not parties to the proceeding wishing to 
file briefs may do so by leave of the Presiding Officer granted on 
motion. A motion for leave must identify the interest of the applicant

section shall have an adequate opportunity, once he learns the name of a 
witness and obtains the narrative summary of his expected testimony, to 
prepare for the presentation of his case.
    (m) Other discovery. (1) Except as provided by paragraph (m)(1) of 
this section, further discovery, under this paragraph is permitted only 
upon determination by the Presiding Officer:
    (i) That this discovery will not in any way unreasonably delay the 
proceeding;
    (ii) That the information to be obtained is not obtainable 
voluntarily; and
    (iii) That the information has significant probative value. The 
Presiding Officer shall be guided by the procedures set forth in the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, where practicable, and the precedents 
thereunder, except that no discovery will be undertaken except upon 
order of the Presiding Officer or upon agreement of the parties.
    (2) The Presiding Officer shall order depositions upon oral 
questions only upon a showing of good cause and upon a finding that:
    (i) The information sought cannot be obtained by alternative 
methods; or
    (ii) There is a substantial reason to believe that relevant and 
probative evidence may otherwise not be preserved for presentation by a 
witness at the hearing.
    (3) Any party to the proceeding desiring an order of discovery shall 
make a motion or motions therefor. The motion must include:
    (i) The circumstances warranting the taking of the discovery;
    (ii) The nature of the information expected to be discovered; and
    (iii) The proposed time and place where it will be taken. If the 
Presiding Officer determines the motion should be granted, he shall 
issue an order for the taking of the discovery together with the 
conditions and terms thereof.
    (4) Failure to comply with an order issued pursuant to this 
paragraph may lead to the inference that the information to be 
discovered would be adverse to the person or party from whom the 
information was sought.
    (n) Protective orders, in camera proceedings. (1) Upon motion by a 
part or by the person from whom discovery is sought, and upon a showing 
by the movant that the disclosure of the information to be discovered, 
or a particular part thereof (other than emission data), would result in 
methods or

[[Page 109]]

processes entitled to protection as trade secrets of the person being 
divulged, the Presiding Officer may enter a protective order with 
respect to this material. Any protective order will contain terms 
governing the treatment of the information which are appropriate under 
the circumstances to prevent disclosure outside the hearing: Provided, 
That the order states that the material will be filed separately from 
other evidence and exhibits in the hearing. Disclosure is limited to 
parties to the hearing, their counsel and relevant technical 
consultants, and authorized representatives of the United States 
concerned with carrying out the Act. Except in the case of the 
government, disclosure may be limited to counsel for parties who shall 
not disclose such information to the parties themselves. Except in the 
case of the government, disclosure to a party or his counsel is 
conditioned on execution of a sworn statement that no disclosure of the 
information will be made to persons not entitled to receive it under the 
terms of the protective order. (This provision is not necessary where 
government employees are concerned because disclosure by them is subject 
to the terms of 18 U.S.C. 1905.)
    (2)(i) A party or person seeking a protective order may be permitted 
to make all or part of the required showing in camera. A record will be 
made of the in camera proceedings. If the Presiding Officer enters a 
protective order following a showing in camera, the record of the 
showing will be sealed and preserved and made available to the Agency or 
court in the event of appeal.
    (ii) Attendance at any in camera proceeding may be limited to the 
Presiding Officer, the Agency, and the person or party seeking the 
protective order.
    (3) Any party, subject to the terms and conditions of any protective 
order issues pursuant to paragraph (n)(1) of this section, desiring for 
the presentation of his case to make use of any in camera documents or 
testimony, shall make application to the Presiding Officer by motion 
setting forth the justification therefor. The Presiding Officer, in 
granting this motion, shall enter an order protecting the rights of the 
affected persons and parties and preventing unnecessary disclosure of 
this information, including the presentation of the information and oral 
testimony and cross-examination concerning it in executive session, as 
in his discretion is necessary and practicable.
    (4) In the submittal of proposed findings, briefs, or other papers, 
counsel for all parties shall make a good faith attempt to refrain from 
disclosing the specific details of in camera documents and testimony. 
This shall not preclude references in these proposed findings, briefs, 
or other papers to the documents or testimony, including generalized 
statements based on their contents. To the extent that counsel considers 
it necessary to include specific details in their presentations, these 
details will be incorporated in separate proposed findings, briefs, or 
other paper marked ``confidential'', and wil become part of the in 
camera record.
    (o) Motions. (1) All motions, except those made orally during the 
course of the hearing, must be in writing and state with particularity 
the grounds therefor, set forth the relief or order sought, and be filed 
with the Hearing Clerk and served upon all parties.
    (2) Within the time fixed by the Environmental Appeals Board or the 
Presiding Officer, as appropriate, any party may serve and file an 
answer to the motion. The movant shall, if requested by the 
Environmental Appeals Board or the Presiding Officer, as appropriate, 
serve and file reply papers within the time set by the request.
    (3) The Presiding Officer shall rule upon all motions filed or made 
prior to the filing of his decision or accelerated decision, as 
appropriate. The Environmental Appeals Board shall rule upon all motions 
filed prior to the appointment of a Presiding Officer and all motions 
filed after the filing of the decision of the Presiding Officer or 
accelerated decision. Oral argument of motions will be permitted only if 
the Presiding Officer or the Environmental Appeals Board, as 
appropriate, considers it necessary.
    (p) Evidence. (1) The official transcripts and exhibits, together 
with all

[[Page 110]]

papers and requests filed in the proceeding, consitute the record. 
Immaterial or irrelevant part of an admissible document will be 
segregated and excluded so far as practicable. Documents or parts 
thereof subject to a protective order under pargarph (n) of this section 
wil be segregated. Evidence may be received at the hearing even though 
inadmissible under the rules of evidence applicable to judicial 
proceedings. The weight to be given evidence will be determined by its 
reliability and probative value.
    (2) The Presiding Officer shall allow the parties to examine and 
cross-examine a witness to the extent that this examination and cross-
examination is necessary for a full and true disclosure of the facts.
    (3) Ruling of the Presiding Officer on the admissibility of 
evidence, the propriety of examination and cross-examination, and other 
procedural matters will appear in the record.
    (4) Parties shall automatically be presumed to have taken exception 
to an adverse ruling.
    (q) Record. (1) Hearings will be stenographically reported and 
transcribed and the original transcripts will be part of the record and 
the sole official transcript. Copies of the record will be filed with 
the Hearing Clerk and made available during Agency business hours for 
public inspection. Any thereof, except as provided in paragraph (n) of 
this section, shall be entitled to the same upon payment of the cost 
thereof.
    (2) The official transcripts and exhibits, together with all paper 
and requests filed in the proceeding, constitute the record.
    (r) Proposed findings, conclusions. (1) Within four (4) days of the 
close of the reception of evidence, or within such longer time as the 
Presiding Officer may fix, any party may submit for the consideration of 
the Presiding Officer proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and 
proposed order, together with reasons therefor and briefs in support 
thereof. These proposals will be in writing, be served upon all parties, 
and contain adequate references to the record and authorities relied 
upon.
    (2) The record will show the Presiding Officer's ruling on the 
proposed findings and conclusions except when his order disposing of the 
proceeding otherwise informs the parties of the action taken by him 
thereon.
    (s) Decision of the Presiding Officer. (1) Unless extended by the 
Environmental Appeals Board, the Presiding Officer shall issue and file 
with the Hearing Clerk his decision within fourteen (14) days (or within 
seven (7) days in the case of a hearing requested under Sec. 86.1012-
84(1)) after the period for filing proposed findings as provided for in 
paragraph (r) of this section has expired.
    (2) The Presiding Officer's decision shall become the decision of 
the Environmental Appeals Board:
    (i) When no notice of intention to appeal as described in paragraphs 
(t) and (u) of this section is filed, ten (10) days after issuance 
thereof, unless in the interim the Environmental Appeals Board shall 
have acted to review or stay the effective date of the decision; or
    (ii) When a notice of intention to appeal is filed but the appeal is 
not perfected as required by paragraphs (t) or (u) of this section, five 
(5) days after the period allowed for perfection of an appeal has 
expired unless within that five (5) day period, the Environmental 
Appeals Board shall have acted to review or stay the effective date of 
the decision.
    (3) The Presiding Officer's decision must include a statement of 
findings and conclusions, as well as the reasons or basis therefor, upon 
all the material issues of fact or law presented on the record and an 
appropriate rule or order. The decision must be supported by substantial 
evidence and based upon a consideration of the whole record.
    (4) At any time prior to the issuance of his decision, the Presiding 
Officer may reopen the proceeding for the reception of further evidence. 
Except for the correction of clerical errors, the jurisdiction of the 
Presiding Officer is terminated upon the issuance of his decision.
    (t) Appeal from the decision of the Presiding Officer. (1) Any party 
to a proceeding may appeal the Presiding Officer's decision to the 
Environmental Appeals Board; Provided, That within ten (10) days after 
issuance of the Presiding Officer's decision the party files

[[Page 111]]

a notice of intention to appeal and an appeal brief within twenty (20) 
days of the decision.
    (2) When an appeal is taken from the decision of the Presiding 
Officer, any party may file a brief with respect to the appeal. The 
party shall file the brief within fifteen (15) days of the date of the 
filing of the appellant's brief.
    (3) Any brief filed pursuant to this paragraph will contain, in the

the Environmental Appeals Board's decision, any party may file with the 
Environmental Appeals Board a petition for reconsideration of such 
decision, setting forth the relief desired and the grounds in support 
thereof. Any petition filed under this subsection must be confined to 
new questions raised by the decision or final order and upon which the 
petitioner had no opportunity to argue before the Presiding Officer or 
the Environmental Appeals Board; Provided, however, That in the case of 
a hearing requested under Sec. 86.1012-84(1) such new questions shall be 
limited to the issues specified in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (2) Any party desiring to oppose this petition shall file an answer 
thereto within ten (10) days after the filing of the petition. The 
filing of a petition for reconsideration shall not operate to stay the 
effective date of the decision or order or to toll the running of any 
statutory time period affecting such decision or order unless 
specifically so ordered by the Environmental Appeals Board.
    (y) Accelerated decision, dismissal. (1) The Presiding Officer, upon 
motion of any party or sua sponte, may at any time render an accelerated 
decision in favor of the Agency or the manufacturer as to all or any 
part of the proceeding, without further hearing or upon limited 
additional evidence such as affidavits which he may require, or dismiss 
any party with prejudice, for any of the following reasons:
    (i) Failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, or 
direct or collateral estoppel;
    (ii) The lack of any genuine issue of material fact, causing a party 
to be entitled to judgment as a matter of law; or
    (iii) Such other reasons as are just, including specifically failure 
to obey a procedural order of the Presiding Officer.
    (2) If, under this subsection, an accelerated decision is issued as 
to all the issues and claims joined in the proceeding, the decision will 
be treated for the purposes of these procedures as the decision of the 
Presiding Officer as provided in paragraph (s) of this section.
    (3) If, under this subsection, judgment is rendered on less than all 
issues or claims in the proceeding, the Presiding Officer shall 
determine what material facts exist without substantial controversy and 
what material facts are actually and in good faith controverted. He 
shall thereupon issue an order specifying the facts which appear without 
substantial controversy, and the issues and claims upon which the 
hearing will proceed.
    (z) Conclusion of hearing. (1) If, after the expiration of the 
period for taking an appeal as provided for by paragraphs (t) and (u) of 
this section, no appeal has been taken from the Presiding Officer's 
decision, and after the expiration of the period for review by the 
Environmental Appeals Board on its own motion as provided for by 
paragraph (v) of this section, the Environmental Appeals Board does not 
move to review such decision, the hearing is considered ended at the 
expiration of all periods allowed for the appeal and review.
    (2) If an appeal of the Presiding Officer's decision is taken 
pursuant to paragraphs (t) and (u) of this section, or if, in the 
absence of this appeal, the Environmental Appeals Board moves to review 
the decision of the Presiding Officer pursuant to paragraph (v) of this 
section, the hearing is considered ended upon rendering of a final 
decision by the Environmental Appeals Board.
    (aa) Judicial review. (1) The Administrator shall designate the 
General Counsel, Environmental Protection Agency as the officer upon 
whom copy of any petition for judicial review must be served. This 
officer shall be responsible for filing in the court the record of which 
the order of the Environmental Appeals Board is based.
    (2) Before forwarding the record to the court, the Agency shall 
advise the petitioner of costs of preparing it and as soon as payment to 
cover fees is made, shall forward the record to the court.

<R05>
Sec. 86.1103-87  Criteria for availability of nonconformance penalties.

    (a) EPA shall establish for each subclass of heavy-duty engines and 
heavy-duty vehicles (other than motorcycles), an NCP for a motor vehicle 
pollutant, when any new or revised emission standard is more stringent 
than the previous standard for the pollutant, or when an existing 
standard for that pollutant becomes more difficult to achieve because of 
a new or revised standard, provided that EPA finds:
    (1) That for such subclass of engines or vehicles, substantial work 
will be required to meet the standard for which the NCP is offered, and
    (2) That there is likely to be a technological laggard.
    (b) Substantial work, as used in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, 
means the application of technology not previously used in an engine or 
vehicle class or subclass, or the significant modification of existing 
technology or design parameters, needed to bring the vehicle or engine 
into compliance with

[[Page 115]]

either the more stringent new or revised standard or an existing 
standard which becomes more difficult to achieve because of a new or 
revised standard.


<R05>
Sec. 86.1104-91  Determination of upper limits.

    (a) The upper limit applicable to a pollutant emission standard for 
a subclass of heavy-duty engines or heavy-duty vehicles for which an NCP 
is established in accordance with Sec. 86.1103-87, shall be the previous 
pollutant emission standard for that subclass.
    (b) If no previous standard existed for the pollutant under 
paragraph (a) of this section, the upper limit will be developed by EPA 
during rulemaking.
    (c) If a manufacturer participates in any of the emissions 
averaging, trading, or banking programs, and carries over certification 
of an engine family from the prior model year, the upper limit for that 
engine family shall be the family emission limit of the prior model 
year, unless the family emission limit is less than the upper limit 
determined in paragraph (a) of this section.

Sec. 86.1106-87  Production compliance auditing.

    For a model year in which upper limits for heavy-duty engine or 
heavy-duty vehicle emission standards for one or more exhaust pollutants 
are specified in Sec. 86.1105-87, a manufacturer may elect to conduct a 
Production Compliance Audit (PCA) for each engine or vehicle 
configuration satisfying the following conditions:
    (a) Certification test results, pursuant to Sec. 86.082-23, exceed 
the emission standard for a particular pollutant but do not exceed the 
upper limit established for that pollutant. In that event, the 
manufacturer will be offered a qualified certificate of conformity 
allowing for the introduction into commerce of the specified engine 
family, Provided, That:
    (1) The manufacturer must agree to conduct a PCA of those engines or 
vehicles;
    (2) PCA testing must be conducted on the same configurations that 
exceeded the standard in certification. In lieu of that requirement, the 
Administrator may approve testing of a greater or lesser number of 
configurations provided the manufacturer agrees to pay the NCP 
determined from the CL of each tested configuration for that 
configuration and for other non-tested

[[Page 119]]

configurations that have similar emission characteristics. If an 
acceptable showing of similar emission characteristics is not made, the 
highest CL of the configurations tested will apply to all non-tested 
configurations exceeding the standard.
    (3) The selection of engines or vehicles for PCA testing must be 
initiated no later than five (5) days after the start of assembly-line 
production of the specified engine or vehicle configuration, unless that 
period is extended by the Administrator;
    (4) The manufacturer must agree:
    (i) To pay the NCP amount calculated as a result of PCA testing on 
each engine or vehicle, unless the manufacturer successfully challenges 
the Administrator's determination of the compliance level or penalty 
calculation or both under Sec. 86.1115-87(c);
    (ii) To recall any engines or vehicles introduced into commerce, 
without invoking the procedural requirements of section 207(c) of the 
Clean Air Act, if the compliance level for the engine or vehicle 
configuration of (a)(2) exceeds the upper limit as determined by the 
PCA;
    (5) If the compliance level determined in the PCA is below the 
emission standard, no NCP will be offered, and all appropriate 
qualifications will be removed from the qualified certificate of 
conformity.
    (b) An engine or vehicle configuration fails a Selective Enforcement 
Audit (SEA) under subpart K of 40 CFR part 86 with respect to the 
standard for a particular pollutant but does not fail with respect to 
the upper limit established for that pollutant, and no NCP has been 
previously assessed for that configuration, Provided, That:
    (1) The manufacturer must submit a written report to the 
Administrator within five (5) days after failure to pass the audit 
containing the following:
    (i) A statement that the manufacturer does not intend, at that time, 
to make any engine and/or emission control system design changes that 
may remedy the nonconformity; and
    (ii) A request from the manufacturer to conduct the PCA, including 
the date the testing will begin;
    (2) Failure to submit the report within five (5) days after the SEA 
failure will result in the forfeiture of the NCP option, unless a 
satisfactory justification for the delay is provided to the 
Administrator;
    (3) The selection of any required engines or vehicles for PCA 
testing must be initiated no later than ten (10) days after the SEA 
failure unless extended by the Administrator; otherwise, the 
manufacturer may forfeit the option to elect an NCP;
    (4) PCA testing must be conducted on the same configuration that 
failed the SEA;
    (5) Test results from the SEA, together with any additional test 
results required during the PCA, will be used in establishing a 
compliance level for the configuration pursuant to Sec. 86.1112-87(a); 
and
    (6) The manufacturer, upon approval by the Administrator to conduct 
a PCA on a failed SEA engine or vehicle configuration, must agree:
    (i) To pay the NCP amount calculated as a result of PCA testing on 
each engine or vehicle introduced into commerce after the tenth day of 
the SEA failure, unless the manufacturer successfully challenges the 
Administrator's determination of the compliance level or penalty 
calculation or both under Sec. 86.1115-87(c);
    (ii) To recall any engines or vehicles introduced into commerce 
after the tenth day of the SEA failure, without invoking the procedural 
requirements of section 207(c) of the Clean Air Act, if the compliance 
level of the engine or vehicle configuration exceeds the upper limit as 
determined by the PCA.
    (c) An engine or vehicle configuration, for which an NCP has been 
previously assessed for a particular pollutant, either passes an SEA 
with respect to the particular pollutant standard, fails an SEA with 
respect to the particular pollutant standard but not the previous 
compliance level, or fails an SEA with respect to the previous 
compliance level but not the associated upper limit, Provided, That:
    (1) The manufacturer must submit a written statement to the 
Administrator within five (5) days of the conclusion of the SEA 
requesting a PCA, including the date the PCA testing will

[[Page 120]]

begin; otherwise, the manufacturer forfeits the option to establish a 
new compliance level;
    (2) The selection of any required engines or vehicles for PCA 
testing must be initiated no later than ten (10) days after the 
conclusion of the SEA unless the period is extended by the 
Administrator; otherwise, the manufacturer forfeits the option to 
establish a new compliance level;
    (3) PCA testing must be conducted on the same configuration tested 
during the SEA, and all conditions in the SEA test order must apply to 
the PCA;
    (4) Test results for the SEA, together with any additional test 
results required during the PCA, will be used in establishing a new 
compliance level for the configuration pursuant to Sec. 86.1112-87(a);
    (5) The manufacturer must agree:
    (i) To pay the NCP amount calculated as a result of PCA testing on 
each engine or vehicle introduced into commerce after the tenth day of 
the conclusion of the SEA, unless the manufacturer successfully 
challenges the Administrator's determination of the compliance level or 
penalty calculation or both under Sec. 86.1115-87(c);
    (ii) To recall any engines or vehicles introduced into commerce 
after the tenth day after the conclusion of the SEA, without invoking 
the procedural requirements of section 207(c) of the Clean Air Act, if 
the engine or vehicle configuration exceeds the upper limit as 
determined by the PCA;
    (6) A previously assessed NCP will be terminated and no NCP will be 
established as a result of the new PCA if the compliance level is 
determined to be below the applicable emission standards.
    (d) The implementation of a production running change that causes 
the emission level for a particular pollutant to be either above the 
emission standard but below the associated upper limit for a vehicle or 
engine configuration for which an NCP has not been previously assessed, 
or below the associated upper limit for a vehicle or engine 
configuration for which an NCP has been previously assessed, regardless 
of the previous compliance level. In that event, the manufacturer will 
be offered a qualified certificate of conformity allowing for the 
introduction into commerce of the engine or vehicle configuration 
resulting from the running change, Provided, That:
    (1) The manufacturer must submit a written report to the 
Administrator outlining the reason for the running change and the date 
the manufacturer will begin PCA testing;
    (2) The manufacturer must agree:
    (i) To pay the NCP amount calculated as a result of PCA testing on 
each engine or vehicle, unless the manufacturer successfully challenges 
the Administrator's determination of compliance level or penalty 
calculation or both under Sec. 86.1115-87(c);
    (ii) To recall any engines or vehicles introduced into commerce, 
without invoking the procedural requirements of section 207(c) of the 
Clean Air Act, if the engine or vehicle configuration exceeds the upper 
limit as determined by the PCA;
    (3) The selection of engines or vehicles for PCA testing must be 
initiated no later than five (5) days after the start of assembly line 
production of the engine or vehicle configuration resulting from the 
running change unless that period is extended by the Administrator; and
    (4) If the compliance level is determined to be below the applicable 
emission standard, a previously assessed NCP will be terminated, an NCP 
will not be established as a result of the PCA testing, and all 
qualifications will be removed from the qualified certificate of 
conformity.

<R05>
Sec. 86.1110-87  Sample selection.

    (a) Engines or vehicles comprising a test sample which are required 
to be tested pursuant to a PCA in accordance with this subpart will be 
selected at

[[Page 124]]

the location and in the manner specified by EPA. If a manufacturer 
determines that the test engines or vehicles cannot be selected in the 
manner specified by EPA, an alternative selection procedure may be 
employed, provided that the manufacturer requests approval of the 
alternative procedure in advance of the start of test sample selection 
and that the Administrator approves the procedure.
    (b) The manufacturer shall have assembled the test engines or 
vehicles of the configuration selected for testing using its normal mass 
production processes for engines or vehicles to be distributed into 
commerce. In the case of heavy-duty engines, if the test engines are 
selected at a location where they do not have their operational and 
emission control systems installed, EPA will specify the manner and 
location for selection of components to complete assembly of the 
engines. The manufacturer shall assemble these components onto the test 
engines using normal assembly and quality control procedures as 
documented by the manufacturer.
    (c) No quality control, testing, or assembly procedures will be used 
on the completed test engine or vehicle or any portion thereof, 
including parts and subassemblies, that will not be used during the 
production and assembly of all other engines or vehicles of that 
configuration.
    (d) The EPA Enforcement Officers may specify that they, rather than 
the manufacturer, will select the test engines or vehicles.
    (e) The order in which test engines or vehicles are selected 
determines the order in which test results are to be used in applying 
the PCA testing plan in accordance with Sec. 86.1112-87.
    (f) The manufacturer shall keep on hand all engines or vehicles 
comprising the test sample until such time as a compliance level is 
determined in accordance with Sec. 86.1112-87(a) except that the 
manufacturer may ship any tested engine or vehicle which has not failed 
in accordance with Sec. 86.1112-87(f)(1). However, once the manufacturer 
ships any test engine or vehicle, it relinquishes the prerogative to 
conduct retests as provided in Sec. 86.1111-87(i).


<R05>
Sec. 86.1111-87  Test procedures for PCA testing.

    (a)(1) For heavy-duty engines, the prescribed test procedure for PCA 
testing is the Federal Test Procedure as described in subparts N, I, and 
P of this part.
    (2) For heavy-duty vehicles, the prescribed test procedure for PCA 
testing is described in subpart M of this part.
    (3) For light-duty trucks, the prescribed test procedure for PCA 
testing is the Federal Test Procedure as described in subparts B and P 
of this part.
    (4) During the testing of heavy-duty diesel engines, the 
manufacturer shall decide for each engine, prior to the start of the 
initial cold cycle, whether the measurement of background particulate is 
required for the cold and hot cycles to be valid. The manufacturer may 
choose to have different requirements for the cold and hot cycles. If a 
manufacturer chooses to require the measurement of background 
particulate, failure to measure background particulate shall void the 
test cycle regardless of the test results. If a test cycle is void, the 
manufacturer shall retest using the same validity requirements of the 
initial test.
    (5) When testing light-duty trucks, the following exceptions to the 
test procedures in subpart B are applicable:
    (i) The manufacturer may use gasoline test fuel meeting the 
specifications of paragraph (a) of Sec. 86.113 for mileage accumulation. 
Otherwise, the manufacturer may use fuels other than those specified in 
this section only with advance approval of the Administrator.
    (ii) The manufacturer may measure the temperature of the test fuel 
at other than the approximate midvolume of the fuel tank, as specified 
in paragraph (a) of Sec. 86.131, and may drain the test fuel from other 
than the lowest point of the fuel tank, as specified in paragraph (b) of 
Sec. 86.131, with the advance approval of the Administrator.
    (iii) The manufacturer may perform additional preconditioning on PCA 
test vehicles other than the preconditioning specified in Sec. 86.132 
only if the additional preconditioning has been performed on 
certification test vehicles of the same configuration.

[[Page 125]]

    (iv) The manufacturer shall perform the heat build procedure 11 to 
34 hours following vehicle preconditioning rather than according to the 
time period specified in paragraph (a) of Sec. 86.133.
    (v) The manufacturer may substitute slave tires for the drive wheel 
tires on the vehicle as specified in paragraph (e) of Sec. 86.135, 
provided that the slave tires are the same size as the drive wheel 
tires.
    (vi) The cold start exhaust emission test described in Sec. 86.137 
shall follow the heat build procedure described in Sec. 86.133 by not 
more than one hour.
    (vii) In performing exhaust sample analysis under Sec. 86.140:
    (A) When testing diesel vehicles, the manufacturer shall allow a 
minimum of 20 minutes warm-up for the HC analyzer, and a minimum of 2 
hours warm-up for the CO, CO<INF>2</INF> and NO<INF>X</INF> analyzers. 
[Power is normally left on for infrared and chemiluminescent analyzers. 
When not in use, the chopper motors of the infrared analyzers are turned 
off and the phototube high voltage supply to the chemiluminescent 
analyzers is placed in the standby position.]
    (B) The manufacturer shall exercise care to prevent moisture from 
condensing in the sample collection bags.
    (viii) The manufacturer need not comply with Sec. 86.142, since the 
records required therein are provided under other provisions of this 
subpart.
    (ix) In addition to the requirements of subpart B of this part, the 
manufacturer shall prepare gasoline-fueled vehicles as follows prior to 
exhaust emission testing:
    (A) The manufacturer shall inspect the fuel system to insure the 
absence of any leaks of liquid or vapor to the atmosphere by applying a 
pressure of 14.5 <plus-minus> 0.5 inches of water to the fuel system, 
allowing the pressure to stabilize, and isolating the fuel system from 
the pressure source. Following isolation of the fuel system, pressure 
must not drop more than 2.0 inches of water in 5 minutes. If required, 
the manufacturer shall perform corrective action in accordance with 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (B) When performing this pressure check, the manufacturer shall 
exercise care to neither purge nor load the evaporative emission control 
system.
    (C) The manufacturer shall not modify the test vehicle's evaporative 
emission control system by component addition, deletion, or 
substitution, except to comply with paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section 
if approved in advance by the Administrator.
    (b)(1) The manufacturer shall not adjust, repair, prepare, or modify 
the engines or vehicles selected for testing and shall not perform any 
emission tests on engines or vehicles selected for testing pursuant to a 
PCA request unless the adjustment, repair, preparation, modification, or 
tests are documented in the manufacturer's engine or vehicle assembly 
and inspection procedures and are actually performed on all engines or 
vehicles produced or unless these adjustments or tests are required or 
permitted under this subpart or are approved in advance by the 
Administrator.
    (2) For 1984 and later model years the Administrator may adjust or 
cause to be adjusted any engine parameter which the Administrator has 
determined to be subject to adjustment for certification, Selective 
Enforcement Audit and Production. Compliance Audit testing in accordance 
with Sec. 86.084-22(e)(1), to any setting within the physically 
adjustable range of that parameter, as determined by the Administrator 
in accordance with Sec. 86.084-2(e)(3)(ii), prior to the performance of 
any tests. However, if the idle speed parameter is one which the 
Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment, the 
Administrator shall not adjust it to any setting which causes a lower 
engine idle speed than would have been possible within the physically 
adjustable range of the idle speed parameter if the manufacturer had 
accumulated 125 hours of service on the engine or 4,000 miles on the 
vehicle under paragraph (c) of this section, all other parameters being 
identically adjusted for the purpose of the comparison. The manufacturer 
may be requested to supply information to establish such an alternative 
minimum idle speed. The Administrator, in making or specifying these 
adjustments, may consider the effect of the deviation from the 
manufacturer's recommended setting on emissions performance 
characteristics as well as the

[[Page 126]]

likelihood that similar settings will occur on in-use heavy-duty engines 
or light-duty trucks. In determining likelihood, the Administrator may 
consider factors such as, but not limited to, the effect of the 
adjustment on engine or vehicle performance characteristics and 
surveillance information from similar in-use engines or vehicles.
    (c) Prior to performing emission testing on a PCA test engine, the 
manufacturer may accumulate on each engine a number of hours of service 
equal to the greater of 125 hours or the number of hours the 
manufacturer accumulated during certification on the emission-data 
engine corresponding to the configuration tested during PCA. Prior to 
performing emission testing on a PCA test vehicle, the manufacturer may 
accumulate a number of miles equal to the greater of 4,000 miles or the 
number of miles the manufacturer accumulated during certification on the 
emission-data vehicle corresponding to the configuration tested during 
PCA. Service or mileage accumulation may be performed in any manner the 
manufacturer desires.
    (d) No maintenance shall be performed on test engines or vehicles 
after selection for testing nor will any test engine or vehicle 
substitution or replacement be allowed, unless requested of and approved 
by the Administrator in advance of the performance of any maintenance or 
engine or vehicle substitution.
    (e) The manufacturer shall expeditiously ship test engines or 
vehicles from the point of selection to the test facility or other 
location to meet any other requirements of this subpart. If the test 
facility is not located at or in close proximity to the point of 
selection, the manufacturer shall assure that test engines or vehicles 
arrive at the test facility within 24 hours of selection, except that 
the Administrator may approve more time based upon a request by the 
manufacturer accompanied by a satisfactory justification.
    (f) If an engine or vehicle cannot complete the service or mileage 
accumulation or emission tests because of engine or vehicle malfunction, 
the manufacturer may request that the Administrator authorize the repair 
of the engine or vehicle. If the engine or vehicle cannot be repaired 
expeditiously, EPA may delete it from the test sequence.
    (g)(1) Heavy-duty engine manufacturers with projected sales bound 
for the United States market for that year of 30,000 or greater, as made 
in their respective Applications for Certification, shall complete 
emission testing at their testing facility on a minimum of two engines 
per 24 hour period, including voided tests.
    (2) Heavy-duty engine manufacturers with projected sales bound for 
the United States market for that year of less than 30,000, as made in 
their respective Applications for Certification, Shall complete emission 
testing at one engine per 24 hour period, including voided tests.
    (3) Light-duty truck manufacturers shall complete emission testing 
on a minimum of four vehicles per 24 hour period, including voided 
tests.
    (4) The Administrator may approve a longer period of time for 
conducting emission tests based upon a request by a manufacturer 
accompanied by a satisfactory justification.
    (h) The manufacturer shall perform test engine or vehicle selection, 
shipping, preparation, service or mileage accumulation, and testing in 
such a manner as to insure that the audit is performed in an expeditious 
manner.
    (i) The manufacturer may retest any engines or vehicles tested 
during a Production Compliance Audit once a compliance level has been 
established in accordance with Sec. 86.1112-87 based on the first test 
on each engine or vehicle. The Administrator may approve retesting at 
other times based upon a request by the manufacturer accompanied by a 
satisfactory justification. The manufacturer may test each engine or 
vehicle a total of three times. The manufacturer shall test each engine 
or vehicle the same number of times. The manufacturer may accumulate 
additional service or mileage before conducting a retest, subject to the 
provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 86.1112-87  Determining the compliance level and reporting of test results.

    (a) A manufacturer that has elected to conduct a PCA in accordance 
with Sec. 86.1106-87 may establish the compliance level for a pollutant 
for any engine or vehicle configuration by using the primary PCA 
sampling plan or either of two optional reduced PCA sampling plans (the 
fixed reduced sampling plan or the sequential reduced sampling plan) 
described below. A manufacturer that uses either of the two optional 
reduced PCA sampling plans may elect to continue testing and establish a 
compliance level under the primary PCA sampling plan.
    (1) A manufacturer that elects to conduct a PCA for a pollutant 
using the primary PCA sampling plan shall:
    (i) Conduct emission tests on 24 engines or vehicles in accordance 
with Sec. 86.1111-87 for the pollutants for which the PCA was initiated. 
If the PCA follows an SEA failure, the number of additional tests 
conducted shall be the difference between 24 and the number of engines 
or vehicles tested in the SEA. If 24 or more engines or vehicles were 
tested in the SEA, no additional tests shall be conducted; and
    (ii) Rank the final deteriorated test results, as defined by 
paragraph (e) of this section, obtained for that pollutant in order from 
the lowest to the highest value. If the PCA follows an SEA failure, all 
SEA test results for that pollutant shall be included in this ranking.
    (iii) The compliance level for that pollutant is the final 
deteriorated test result in the sequence determined from table 1 of 
appendix XII of these regulations.
    (2) A manufacturer that elects to conduct a PCA for a pollutant 
using the fixed reduced PCA sampling plan shall:
    (i) Select a sample size between 3 and 23 engines or vehicles. If 
the PCA follows an SEA failure, the sample size selected cannot be less 
than the number of engines or vehicles tested during the SEA; and
    (ii) Conduct emission tests on the selected sample in accordance 
with Sec. 86.1111-87 for the pollutants for which the PCA was initiated.
    (iii) The compliance level for the pollutant is the result of the 
following equation, using the test results obtained in paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii) of this section and all SEA test results for that pollutant 
if the PCA follows an SEA failure:

CL=X + Ks

where:

CL=The compliance level.
X=The mean of the final deteriorated test results, as defined by 
paragraph (e) of this section.
K=A value that depends on the size of the test sample. See table 2 of 
appendix XII of this part for the value of K that corresponds to the 
size of the test sample.
s=The sample standard deviation.


The compliance level is rounded to the same number of significant 
figures contained in the applicable standard in accordance with ASTM 
E29-67.
    (3) A manufacturer that elects to conduct a PCA for a pollutant 
using the sequential reduced PCA sampling plan shall perform the 
following:
    (i) Select a sample size of 4, 8, 12, 16 or 20 engines or vehicles. 
If the PCA follows an SEA failure, the sample size selected cannot be 
less than the number of engines or vehicles tested during the SEA.
    (ii) Conduct emission tests on the selected sample in accordance 
with Sec. 86.1111-87 for the pollutants for which the PCA was initiated.
    (iii) The compliance level for the pollutant is the result of the 
following equation, using the test results obtained in (a)(3)(ii) and 
all SEA test results for that pollutant if the PCA follows an SEA 
failure:

CL=X + Ks

where:

CL=The compliance level.
X=The mean of the final deteriorated test results, as defined by 
paragraph (e) of this section.
K=A value that depends on the size of the test sample. See table 3 of 
appendix XII of this part for the value of K that corresponds to the 
size of the test sample.
s=The sample standard deviation.


The compliance level is rounded to the same number of significant 
figures contained in the applicable standard in accordance with ASTM 
E29-67.

[[Page 128]]

    (iv) After calculating a compliance level in accordance with 
paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section, a manufacturer may elect to 
increase the sample size by 4 engines or vehicles, or a multiple 
thereof, up to the maximum, including SEA engines or vehicles if any, of 
20. Upon that election, the manufacturer shall add the additional 
engines or vehicles to the sample and perform paragraphs (a)(3)(ii) and 
(a)(3)(iii) of this section. This election may be repeated if 
appropriate. A compliance level determined under this election shall 
replace a previously determined compliance level.
    (b) A fail decision is reached with respect to the upper limit when 
the compliance level determined in paragraph (a) of this section exceeds 
the applicable upper limit.
    (c) Initial test results are calculated following the Federal Test 
Procedure specified in Sec. 86.1111-87(a).
    (d) Final test results are calculated by summing the initial test 
results derived in paragraph (c) of this section for each test engine or 
vehicle, dividing by the number of tests conducted on the engine or 
vehicle, and rounding in accordance with ASTM E29-67 to the same number 
of decimal places contained in the applicable standard expressed to one 
additional significant figure.
    (e) Final deteriorated test results. (1) The final deteriorated test 
results for each heavy-duty engine or light-duty truck tested according 
to subpart B, I, N, or P of this part are calculated by applying the 
final test results by the appropriate deterioration factor, derived from 
the certification process for the engine family control system 
combination and model year for the selected configuration to which the 
test engine or vehicle belongs. If the deterioration factor computed 
during the certification process is multiplicative and it is less than 
one, that deterioration factor will be one. If the deterioration factor 
computed during the certification process is additive and it is less 
than zero, that deterioration factor will be zero.
    (2) The final deteriorated test results are rounded to the same 
number of significant figures contained in the applicable standard in 
accordance with ASTM E29-67.
    (f) A failed engine or vehicle is one whose final deteriorated test 
results, for one or more of the applicable exhaust pollutants, exceed:
    (1) The applicable emission standard, or
    (2) The compliance level established in paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (g) Within five working days after completion of PCA testing of all 
engines or vehicles, the manufacturer shall submit to the Administrator 
a report which includes the following information:
    (1) The location and description of the manufacturer's emission test 
facilities which were utilized to conduct testing reported pursuant to 
this section;
    (2) The applicable standards against which the engines or vehicles 
were tested;
    (3) Deterioration factors for the engine family to which the 
selected configuration belongs;
    (4) A description of the engine or vehicle and any emission-related 
component selection method used;
    (5) For each test conducted:
    (i) Test engine or vehicle description, including;
    (A) Configuration and engine family identification,
    (B) Year, make and build date,
    (C) Engine or vehicle identification number, and
    (D) Number of hours of service accumulated on engine or number of 
miles on vehicle prior to testing;
    (ii) Location where service or mileage accumulation was conducted 
and description of accumulation procedure and schedule;
    (iii) Test number, date, initial test results before and after 
rounding, final test results and final deteriorated test results for all 
emission tests, whether valid or invalid, and the reason for 
invalidation, if applicable;

Sec. 86.1113-87  Calculation and payment of penalty.

    (a) The NCP for each engine or vehicle for which a compliance level 
has been determined under Sec. 86.1112-87 is calculated according to the 
formula in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section depending on the 
value of the compliance level. Each formula contains an annual 
adjustment factor (AAF<INF>i</INF>) which is defined in paragraph (a)(3) 
of this section. Other terms in the formulas are defined in paragraph 
(a)(4) of this section.
    (1) If the compliance level (CL) is greater than the standard and 
less than or equal to X (e.g., point CL<INF>1</INF> in figure 1), then:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.111

where:

PR<INF>1</INF> = (F) (MC<INF>50</INF>)

    (2) If the compliance level is greater than X and less than or equal 
to the upper limit as determined by Sec. 86.1104-87 (e.g., point 
CL<INF>2</INF> in figure 1), then:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.112

where:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.113

    (3) AAF<INF>i</INF> has the following values:
    (i) If frac<INF>i-1</INF> = 0, then AAF<INF>i</INF> = 1 + 
I<INF>i-1</INF>
    (ii) If frac<INF>i-1</INF> <ls-thn-eq>0, then:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.114
    

[[Page 130]]


[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.183


If frac<INF>i-1</INF> <ls-thn-eq>0.50, then frac<INF>i-1</INF> will be 
set equal to 0.50.
    (iii) AAF<INF>1</INF>=1
    (iv) In calculating the NCP for year n, the value frac<INF>i-1</INF> 
for i=n will include actual NCP usage through March 31 of model year n-1 
and EPA's estimate of additional usage for the remainder of model year 
n-1 using manufacturer input. All manufacturers using NCPs must report 
by subclass actual NCP and non-NCP production numbers through March 31, 
an estimate of NCP and non-NCP production for the remainder of the model 
year, and the previous year's actual NCP and non-NCP production to EPA 
no later than April 30 of the model year. If EPA is unable to obtain 
similar information from manufacturers not using NCPs, EPA will use 
projected sales data from the manufacturers' application for 
certification in computing the total production of the subclass and the 
frac<INF>i-1</INF>. The value of frac<INF>i-1</INF> will be corrected to 
reflect actual year-end usage of NCPs and a corrected AAF will be used 
to establish NCPs in future years. The correction of previous year's AAF 
will not affect the previous year's penalty.
    (4) The terms in the above formulas have the following meanings and 
values, which may be determined separately for each subclass and 
pollutant for which an NCP is offered. The production of Federal and 
California designated engines or vehicles shall be combined for the 
purpose of this section in calculating the NCP for each engine or 
vehicle.

NCP<INF>n</INF>=NCP for year n for each applicable engine or vehicle
CL=Compliance level for year n for applicable engines or vehicles
S=Emission standard
UL=Upper limit as determined by section 86.1104-87, except that, if the 
upper limit is determined by section 86.1104-87(c), the value of UL in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall be the prior emission standard 
for that pollutant.
UL'=Upper limit as determined by section 86.1104-87(c). This value is 
not used in the above formulas.
X=Compliance level above the standard at which NCP<INF>1</INF> equals 
COC<INF>50</INF>

[[Page 131]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.115

PR<INF>1</INF>=Penalty rate when CL [lE] X
PR<INF>2</INF>=Penalty rate when X < CL [lE] applicable upper limit
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.116

i=An index representing a year. It represents the same year for both 
Federal and California designated engines or vehicles of the same 
production model year.
n=Index representing the number of model years for which the NCP has 
been available for an engine or vehicle subclass (i.e., n=1 for the 
first year that the NCP is available, and so on until n=n for the nth 
year that the NCP is available). The factor ``n'' is based on the model 
year the NCP is first available, as specified in section 86.1105-87 for 
the engine or vehicle subclass and pollutant for both Federal and 
California designated engines and vehicles.
COC<INF>50</INF>=Estimate of the average total incremental cost to 
comply with the standard relative to complying with the upper limit.
COC<INF>90</INF>=Estimate of the 90th percentile total incremental cost 
to comply with the standard relative to complying with the upper limit.
MC<INF>50</INF>=Estimate of the average marginal cost of compliance 
(dollars per emission unit) with the standard.
F=Factor used to estimate the 90th percentile marginal cost based on the 
average marginal cost (the minimum value of F is 1.1, the maximum value 
of F is 1.3).
AAF<INF>i</INF>=Annual adjustment factor for year i, 
frac<INF>i-1</INF>=Fraction of engines or vehicles of a subclass using 
NCPs in previous year (year i-1).
A<INF>i</INF>=Usage adjustment factor in year i: A<INF>i</INF>=0.10 for 
i=2; A<INF>i</INF>=0.08 for i<2.
I<INF>i</INF>=Percentage increase in overall consumer price index in 
year i.

    (5) The values of COC<INF>50</INF>, COC<INF>90</INF>, 
MC<INF>50</INF> and F will be determined for each applicable subclass by 
EPA based on the cost data used by EPA in setting the applicable 
emission standard. However, where the rulemaking to establish a specific 
NCP occurs after the rulemaking to establish the standard, EPA may 
augment the data base used to establish the standard by including the 
best cost and emission performance data available to EPA during the 
specific NCP rulemaking.
    (6) In calculating the NCP, appropriate values of the following 
predefined terms should be used: CL, S, UL, F, and A<INF>i</INF>. For 
all other terms, unrounded values of at least five figures beyond the 
decimal point should be used in calculations leading up to the penalty 
amount. Any NCP calculated under paragraph (a) of this section will be 
rounded to the nearest dollar in accordance with ASTM E29-67.
    (b) The NCP determined in paragraph (a) of this section is assessed 
against all those engines or vehicles of the nonconforming configuration 
or engine family produced at all assembly plants and distributed into 
commerce--
    (1) Since the beginning of the model year in the case of a 
certification failure described by Sec. 86.1106-87(a).
    (2) Beginning ten days after an SEA failure described by 
Sec. 86.1106-87 (b) or (c).
    (3) Following implementation of a production running change 
described by Sec. 86.1106-87(d).
    (c) The NCP will continue to be assessed during the model year, 
until such time, if any, that the configuration or engine family is 
brought into conformance with applicable emission standards.
    (d) A manufacturer may carry over an NCP from a model year to the 
next model year. There is no limit to the number of years that carryover 
can continue. The amount of the penalty will increase each year 
according to paragraph (a) of this section.
    (e) The Administrator shall notify the manufacturer in writing of 
the nonconformance penalty established under paragraph (a) of this 
section after the completion of the PCA under Sec. 86.1112-87.
    (f) A manufacturer may request a hearing under Sec. 86.1115-87 as to 
whether

[[Page 132]]

the compliance level (including a compliance level in excess of the 
upper limit) was determined in accordance with the procedures in 
Sec. 86.1112-87(a) or whether the nonconformance penalty was calculated 
in accordance with the procedures in Sec. 86.1113-87(a). If a 
nonconformance penalty has been established, such hearing must be 
requested within fifteen (15) days or such other period as may be 
allowed by the Administrator after the notification of the 
nonconformance penalty. If a manufacturer wishes to challenge a 
compliance level in excess of the upper limit, he must request a hearing 
within fifteen (15) days or such other period as may be allowed by the 
Administrator after the completion of the Production Compliance Audit.
    (g)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the 
nonconformance penalty or penalties assessed under this subpart must be 
paid as follows:
    (i) By the quarterly due dates, i.e., within 30 days of the end of 
each calendar quarter (March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31), 
or according to such other payment schedule as the Administrator may 
approve pursuant to a manufacturer's request, for all nonconforming 
engines or vehicles produced by a manufacturer in accordance with 
paragraph (b) of this section and distributed into commerce for that 
quarter.
    (ii) The penalty shall be payable to U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency, NCP Fund, P.O. Box 360277M, Pittsburgh, PA 15251.
    (2) When a manufacturer has requested a hearing under Sec. 86.1115-
87, it must pay the nonconformance penalty, and any interest, within ten 
days after the Presiding Officer renders his decision, unless the 
manufacturer first files a notice of intention to appeal to the 
Administrator pursuant to Sec. 86.1115-87(t)(1), or, if an appeal of the 
Presiding Officer's decision is taken, within ten days after the 
Administrator renders his decision, unless the manufacturer first files 
a petition for judicial review.
    (3) A manufacturer making payment under paragraph (g)(1) or (g)(2) 
of this section shall submit the following information by each quarterly 
due date to: Director, Manufacturers Operations Division, U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., 
Washington, DC 20460. This information shall be submitted even if a 
manufacturer has no NCP production in a given quarter.
    (i) Corporate identification, identification and quantity of engines 
or vehicles subject to the NCP, certificate identification (number and 
date), NCP payment calculations and interest payment calculations, if 
applicable.
    (ii) The following statement and endorsement:

    This information is submitted pursuant to section 206 of the Clean 
Air Act. All information reported herein is, to the best of
------------------------------------------'s
(Company name)

knowledge, true and accurate. I am aware of the penalties associated 
with violations of the Clean Air Act and the regulations thereunder.

________________________________________________________________________
(Authorized Company Representative)
    (4) The Administrator may verify the production figures or other 
documentation submitted under paragraph (g)(3) of this section.
    (5)(i) Interest shall be assessed on any nonconformance penalty for 
which payment has been withheld under Sec. 86.113-87(g) (1) or (2). 
Interest shall be calculated from the due date for the first quarterly 
NCP payment, as determined under Sec. 86.1113-87(g)(1), until either the 
date on which the Presiding Officer or the Administrator renders the 
final decision of the Agency under Sec. 86.1115-87 or the date when an 
alternate payment schedule (approved pursuant to Sec. 86.1113-87(g)(1)) 
ends.
    (ii) The combined principal plus interest on each quarterly NCP 
payment withheld pursuant to Sec. 86.1113-87(g) (1) or (2) shall be 
calculated according to the formula:

QNCP(1 + R).25n

where:
QNCP=the quarterly NCP payment
R=the interest rate applicable to that quarter
n=the number of quarters for which the quarterly NCP payment is 
outstanding.

    (iii) The number of quarters for which payment is outstanding for 
purposes of this paragraph shall be the number of quarterly NCP payment 
due dates, as determined under Sec. 86.1113-

[[Page 133]]

87(g)(1), which have elapsed throughout the duration of a hearing 
request, or alternate payment schedule.
    (iv) The interest rate applicable to a quarter for purposes of this 
paragraph shall be the rate published by the Secretary of the Treasury 
pursuant to the Debt Collection Act of 1982 and effective on the date on 
which the NCP payment was originally due.
    (6) A manufacturer will be refunded an overpayment, or be permitted 
to offset an overpayment by withholding a future payment, if approved in 
advance by the Administrator. The government shall pay no interest on 
overpayments.
    (h) A manufacturer that certifies as a replacement for the 
nonconforming configuration, a configuration that is in conformance with 
applicable standards, and that performs a production compliance audit 
(PCA) in accordance with Sec. 86.1112-87(a) that results in a compliance 
level below the applicable standard, will be eligible to receive a 
refund of a portion of the engineering and development component of the 
penalty. The engineering and development component will be determined by 
multiplying the base penalty amount by the engineering and development 
factor for the appropriate subclass and pollutant in Sec. 86.1105-87. 
The amount refunded will depend on the model year in which the 
certification and PCA take place. In cases where payment of penalties 
have been waived by EPA in accordance with paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this 
section, EPA will refund a portion of the engineering and development 
component. The proportionate refund to be paid by EPA will be based on 
the proportion of vehicles or engines of the nonconforming configuration 
for which NCPs were paid to EPA. The refund is calculated as follows:

R<INF>tot</INF>=D<INF>n</INF> x F<INF>E&D</INF> x NCP<INF>1</INF> x 
Prod<INF>tot</INF>
R<INF>Cal</INF>=(Prod<INF>Cal</INF>/Prod<INF>tot</INF>) x 
(R<INF>tot</INF>)
R<INF>EPA</INF>=R<INF>tot</INF>-R<INF>Cal</INF>

Where:
n=index representing the number of model years for which the NCP has 
been available for an engine or vehicle subclass (i.e., n=1 for the 
first year that NCPs are available, . . . , n=n for the n<SUP>th</SUP> 
year the NCPs are available; same as ``n'' in paragraph (a)(4)).
D<INF>n</INF>=discount factor depending on the number of model years (n) 
for which NCPs were available at the time of certification and PCA of 
the replacement configuration, and its value is as follows:
    D<INF>1</INF>=0.90
    D<INF>2</INF>=0.79
    D<INF>3</INF>=0.67
    D<INF>4</INF>=0.54
    D<INF>5</INF>=0.39
    D<INF>6</INF>=0.23
    D<INF>7</INF>=0.05
    D<INF>n</INF>=0.00 for n=8 or larger
F<INF>E&D</INF>=the engineering and development factor specified in 
section 86.1105-87 for the appropriate subclass and pollutant
NCP<INF>1</INF>=the penalty for each engine or vehicle during the first 
(base) year the NCP is available as calculated in paragraph (a)
Prod<INF>tot</INF>=total number of engines or vehicles produced in the 
subclass for which NCPs were paid to EPA or to the State of California
Prod<INF>Cal</INF>=number of engines or vehicles in the subclass 
demonstrated to have been titled, registered or principally used in the 
State of California and for which NCPs were paid to the State of 
California under paragraph (g)(1)

[[Page 134]]

days after successful completion of testing on the failed engine or 
vehicle, which contains a description of the remedy and test results for 
each engine or vehicle in addition to other information that may be 
required by this regulation.
    (c) The Administrator may suspend the certificate of conformity if 
the manufacturer, after electing to conduct a PCA, fails to adhere to 
the requirements stated in Sec. 86.1106-87(b)(3), (b)(6)(iii), (c)(2), 
or (c)(5)(iii).
    (d) The Administrator may suspend the qualified certificate of 
conformity issued under the conditions specified in Sec. 86.1106-87 if 
the manufacturer fails to adhere to the requirements stated in 
Sec. 86.1106-87(a)(3), (a)(4)(iii), (d)(2)(iii), or (d)(3).
    (e) The Administrator may suspend the certificate of conformity or 
the qualified certificate of conformity if the compliance level as 
determined in Sec. 86.1112-87(a) is in excess of the upper limit.
    (f) The Administrator may void the certificate of conformity if the 
compliance level as determined in Sec. 86.1112-87(a) is in excess of the 
upper limit and the manufacturer fails to recall any engines or vehicles 
introduced into commerce pursuant to Sec. 86.1106-87(a)(4)(ii), 
(b)(6)(ii), (c)(5)(ii) or (d)(2)(ii).
    (g) The Administrator may void the certificate of conformity for 
those engines or vehicles for which the manufacturer fails to meet the

part, except as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (i) A certificate of conformity suspended or voided under paragaph 
(c), (d), (e), (f) or (g) of this section may be reinstated after a 
written request by the manufacturer and under such terms and conditions 
as the Administrator may require and after the manufacturer demonstrates 
compliance with applicable requirements.
    (j) After the Administrator suspends or voids a certificate of 
conformity pursuant to this section or notifies a manufacturer of his 
intent to suspend or void a certificate of conformity under Sec. 86.087-
30(e), and prior to the commencement of a hearing, if any, under 
Sec. 86.1115-87, if the manufacturer demonstrates to the Administrator's 
satisfaction that the decision to suspend or void the certificate was 
based on erroneous information, the Administrator shall reinstate the 
certificate.


<R05>
Sec. 86.1115-87  Hearing procedures for nonconformance determinations and 
penalties.

    (a) Applicability. The procedures prescribed by this section shall 
apply whenever a manufacturer requests a hearing pursuant to 
Sec. 86.087-30(e)(6)(i), Sec. 86.087-30(e)(7), or Sec. 86.1113-87(f).
    (b) Definitions. The following definitions shall be applicable to 
this section:
    (1) Hearing Clerk shall mean the Hearing Clerk of the Environmental 
Protection Agency.
    (2) Manufacturer means a manufacturer contesting a compliance level 
or penalty determination sent to the manufacturer.
    (3) Party means the Agency and the manufacturer.
    (4) Presiding Officer shall mean an Administrative Law Judge 
appointed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 3105 (see also 5 CFR part 930 as 
amended).
    (5) Environmental Appeals Board shall mean the Board within the 
Agency described in Sec. 1.25 of this title. The Administrator delegates 
authority to the Environmental Appeals Board to issue final decisions in 
appeals filed under this subpart. Appeals directed to the Administrator, 
rather than to the Environmental Appeals Board, will not be considered. 
This delegation of authority to the Environmental Appeals Board does not 
preclude the Environmental Appeals Board from referring an appeal or a 
motion filed under this subpart to the Administrator for decision when 
the Environmental Appeals Board, in its discretion, deems it appropriate 
to do so. When an appeal or motion is referred to the Administrator, all 
parties shall be so notified and the rules in this part referring to the 
Environmental Appeals Board shall be interpreted as referring to the 
Administrator.

[[Page 135]]

    (c) Request for public hearing. (1) A manufacturer may request a 
hearing pursuant to Sec. 86.1113-87(f) if it disagrees with the 
Administrator's determination of compliance level or penalty calculation 
or both, or pursuant to Sec. 86.085-30(e)(6)(i) or Sec. 86.085-30(e)(7) 
if it disagrees with the Administrator's proposed suspension or voiding 
of a certificate of conformity. Requests for such a hearing shall be 
filed no later than 15 days:
    (i) After receipt of the Administrator's notification of NCP, if the 
compliance level is in the allowable range of non-conformity, or
    (ii) After completion of the Production Compliance Audit, if the 
compliance level exceeds the upper limit, or
    (iii) After receipt of the Administrator's notification of a 
proposed suspension or voiding of a certificate of conformity if the 
hearing is requested pursuant to Secs. 86.085-30(e)(6)(i) or 86.085-
30(e)(7), unless otherwise specified by the Administrator. The 
manufacturer shall simultaneously serve two copies of this request upon 
the Director of the Manufacturers Operations Division and file two 
copies with the Hearing Clerk. Failure of the manufacturer to request a 
hearing within the time provided constitutes a waiver of the right to a 
hearing. Subsequent to the expiration of the period for requesting a 
hearing as of right, the Administrator may, in his discretion and for 
good cause shown, grant the manufacturer a hearing to contest the 
compliance level or penalty calculation.
    (2) The request for a public hearing shall contain:
    (i) A statement as to which vehicle or engine subclasses or 
configurations are to be the subject of the hearing;
    (ii) A concise statement of the issues to be raised by the 
manufacturer at the hearing for each vehicle or engine subclass or 
configuration for which the manufacturer has requested the hearing. 
Provided, however, That in the case of a hearing requested under 
Sec. 86.1113-87(f), the hearing shall be restricted to the following 
issues:
    (A) Whether the compliance level was determined in accordance with 
the procedures in Sec. 86.1112-87(a); or
    (B) Whether the penalty was calculated in accordance with the 
procedures in Sec. 86.1113-87(a).
    (iii) A statement specifying reasons why the manufacturer believes 
it will prevail on the merits on each of the issues so raised; and
    (iv) A summary of the evidence which supports the manufacturer's 
position on each of the issues so raised.
    (3) A copy of all requests for public hearings shall be kept on file 
in the Office of the Hearing Clerk and shall be made available to the 
public during Agency business hours.
    (d) Summary decision. (1) In the case of a hearing requested under 
Sec. 86.1113-87(f) when it clearly appears from the data and other 
information contained in the request for a hearing that there is no 
genuine and substantial question of fact with respect to the issues 
specified in Sec. 86.1115-87(c)(2)(ii), the Administrator will enter an 
order denying the request for a hearing, and reaffirming the original 
compliance level determination or penalty calculation.
    (2) Any order issued under paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall 
have the force and effect of a final decision of the Administrator, as 
issued pursuant to paragraph (v)(4) of this section.
    (3) If the Administrator determines that a genuine and substantial 
question of fact does exist with respect to any of the issues referred 
to in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, he shall grant the request for a 
hearing and publish a notice of public hearing in accordance with 
paragraph (h) of this section.
    (e) Filing and service. (1) An original and two copies of all 
documents or papers required or permitted to be filed pursuant to this 
section shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk. Filing shall be deemed

[[Page 136]]

hearing. A certificate of service shall be provided on or accompany each 
document or paper filed with the Hearing Clerk. Documents to be served 
upon the Director of the Manufacturers Operations Division shall be sent 
by registered mail to: Director, Manufacturers Operations Division, U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EN-340F), 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., 
Washington, DC 20460. Service by registered mail is complete upon 
mailing.
    (f) Time. (1) In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed 
by this section, except as otherwise provided, the day of the act or 
event from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not 
be included. Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal legal holidays shall be 
included in computing any such period allowed for the filing of any 
document or paper, except that when such a period expires on a Saturday, 
Sunday, or Federal legal holiday, such period shall be extended to 
include the next following business day.
    (2) A prescribed period of time within which a party is required or 
permitted to do an act shall be computed from the time of service, 
except that when service is accomplished by mail, three days shall be 
added to the prescribed period.
    (g)(1) Consolidation. The Administrator of the Presiding Officer in 
his discretion may consolidate two or more proceedings to be held under 
this section for the purpose of resolving one or more issues whenever it 
appears that such consolidation will expedite or simplify consideration 
of such issues. Consolidation shall not affect the right of any party to 
raise issues that could have been raised if consolidation had not 
occurred.
    (2) If a vehicle or engine is determined to be in nonconformity 
during certification testing under subpart A of this part, then the 
manufacturer may wait to challenge the determination until after 
production compliance auditing and calculation of his penalty and may 
consolidate challenges to the determination of nonconformity and the 
compliance level determination or the penalty calculation, without 
losing any rights he would otherwise have had.
    (3) If a vehicle or engine is determined to be in nonconformity 
during selective enforcement auditing under subpart K of this part, then 
the manufacturer must wait to challenge the determination until after 
the compliance level determination and the penalty calculation, and must 
consolidate challenges to the determination of nonconformity and the 
compliance level determination or the calculation of the penalty.
    (h) Notice of public hearings. (1) Notice of public hearing under 
this section shall be given by publication in the Federal Register and 
by such other means as the Administrator finds appropriate to provide 
notice to the public. To the extent possible, hearings under this 
section shall be scheduled to commence within 30 days of receipt of the 
application in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) [Revised]
    (i) Amicus curiae. Persons not parties to the proceeding wishing to 
file briefs may do so by leave of the Presiding Officer granted on 
motion. A motion for leave shall identify the interest of the applicant 
and shall state the reasons why the proposed amicus brief is desirable.
    (j) Presiding Officer. The Presiding Officer shall have the duty to 
conduct a fair and impartial hearing in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 554, 
556 and 557 and to take all necessary action to avoid delay in the 
disposition of the proceedings and to maintain order. He shall have all 
power consistent with Agency rules and with the Administrative Procedure 
Act necessary to this end, including the following:
    (1) To administer oaths and affirmations;
    (2) To rule upon offers of proof and exclude irrelevant or 
repetitious material;
    (3) To regulate the course of the hearings and the conduct of the 
parties and their counsel therein;
    (4) To hold conferences for simplification of the issues or any 
other proper purpose;
    (5) To consider and rule upon all procedural and other motions 
appropriate in such proceedings;
    (6) To require the submission of direct testimony in written form 
with or

[[Page 137]]

without affidavit whenever, in the opinion of the Presiding Officer, 
oral testimony is not necessary for full and true disclosure of the 
facts;
    (7) To enforce agreements and orders requiring access as authorized 
by law;
    (8) To require the filing of briefs on any matter on which he is 
required to rule;
    (9) To require any party or any witness, during the course of the 
hearing, to state his position on any issue;
    (10) To take or cause depositions to be taken whenever the ends of 
justice would be served thereby;
    (11) To make decisions or recommend decisions to resolve the 
disputed issues on the record of the hearing;
    (12) To issue, upon good cause shown, protective orders as described 
in paragraph (n) of this section.
    (k) Conferences. (1) At the discretion of the Presiding Officer, 
conferences may be held prior to or during any hearing. The Presiding 
Officer shall direct the Hearing Clerk to notify all parties of the time 
and location of such conference. At the discretion of the Presiding 
Officer, persons other than parties may attend. At a conference the 
Presiding Officer may:
    (i) Obtain stipulations and admissions, receive requests and order 
depositions to be taken, identify disputed issues of fact and law, and 
require or allow the submission of written testimony from any witness or 
party;
    (ii) Set a hearing schedule for as many of the following as are 
deemed necessary by the Presiding Officer:
    (A) Oral and written statements;
    (B) Submission of written direct testimony as required or authorized 
by the Presiding Officer;
    (C) Oral direct and cross-examination of a witness where necessary 
as prescribed in paragraph (p) of this section; and
    (D) Oral argument, if appropriate.
    (iii) Identify matters of which official notice may be taken;
    (iv) Consider limitation of the number of expert and other 
witnesses;
    (v) Consider the procedure to be followed at the hearing; and
    (vi) Consider any other matter that may expedite the hearing or aid 
in the disposition of the issue.
    (2) The results of any conference including all stipulations shall, 
if not transcribed, be summarized in writing by the Presiding Officer 
and made part of the record.
    (l) Primary discovery (exchange of witness lists and documents). (1) 
At a prehearing conference or within some reasonable time set by the 
Presiding Officer prior to the hearing, each party shall make available 
to the other parties the names of the expert and other witnesses the 
party expects to call, together with a brief summary of their expected 
testimony and list of all documents and exhibits which the party expects 
to introduce into evidence. Thereafter, witnesses, documents, or 
exhibits may be added and summaries of expected testimony amended upon 
motion by a party.
    (2) The Presiding Officer may upon motion by a party or other 
person, and for good cause shown, by order
    (i) Restrict or defer disclosure by a party of the name of a witness 
or a narrative summary of the expected testimony of a witness, and
    (ii) Prescribe other appropriate measures to protect a witness. Any 
party affected by any such action shall have an adequate opportunity, 
once he learns the name of a witness and obtains the narrative summary 
of this expected testimony, to prepare for the presentation of this 
case.
    (m) Other discovery. (1) Except as provided by paragraph (m)(1) of 
this section, further discovery under this paragraph shall be permitted 
only upon determination by the Presiding Officer:
    (i) That such discovery will not in any way unreasonably delay the 
proceeding;
    (ii) That the information to be obtained is not obtainable 
voluntarily; and
    (iii) That such information has significant probative value. The 
Presiding Officer shall be guided by the procedures set forth in the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, where practicable, and the precedents 
thereunder, except that no discovery shall be undertaken except upon 
order of the Presiding Officer or upon agreement of the parties.
    (2) The Presiding Officer shall order depositions upon oral 
questions only

[[Page 138]]

upon a showing of good cause and upon a finding that:
    (i) The information sought cannot be obtained by alternative 
methods; or
    (ii) There is a substantial reason to believe that relevant and 
probative evidence may otherwise not be preserved for presentation by a 
witness at the hearing.
    (3) Any party to the proceeding desiring an order of discovery shall 
make a motion or motions therefor. Such a motion shall set forth:
    (i) The circumstances warranting the taking of the discovery;
    (ii) The nature of the information expected to be discovered; and
    (iii) The proposed time and place where it will be taken. If the 
Presiding Officer determines the motion should be granted, he shall 
issue an order for the taking of such discovery together with the 
conditions and terms thereof.
    (4) Failure to comply with an order issued pursuant to this 
paragraph may lead to the inference that the information to be 
discovered would be adverse to the person or party from whom the 
information was sought.
    (n) Protective orders, in camera proceedings. (1) Upon motion by a 
party or by the person from whom discovery is sought, and upon a showing 
by the movant that the disclosure of the information to be discovered, 
or a particular part thereof (other than emission data), would result in 
methods or processes entitled to protection as trade secrets of the 
person being divulged, the Presiding Officer may enter a protective 
order with respect to such material. Any protective order shall contain 
such terms governing the treatment of the information as may be 
appropriate under the circumstances to prevent disclosure outside the 
hearing, provided that the order shall state that the material shall be 
filed separately from other evidence and exhibits in the hearing. 
Disclosure shall be limited to parties to the hearing, their counsel and 
relevant technical consultants, and authorized representatives of the 
United States concerned with carrying out the Act. Except in the case of 
the government, disclosure may be limited to counsel for parties who 
shall not disclose such information to the parties themselves. Except in 
the case of the government, disclosure to a party or his counsel shall 
be conditioned on execution of a sworn statement that no disclosure of 
the information will be made to persons not entitled to receive it under 
the terms of the protective order. (No such provision is necessary where 
government employees are concerned because disclosure by them is subject 
to the terms of 18 U.S.C. 1905.)
    (2)(i) A party or person seeking a protective order may be permitted 
to make all or part of the required showing in camera. A record shall be 
made of such in camera proceedings. If the Presiding Officer enters a 
protective order following a showing in camera, the record of such 
showing shall be sealed and preserved and made available to the Agency 
or court in the event of appeal.
    (ii) Attendance at any in camera proceeding may be limited to the 
Presiding Officer, representatives of the Agency, and the person or 
party seeking the protective order.
    (3) Any party, subject to the terms and conditions of any protective 
order issued pursuant to paragraph (n)(1) of this section, that desires 
to make use of any in camera documents or testimony in the presentation 
of his case shall apply to the Presiding Officer by motion for 
permission to do so, and shall state the justification for the motion. 
The Presiding Officer, in granting any such motion, shall enter an order 
protecting the rights of the affected persons and parties as far as is 
practicable, and preventing unnecessary disclosure of such information 
and testimony concerning such information.
    (4) In the submittal of proposed findings, briefs, or other papers, 
counsel for all parties shall make a good faith attempt to refrain from 
disclosing the specific details of in camera documents and testimony. 
This shall not preclude references in such proposed findings, briefs, or 
other papers to such documents or testimony. This shall not preclude 
references in such proposed findings, briefs, or other papers marked 
``confidential,'' which shall become part of the in camera record.
    (o) Motions. (1) All motions, except those made orally during the 
course of the hearing, shall be in writing and

[[Page 139]]

shall state with particularity the grounds therefore, shall set forth 
the relief or order sought, and shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk 
and served upon all parties.
    (2) Within such time as may be fixed by the Environmental Appeals 
Board or the Presiding Officer, as appropriate, any party may serve and 
file an answer to the motion. The movant shall, if requested by the 
Environmental Appeals Board or the Presiding Officer, as appropriate, 
serve and file reply papers, within the time set by the request.
    (3) The Presiding Officer shall rule upon all motions filed or made 
prior to the filing of his decision or accelerated decision, as 
appropriate. The Environmental Appeals Board shall rule upon all motions 
filed prior to the appointment of a Presiding Officer and all motions 
filed after the filing of the decision of the Presiding Officer or 
accelerated decision. Oral argument of motions will be permitted only if 
the Presiding Officer or the Environmental Appeals Board, as 
appropriate, deems it necessary.
    (p) Evidence. (1) The official transcripts and exhibits, together 
with all papers and requests filed in the proceeding, shall constitute 
the record. Immaterial or irrelevent parts of an admissible document 
shall be segregated and excluded so far as practicable. Documents or 
parts thereof subject to a protective order under paragraph (n) of this 
section shall be segregated. Evidence may be received at the hearing 
even though inadmissible under the rules of evidence applicable to 
judicial proceedings. The weight to be given evidence shall be 
determined by its reliability and probative value.
    (2) The Presiding Officer shall allow the parties to examine and 
cross-examine a witness to the extent that such examination and cross-
examination is necessary for a full and true disclosure of the facts.
    (3) Rulings of the Presiding Officer on the admissibility of 
evidence, the propriety of examination and cross-examination and other 
procedural matters shall appear in the record.
    (4) Parties shall automatically be presumed to have taken exception 
to an adverse ruling.
    (q) Record. (1) Hearings shall be stenographically reported and 
transcribed and the original transcripts shall be part of the record. 
Copies of the records shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk and made 
available during Agency business hours for public inspection. Any person 
who wants a copy of the record of the hearing or any part thereof, 
except as provided in paragraph (n) of this section, shall be entitled 
to the same upon payment of the cost thereof.
    (2) The official transcripts and exhibits, together with all papers 
and requests filed in the proceeding, shall constitute the record.
    (r) Proposed findings, conclusions. (1) Within 30 days of the close 
of the reception of evidence, or within such longer time as may be fixed 
by the Presiding Officer, any party may submit for the consideration of 
the Presiding Officer proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and 
a proposed order, together with reasons therefore and briefs in support 
thereof. Such proposals shall be in writing, shall be served upon all 
parties, and shall contain adequate references to the record and 
authorities relied upon.
    (2) The record shall show the Presiding Officer's ruling on the 
proposed findings and conclusions except when his order disposing of the 
proceeding otherwise informs the parties of the action taken by him.
    (s) Decision of the Presiding Officer. (1) Unless extended by the 
Environmental Appeals Board, the Presiding Officer shall issue and file 
with the Hearing Clerk his decision within 30 days after the period for 
filing proposed findings has expired, as provided for in paragraph (c) 
of this section.
    (2) The Presiding Officer's decision shall become the decision of 
the Environmental Appeals Board (i) 10 days after issuance thereof, if 
no notice of intention to appeal as described in paragraph (t) of this 
section is filed, unless in the interim the Environmental Appeals Board 
shall have taken action to review or stay the effective date of the 
decision; or (ii) 5 days after expiration of the period allowed by

[[Page 140]]

paragraph (t)(1) of this section for perfection of an appeal, if a 
notice of intention to appeal is filed but the appeal is not perfected, 
unless within that 5 day period the Environmental Appeals Board shall 
have taken action to review or stay the effective date of the decision;
    (3) The Presiding Officer's decision shall include a statement of 
findings and conclusions, as well as the reasons or basis therefore, 
upon all the material issues of fact or law presented on the record and 
an appropriate rule or order. Such decision shall be supported by 
substantial evidence and based upon a consideration of the whole record.
    (4) At any time prior to the issuance of his decision, the Presiding 
Officer may reopen the proceeding for the reception of further evidence. 
Except for the correction of clerical errors, the jurisdiction of the 
Presiding Officer is terminated upon the issuance of his decision.
    (t) Appeal from the decision of the Presiding Officer. (1) Any party 
to a proceeding may appeal the Presiding Officer's decision to the 
Environmental Appeals Board, Provided, That within 10 days after 
issuance of the Presiding Officer's decision such party files a notice 
of intention to appeal and an appeal brief within 20 days of such 
decision.
    (2) When an appeal is taken from the decision of the Presiding 
Officer, any party may file a brief with respect to such appeal. The 
brief shall be filed within the same time limits as the appellant's 
brief.
    (3) Any brief filed pursuant to this paragraph shall contain in the 
order indicated, the following:
    (i) A subject index of the matter in the brief, with page 
references, and a table of cases (alphabetically arranged), textbooks, 
statutes, and other material cited, with page references thereto;
    (ii) A specification of the issues intended to be appealed;
    (iii) The argument, presenting clearly the points of fact and law 
relied upon in support of the position taken on each issue, with 
specific page references to the record and legal or other material 
relied upon; and
    (iv) A proposed order for the Environmental Appeals Board's 
consideration if different from the order contained in the Presiding 
Officer's decision.
    (4) No brief in excess of 15 pages shall be filed without leave of 
the Environmental Appeals Board.
    (5) Oral argument will be allowed only in the discretion of the 
Environmental Appeals Board.
    (u) Review of the Presiding Officer's decision in absence of appeal. 
(1) If, after the expiration of the period for taking an appeal as 
provided for by paragraph (t) of this section, no notice of intention to 
appeal the decision of the Presiding Officer has been filed, or if 
filed, not perfected, the Hearing Clerk shall so notify the 
Environmental Appeals Board.
    (2) The Environmental Appeals Board, upon receipt of notice from the 
Hearing Clerk that no notice of intention to appeal has been filed, or 
if filed, not perfected pursuant to paragraph (t)(1) of this section, 
may, on its own motion, within 14 days after notice from the Hearing 
Clerk, review the decision of the Presiding Officer. Notice of the 
intention of the Environmental Appeals Board to review the decision of 
the Presiding Officer shall be given to all parties and shall set forth 
the scope of such review and the issues which shall be considered and 
shall make provisions for filing of briefs.
    (v) Decision of appeal or review. (1) Upon appeal from or review of 
the Presiding Officer's the Environmental Appeals Board shall consider 
such parts of the record as are cited or as may be necessary to resolve 
the issues presented and in addition shall, to the extent necessary or 
desirable, exercise all the powers which it could have exercised if it 
had presided at the hearing.
    (2) In rendering its decision, the Environmental Appeals Board shall 
adopt, modify, or set aside the findings, conclusions, and order 
contained in the decision of the Presiding Officer and shall set forth 
in its decision a statement of the reasons or bases for this action.
    (3) In those cases where the Environmental Appeals Board determines 
that it should have further information or additional views of the 
parties as to the form and content of the rule or order to be issued, 
the Environmental

[[Page 141]]

Appeals Board, in its discretion, may without final action pending the 
receipt of such additional information or views, or may remand the case 
to the Presiding Officer.
    (4) Any decision rendered under this paragraph which completed 
disposition of a case shall be a final decision of the Environmental 
Appeals Board.
    (w) Reconsideration. Any party may file with the Environmental 
Appeals Board a petition for reconsideration of such decision setting 
forth the relief desired and the grounds in support thereof. This 
petition must be filed within 20 days of the issuance of the 
Environmental Appeals Board's decision, and must be confined to new 
questions raised by the decision or final order and which the petitioner 
had no opportunity to argue before the Presiding Officer or the 
Environmental Appeals Board, unless otherwise specified by the 
Environmental Appeals Board. Subsequent to the expiration of the period 
for petitioning for reconsideration, the Environmental Appeals Board 
may, in its discretion and for good cause shown, grant the manufacturer 
a hearing to contest the compliance level or the penalty calculation 
even though such issues may have been raised in the previous proceeding. 
Any party desiring to oppose such a petition, shall file an answer 
thereto within 10 days after the filing of the petition. The filing of a 
petition for reconsideration shall not operate to stay the effective 
date of the decision or order or to toll the running of any statutory 
time period affecting such decision or order unless specifically so 
ordered by the Environmental Appeals Board.
    (x) Accelerated decision, dismissal. (1) The Presiding Officer, upon 
motion of any party or sua sponte, may at any time render an accelerated 
decision in favor of the Agency or the manufacturer as to all or any 
part of the proceeding, without further hearing or upon such limited 
additional evidence such as affidavits as he may require, or dismiss any 
party with prejudice, for any of the following reasons:
    (i) Failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, or 
direct or collateral estoppel;
    (ii) The lack of any genuine issue of material fact, causing a party 
to be entitled to judgment as a matter of law; or
    (iii) Such other and further reasons as are just, including 
specifically, failure to obey a procedural order of the Presiding 
Officer.
    (2) If under this paragraph an accelerated decision is issued as to 
all the issues and claims joined in the proceeding, the decision shall 
be treated for the purposes of these procedures as the decision of the 
Presiding Officer, as provided in paragraph (s) of this section.
    (3) If under this paragraph, judgment is rendered on less than all 
issues or claims in the proceeding, the Presiding Officer shall 
determine what material facts exist without substantial controversy and 
what material facts are actually and in good faith controverted. He 
shall thereupon issue an order specifying the facts which appear without 
substantial controversy, and the issues and claims upon which the 
hearing will proceed.
    (y) Conclusion of hearing. (1) If, after the expiration of the 
period for taking an appeal as provided by paragraph (t) of this 
section, no appeal has been taken from the Presiding Officer's decision, 
and after the expiration of the period for review by the Environmental 
Appeals Board on its own motion as provided for by paragraph (u) of this 
section, the Environmental Appeals Board does not move to review such 
decision, the hearing will be deemed to have ended at the expiration of 
all periods allowed for such appeal and review.
    (2) If an appeal of the Presiding Officer's decision is taken 
pursuant to paragraph (t) of this section, or if, in the absence of such 
appeal the Environmental Appeals Board moves to review the decision of 
the Presiding Officer pursuant to paragraph (u) of this section, the 
hearing will be deemed to have ended upon issuance of a final decision 
by the Environmental Appeals Board.
    (z) Judicial review. (1) The Administrator hereby designates the 
General Counsel of the Environmental Protection Agency as the officer 
upon whom any copies for judicial review shall be served. Such officer 
shall be responsible for filing in the court the record

[[Page 142]]

on which the order of the Environmental Appeals Board is based.

<R05>
Sec. 86.1206-90  Equipment required; overview.

    This subpart specifies procedures for testing of gasoline-fueled and 
methanol-fueled heavy-duty vehicles. Equipment required and 
specifications are as follows:
    (a) Evaporative emissions tests. Sec. 86.1207 specifies the 
necessary equipment.
    (b) Fuel, analytical gas, and driving schedule specifications. Fuel 
specifications for emission testing and for service accumulation are 
specified in Sec. 86.1213. Analytical gases are specified in

<R05>
Sec. 86.1207-90  Sampling and analytical system; evaporative emissions.

    The following is a description of the components which will be used 
in evaporative emissions sampling systems for testing under this 
subpart.
    (a) Evaporative emission measurement enclosure. The enclosure shall 
be readily sealable, rectangular in shape, with space for personnel 
access to all sides of the vehicle. When sealed, the enclosure shall be 
gas tight in accordance with Sec. 86.1217. Interior surfaces must be 
impermeable and non-reactive to hydrocarbons and to methanol (if used 
for methanol-fueled vehicles). One surface should be of flexible, 
impermeable and non-reactive material to allow for minor volume changes, 
resulting from temperature changes. Wall design should promote maximum 
dissipation of heat, and if artificial cooling is used, interior surface 
temperatures shall not be less than 68  deg.F (20  deg.C).
    (b) Evaporative emission hydrocarbon and methanol analyzers. (1) For 
gasoline and methanol-fueled vehicles a hydrocarbon analyzer utilizing 
the hydrogen flame ionization principle (FID) shall be used to monitor 
the atmosphere within the enclosure (a heated FID 
(HFID)(235 deg.<plus-minus>15  deg.F (113<plus-minus>8  deg.C)) is 
recommended for methanol-fueled vehicles). Instrument bypass flow may be 
returned to the enclosure. The FID shall have a response time to 90 
percent of final reading of less than 1.5 seconds, and be capable of 
meeting performance requirements expressed as a function of Cstd: where 
Cstd is the specific enclosure hydrocarbon level, in ppm, corresponding 
to the evaporative emission standard:
    (i) Stability of the analyzer shall be better than 0.01 Cstd ppm at 
zero and span over a 15-minute period on all ranges used.
    (ii) Repeatability of the analyzer, expressed as one standard 
deviation, shall be better than 0.005 Cstd ppm on all ranges used.

[[Page 144]]

    (2) For methanol-fueled vehicles, a methanol sampling and analyzing 
system is required in addition to the FID analyzer. The methanol 
sampling equipment shall consist of impingers for collecting the 
methanol sample and appropriate equipment for drawing the sample through 
the impingers. The analytical equipment shall consist of a gas 
chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector. (Note: For 1990 
through 1994 model year methanol-fueled vehicles, a HFID, calibrated on 
methanol may be used in place of the HFID calibrated on propane plus the 
methanol impingers and associated analytical equipment.)
    (3) The methanol sampling system described in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section shall be designed such that, if a test vehicle emitted the 
maximum allowable level of methanol (based on all applicable standards) 
during any phase of the test, the measured concentration in the primary 
impinger would exceed either 25 mg/l or a concentration equal to 25 
times the limit of detection for the GC analyzer, and such that the 
primary impinger collects at least 90 percent of the analyte in the 
samples. The remaining analyte shall be collected by the secondary 
impinger. The provisions of this paragraph apply to the design of 
sampling systems, not to individual tests.
    (c) Evaporative emission hydrocarbon and methanol data recording 
system. (1) The electrical output of the FID used for measuring 
hydrocarbons (or hydrocarbons plus methanol as appropriate) shall be 
recorded at least at the initiation and termination of each diurnal or 
hot soak. The recording may be by means of a strip chart potentiometric 
recorder, by use of an on-line computer system or other suitable means. 
In any case, the recording system must have operational characteristics 
(signal to noise ratio, speed of response, etc.) equivalent to or better 
than those of the signal source being recorded, and must provide a 
permanent record of results. The record shall show a positive indication 
of the initiation and completion of each diurnal or hot soak along with 
the time elapsed between initiation and completion of each soak.
    (2) For the methanol sample, permanent records shall be made of the 
following: the volumes of deionized water introduced into each impinger, 
the rate and time of sample collection and the chromatogram of the 
analyzed sample.
    (d) Tank fuel heating system. The tank fuel heating system shall 
consist of a heat source and a temperature controller. A typical heat 
source is a 2,000 W heating pad. Other sources may be used as required 
by circumstances. The temperature controller may be manual, such as a 
variable voltage transformer, or may be automated. The heating system 
must not cause hot spots on the tank wetted surface which could cause 
local overheating of the fuel. Heat must not be applied to the vapor in 
the tank above the liquid fuel. The temperature controller must be 
capable of controlling the fuel tank temperature during the diurnal soak 
to within <plus-minus>3  deg.F (<plus-minus>1.7  deg.C) of the following 
equation:
    (1) F = T<INF>o</INF> + (0.4)t
    (2) For SI units, C = T<INF>o</INF> - (2/9)t

Where:

F = Temperature in  deg.F.
C = Temperature in  deg.C.
t = Time since start of test in minutes.
T<INF>o</INF> = Initial temperature in  deg.F (or in  deg.C for SI 
          units).

    (e) Temperature recording system. Strip chart recorder(s) or an 
automatic data processor shall be used to record enclosure ambient and 
vehicle fuel tank temperature at least once every minute. The 
temperature recorder or data processor shall have a time accuracy of 
<plus-minus>15s, a time precision of <plus-minus>15s and be capable of 
resolving temperature to <plus-minus>0.75  deg.F (<plus-minus>0.42 
deg.C). The temperature recording system (recorder and sensor) shall 
have an accuracy of <plus-minus>3  deg.F (<plus-minus>1.7  deg.C). Two 
ambient temperature sensors, connected to provide one average output, 
shall be located in the enclosure. These sensors shall be located at the 
approximate vertical centerline of each side wall extending 4 inches 
(nominally) into the enclosure at a height of 3<plus-minus>0.5 ft 
(0.9<plus-minus>0.2 m). The vehicle fuel tank temperature sensor shall 
be located in the fuel tank so as to measure the temperature of the 
prescribed test fuel at the approximate mid-volume of the fuel. 
Manufacturers shall arrange that vehicles furnished

[[Page 145]]

for testing at Federal certification facilities be equipped with iron-
constantan Type J thermocouples for measurement of fuel tank 
temperature.
    (f) Purge blower. One or more portable or fixed blowers shall be 
used to purge the enclosure. The blowers shall have sufficient flow 
capacity to reduce the enclosure hydrocarbon and/or methanol 
concentration from the test level to the ambient level between tests. 
Actual flow capacity will depend upon the time available between tests.
    (g) Mixing blower. One or more blowers or fans with a total capacity 
of 250 to 750 cfm per 1,000 ft\3\ of enclosure volume shall be used to 
mix the contents of the enclosure during evaporative emission testing. 
The mixing blower(s) shall be arranged such that a uniform concentration 
is maintained. No portion of the air stream shall be directed towards 
the vehicle.

<R05>
Sec. 86.1207-96  Sampling and analytical systems; evaporative emissions.

    (a) Testing enclosures--(1) Diurnal emission test. The enclosure 
shall be readily sealable, rectangular in shape, with space for 
personnel access to all sides of the vehicle. When sealed, the enclosure 
shall be gas tight in accordance with Sec. 86.1217-96. Interior surfaces 
must be impermeable and nonreactive to hydrocarbons (and to methanol, if 
the enclosure is used for methanol-fueled vehicles). The temperature 
conditioning system shall be capable of controlling the internal 
enclosure air temperature to follow the prescribed temperature versus 
time cycle as specified in Sec. 86.1233-96 and appendix II of this part, 
within an instantaneous tolerance of <plus-minus>3.0  deg.F of the 
nominal temperature versus time profile throughout the test, and an 
average tolerance of 2.0  deg.F over the duration of the test (where the 
average is calculated using the absolute value of each measured 
deviation). The control system shall be tuned to provide a smooth 
temperature pattern that has a minimum of overshoot, hunting, and 
instability about the desired long-term ambient temperature profile. 
Interior surface temperatures shall not be less than 40  deg.F at any 
time during the diurnal emission test. To accommodate the volume changes 
due to enclosure temperature changes, either a variable-volume or fixed-
volume enclosure may be used for diurnal emission testing:
    (i) Variable-volume enclosure. The variable-volume enclosure expands 
and contracts in response to the temperature change of the air mass in 
the enclosure. Two potential means of accommodating the internal volume 
changes are moveable panel(s), or a bellows design, in which impermeable 
bag(s) inside the enclosure expand and contract in response to internal 
pressure changes by exchanging air from outside the enclosure. Any 
design for volume accommodation must maintain the integrity of the 
enclosure as specified in Sec. 86.1217-96 over the specified temperature 
range. Any method of volume accommodation shall limit the differential 
between the enclosure internal pressure and the barometric pressure to a 
maximum value of <plus-minus>2.0 inches of water. The enclosure shall be 
capable of latching to a fixed volume. A variable-volume enclosure must 
be capable of accommodating a <plus-minus>7 percent change from its 
``nominal volume'' (see Sec. 86.1217-96(b)), accounting for temperature 
and barometric pressure variation during testing.
    (ii) Fixed-volume enclosure. The fixed-volume enclosure shall be 
constructed with rigid panels that maintain a fixed enclosure volume, 
and meet the following requirements.
    (A) The enclosure shall be equipped with a mechanism to maintain a 
fixed internal air volume. This may be accomplished either by 
withdrawing air at a constant rate and providing makeup air as needed, 
or by reversing the flow of air into and out of the enclosure in 
response to rising or falling temperatures. If inlet air is added 
continuously throughout the test, it should be filtered with activated 
carbon to provide a relatively low and constant hydrocarbon level. Any 
method of volume accommodation shall maintain the differential between 
the enclosure internal pressure and the barometric pressure to a maximum 
value of <plus-minus>2.0 inches of water.
    (B) The equipment shall be capable of measuring the mass of 
hydrocarbon and methanol (if the enclosure is used

[[Page 146]]

for methanol-fueled vehicles) in the inlet and outlet flow streams with 
a resolution of 0.01 gram per hour. A bag sampling system may be used to 
collect a proportional sample of the air withdrawn from and admitted to 
the enclosure. Alternatively, the inlet and outlet flow streams may be 
continuously analyzed using an on-line FID analyzer and integrated with 
the flow measurements to provide a continuous record of the mass 
hydrocarbon and methanol removal.
    (2) Running loss test. The enclosure shall be readily sealable, 
rectangular in shape, with space for personnel access to all sides of 
the vehicle. When sealed, the enclosure shall be gas tight in accordance 
with Sec. 86.1217-96. The enclosure may be equipped with a personnel 
door, provided that the enclosure can still meet the requirements of 
Sec. 86.1217-96 with the door installed. Interior surfaces must be 
impermeable and nonreactive to hydrocarbons and to methanol (if the 
enclosure is used for methanol-fueled vehicles). Interior surface 
temperatures shall not be less than 40  deg.F. If a running loss 
enclosure meets all the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, it may be used as a diurnal evaporative emission enclosure. The 
enclosure must contain a dynamometer that meets the requirements of 
Sec. 86.1208. Provisions shall be made to remove exhaust gases from the 
enclosure. During the running loss test, ambient temperatures must be 
maintained at 95<plus-minus>5  deg.F (95<plus-minus>2  deg.F on 
average). An air or oxygen cylinder with an attached self-contained 
breathing apparatus may be provided for the vehicle operator. The air 
required for vehicle operation shall be provided by one of the following 
methods:
    (i) The running loss enclosure may be equipped to supply air to the 
vehicle, at a temperature of 95<plus-minus>5  deg.F, from sources 
outside of the running loss enclosure directly into the operating 
engine's air intake system. Supplemental air requirements (e.g., for an 
air pump) shall be supplied by drawing air from the engine intake 
source.
    (ii) If it is shown to yield equivalent or superior results, the 
running loss enclosure may be designed with an air makeup system that 
brings outside air into the enclosure to accommodate the aspiration 
needs of the engine and any auxiliary devices. The makeup air shall be 
monitored to establish the background hydrocarbon levels (or hydrocarbon 
and methanol, levels, if applicable) of the makeup air. A filter may be 
used to provide dry air with a stable concentration of background 
hydrocarbon. The makeup-air vent shall be readily sealable for 
calibration of the enclosure and other purposes. For calculation of 
running loss emissions, it may be assumed that the hydrocarbon and 
methanol concentration in the air consumed by the vehicle is the same as 
that of the rest of the air in the enclosure.
    (3) Hot soak test. The hot soak test may be conducted by holding the 
vehicle in an enclosure that meets the requirements for either diurnal 
emission or running loss tests. The enclosure shall be configured to 
provide an internal enclosure ambient temperature of 95<plus-minus>10 
deg.F for the first 5 minutes, and 95<plus-minus>5  deg.F 
(95<plus-minus>2  deg.F on average) for the remainder of the hot soak 
test.
    (i) If the hot soak test is conducted in the same enclosure as the 
immediately preceding running loss test, interior surface temperatures 
shall not be below 70  deg.F for the last 55 minutes of the hot soak 
test.
    (ii) If the hot soak test is not conducted in the same enclosure as 
the immediately preceding running loss test, interior surface 
temperatures shall not be below 70  deg.F for the duration of the hot 
soak test.
    (b) Evaporative emission hydrocarbon and methanol analyzers. (1) For 
gasoline-, liquefied petroleum gas-, natural gas- and methanol-fueled 
vehicles a hydrocarbon analyzer utilizing the hydrogen flame ionization 
principle (FID) shall be used to monitor the atmosphere within the 
enclosure (a heated FID (HFID)(235 deg.<plus-minus>15  deg.F 
(113<plus-minus>8  deg.C)) is recommended for methanol-fueled vehicles). 
Provided evaporative emission results are not affected, a probe may be 
used to detect or verify hydrocarbon sources during a running loss test. 
Instrument bypass flow may be returned to the enclosure. The FID shall 
have a response time to 90 percent of final reading of less than 1.5 
seconds.

[[Page 147]]

    (2) For methanol-fueled vehicles, a methanol sampling and analyzing 
system is required in addition to the FID analyzer. The methanol 
sampling equipment shall consist of impingers for collecting the 
methanol sample and appropriate equipment for drawing the sample through 
the impingers. The analytical equipment shall consist of a gas 
chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector.
    (3) The methanol sampling system described in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section shall be designed such that, if a test vehicle emitted the 
maximum allowable level of methanol (based on all applicable standards) 
during any phase of the test, the measured concentration in the primary 
impinger would exceed either 25 mg/l or a concentration equal to 25 
times the limit of detection for the GC analyzer, and such that the 
primary impinger collects at least 90 percent of the analyte in the 
samples. The remaining analyte shall be collected by the secondary 
impinger. The provisions of this paragraph apply to the design of 
sampling systems, not to individual tests.
    (c) Evaporative emission hydrocarbon and methanol data recording 
system. (1) The electrical output of the FID used for measuring 
hydrocarbons (or hydrocarbons plus methanol, as appropriate) shall be 
recorded at least at the initiation and termination of each running loss 
and hot soak test, and at least at the initiation and termination of the 
enclosure sampling period(s) for the diurnal emission test, as described 
in Sec. 86.1233. The recording may be taken by means of a strip chart 
potentiometric recorder, by use of an on-line computer system or other 
suitable means. In any case, the recording system must have operational 
characteristics (signal-to-noise ratio, speed of response, etc.) 
equivalent to or better than those of the signal source being recorded, 
and must provide a permanent record of results. The record shall show a 
positive indication of the initiation and completion of each hot soak, 
running loss, or diurnal emission test (including initiation and 
completion of sampling period(s)), along with the time elapsed during 
each soak.
    (2) For the methanol sample, permanent records shall be made of the 
following: the volumes of deionized water introduced into each impinger, 
the rate and time of sample collection and the chromatogram of the 
analyzed sample.
    (d) Fuel temperature control system. Fuel temperatures of the test 
vehicle shall be controlled, as specified in Sec. 86.1234(g)(1)(xv), 
with the following combination of fans. The control system shall be 
tuned and operated to provide a smooth and continuous fuel temperature 
profile that is representative of the on-road temperature profile. The 
running loss test configuration should be designed to avoid heating or 
cooling the fuel tank's vapor space in a way that would cause vapor 
temperature behavior to be unrepresentative of the vehicle's on-road 
profile.
    (1) A vehicle cooling fan shall discharge air to the front of the 
vehicle. The fan shall be a road-speed modulated fan that is controlled 
to a discharge velocity that follows the dynamometer roll speed, at 
least up to speeds of 30 mph, throughout the driving cycle. If a warning 
light or gauge indicates that the vehicle's engine coolant has 
overheated, subsequent test runs on the that vehicle must include a 
vehicle cooling fan that follows the dynamometer roll speed at all 
speeds throughout the test cycle. The fan may direct airflow to both the 
vehicle radiator air inlet(s) and the vehicle underbody.
    (2) An additional fan may be used to discharge airflow from the 
front of the vehicle directly to the vehicle underbody to control fuel 
temperatures. Such a fan shall provide a total discharge airflow not to 
exceed 8,000 cfm.
    (3) Additional fans may be used to route heating or cooling air 
directly at the bottom of the vehicle's fuel tank. The air supplied to 
the tank shall be between 85 deg. and 160  deg.F, with a total discharge 
airflow not to exceed 4,000 cfm. For exceptional circumstances, 
manufacturers may direct up to 6,000 cfm at the bottom of the fuel tank 
with the advance approval of the Administrator.
    (4) Direct fuel heating may be needed for canister preconditioning, 
as specified in Sec. 86.1232(j)(2). Also, under exceptional 
circumstances in which airflow alone is insufficient to control fuel 
temperatures during the running loss

[[Page 148]]

test, direct fuel tank heating may be used (see Sec. 86.1234-
96(g)(1)(xv)). The heating system must not cause hot spots on the tank 
wetted surface that could cause local overheating of the fuel. Heat must 
not be applied directly to the tank's vapor space, nor to the liquid-
vapor interface.
    (e) Temperature recording system. A strip chart potentiometric 
recorder, an on-line computer system, or other suitable means shall be 
used to record enclosure ambient temperature during all evaporative 
emission test segments, as well as vehicle fuel tank temperature during 
the running loss test. The recording system shall record each 
temperature at least once every minute. The recording system shall be 
capable of resolving time to <plus-minus>15 s and capable of resolving 
temperature to <plus-minus>0.75  deg.F (<plus-minus>0.42  deg.C). The 
temperature recording system (recorder and sensor) shall have an 
accuracy of <plus-minus>3  deg.F (<plus-minus>1.7  deg.C). The recorder 
(data processor) shall have a time accuracy of <plus-minus>15 s and a 
precision of <plus-minus>15 s. Enclosures shall be equipped with two 
ambient temperature sensors, connected to provide one average output, 
located 3 feet above the floor at the approximate mid-length of each 
side wall of the enclosure and within 3 to 12 inches of each side wall. 
For diurnal emission testing, an additional temperature sensor shall be 
located underneath the vehicle to provide a temperature measurement 
representative of the air temperature under the fuel tank. For running 
loss testing, an ambient temperature sensor shall be located at the 
inlet to the fan that provides engine cooling. Manufacturers shall 
arrange that vehicles furnished for testing at federal certification 
facilities be equipped with temperature sensors for measurement of fuel 
tank temperatures. Vehicles shall be equipped with two temperature 
sensors installed to provide an average liquid fuel temperature. The 
temperature sensors shall be placed to measure the temperature at the 
mid-volume of the liquid fuel at a fill level of 40 percent of nominal 
tank capacity. An additional temperature sensor may be placed to measure 
vapor temperatures approximately at the mid-volume of the vapor space, 
though measurement of vapor temperatures is optional during the running 
loss test. In-tank temperature sensors are not required for the 
supplemental two-diurnal test sequence specified in Sec. 86.1230-96.
    (f) Pressure recording system. A strip chart potentiometric 
recorder, an on-line computer system, or other suitable means, shall be 
used to record the enclosure gage pressure for any testing in an 
enclosure, as well as the vehicle's fuel tank pressure during the 
running loss test and the outdoor driving procedure specified in 
Sec. 86.1229-85(d). Fuel tank pressure measurement and recording 
equipment are optional during the running loss test. The recording 
system shall record each pressure at least once every minute. The 
recording system shall be capable of resolving time to <plus-minus>15 s 
and capable of resolving pressure to <plus-minus>0.1 inches of water. 
The pressure recording system (recorder and sensor) shall have an 
accuracy of <plus-minus>1.0 inch of water. The recorder (data processor) 
shall have a time accuracy of <plus-minus>15 s and a precision of 
<plus-minus>15 s. The pressure transducer shall be installed to measure 
the pressure in the vapor space of the fuel tank.
    (g) Purge blower. One or more portable or fixed blowers shall be 
used to purge the enclosure. The blowers shall have sufficient flow 
capacity to reduce the enclosure hydrocarbon and/or methanol 
concentration from the test level to the ambient level between tests. 
Actual flow capacity will depend upon the time available between tests.
    (h) Mixing blower. Blowers or fans shall be used to mix the 
enclosure contents during evaporative emission testing. The inlets and 
outlets of the air circulation blower(s) shall be configured to provide 
a well dispersed air circulation pattern that produces effective 
internal mixing and avoids significant temperature or hydrocarbon 
stratification. Maintenance of uniform concentrations throughout the 
enclosure is important to the accuracy of testing.
    (1) Diurnal emission test. Blowers or fans shall have a capacity of 
0.8<plus-minus>0.2 cfm per cubic foot of the nominal enclosure volume 
for mixing in the enclosure. Additional fans may be used to maintain a 
minimum wind speed of 5 mph (8 km/h) under the fuel tank of the test 
vehicle.

[[Page 149]]

    (2) Running loss test. Blowers or fans shall have a total capacity 
of at least 1.0 cfm per cubic foot of the nominal enclosure volume.
    (3) Hot soak test. Blowers or fans must have a capacity of 
0.8<plus-minus>0.2 cfm per cubic foot of the nominal enclosure volume. 
Circulated air shall not be aimed directly at the vehicle.
    (i) Point-source running loss measurement facility. Some system 
requirements pertain specifically to running loss testing by the point-
source method, in which emissions from potential sources are collected 
and routed to a sampling system. Emissions are sampled with the same 
equipment and techniques as for exhaust emission measurement. The test 
environment must contain a dynamometer that meets the requirements of 
Sec. 86.108. During the running loss test, ambient temperatures must be 
maintained at 95<plus-minus>5  deg.F (95<plus-minus>2  deg.F on 
average). An air or oxygen cylinder with an attached self-contained 
breathing apparatus may be provided for the vehicle operator.
    (1) The running loss vapor vent collection system shall be 
configured to collect all running loss emissions from each of the 
discrete point sources that function as vehicle fuel system vapor vents, 
and transport the collected vapor emissions to a CFV- or PDP-based 
dilution and measurement system. The collection system shall consist of 
a collector at each vehicle vapor vent, lengths of heated sample line 
connecting each collector to the inlet of the heated sample pump, and 
lengths of heated sample line connecting the outlet of the heated sample 
pump to the inlet of the running loss fuel vapor sampling system. Up to 
3 feet of unheated line connecting each of the vapor collectors to the 
heated sample lines shall be allowed. Each heated sample pump and its 
associated sample lines shall be maintained at a temperature between 175 
 deg.F and 200  deg.F to prevent condensation of fuel vapor in the 
sample lines. The heated sample pump(s) and its associated flow controls 
shall be configured and operated to draw a flow of ambient air into each 
collector at a flow rate of at least 0.67 cfm. The flow controls on each 
heated sampling system shall include an indicating flow meter that 
provides an alarm output to the data recording system if the flow rate 
drops below 0.67 cfm by more than 5 percent. The collector inlet for 
each discrete vapor vent shall be placed in proximity to the vent as 
necessary to capture any fuel vapor emissions without significantly 
affecting flow or pressure of the normal action of the vent. The 
collector inlets shall be designed to interface with the configuration 
and orientation of each specific vapor vent. For vapor vents that 
terminate in a tube or hose barb, a short length of tubing of an inside 
diameter larger throughout its length than the inside diameter of the 
vent outlet may be used to extend the vent into the mouth of the 
collector. For those vapor vent designs that are not compatible with 
such collector configurations, the vehicle manufacturer shall supply a 
collector that is configured to interface with the vapor vent design and 
that terminates in a fitting that is capable of capturing all vapor 
emitted from the vent. The Administrator may test for running losses by 
the point-source method without heating sample lines or pumps.
    (2) The running loss fuel vapor sampling system shall be a CFV- or 
PDP-based dilution and measurement system that further dilutes the 
running loss fuel vapors collected by the vapor vent collection 
system(s) with ambient air, collects continuously proportional samples 
of the diluted running loss vapors and dilution air in sample bags, and 
measures the total dilute flow through the sampling system over each 
test interval. In practice, the system shall be configured and operated 
in a manner that is directly analogous to an exhaust emissions constant 
volume sampling system, except that the input flow to the system is the 
flow from the running loss vapor vent collection system(s) instead of 
vehicle exhaust flow. The system shall be configured and operated to 
meet the following requirements:
    (i) The running loss fuel vapor sampling system shall be designed to 
measure the true mass of fuel vapor emissions collected by the running 
loss vapor vent collection system from the specified fuel vapor vents. 
The total volume of the mixture of running loss emissions and dilution 
air shall be

[[Page 150]]

measured and a continuously proportioned sample of volume shall be 
collected for analysis. Mass emissions shall be determined from the 
sample concentration and total flow over the test period.
    (ii) The PDP-CVS shall consist of a dilution air filter and mixing 
assembly, heat exchanger, positive-displacement pump, sampling system, 
and associated valves, pressure and temperature sensors. The PDP-CVS 
shall conform to the following requirements:
    (A) The gas mixture temperature, measured at a point immediately 
ahead of the positive-displacement pump, shall be within <plus-minus>10 
deg.F of the designed operating temperature at the start of the test. 
The gas mixture temperature variation from its value at the start of the 
test shall be limited to <plus-minus>10  deg.F during the entire test. 
The temperature measuring system shall have an accuracy and precision of 
<plus-minus>2  deg.F.
    (B) The pressure gauges shall have an accuracy and precision of 
<plus-minus>1.6 inches of water (<plus-minus>0.4 kPa).
    (C) The flow capacity of the CVS shall not exceed 350 cfm.
    (D) Sample collection bags for dilution air and running loss fuel

Sec. 86.1215-85  EPA heavy-duty vehicle (HDV) urban dynamometer driving schedule.

    (a)(1) The EPA dynamometer driving schedule for heavy-duty vehicles 
is a 1060 second transient speed versus time cycle which is designed to 
simulate gasoline-fueled HDV operation in urban areas. A second by 
second listing of this schedule is given in appendix I(d) of this part. 
Thirty-three percent of the cycle is idle operation, and the average 
vehicle speed is 18.9 mph (30.4 km/hr). The Administrator will use this 
driving schedule when conducting evaporative emission tests, as 
described in Sec. 86.1230-96.
    (2) For evaporative emission testing of heavy-duty vehicles a 
manufacturer may optionally use the dynamometer driving schedule for 
light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks specified in appendix I(a) of 
this part. This driving schedule may not be used for exhaust emissions 
testing of heavy-duty vehicles. If the manufacturer chooses to use this 
option, the Administrator will use this driving schedule when conducting 
evaporative emission tests, as described in Sec. 86.1230-96.
    (b) The driver should attempt to follow the target schedule as 
closely as possible. The speed tolerance at any given time for these 
schedules, or for a driver's aid chart approved by the Administrator, 
are as follows:
    (1) The upper limit is 4 mph (6.4 km/h) higher than the highest 
point on the trace within 1 second of the given time.
    (2) The lower limit is 4 mph (6.4 km/h) lower than the lowest point 
on the trace within 1 second of the given time.
    (3)(i) Speed variations greater than the tolerances (such as may 
occur during gear changes or braking spikes) are acceptable, provided 
they occur for less than 2 seconds on any occasion and are clearly 
documented as to the time and speed at that point of the driving 
schedule.
    (ii) When conducted to meet the requirements of Sec. 86.1229, up to 
three additional occurrences of speed variations greater than the 
tolerance are acceptable, provided they occur for less than 15 seconds 
on any occasion, and are clearly documented as to the time and speed at 
that point of the driving schedule.
    (4) Speeds lower than those prescribed are acceptable, provided the 
vehicle is operated at maximum available power during such occurrences.

    (b) At least yearly or after any maintenance which could alter 
background emission levels, enclosure background emission measurements 
shall be performed.
    (c) At least monthly or after any maintenance which could alter 
calibration, the following calibrations and checks shall be performed:
    (1) Calibrate the hydrocarbon analyzer (see Sec. 86.1221). Certain 
analyzers may require more frequent calibration depending on particular 
equipment and uses.
    (2) Calibrate the dynamometer. If the dynamometer receives a weekly 
performance check (and remains within calibration) the monthly 
calibration need not be performed (see Sec. 86.1218).
    (3) Perform a hydrocarbon retention check and calibration on the 
evaporative emission enclosure (see Sec. 86.1217).
    (d) At least twice annually or after any maintenance perform a 
methanol retention check and calibration on the evaporative emission 
enclosure (see Sec. 86.1217).
    (e) Calibrate the methanol analyzer as often as required by the 
manufacturer or as necessary according to good practice.

[[Page 155]]


<R05>
Sec. 86.1217-90  Evaporative emission enclosure calibrations.

    The calibration of the evaporative emission enclosure consists of 
three parts: Initial and periodic determination of enclosure background 
emissions (hydrocarbons and methanol); initial determination of 
enclosure internal volume; and periodic hydrocarbon and methanol 
retention check and calibration. Methanol measurements may be omitted 
when methanol-fueled vehicles will not be tested in the evaporative 
enclosure.
    (a) Initial and periodic determination of enclosure background 
emissions. Prior to its introduction into service, annually thereafter, 
and after any repair which can affect the enclosure background 
emissions, the enclosure shall be checked to determine that it does not 
contain materials which will themselves emit hydrocarbons or 
methanol.\1\ Proceed as follows:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Note: When methanol as well as hydrocarbons are present in the 
evaporative enclosure, the HFID hydrocarbon concentration measurement 
includes the partial response of the HFID to methanol plus the 
hydrocarbons. Determination of the HFID response to methanol, 
Sec. 86.1221, prior to its being placed in service is required for the 
determination of hydrocarbons.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) Zero and span (calibrate if required) the hydrocarbon analyzer.
    (2) Purge the enclosure until a stable background hydrocarbon 
reading is obtained.
    (3) Turn on the mixing blower (if not already on).
    (4) Seal enclosure and measure background hydrocarbon concentration, 
background methanol, temperature, and barometric pressure. These are the 
initial readings C<INF>HCi</INF>, C<INF>CH3OHi</INF>, T<INF>i</INF>, and 
P<INF>Bi</INF>, for the enclosure background determination.
    (5) Allow the enclosure to stand undisturbed without sampling for 
four hours.
    (6) Measure the hydrocarbon and methanol concentration on the same 
FID. These are the final concentrations, C<INF>HCf</INF> and 
C<INF>CH3OHf</INF>. Also measure final temperature and barometric 
pressure.
    (7) Calculate the mass change of methanol, hydrocarbons, and 
hydrocarbons plus methanol in the enclosure according to the equations 
in paragraph (d) of this section. The enclosure background emissions 
(hydrocarbons plus methanol) shall not be greater than 0.4g for the 4 
hours.
    (b) Initial determination of enclosure internal volume. Prior to its 
introduction into service the enclosure internal volume shall be 
determined by the following procedure.
    (1) Carefully measure the internal length, width and height of the 
enclosure, accounting for irregularities (such as braces) and calculate 
the internal volume.
    (2) Perform an enclosure calibration check according to paragraphs 
(c) (1) through (7) of this section.
    (3) If the calculated mass does not agree within <plus-minus>2 
percent of the injected propane mass, then corrective action is 
required.
    (c) Hydrocarbon and methanol retention check and claibration. The 
hydrocarbon and methanol retention check provides a check upon the 
calculated volume and also measures the leak rate. Prior to its 
introduction into service and at least monthly thereafter the enclosure 
leak rate shall be determined as follows:
    (1) Zero and span (calibrate if required) the hydrocarbon analyzer.
    (2) Purge the enclosure until a stable background hydrocarbon 
reading is obtained.
    (3) Turn on the mixing blower (if not already on).
    (4) Seal enclosure and measure background hydrocarbon concentration, 
background methanol, temperature, and barometric pressure. These are the 
initial readings C<INF>HCi</INF>, C<INF>CH3OHi</INF>, T<INF>i</INF> and 
P<INF>Bi</INF> for the enclosure calibration.
    (5) Inject into the enclosure a known quantity of pure propane (4g 
is a convenient quantity) and a known quantity of pure methanol (4g is a 
convenient quantity) in gaseous form; i.e., at a temperature of at least 
150-155  deg.F (65-68  deg.C). The propane and methanol may be measured 
by volume flow or by mass measurement. The method used to measure the 
propane and methanol shall have an accuracy of <plus-minus>0.5 percent 
of the measured value. (Less accurate methods may be used with the 
advanced approval of the Administrator.)

[[Page 156]]

The methanol and propane tests do not need to be conducted 
simultaneously.
    (6) After a minimum of 5 minutes of mixing, analyze the enclosure 
atmosphere for hydrocarbon and methanol content, also record temperature 
and pressure. These measurements are the final readings for the 
enclosure calibration as well as the initial readings for the retention 
check.
    (7) To verify the enclosure calibration, calculate the mass of 
propane and the mass of methanol using the measurements taken in steps 
(4) and (6). See paragraph (d) of this section. This quantity must be 
within <plus-minus>2 percent of that measured in step 5 above. (For 
1991-1995 calendar years, the difference may exceed <plus-minus>2 
percent for methanol, provided it does not exceed <plus-minus>6 
percent.)
    (8) Allow the enclosure to remain sealed for a minimum of 4 hours, 
analyze the enclosure atmosphere for hydrocarbon and methanol content; 
record temperature and barometric pressure. These are the final readings 
for the hydrocarbon and methanol retention check.
    (9) Calculate, using the equation in paragraph (d) of this section 
and the readings taken in step (8), the hydrocarbon and methanol mass. 
It may not differ by more than <plus-minus>4 percent of the value in 
step (6). (For 1991-1995 calendar year methanol-fueled vehicles, the 
difference may exceed <plus-minus>4 percent for methanol, provided it 
does not exceed <plus-minus>6 percent.)
    (d) Calculations. (1) The calculation of net methanol and 
hydrocarbon mass change is used to determine enclosure background and 
leak rate. It is also used to check the enclosure volume measurements. 
The methanol mass change is calculated from the initial and final 
methanol samples, temperature and pressure according to the following

Sec. 86.1217-96  Evaporative emission enclosure calibrations.

    The calibration of evaporative emission enclosures consists of three 
parts: initial and periodic determination of enclosure background 
emissions (hydrocarbons and methanol); initial determination of 
enclosure internal volume; and periodic hydrocarbon and methanol 
retention check and calibration. Methanol measurements may be omitted if 
methanol-fueled vehicles will not be tested in the evaporative 
enclosure. Alternate calibration methods may be used if shown to yield 
equivalent or superior results, and if approved in advance by the 
Administrator; specifically, more extreme temperatures may be used for 
determining calibration without affecting the validity of test results.
    (a) Initial and periodic determination of enclosure background 
emissions. Prior to its introduction into service, annually thereafter, 
and after any repair that can affect the enclosure background emissions, 
the enclosure shall be checked to determine that it does not contain 
materials that will themselves emit hydrocarbons or methanol. When 
methanol as well as hydrocarbons are present in the evaporative 
enclosure, the HFID hydrocarbon concentration measurement includes the 
partial response of the HFID to methanol plus the hydrocarbons. 
Determination of the HFID response to methanol, Sec. 86.1221, prior to 
its being placed in service is required for the determination of 
hydrocarbons. Proceed as follows:
    (1) Prepare the enclosure. (i) Variable-volume enclosures may be 
operated in either latched or unlatched volume configuration, as 
described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Ambient temperatures 
shall be maintained at 96<plus-minus>3  deg.F throughout the 4-hour 
period.
    (ii) Fixed-volume enclosures may be operated with inlet and outlet 
flow streams either closed or open; if inlet and outlet flow streams are 
open, the air flowing into and out of the enclosure must be monitored in 
accordance with Sec. 86.107-96(a)(1)(ii)(B). Ambient temperatures shall 
be maintained at 96<plus-minus>3  deg.F throughout the 4-hour period.
    (iii) For running loss enclosures ambient temperatures shall be 
maintained at 95<plus-minus>3  deg.F throughout the 4-hour period. For 
running loss enclosures designed with a vent for makeup air, the 
enclosure shall be operated with the vent closed.
    (2) The enclosure may be sealed and the mixing fan operated for a 
period of up to 12 hours before the 4-hour background sampling period 
begins.
    (3) Zero and span (calibrate if required) the hydrocarbon analyzer.
    (4) Prior to the background determination, purge the enclosure until 
a stable background hydrocarbon reading is obtained.
    (5) Turn on the mixing blower (if not already on).
    (6) Seal enclosure and measure background hydrocarbon concentration, 
background methanol, temperature, and barometric pressure. These are the 
initial readings C<INF>HCi</INF>, C<INF>CH</INF>3<INF>OHi</INF>, and 
P<INF>Bi</INF>, T<INF>i</INF> for the enclosure background 
determination.
    (7) Allow the enclosure to stand undisturbed for four hours.

[[Page 158]]

    (8) Measure the hydrocarbon concentration on the same FID and the 
methanol level. These are the final concentrations, C<INF>HCf</INF> and 
C<INF>CH</INF>3<INF>OHf</INF>. Also measure final temperature and 
barometric pressure.
    (9) Calculate the mass change of methanol, hydrocarbons, and 
hydrocarbons plus methanol in the enclosure according to the equations 
in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (i) Diurnal enclosures. The enclosure background emissions 
(hydrocarbons plus methanol) shall not be greater than 0.05g for the 4 
hours.
    (ii) Running loss enclosures. The enclosure background emissions 
(hydrocarbons plus methanol) shall not be greater than 0.2 grams for the 
4 hours.
    (b) Initial determination of enclosure internal volume. Prior to its 
introduction into service the enclosure internal volume shall be 
determined by the following procedure:
    (1) Carefully measure the internal length, width and height of the 
enclosure, accounting for irregularities (such as braces) and calculate 
the internal volume. For variable-volume enclosures, latch the enclosure 
to a fixed volume when the enclosure is held at a constant temperature; 
this nominal volume shall be repeatable within <plus-minus>0.5 percent 
of the reported value.
    (2)-(3) [Reserved]
    (c) Hydrocarbon and methanol (organic gas) retention check and 
calibration. The hydrocarbon and methanol (if the enclosure is used for 
methanol-fueled vehicles) retention check provides a check upon the 
calculated volume and also measures the leak rate. The enclosure leak 
rate shall be determined prior to its introduction into service, 
following any modifications or repairs to the enclosure that may affect 
the integrity of the enclosure, and at least monthly thereafter. If six 
consecutive monthly retention checks are successfully completed without 
corrective action, the enclosure leak rate may be determined quarterly 
thereafter as long as no corrective action is required.
    (1) An enclosure to be used for the diurnal emission test (see 
Sec. 86.1233-96) shall be calibrated according to the following 
procedure. Calibration for hydrocarbon and methanol may be conducted 
simultaneously or in sequential test runs.
    (i) Zero and span (calibrate if required) the hydrocarbon analyzer.
    (ii) Purge the enclosure until a stable background hydrocarbon 
reading is obtained.
    (iii) Turn on the mixing blowers (if not already on).
    (iv) [Reserved]
    (v) Turn on the ambient temperature control system (if not already 
on) and adjust it for an initial temperature of 96  deg.F (36  deg.C). 
On variable-volume enclosures, latch the enclosure to the appropriate 
volume position for the set temperature. On fixed-volume enclosures 
close the outlet and inlet flow streams.
    (vi) When the enclosure stabilizes at 96<plus-minus>3  deg.F 
(36<plus-minus>2  deg.C), seal the enclosure and measure background 
hydrocarbon concentration, background methanol, temperature, and 
barometric pressure. These are the initial readings C<INF>HCi</INF>, 
C<INF>CH</INF>3<INF>OHi</INF>, T<INF>i</INF>, and P<INF>Bi</INF> for the 
enclosure calibration.
    (vii) Inject into the enclosure 2 to 6 grams of pure methanol at a 
temperature of at least 150  deg.F (65  deg.C) and/or 2 to 6 grams of 
pure propane. The injected quantity may be measured by volume flow or by 
mass measurement. The method used to measure the quantity of methanol 
and propane shall have an accuracy of <plus-minus>0.2 percent of the 
measured value (less accurate methods may be used with the advance 
approval of the Administrator).
    (viii) After a minimum of 5 minutes of mixing, analyze the enclosure 
atmosphere for hydrocarbon and methanol content, also record temperature 
and pressure. These measurements are the final readings for the 
enclosure calibration as well as the initial readings for the retention 
check.
    (ix) To verify the enclosure calibration, calculate the mass of 
propane and the mass of methanol using the measurements taken in 
paragraphs (c)(1)(vi) and (viii) of this section. See paragraph (d) of 
this section. This quantity must be within <plus-minus>2 percent of that 
measured in paragraph (c)(1)(vii) of this section. (For calendar years 
through 1995, the difference may exceed <plus-minus>2 percent for 
methanol, provided it does not exceed <plus-minus>6 percent.)

[[Page 159]]

    (x) For variable-volume enclosures, unlatch the enclosure from the 
nominal volume configuration. For fixed-volume enclosures, open the 
outlet and inlet flow streams.
    (xi) Start cycling the ambient temperature from 96  deg.F to 72 
deg.F and back to 96  deg.F over a 24-hour period, according to the 
profile specified in Sec. 86.1233-96 and appendix II of this part, 
within 15 minutes of sealing the enclosure.
    (xii) At the completion of the 24-hour cycling period, analyze the 
enclosure atmosphere for hydrocarbon and methanol content; determine the 
net withdrawn methanol (in the case of diurnal emission testing with 
fixed-volume enclosures); record temperature and barometric pressure. 
These are the final readings for the hydrocarbon and methanol retention 
check. The final hydrocarbon and methanol mass, calculated in paragraph 
(d) of this section, shall be within 3 percent of that determined in 
paragraph (c)(1)(viii) of this section. (For calendar years through 
1995, the difference may exceed <plus-minus>3 percent for methanol, 
provided it does not exceed <plus-minus>6 percent.)
    (2) An enclosure to be used for the running loss test (see 
Sec. 86.1234-96) shall meet the calibration and retention requirements 
of Sec. 86.1217-90(c).
    (3) Enclosures calibrated according to the procedures specified in 
either paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section may be used for hot 
soak testing (see Sec. 86.1238).
    (4) The Administrator, upon request, may waive the requirement to 
comply with <plus-minus>2 percent methanol recovery tolerance, and/or 
the <plus-minus>3 percent retention tolerance and instead require 
compliance with higher tolerances (not to exceed <plus-minus>6 percent 
for recoveries and <plus-minus>8 for retention), provided that:
    (i) The Administrator determines that compliance with these 
specified tolerances is not practically feasible; and
    (ii) The manufacturer makes information available to the 
Administrator which indicates that the calibration tests and their 
results are consistent with good laboratory practice, and that the 
results are consistent with the results of calibration testing conducted 
by the Administrator.
    (d) Calculations. (1) The calculation of net methanol and 
hydrocarbon mass change is used to determine enclosure background and 
leak rate. It is also used to check the enclosure volume measurements. 
The methanol mass change is calculated from the initial and final 
methanol samples, the net withdrawn methanol (in the case of diurnal 
emission testing with fixed-volume enclosures), and initial and final 
temperature and pressure according to the following equation:

    (3) For variable-volume enclosures, defined in 
Sec. 86.1207(a)(1)(i), the following simplified form of the hydrocarbon 
mass change equation may be used:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.123

    (e) Calibration of equipment for point-source testing of running 
losses. For the point-source method, the running loss fuel vapor 
sampling system shall be calibrated as a CVS system, as specified in 
Sec. 86.119, with the additional specification that the vapor sampling 
system verification be conducted as follows:
    (1) The following ``gravimetric'' technique can be used to verify 
that the vapor sampling system and analytical instruments can accurately 
measure a mass of gas that has been injected into the system. If the 
vapor sampling system will be used only in the testing of petroleum-
fueled engines, system verification may be performed using propane. If 
the vapor sampling system will be used with methanol-fueled vehicles as 
well as petroleum-fueled vehicles, the system verification performance 
check must include a methanol check in addition to the propane check. 
(Verification can also be accomplished by constant flow metering using 
critical flow orifice devices.)

[[Page 161]]

    (i) Obtain a small cylinder that has been charged with pure propane 
gas. Obtain another small cylinder that has been charged with pure 
methanol if the system will be used for methanol-fueled vehicle testing. 
Since this cylinder will be heated to 150-155  deg.F, care must be taken 
to ensure that the liquid volume of methanol placed in the cylinder does 
not exceed approximately one-half of the total volume of the cylinder.
    (ii) Determine a reference cylinder weight to the nearest 0.01 
grams.
    (iii) Operate the vapor sampling system in the normal manner and 
release a known quantity of pure propane into the most frequently used 
fuel vapor collector during the sampling period (approximately 5 
minutes).
    (iv) Continue to operate the vapor sampling system in the normal 
manner and release a known quantity of pure methanol into the system 
during the sampling period (approximately 5 minutes).
    (v) The calculations of Sec. 86.1244 are performed in the normal 
way, except in the case of propane. The density of propane (17.30 g/
ft\3\/carbon atom (0.6109 kg/m\3\/carbon atom)) is used in place of the 
density of exhaust hydrocarbons. In the case of methanol, the density of 
37.71 g/ft\3\ (1.332 kg/m\3\) is used.
    (vi) The gravimetric mass is subtracted from the vapor sampling 
system measured mass and then divided by the gravimetric mass to 
determine the percent accuracy of the system.
    (vii) The cause for any discrepancy greater than <plus-minus>2 
percent must be found and corrected.
    (2) This procedure shall be conducted in the point-source running 
loss test environment with the collector installed in a vehicle in the 
normal test configuration. The fuel of the test vehicle shall either be 
diesel, or it shall be kept under 100  deg.F (38  deg.C). Two to six 
grams of pure propane and two to six grams of pure methanol shall be 
injected into the collector while the vehicle is operated over one 
Heavy-Duty Vehicle Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule, as described in 
Sec. 86.1215 and appendix I of this part. The propane and methanol 
injections shall be conducted at the ambient temperature of 
95<plus-minus>5  deg.F (35<plus-minus>3  deg.C).

<R05>
Sec. 86.1218-85  Dynamometer calibration.

    (a) The dynamometer shall be calibrated at least once each month or 
performance verified at least once each week and then calibrated as 
required. The calibration shall consist of the manufacturer's 
recommended calibration procedure plus a determination of the 
dynamometer frictional power absorption. If the dynamometer is to be 
used for driving only the reference (transient) schedule, the frictional 
power absorption needs to be determined only at 50.0 mph (80.5 km/hr). 
If the dynamometer is to be used for driving the steady-state cycle, the 
frictional power absorption needs to be determined through the range of 
15 to 50 mph. One method for determining dynamometer frictional power 
absorption at 50.0 mph (80.5 km/hr) is described below. The same general 
method can be used at other speeds. Other methods may be used if shown 
to yield equivalent results. The measured absorbed road power includes 
the dynamometer friction as well as the power absorbed by the power 
absorption unit. The dynamometer is driven above the test speed range. 
The device used to drive the dynamometer is then disengaged from the 
dynamometer and the roll(s) is (are) allowed to coastdown. The kinetic 
energy of the system is dissipated by the dynamometer. This method 
neglects the variations in roll bearing friction due to the drive axle 
weight of the vehicle. In the case of dynamometers with paired rolls, 
the inertia and power absorption of the free (rear) roll may be 
neglected if its inertia is less than 3.0 percent of the total 
equivalent inertia required for vehicle testing.
    (1) Devise a method to determine the speed of the roll(s) to be 
measured for power absorption. A fifth wheel, revolution pickup, or 
other suitable means may be used.
    (2) Place a vehicle on the dynamometer or devise another method of 
driving the dynamometer.

[[Page 162]]

    (3) If the dynamometer is capable of simulating more than a single 
inertia mass, engage the inertial flywheel or other inertial simulation 
system for the most common vehicle mass category for which the 
dynamometer is used. In addition, other vehicle mass categories may be 
calibrated, if desired.
    (4) Drive the dynamometer up to 50 mph (80.5 km/hr).
    (5) Record indicated road power.
    (6) Drive the dynamometer up to 60 mph (96.9 km/hr).
    (7) Disengage the device used to drive the dynamometer.
    (8) Record the time for the dynamometer roll(s) to coastdown from 
55.0 mph (88.5 km/hr) to 45.0 mph (72.4 km/hr).
    (9) Adjust the power absorption unit to a different level.
    (10) Repeat steps (4) to (8) above sufficient times to cover the 
range of road power used.
    (11) Calculate absorbed road power (HP<INF>d</INF>). (See paragraph 
(c) of this section.)
    (12) Plot indicated road load power at 50 mph (80.5 km/hr) versus 
road load power at 50 mph (80.5 km/hr).
    (b) The performance check consists of conducting a dynamometer 
coastdown and comparing the coastdown time to that recorded during the 
last calibration. If the coastdown times differ by more than 1 second or 
by 5 percent of the time recorded during the last calibration, whichever 
is greater, a new calibration is required.
    (c) Calculations. The road load power actually absorbed by each roll 
assembly (or roll-inertia weight assembly) of the dynamometer is 
calculated from the following equation:

HP<INF>d</INF> = (\1/2\) (W/32.2) (V<INF>1</INF>\2\--V<INF>2</INF>\2\)/
          550t

Where:
HP<INF>d</INF> = Power, horsepower (kilowatts)
W = Equivalent inertia, lb (kg)
V <INF>1</INF> = Initial velocity, ft/s (m/s) (55 mph = 88.5 km/h = 
80.67 ft/s = 24.58 m/s)
V<INF>2</INF> = Final velocity, ft/s (m/s) (45 mph = 72.4 km/h = 66 ft/s 
= 20.11 m/s)
t = Elapsed time for rolls to coast from 55 mph to 45 mph (88.5 to 72.4 
km/hr).

(Expressions in parenthesis are for SI units). When the coastdown is 
from 55 to 45 mph (88.5 to 72.4 km/hr) the above equation reduces to:

HP<INF>d</INF> = 0.06073 (W/t)

For SI units:
HP <INF>d</INF> = 0.09984 (W/t)

    The total road load power actually absorbed by the dynamometer is 
the sum of the absorbed road load power of each roll assembly.

Sec. 86.1221-90  Hydrocarbon analyzer calibration.

    The FID hydrocarbon analyzer shall receive the following initial and 
periodic calibrations.
    (a) Initial and periodic optimization of detector response. Prior to 
its introduction into service and at least annually thereafter, the FID 
hydrocarbon analyzer shall be adjusted for optimum hydrocarbon response. 
(The HFID used with methanol-fueled vehicles shall be operated at 
235 deg. <plus-minus>15  deg.F (113 deg. <plus-minus>8  deg.C)). 
Analyzers used with gasoline-fuel and liquefied petroleum gas-fuel shall 
be optimized using propane. Analyzers used with natural gas-fuel may be 
optimized using methane, or if calibrated using propane the FID response 
to methane shall be determined and applied to the FID hydrocarbon 
reading. Alternate methods yielding equivalent results may be used, if 
approved in advance by the Administrator.
    (1) Follow the manufacturer's instructions or good engineering 
practice for instrument startup and basic operating adjustment using the 
appropriate FID fuel and zero-grade air.
    (2) Optimize on the most common operating range. Introduce into the 
analyzer a propane (or methane as appropriate) in air mixture with a 
propane (or methane as appropriate) concentration equal to approximately 
90 percent of the most common operating range.
    (3) Select an operating FID fuel flow rate that will give near 
maximum response and least variation in response with minor fuel flow 
variations.
    (4) To determine the optimum air flow, use the FID fuel flow setting 
determined above and vary air flow.
    (5) After the optimum flow rates have been determined, record them 
for future reference.
    (b) Initial and periodic calibration. Prior to its introduction into 
service and monthly thereafter the FID hydrocarbon analyzer shall be 
calibrated on all normally used instrument ranges,

[[Page 163]]

and, if applicable, the methanol response factor shall be determined 
(paragraph (c) of this section). Use the same flow rate as when 
analyzing sample.
    (1) Adjust analyzer to optimize performance.
    (2) Zero the hydrocarbon analyzer with zero-grade air.
    (3) Calibrate on each normally used operating range with propane in 
air (or methane in air as appropriate) calibration gases having nominal 
concentrations of 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 percent of that range. For 
each range calibrated, if the deviation from a least squares best-fit 
straight line is two percent or less of the value at each data point, 
concentration values may be calculated by use of a single calibration 
factor for that range. If the deviation exceeds two percent at any 
point, the best-fit non-linear equation which represents the data to 
within two percent of each test point shall be used to determine 
concentration.
    (c) FID response factor to methanol. When the FID analyzer is to be 
used for the analysis of hydrocarbon samples containing methanol, the 
methanol response factor of the analyzer shall be established. The 
methanol response factor shall be determined at several concentrations 
in the range of concentrations in the exhaust sample, using either bag 
samples or gas bottles meeting the requirements of Sec. 86.114.
    (1) The bag sample of methanol for analysis in the FID, if used, 
shall be prepared using the apparatus shown in Figure M90-1. A known 
volume of methanol is injected, using a microliter syringe, into the 
heated mixing zone (250  deg.F (121  deg.C) of the apparatus. The 
methanol is vaporized and swept into the sample bag with a known volume 
of zero grade air measured by a gas flow meter with an accuracy of 
<plus-minus>2 percent.

in the range of concentrations in the exhaust sample. The total 
hydrocarbon FID response to methane is calculated as follows:

Sec. 86.1227-90  Test procedures; overview.

    (a) The overall test consists of prescribed sequences of fueling, 
parking, and operating conditions. Vehicles are tested only for 
evaporative emissions.
    (b) The evaporative emission test (gasoline-fueled and methanol-
fueled vehicles) is designed to determine hydrocarbon and/or methanol 
evaporative emissions as a consequence of diurnal temperature 
fluctuation, urban driving and hot soaks during engine-off periods. It 
is associated with a series of events representative of heavy-duty 
vehicle operation, which result in hydrocarbon and/or methanol vapor 
losses. The test procedure is designed to measure:
    (1) Diurnal breathing losses resulting from daily temperature 
changes, measured by the enclosure technique;
    (2) Running losses from suspected sources (if indicated by 
engineering analysis or vehicle inspection) resulting from a simulated 
trip on a chassis dynamometer, measured by carbon traps; and
    (3) Hot soak losses which result when the vehicle is parked and the 
hot engine is turned off, measured by the enclosure technique.
    (c) Background concentrations are measured for all species for which 
emissions measurements are made. For evaporative testing, this requires 
measuring initial concentrations. (When testing methanol-fueled 
vehicles, manufacturers may choose not to measure background 
concentrations of methanol, and then assume that the concentrations are 
zero during calculations.)

Sec. 86.1228-85  Transmissions.

    (a) All test conditions, except as noted, shall be run in a manner 
representative of in-use operation, and where appropriate, according to 
the manufacturer's recommendation to the ultimate purchaser.
    (b) Except for the first idle mode, idle modes less than one minute 
in length shall be run with automatic transmissions in ``Drive'' and the 
wheels braked; manual transmissions shall be in gear with the clutch 
disengaged, except first idle. The first idle mode and idle modes longer 
than one minute in length shall be run with automatic transmissions in 
``Neutral,'' and manual transmissions shall be in ``Neutral'' with the 
clutch engaged (clutch may be disengaged for engine start-up).
    (c) The vehicle shall be driven with minimum accelerator pedal 
movement to maintain the desired operation.
    (d) Accelerations shall be driven smoothly according to the 
manufacturer's recommendation to the ultimate purchaser. For manual 
transmissions, the operator shall accomplish each shift with minimum 
time. If the vehicle cannot accelerate at the specified rate, the 
vehicle shall be operated at maximum available power until the vehicle 
speed reaches the value prescribed for that time in the driving 
schedule.
    (e) For those deceleration modes which decelerate to zero, manual 
transmission clutches shall be depressed when the speed drops below 15 
mph (24.1 km/hr), when engine roughness is evident, or when engine 
stalling is imminent.

Sec. 86.1229-85  Dynamometer load determination and fuel temperature profile.

    (a) Flywheels, electrical or other means of simulating inertia shall 
be used. The value of equivalent inertia weight shall be within 250 
pounds of the loaded vehicle weight (LVW). Loaded vehicle weight is 
defined as follows:
    (1) For test vehicles which have an actual weight less than 0.5 x 
(GVWR),

LVW = 0.5 x (Gross Vehicle Weight Rating)

    (2) For test vehicles which have an actual weight (As tested) 
greater than 0.5 x (GVWR),

LVW = Actual Weight of Test Vehicle,

    (b) Power absorption unit adjustment. (1) The power absorption unit 
shall be adjusted to reproduce road load power at 50 mph true speed. The 
indicated road load power setting shall take into account the 
dynamometer friction. The relationship between road load (absorbed) 
power and indicated road load power for a particular dynamometer shall 
be determined by the procedure outlined in Sec. 86.1218-85 or other 
suitable means.
    (2) The road load power used shall be determined from the following 
equation:


[[Page 167]]


RLP = 0.67(H - 0.75)W = 0.00125[LVW - (N x DW)]

Where:
RLP = Road Load Power at 50 mph (horsepower).
H = Vehicle overall maximum height (feet).
W = Vehicle overall maximum width (feet).
LVW = Loaded vehicle weight (pounds).
DW = Vehicle weight supported by the dynamometer (pounds).
N = Number of dynamometer rolls supporting a tire.


or the manufacturer may determine the road load power by an alternate 
procedure (including coastdown). Such alternate procedures shall exhibit 
good engineering judgement and shall be subject to review upon request 
by the Administrator. For vehicles which the manufacturer chooses to 
certify by the optional light-duty truck certification provision 
(Sec. 86.082-1(b)), the evaporative emission test procedure (and 
standard) will be that specified by the light-duty truck regulations.
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) Fuel temperature profile--(1) General requirements. (i) To be 
tested for running losses, as specified in Sec. 86.1234, a vehicle must 
have a fuel temperature profile. The following procedure is used to 
generate the fuel temperature profile, which serves as a target for 
controlling fuel temperatures during the running loss test. This profile 
represents the fuel temperature change that occurs during on-road 
driving. If a vehicle has more than one fuel tank, a profile shall be 
established for each tank. Manufacturers may also simultaneously 
generate a profile for vapor temperatures.
    (ii) If a manufacturer uses a vehicle model to develop a profile to 
represent multiple models, the vehicle model selected must have the 
greatest expected fuel temperature increase during driving of all those 
models it represents. Also, manufacturers must select test vehicles with 
any available vehicle options that increase fuel temperatures during 
driving (for example, any feature that limits underbody airflow).
    (iii) Manufacturers may conduct testing to develop fuel temperature 
profiles in a laboratory setting, subject to approval by the 
Administrator. The laboratory facility should simulate outdoor testing 
to reproduce fuel and vapor temperature behavior over the specified 
driving schedule. The design of the laboratory facility should include 
consideration of any parameters that may affect fuel temperatures, such 
as solar loading, pavement heat, and relative wind velocities around and 
underneath the test vehicle. Indoor testing to develop the fuel 
temperature profiles must be conducted with little or no vehicle-
specific adjustment of laboratory parameters. Manufacturers would need 
to maintain an ongoing demonstration of correlation between laboratory 
and outdoor measurement of fuel temperatures. Specifically, fuel 
temperatures and pressures from indoor driving should be at least as 
high as measured when driving outdoors according to the procedures 
described in this section.
    (iv) Small-volume manufacturers, as defined in Sec. 86.094-14(b)(1), 
may use an alternate method for generating fuel temperature profiles, 
subject to the approval of the Administrator.
    (v) The Administrator may conduct testing to establish any vehicle's 
temperature profiles or to verify compliance with fuel tank pressure 
requirements.
    (2) Vehicle instrumentation. (i) The vehicle must be equipped with 
temperature sensors and pressure transducers, as described in 
Sec. 86.1207-96(e) and (f), and a driver's aid, which shall be 
configured to provide the test driver with the desired vehicle speed vs. 
time trace and the actual vehicle speed.
    (ii) A computer, data logger, or strip chart data recorder shall 
record the following parameters at a minimum during the test run:
    (A) Desired speed;
    (B) Actual speed;
    (C) Instantaneous average liquid fuel temperature (T<INF>liq</INF>); 
and
    (D) Vapor space pressure (the Administrator may omit measurement of 
fuel tank pressure).
    (iii) The data recording system described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of 
this section shall be capable of resolving time to <plus-minus>1 s, 
capable of resolving temperature to <plus-minus>2  deg.F, capable of 
resolving pressure to <plus-minus>1.0 inch of water, and capable of 
resolving speed to <plus-minus>1 mph. The temperature and pressure 
signals shall be recorded at intervals of up to 1

[[Page 168]]

minute; speed signals shall be recorded at intervals of up to 1 second.
    (3) Ambient conditions. The procedure shall be run under the 
following ambient conditions. Conditions should be representative of 
sunny summer days.
    (i) Starting ambient temperature (T<INF>amb,o</INF>) shall be at 
least 95  deg.F, steady or increasing (no more than 2  deg.F drop) 
during the procedure. Ambient temperature shall be measured and recorded 
in regular intervals of at least once every 5 minutes. Measure ambient 
temperature with the following requirements (based on Federal Standard 
for Siting Meteorological Sensors at Airports, FCM-S4-1987). The sensors 
shall be mounted 5<plus-minus>1 feet (1.5<plus-minus>0.3 meters) above 
ground level. The sensors shall be protected from radiation from the 
sun, sky, earth, and any other surrounding objects, but at the same time 
be adequately ventilated. The sensors shall be installed in such a 
position as to ensure that measurements are representative of the free 
air circulation in the locality and not influenced by artificial 
conditions such as large buildings, cooling towers, and expanses of 
concrete and tarmac. Keep any grass and vegetation within 100 feet (30 
meters) of the sensor clipped to a height of about 10 inches (25 
centimeters) or less.
    (ii) Wind conditions shall be calm to light with maximum wind speed 
of 15 mph. In the case of temporary gusting, wind speeds between 15 and 
25 mph may occur for up to 5 percent of the total driving time without 
invalidating the data collection. Wind speed shall be measured and 
recorded in regular intervals of at least once per minute. Measure wind 
speed with the following requirements (based on Federal Standard for 
Siting Meteorological Sensors at Airports, FCM-S4-1987). The site should 
be relatively level, but small gradual slopes are acceptable. The sensor 
shall be mounted 30 to 33 feet (9 to 10 meters) above the average ground 
height within a radius of 500 feet (150 meters). The sensor height shall 
not exceed 33 feet, except as necessary to be at least 15 feet (5 
meters) above the height of any obstruction (e.g. vegetation, buildings, 
etc.) within a 500 foot (150 meter) radius. An object is considered to 
be an obstruction if the included lateral angle from the sensor to the 
ends of the object is 10 degrees or more.
    (iii) Road surface temperature shall be at least 125  deg.F 
throughout the driving period. Pavement temperature shall be measured 
and recorded in regular intervals of at least once per minute. The track 
temperature may be measured with an embedded sensor, a portable 
temperature probe, or an infrared pyrometer that can provide an accuracy 
of <plus-minus>2  deg.F. Temperatures must be measured on a surface 
representative of the surface where the vehicle is driven.
    (iv) Conditions shall be sunny or mostly sunny with a maximum cloud 
cover of 25 percent.
    (v) Reported cloud cover, wind speed, and ambient temperature should 
be consistent with that reported by the nearest weather station; the 
Administrator may request justification of any discrepancy.
    (4) Profile determination procedure. (i) Drain the fuel tank(s) and 
fill with test fuel to the ``tank fuel volume'' defined in Sec. 86.082-
2. The test fuel should meet the specifications of Sec. 86.1213, except 
that fuel with a lower volatility may be used, subject to Administrator 
approval. Manufacturers using a lower volatility fuel must generate a 
vapor temperature profile for demonstrating compliance with the limit on 
fuel tank pressure during the running loss test (see Sec. 86.1234-96).
    (ii) The vehicle shall be moved to the location where the data is to 
be collected. It may be driven a maximum distance of 5 miles and may 
also be transported by other means. The vehicle shall be stabilized by 
one of the following methods:
    (A) The vehicle shall be parked for a minimum of 12 hours in an open 
area on a surface that is representative of the test road, without any 
artificial heating or cooling of the fuel. The orientation of the front 
of the vehicle during parking (e.g., N, SW, etc.) shall be documented.
    (B) The vehicle may be soaked in a temperature-controlled 
environment to stabilize fuel temperatures. Before starting the drive, 
the vehicle shall be stabilized with fuel temperatures 95<plus-minus>3 
deg.F for at least one hour. The fuel temperature may not exceed 98 
deg.F at any

[[Page 169]]

time before the beginning of the driving schedule, during which only 
whole-vehicle heating and cooling may be used to control fuel 
temperatures. If a manufacturer uses the provisions of paragraph 
(d)(7)(v) of this section to establish a lower initial fuel temperature 
for the running loss test, the fuel in the test vehicle may not be 
stabilized at a temperature higher than the newly established initial 
fuel temperature.
    (iii) Once the ambient conditions specified in paragraph (d)(3) of 
this section are met and the vehicle has been stabilized according to 
paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section, the vehicle's engine may be 
started. The vehicle's air conditioning system (if so equipped) shall be 
set to the ``normal'' air conditioning mode and adjusted to the minimum 
discharge air temperature and high fan speed. Vehicles equipped with 
automatic temperature controlled air conditioning systems shall be set 
to operate in ``automatic'' temperature and fan modes with the system 
set at 72  deg.F.
    (iv) The vehicle may be operated at minimum throttle for a period up 
to 60 seconds prior to the start of the driving schedule, as necessary 
to move from the parking location onto the road surface. The driver's 
aid shall be started and the vehicle operated over the driving cycle 
specified in Sec. 86.1234-96(b) with the transmission operated in the 
same manner as specified in Sec. 86.128-79. The data recording system 
shall provide a record of the required parameters over the entire period 
of driving.
    (5) Records required. In addition to the vehicle data recording, the 
following parameters shall be documented for the determination of the 
fuel temperature profile:
    (i) Date and time of vehicle fueling;
    (ii) Odometer reading at vehicle fueling;
    (iii) Date and time vehicle was parked, parking location and 
orientation;
    (iv) Odometer reading at parking;
    (v) Date and time engine was started;
    (vi) Time of initiation of the first driving cycle;
    (vii) Time of completion of the driving cycle;
    (viii) Ambient temperatures throughout the period of driving 
(T<INF>amb</INF>);
    (ix) Wind speed throughout the period of driving;
    (x) Track surface temperatures throughout the period of driving 
cycle (T<INF>sur</INF>);
    (xi) Percent cloud cover during the period of driving; and
    (xii) Ambient temperature, wind speed, and percent cloud cover 
reported by the nearest weather station for the time corresponding most 
closely to the period of driving.
    (6) Fuel tank pressure. Tank pressure shall not exceed 10 inches of 
water at any time during the temperature profile determination unless a 
pressurized system is used and the manufacturer demonstrates that vapor 
would not be vented to the atmosphere upon fuel cap removal.
    (7) Calculation of temperature profiles. (i) The traces from the 
driving schedule shall be verified to meet the speed tolerance 
requirements of Sec. 86.1215. The following conditions shall be 
verified:

    (A) T<INF>amb,i</INF> [ge] T<INF>amb,o</INF> -2  deg.F.

Where,
    (1) i=instantaneous measurement throughout the drive; and
    (2) o=initial measurement at the start of the specified driving 
schedule.
    (B) T<INF>amb,o</INF>[ge]95  deg.F.
    (C) T<INF>sur,i</INF>-T<INF>amb,i</INF>[ge]30  deg.F.
    (D) W<INF>max</INF>[le]15 mph.

    (ii) Failure to comply with any of these requirements shall result 
in invalidation of the data and require that the procedure be repeated, 
beginning with the fuel drain at paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section.
    (iii) If all these requirements are met, the following calculations 
shall be performed to determine a profile for liquid fuel temperatures 
and, if applicable, for vapor temperatures: 
T<INF>i,profile</INF>=T<INF>i</INF>-T<INF>o</INF>.
Where:
    (A) T<INF>i,profile</INF>=the series of temperatures that comprise 
the relative temperature profile.
    (B) T<INF>i</INF>=the series of observed liquid fuel or vapor 
temperatures during the drive.
    (C) T<INF>o</INF>=the liquid fuel or vapor temperature observed at 
the start of the specified driving schedule.
    (iv) The relative temperature profile consists of the set of 
temperatures at

[[Page 170]]

each 1-minute interval. If temperatures are sampled more frequently than 
once per minute, the temperature data points may represent a rolling 
average of temperatures sampled for up to one-minute intervals. If 
multiple valid test runs are conducted for any model, then all the 
collected data shall be used to calculate a composite profile, based on 
the average temperatures at each point. The absolute temperature profile 
is determined by adding 95  deg.F (35  deg.C) to each point of the 
relative profile. Other methodologies for developing corrected liquid 
fuel and vapor space temperature profiles may be used if demonstrated to 
yield equivalent results and approved in advance by the Administrator.
    (v) Manufacturers may use a lower initial fuel temperature for the 
running loss test, if approved in advance by the Administrator. To 
demonstrate the need for such an adjustment, manufacturers would be 
expected to determine the maximum fuel temperature experienced by a 
vehicle during an extended park or after driving one UDDS cycle when 
exposed to the ambient conditions described in paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section. To use this provision, manufacturers would have to show maximum 
fuel temperatures no greater than 92  deg.F.

Sec. 86.1230-96  Test sequence; general requirements.

    (a)(1) Gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles. The test sequence 
shown in figure M96-1 of this section shows the steps encountered as the 
test vehicle undergoes the procedures subsequently described to 
determine conformity with the standards set forth. The full three-
diurnal sequence depicted in figure M96-1 tests vehicles for all sources 
of evaporative emissions. The supplemental two-diurnal test sequence is 
designed to verify that vehicles sufficiently purge their evaporative 
canisters during the dynamometer run. Sections 86.1232-96, 86.1233-96 
and 86.1238-96 describe the separate specifications of the supplemental 
two-diurnal test sequence.
    (2) Gaseous-fueled vehicles. The test sequence shown in figure M96-1 
of this section shows the steps encountered as the test vehicle 
undergoes the procedures subsequently described to determine conformity 
with the standards set forth, with the exception that the fuel drain and 
fill and precondition canister steps are not required for gaseous-fueled 
vehicles. In addition, the supplemental two-diurnal test and the running 
loss test are not required.
    (b) The vehicle test for fuel spitback during fuel dispensing is 
conducted as a stand-alone test (see Sec. 86.1246). This test is not 
required for gaseous-fueled vehicles.
    (c) Ambient temperature levels encountered by the test vehicle shall 
be not less than 68  deg.F nor more than 86  deg.F, unless otherwise 
specified. If a different ambient temperature is specified for soaking 
the vehicle, the soak period may be interrupted once for up to 10 
minutes to transport the vehicle from one soak area to another, provided 
the ambient temperature experienced by the vehicle is never below 68 
deg.F. The temperatures monitored during testing must be representative 
of those experienced by the test vehicle.
    (d) The vehicle shall be approximately level during all phases of 
the test sequence to prevent abnormal fuel distribution.
    (e) If tests are invalidated after collection of emission data from 
previous test segments, the test may be repeated to collect only those 
data points needed to complete emission measurements. Compliance with 
emission standards may be determined by combining emission measurements 
from different test runs. If any emission measurements are repeated, the 
new measurements supersede previous values.

    (a) Prepare the fuel tank(s) for recording the temperature of the 
prescribed test fuel at the approximate mid-volume of the fuel when the 
tank is 40 percent full.
    (b) Provide additional fittings and adapters, as required, to 
accommodate a fuel drain at the lowest point possible in the tank(s) as 
installed on the vehicle.
    (c)(1) Any vapor storage device which absorbs HC vapors and/or 
CH<INF>3</INF>OH vapors and subsequently releases them to the engine 
induction system during vehicle operation shall be subjected to a 
minimum of 30 load-purge cycles or the equivalent thereof (4,000 miles 
or more of actual in-use vehicle service accumulation shall be 
considered equivalent). One load-purge cycle shall be accomplished by 
conducting one of the following procedures:
    (i) Vehicle Procedure. Park a fully-warm vehicle (a vehicle that has 
been driven for at least 15 minutes) for a time period of at least 3 
hours. Fill the fuel tank(s) to the prescribed ``tank fuel volume'' with 
specified test fuel (Sec. 86.1213) at room temperature. Then drive the 
vehicle through at least one cycle of the HDV reference (transient) 
urban dynamometer driving schedule.
    (ii) Laboratory Procedure. Flow vapors (gasoline or methanol, as 
appropriate) into a pre-purged vapor storage device until at least 10 
percent of the input HC or CH<INF>3</INF>OH mass flow rate is passing 
through the device. Purge the device with a volume of air which is at 
least as great as, and which has a temperature no higher than that which 
would be drawn through the device if it were installed on the test 
vehicle and the vehicle was operated according to the HDV reference 
(transient) urban dynamometer driving schedule. The vapor flow rate, the 
method used to generate the vapors, the air flow rate, and the air 
temperature shall be recorded. If pre-blended gas is used, then the 
composition and characteristics of the gas shall be recorded.
    (2) Ten load-purge cycles accumulated immediately prior to testing 
shall be conducted according to the method in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of 
this section. The preceding 20 cycles (minimum) shall be conducted 
according to either of the methods in paragraph (c)(1) (i) or (ii) of 
this section.

    (b) Provide additional fittings and adapters, as required, to 
accommodate a fuel drain at the lowest point possible in the tank(s) as 
installed on the vehicle.
    (c) For preconditioning that involves loading the evaporative 
emission canister(s) with butane, provide valving or other means as 
necessary to allow purging and loading of the canister(s).
    (d) For vehicles to be tested for running loss emissions, prepare 
the fuel tank(s) for measuring and recording the temperature and 
pressure of the fuel tank as specified in Sec. 86.1207-96 (e) and (f). 
Measurement of vapor temperature is optional during the running loss 
test. If vapor temperature is not measured, fuel tank pressure need not 
be measured.
    (e) For vehicles to be tested for running loss emissions, prepare 
the exhaust system by sealing or plugging all detectable sources of 
exhaust gas leaks. The exhaust system shall be tested or inspected to 
ensure that detectable exhaust hydrocarbons are not emitted into the 
running loss enclosure during the running loss test.

Sec. 86.1232-96  Vehicle preconditioning.

    (a) Fuel tank cap(s) of gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles shall 
be removed during any period that the vehicle is parked outdoors 
awaiting testing, to prevent unusual loading of the canisters. During 
this time care must be taken to prevent entry of water or other 
contaminants into the fuel tank. During storage in the test area while 
awaiting testing, the fuel tank cap(s) may be in place. The vehicle 
shall be moved into the test area and the following operations 
performed.
    (b)(1) Gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles. Drain the fuel 
tank(s) and fill with test fuel, as specified in Sec. 86.1213, to the 
``tank fuel volume'' defined in Sec. 86.082-2. The fuel cap(s) shall be 
installed within one minute after refueling.
    (2) Gaseous-fueled vehicles. Vehicle fuel tanks are to be filled 
with fuel that meets the specifications in Sec. 86.113. Fuel tanks shall 
be filled to a minimum of 75% of service pressure for natural gas-fueled 
vehicles or a minimum of 75% of available fill volume for liquefied 
petroleum gas-fueled vehicles. Prior draining of the fuel tanks is not 
called for if the fuel in the tanks already meets the specifications in 
Sec. 86.113.
    (c) Gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles shall be soaked for at 
least 6 hours after being refueled. Gaseous-fueled vehicles shall be 
soaked for at least 1 hour after being refueled. Following this soak 
period, the test vehicle shall be placed, either by being driven or 
pushed, on a dynamometer and operated through one driving schedule, 
specified in Sec. 86.1215 and appendix I of this part. Once a test 
vehicle has completed the refueling and vehicle soak steps specified in 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, these steps may be omitted in 
subsequent testing with the same vehicle and the same fuel 
specifications, provided the vehicle remains under laboratory ambient 
temperature conditions for at least 6 hours before starting the next 
test. In such cases, each subsequent test shall begin with the 
preconditioning drive specified in this paragraph. The test vehicle may 
not be used to set dynamometer horsepower.
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) The Administrator may choose to conduct additional 
preconditioning to ensure that the evaporative emissions control system 
is stabilized. The additional preconditioning shall consist of an 
initial one hour minimum soak and one, two or three driving cycles of 
the dynamometer driving schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this 
section, each followed by a soak of at least one hour with engine off, 
engine compartment cover closed and cooling fan off. The vehicle may be 
driven off the dynamometer for the soak period that follows each driving 
cycle.
    (f)(1) Gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles. After completion of 
the preconditioning drive, the vehicle shall be driven off the 
dynamometer. The vehicle's fuel tank(s) shall be drained and then filled 
with test fuel, as specified in Sec. 86.1213, to the ``tank fuel 
volume'' defined in Sec. 86.082-2. The vehicle shall be refueled within 
1 hour after completion of the preconditioning drive. The fuel cap(s) 
shall be installed within 1 minute after refueling. The vehicle shall be 
parked within five minutes after refueling.
    (2) Gaseous-fueled vehicles. After completion of the preconditioning 
drive,

[[Page 176]]

the vehicle shall be driven off the dynamometer. Vehicle fuel tanks 
shall be refilled with fuel that meets the specifications in 
Sec. 86.1213. Fuel tanks shall be filled to a minimum of 75% of service 
pressure for natural gas-fueled vehicles or a minimum of 75% of 
available fill volume for liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles. Prior 
draining of the fuel tanks is not called for if the fuel in the tanks 
already meets the specifications in Sec. 86.1213. The vehicle shall be 
parked within five minutes after refueling, or, in the absence of 
refueling, within five minutes after completion of the preconditioning 
drive.
    (g) The vehicle shall be soaked for not less than 12 hours nor more 
than 36 hours between the end of the refueling event and the beginning 
of the cold start exhaust emission test.
    (h) During the soak period for the three-diurnal test sequence 
described in Sec. 86.1230-96, evaporative canisters, if the vehicle is 
so equipped, shall be preconditioned according to the following 
procedure. For vehicles with multiple canisters in a series 
configuration, the set of canisters must be preconditioned as a unit. 
For vehicles with multiple canisters in a parallel configuration, each 
canister must be preconditioned separately. If production evaporative 
canisters are equipped with a functional service port designed for vapor 
load or purge steps, the service port shall be used during testing to 
precondition the canister. In addition, for model year 1998 and later 
vehicles equipped with refueling canisters, these canisters shall be 
preconditioned for the three-diurnal test sequence according to the 
procedure in paragraph (j)(1) of this section. If a vehicle is designed 
to actively control evaporative or refueling emissions without a 
canister, the manufacturer shall devise an appropriate preconditioning 
procedure, subject to the approval of the Administrator.
    (1)(i) Prepare the evaporative emission canister for the canister 
purging and loading operation. The canister shall not be removed from 
the vehicle, unless access to the canister in its normal location is so 
restricted that purging and loading can only reasonably be accomplished 
by removing the canister from the vehicle. Special care shall be taken 
during this step to avoid damage to the components and the integrity of 
the fuel system. A replacement canister may be temporarily installed 
during the soak period while the canister from the test vehicle is 
preconditioned.
    (ii) The canister purge shall be performed with ambient air of 
humidity controlled to 50<plus-minus>25 grains per pound of dry air. 
This may be accomplished by purging the canister in a room that is 
conditioned to this level of absolute humidity. The flow rate of the 
purge air shall be maintained at a nominal flow rate of 0.8 cfm and the 
duration shall be determined to provide a total purge volume flow 
through the canister equivalent to 300 canister bed volume exchanges. 
The bed volume is based on the volume of adsorbing material in the 
canister.
    (iii) The evaporative emission canister shall then be loaded by 
sending to the canister an amount of commercial grade butane vapors 
equivalent to 1.5 times its nominal working capacity. The canister shall 
be loaded with a mixture composed of 50 percent butane and 50 percent 
nitrogen by volume at a rate of 15<plus-minus>2 grams butane per hour. 
If the canister loading at that rate takes longer than 12 hours, a 
manufacturer may determine a new rate, based on completing the canister 
loading in no less than 12 hours. The new rate may be used for all 
subsequent canister loading according to paragraph (h) of this section. 
The time of initiation and completion of the canister loading shall be 
recorded.
    (iv) The determination of a canister's nominal working capacity 
shall be based on the average capacity of no less than five canisters 
that are in a stabilized condition.
    (A) For stabilization, each canister must be loaded no less than 10 
times and no more than 100 times to 2-gram breakthrough with a 50/50 
mixture by volume of butane and nitrogen, at a rate of 15 grams butane 
per hour. Each canister loading step must be preceded by canister 
purging with 300 canister bed volume exchanges at 0.8 cfm.
    (B) For determining working capacity, each canister must first be 
purged with 300 canister bed volume exchanges at 0.8 cfm. The working 
capacity of each canister shall be established by

[[Page 177]]

determining the mass of butane required to load the canister from the 
purged state so that it emits 2 grams of hydrocarbon vapor; the canister 
must be loaded with a 50/50 mixture by volume of butane and nitrogen, at 
a rate of 15 grams butane per hour.
    (2) For methanol-fueled and flexible-fueled vehicles, canister 
preconditioning shall be performed with a fuel vapor composition 
representative of that which the vehicle would generate with the fuel 
mixture used for the current test. Manufacturers shall develop a 
procedure to precondition the evaporative canister, if the vehicle is so 
equipped, for the different fuel. The procedure shall represent a 
canister loading equivalent to that specified in paragraph (h)(1) of 
this section and shall be approved in advance by the Administrator.
    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) For the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence described in 
Sec. 86.1230-96, one of the following methods shall be used to 
precondition evaporative canisters during the soak period specified in 
paragraph (g) of this section. For vehicles with multiple canisters in a 
series configuration, the set of canisters must be preconditioned as a 
unit. For vehicles with multiple canisters in a parallel configuration, 
each canister must be preconditioned separately. In addition, for model 
year 1998 and later vehicles equipped with refueling canisters, these 
canisters shall be preconditioned for the supplemental two-diurnal test 
sequence according to the procedure in paragraph (j)(1) of this section. 
Canister emissions are measured to determine breakthrough. Breakthrough 
is here defined as the point at which the cumulative quantity of 
hydrocarbons emitted is equal to 2 grams.
    (1) Butane loading to breakthrough. The following procedure provides 
for emission measurement in an enclosure. Breakthrough may also be 
determined by measuring the weight gain of an auxiliary evaporative 
canister connected downstream of the vehicle's canister, in which case, 
the following references to the enclosure can be ignored. The auxiliary 
canister shall be well purged prior to loading. If production 
evaporative canisters are equipped with a functional service port 
designed for vapor load or purge steps, the service port shall be used 
during testing to precondition the canister.
    (i) Prepare the evaporative/refueling emission canister for the 
canister loading operation. The canister shall not be removed from the 
vehicle, unless access to the canister in its normal location is so 
restricted that purging and loading can only reasonably be accomplished 
by removing the canister from the vehicle. Special care shall be taken 
during this step to avoid damage to the components and the integrity of 
the fuel system. A replacement canister may be temporarily installed 
during the soak period while the canister from the test vehicle is 
preconditioned.
    (ii) The evaporative emission enclosure shall be purged for several 
minutes. Warning: If at any time the concentration of hydrocarbons, of 
methanol, or of methanol and hydrocarbons exceeds 15,000 ppm C the 
enclosure should be immediately purged. This concentration provides at 
least a 4:1 safety factor against the lean flammability limit.
    (iii) The FID hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and spanned 
immediately prior to the canister loading procedure.
    (iv) If not already on, the evaporative enclosure mixing fan shall 
be turned on at this time.
    (v) Place the vehicle in a sealed enclosure and measure emissions 
with a FID.
    (vi)(A) For gasoline-fueled vehicles, load the canister with a 
mixture composed of 50 percent butane and 50 percent nitrogen by volume 
at a rate of 40 grams butane per hour.
    (B) For methanol-fueled and flexible-fueled vehicles, canister 
preconditioning shall be performed with a fuel vapor composition 
representative of that which the vehicle would generate with the fuel 
mixture used for the current test. Manufacturers shall develop a 
procedure to precondition the evaporative canister, if the vehicle is so 
equipped, for the different fuel.
    (vii) As soon as the canister reaches breakthrough, the vapor source 
shall be shut off.

[[Page 178]]

    (viii) Reconnect the evaporative emission canister and restore the 
vehicle to its normal operating condition.
    (2) Load with repeated diurnal heat builds to breakthrough. The 
following procedure provides for emission measurement in an enclosure. 
Breakthrough may also be determined by measuring the weight gain of an 
auxiliary evaporative canister connected downstream of the vehicle's 
canister, in which case, the following references to the enclosure can 
be ignored. The auxiliary canister shall be well purged with dry air 
prior to loading.
    (i) The evaporative emission enclosure shall be purged for several 
minutes. Warning: If at any time the concentration of hydrocarbons, of 
methanol, or of methanol and hydrocarbons exceeds 15,000 ppm C the 
enclosure should be immediately purged. This concentration provides at 
least a 4:1 safety factor against the lean flammability limit.
    (ii) The FID hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and spanned 
immediately prior to the diurnal heat builds.
    (iii) If not already on, the evaporative enclosure mixing fan shall 
be turned on at this time.
    (iv) The fuel tank(s) of the prepared vehicle shall be drained and 
filled with test fuel, as specified in Sec. 86.1213, to the ``tank fuel 
volume'' defined in Sec. 86.082-2. The average temperature of the 
dispensed fuel shall be 60<plus-minus>12  deg.F (16<plus-minus>7 
deg.C). The fuel tank cap(s) shall be installed within 1 minute after 
refueling.
    (v) Within one hour of being refueled, the vehicle shall be placed, 
with the engine shut off, in the evaporative emission enclosure. The 
fuel tank temperature sensor shall be connected to the temperature 
recording system. A heat source, specified in Sec. 86.1207-90(d), shall 
be properly positioned with respect to the fuel tank(s) and connected to 
the temperature controller.
    (vi) The temperature recording system shall be started.
    (vii) The fuel may be artificially heated to the starting diurnal 
temperature.
    (viii) When the fuel temperature reaches at least 69  deg.F (21 
deg.C), immediately turn off purge blower (if not already off); close 
and seal enclosure doors; and initiate measurement of the hydrocarbon 
level in the enclosure.
    (ix) When the fuel temperature reaches 72<plus-minus>2  deg.F 
(22<plus-minus>1  deg.C), start the diurnal heat build.
    (x) The fuel shall be heated in such a way that its temperature 
change conforms to the following function to within <plus-minus>4  deg.F 
(<plus-minus>3  deg.C):
    F= T<INF>o</INF>+0.4t; or


for SI units,

    C=T<INF>o</INF>+(2/9)t.

Where,
F=fuel temperature,  deg.F;
C=fuel temperature,  deg.C;
t=time since beginning of test, minutes; and
T<INF>o</INF>=initial temperature in  deg.F (  deg.C for SI units).

    (xi) As soon as breakthrough occurs or when the fuel temperature 
reaches 96  deg.F (36  deg.C), whichever occurs first, the heat source 
shall be turned off, the enclosure doors shall be unsealed and opened, 
and the vehicle fuel tank cap(s) shall be removed. If breakthrough has 
not occurred by the time the fuel temperature reaches 96  deg.F (36 
deg.C), the heat source shall be removed from the vehicle, the vehicle 
shall be removed (with engine still off) from the evaporative emission 
enclosure and the entire procedure outlined in paragraph (j)(2) of this 
section shall be repeated until breakthrough occurs.
    (xii) After breakthrough occurs, the fuel tank(s) of the prepared 
vehicle shall be drained and filled with test fuel, as specified in 
Sec. 86.1213, to the ``tank fuel volume'' defined in Sec. 86.082-2. The 
fuel shall be stabilized to a temperature within 3  deg.F of the lab 
ambient before beginning the driving cycle for the dynamometer run.
    (k) The Administrator may conduct the vehicle preparation and 
preconditioning for measurement of fuel economy or exhaust emissions 
according to the procedures specified in Secs. 86.1232-90 and 86.1233-
90, in lieu of the procedures specified in this section.
    (l) Vehicles to be tested for exhaust emissions only shall be 
processed according to Secs. 86.1235 through 86.1237. Vehicles to be 
tested for evaporative emissions shall be processed in accordance with 
the procedures in Secs. 86.1233 through 86.1238, starting with 
Sec. 86.1235.
    (m) Vehicles to be tested for evaporative emissions with the 
supplemental

[[Page 179]]

two-diurnal test sequence described in Sec. 86.1230-96, shall proceed 
according to Secs. 86.1235 through 86.1237, followed by the supplemental 
hot soak test (see Sec. 86.1238-96(k)) and the supplemental diurnal 
emission test (see Sec. 86.1233-96(p)).

Sec. 86.1233-90  Diurnal breathing loss test.

    (a) Following vehicle preparation and vehicle preconditioning 
procedures described in Secs. 86.1231 and 86.1232, the diurnal test 
shall start not less than 10 or more than 35 hours after the end of the 
preconditioning procedure. The start of vehicle operation shall follow 
the end of the diurnal test within one hour.
    (b) The evaporative emissions enclosure shall be purged for several 
minutes immediately prior to the test.
    Note: If at any time the concentration of hydrocarbons, or of 
methanol, or of hydrocarbons and methanol exceeds 15,000 ppm C the 
enclosure should be immediately purged. This concentration provides a 
4:1 safety factor against the lean flammability limit.
    (c) The FID hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and spanned 
immediately prior to the test.
    (d) Impingers charged with known volumes of pure deionized water 
shall be placed in the methanol sampling system (methanol-fueled 
vehicles only).
    (e) If not already on, the evaporative enclosure mixing fan(s) shall 
be turned on at this time.
    (f) For vehicles with multiple tanks, the largest tank shall be 
designated as the primary tank and shall be heated in accordance with 
the procedures described in paragraph (m) of this section. All other 
tanks shall be designated as auxiliary tanks and shall undergo a similar 
heat build such that the fuel temperature shall be within 3  deg.F (1.6 
deg.C) of the primary tank.
    (g) Immediately prior to the diurnal breathing loss test, the fuel 
tank(s) of the prepared vehicle shall be drained and recharged with the 
specified test fuel as defined in Sec. 86.1213 to the prescribed ``tank 
fuel volume'', as defined in Sec. 86.078-2. The temperature of the fuel 
prior to its delivery to the fuel tank shall be between 45  deg.F and 60 
 deg.F (7.2  deg.C and 16  deg.C). The fuel tank cap(s) is not installed 
until the diurnal heat build begins.
    (h) The test vehicle, with the engine shut off, shall be moved into 
the evaporative emission enclosure, the test vehicle windows and any 
storage compartments shall be opened, the fuel tank temperature sensor 
shall be connected to the temperature recording system, and, if 
required, the heat source shall be properly positioned with respect to 
the fuel tank(s) and/or connected to the temperature controller.
    (i) The temperature recording system shall be started.
    (j) The fuel may be artificially heated to the starting diurnal 
temperature, 60  deg.F<plus-minus>2  deg.F (16  deg.C<plus-minus>1.1 
deg.C).
    (k) When the fuel temperature recording system reaches at least 58 
deg.F (14  deg.C), immediately:
    (1) Install fuel tank cap(s).
    (2) Turn off purge blowers, if not already off at this time.
    (3) Close and seal enclosure doors.
    (l) When the fuel temperature recording system reaches 60 
deg.F<plus-minus>2  deg.F (16  deg.C<plus-minus>1.1  deg.C) immediately:
    (1) Analyze enclosure atmosphere for hydrocarbons and record. This 
is the initial (time = 0 minutes) hydrocarbon concentration, 
C<INF>HCi</INF> (see Sec. 86.1243).
    (2) Simultaneously with initiation of the hydrocarbon analysis, 
initiate collection of the methanol sample by drawing a sample from the 
enclosure through the sampling system for four minutes. This is the 
initial methanol measurement from which methanol concentration 
C<INF>CH3OHi</INF> and mass are calculated. Remove impingers and replace 
with freshly charged clean impingers which will be used to collect the 
final methanol sample.
    (3) Record barometric pressure reading. This is the initial (time = 
0 minutes) barometric pressure, P<INF>bi</INF> (see Sec. 86.1243).
    (4) Record enclosure ambient temperature. This is the initial (time 
= 0 minutes) enclosure ambient temperature, T<INF>i</INF> (see 
Sec. 86.1243).
    (5) Start diurnal heat build and record time. This commences the 
60<plus-minus>2 minute test period.

[[Page 180]]

    (m) The fuel shall be heated in such a way that its temperature 
change conforms to the following function to within <plus-minus>3  deg.F 
(<plus-minus>1.6  deg.C):
    (1) F = T<INF>o</INF> + 0.4t
    (2) For SI units, C = T<INF>o</INF> + (2/9)t

Where:
F = fuel temperature,  deg.F.
C = fuel temperature,  deg.C.
t = heating time, minutes.
T<INF>o</INF> = initial temperature in  deg.F (or in  deg.C for SI 
units).

    After 60<plus-minus>2 minutes of heating, the fuel temperature rise 
shall be 240<plus-minus>1  deg.F (13.30<plus-minus>0.5  deg.C).
    (n) The FID hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and spanned 
immediately prior to the end of the diurnal test.
    (o)(1) The end of the diurnal breathing loss test occurs 
60<plus-minus>2 minutes after the heat build begins (paragraph (k)(4) of 
this section). Analyze the enclosure atmosphere for hydrocarbon and 
record. This is the final (time = 60 minutes) hydrocarbon concentration, 
C<INF>HCf</INF> (see Sec. 86.1234). The time (or elapsed time) of this 
analysis shall be recorded.
    (2) Simultaneously with the start of the hydrocarbon analysis, 
initiate collection of the methanol sample. Sample for four minutes. 
This is the final methanol sample.
    (3) Alternate method for methanol sampling. Since sample times of 
longer than four minutes may be necessary in order to collect an 
adequate and representative sample of methanol at the end of a test 
(when SHED concentrations are usually increasing rapidly), it may be 
necessary to rapidly collect the methanol sample in a bag and then 
bubble the bag sample through the impingers at the specified flow rate. 
The time elapsed between collection of the bag sample and flowing 
through the impingers should be minimized in order to prevent any 
losses. This alternative must be adopted if the four minute sample 
period is inadequate to collect a sample of sufficient concentration to 
allow accurate GC analysis.
    (4) Record barometric pressure reading. This is the final (time = 60 
minutes) barometric pressure, P<INF>bf</INF> (see Sec. 86.1243).
    (5) Record enclosure ambient temperature. This is the final (time = 
60 minutes) enclosure ambient temperature, T<INF>f</INF> (see 
Sec. 86.1243).
    (p) The heat source shall be turned off and the enclosure doors 
unsealed.
    (q) The heat source shall be moved away from the vehicle, if 
required, and/or disconnected from the temperature controller, the fuel 
tank temperature sensor shall be disconnected from the temperature 
recording system, and the test vehicle windows and any storage 
compartments may be closed. The vehicle shall be either driven or pushed 
out of the evaporative emission enclosure.

Sec. 86.1233-96  Diurnal emission test.

    (a)(1) The diurnal emission test for gasoline-, methanol- and 
gaseous-fueled vehicles consists of three 24-hour test cycles following 
the hot soak test. Emissions are measured for each 24-hour cycle, with 
the highest emission level used to determine compliance with the 
standards specified in subpart A of this part. The Administrator may 
truncate a test after any 24-hour cycle without affecting the validity 
of the collected data. Sampling of emissions from the running loss and 
hot soak tests is not required as preparation for the diurnal emission 
test. The diurnal emission test may be conducted as part of either the 
three-diurnal test sequence or the supplemental two-diurnal test 
sequence, as described in Sec. 86.1230-96.
    (2) For the full three-diurnal test sequence, the diurnal emission 
test outlined in paragraphs (b) through (o) of this section follows the 
high-temperature hot soak test concluded in Sec. 86.1238-96(j).
    (3) For the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence, the diurnal 
emission test outlined in paragraph (p) of this section follows the 
alternate hot soak test specified in Sec. 86.1238-96(k). This test is 
not required for gaseous-fueled vehicles.
    (b) The test vehicle shall be soaked for not less than 6 hours nor 
more than 36 hours between the end of the hot soak test and the start of 
the diurnal emission test. For at least the last 6 hours of this period, 
the vehicle shall be soaked at 72<plus-minus>3  deg.F. The temperature 
tolerance may be waived for up to 10

[[Page 181]]

minutes to allow purging of the enclosure or transporting the vehicle 
into the enclosure at the beginning of the diurnal emission test.
    (c) The test vehicle shall be exposed to ambient temperatures cycled 
according to the profile specified in Sec. 86.1233 and appendix II of 
this part.
    (1) Temperatures measured with the underbody temperature sensor 
shall follow the profile with a maximum deviation of 3  deg.F at any 
time and an average temperature deviation not to exceed 2  deg.F, where 
the average deviation is calculated using the absolute value of each 
measured deviation. In addition, the temperature from the sidewall 
temperature sensors shall follow the profile with a maximum deviation of 
5  deg.F at any time.
    (2) Ambient temperatures shall be measured at least every minute. 
Temperature cycling shall begin when time=0 minutes, as specified in 
paragraph (i)(5) of this section.
    (d) The diurnal enclosure shall be purged for several minutes prior 
to the test. Warning: If at any time the concentration of hydrocarbons, 
of methanol or of methanol and hydrocarbons exceeds 15,000 ppm C the 
enclosure should be immediately purged. This concentration provides at 
least a 4:1 safety factor against the lean flammability limit.
    (e) The test vehicle, with the engine shut off and the test vehicle 
windows and luggage compartment(s) opened, shall be moved into the 
diurnal enclosure.
    (f)-(g) [Reserved]
    (h) Prior to sampling for emissions and throughout the period of 
cycled ambient temperatures, the mixing fan(s) shall circulate the air 
at a rate of 0.8<plus-minus>0.2 cfm per cubic foot of ambient volume. 
The mixing fan(s), plus any additional fans if needed, shall also 
maintain a minimum wind speed of 5 mph (8 km/hr) under the fuel tank of 
the test vehicle. The Administrator may adjust fan speed and location to 
ensure sufficient air circulation around the fuel tank. The wind speed 
requirement may be satisfied by consistently using a fan configuration 
that has been demonstrated to maintain a broad 5-mph air flow in the 
vicinity of the vehicle's fuel tank, subject to verification by the 
Administrator.
    (i) Emission sampling may begin as follows:
    (1) The FID (or HFID) hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and 
spanned immediately prior to the sampling.
    (2) Impingers charged with known volumes of pure deionized water 
shall be placed in the methanol sampling system (methanol-fueled 
vehicles only).
    (3) Turn off purge blowers (if not already off).
    (4) Close and seal enclosure doors (if not already closed and 
sealed).
    (5) Within 10 minutes of closing and sealing the doors, analyze 
enclosure atmosphere for hydrocarbons and record. This is the initial 
(time=0 minutes) hydrocarbon concentration, C<INF>HCi</INF>, required in 
Sec. 86.1243. Hydrocarbon emissions may be sampled continuously during 
the test period.
    (6) Analyze the enclosure atmosphere for methanol, if applicable, 
and record. The methanol sampling must start simultaneously with the 
initiation of the hydrocarbon analysis and continue for 
4.0<plus-minus>0.5 minutes. This is the initial methanol concentration, 
C<INF>CH</INF>3<INF>OHi</INF>, required in Sec. 86.1243. Record the time 
elapsed during this analysis. If the 4-minute sample period is 
inadequate to collect a sample of sufficient concentration to allow 
accurate GC analysis, rapidly collect the methanol sample in a bag and 
then bubble the bag sample through the impingers at the specified flow 
rate. The time elapsed between collection of the bag sample and flow 
through the impingers should be minimized to prevent any losses. If the 
test is conducted in a fixed-volume enclosure that allows airflow into 
and out of the enclosure, the effect of makeup air dilution must be 
factored into the analysis.
    (j) If testing indicates that a vehicle design may result in fuel 
temperature responses during enclosure testing that are not 
representative of in-use summertime conditions, the Administrator may 
adjust air circulation and temperature during the test as needed to 
ensure that the test sufficiently duplicates the vehicle's in-use 
experience.
    (k) The FID (or HFID) hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and 
spanned

[[Page 182]]

immediately prior to the end of each emission sampling period.
    (l) Fresh impingers shall be installed in the methanol collection 
system immediately prior to the end of each emission measurement, if 
applicable.
    (m) The end of the first, second, and third emission sampling period 
shall occur 1440<plus-minus>6, 2880<plus-minus>6, 4320<plus-minus>6 
minutes, respectively, after the beginning of the initial sampling, as 
specified in paragraph (i)(5) of this section.
    (1) At the end of each emission sampling period, analyze the 
enclosure atmosphere for hydrocarbons and record. This is the final 
hydrocarbon concentration, C<INF>HCf</INF>, required in Sec. 86.1243. 
The emission measurement at the end of each period becomes the initial 
hydrocarbon concentration, C<INF>HCi</INF>, of the next emission 
sampling period.
    (2) Analyze the enclosure atmosphere for methanol, if applicable, 
and record. The methanol sampling must start simultaneously with the 
initiation of the hydrocarbon analysis and continue for 
4.0<plus-minus>0.5 minutes. This is the final (time=1440 minutes) 
methanol concentration, C<INF>CH</INF>3<INF>OHf</INF>, required in 
Sec. 86.1243. Record the time elapsed during this analysis. If the 4-
minute sample period is inadequate to collect a sample of sufficient 
concentration to allow accurate GC analysis, rapidly collect the 
methanol sample in a bag and then bubble the bag sample through the 
impingers at the specified flow rate. The time elapsed between 
collection of the bag sample and flow through the impingers should be 
minimized to prevent any losses. If the test is conducted in a fixed-
volume enclosure that allows airflow into and out of the enclosure, the 
effect of makeup air dilution must be factored into the analysis.
    (n) At the end of the temperature cycling period the enclosure doors 
shall be unsealed and opened, the test vehicle windows and luggage 
compartments may be closed and the test vehicle, with the engine shut 
off, shall be removed from the enclosure.
    (o) This completes the full three-diurnal evaporative emission test 
sequence described in Sec. 86.1230-96.
    (p) For the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence described in 
Sec. 86.1230-96, the following steps shall be performed in lieu of the 
steps described in paragraphs (b) through (n) of this section.
    (1) For the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence, the test vehicle 
shall be soaked for not less than 6 hours nor more than 36 hours between 
the end of the hot soak test described in Sec. 86.1238-96(k), and the 
start of the two-diurnal emission test. For at least the last 6 hours of 
this period, the vehicle shall be soaked at 72<plus-minus>3  deg.F.
    (2) The vehicle shall be tested for diurnal emissions according to 
the procedures specified in paragraphs (c) through (n) of this section, 
except that the test includes only two 24-hour periods. Therefore the 
end of the first and second emission sampling periods shall occur 
1440<plus-minus>6 and 2880<plus-minus>6 minutes, respectively, after the 
initial sampling.
    (3) This completes the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence for 
evaporative emission measurement.

Sec. 86.1234-96  Running loss test.

    (a) Overview. Gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles are to be 
tested for running loss emissions during simulated high-temperature 
urban driving; this test is not required for gaseous-fueled vehicles. 
During operation, tank temperatures are controlled according to a 
prescribed profile to simulate in-use conditions. If the vehicle is 
determined to have exceeded the standard before the end of the running 
loss test, the test may be terminated without invalidating the data. The 
test can be run either in a sealed enclosure or with the point-source 
method, as specified in paragraph (g) of this section. Measurement of 
vapor temperature is optional during the running loss test; however, if 
testing by the Administrator shows that a vehicle has exceeded an 
emission standard without measurement of vapor temperatures, the 
manufacturer may, utilizing its own resources, conduct subsequent 
testing on that vehicle to determine if the exceedance is attributable 
to inadequate control of vapor temperatures.
    (b) Driving schedule. Conduct the running loss test by operating the 
test vehicle through three driving schedules (see Sec. 86.1215 and 
appendix I of this

[[Page 183]]

part). Fifteen seconds after the engine starts, place the transmission 
in gear. Twenty seconds after the engine starts, begin the initial 
vehicle acceleration of the driving schedule. The transmission shall be 
operated according to the specifications of Sec. 86.1228 during the 
driving cycles.
    (c) Dynamometer operation. (1) The exhaust from the vehicle must be 
routed outside the test cell or enclosure. Exhaust gases may, but need 
not, be collected and sampled.
    (2) Provisions of Sec. 86.1235-85(c) shall apply.
    (3) Practice runs over the prescribed driving schedule may not be 
performed at test point.
    (4) Provisions of Sec. 86.1235-85 (e) and (f) shall apply.
    (5) If the dynamometer horsepower must be adjusted manually, it 
shall be set within 1 hour prior to the running loss test phase. The 
test vehicle shall not be used to make this adjustment. Dynamometers 
using automatic control of preselectable power settings may be set any 
time prior to the beginning of the emissions test.
    (6) Dynamometer roll or shaft revolutions shall be used to determine 
the actual driving distance for the running loss test, D<INF>RL</INF>, 
required in Sec. 86.1243. The revolutions shall be measured on the same 
roll or shaft used for measuring the vehicle's speed.
    (7) Provisions of Sec. 86.1235-85(i) shall apply.
    (8) The test run may be stopped if a warning light or gauge 
indicates that the vehicle's engine coolant has overheated.
    (d) Engine starting and restarting. (1) Provisions of Sec. 86.1236-
85(a) shall apply.
    (2) If the vehicle does not start after the manufacturer's 
recommended cranking time (or 10 continuous seconds in the absence of a 
manufacturer's recommendation), cranking shall cease for the period 
recommended by the manufacturer (or 10 seconds in the absence of a 
manufacturer's recommendation). This may be repeated for up to three 
start attempts. If the vehicle does not start after three attempts, the 
reason for failure to start shall be determined. If failure to start is 
an operational error, the vehicle shall be rescheduled for testing, 
starting with the soak period immediately preceding the running loss 
test.
    (3) If failure to start is caused by a vehicle malfunction, 
corrective action of less than 30 minutes duration may be taken 
(according to Sec. 86.090-25), and the test continued, provided that the 
ambient conditions to which the vehicle is exposed are maintained at 
95<plus-minus>5  deg.F (35<plus-minus>3  deg.C). When the engine starts, 
the timing sequence of the driving schedule shall begin. If failure to 
start is caused by vehicle malfunction and the vehicle cannot be 
started, the test shall be voided, the vehicle removed from the 
dynamometer, and corrective action may be taken according to 
Sec. 86.090-25. The reason for the malfunction (if determined) and the 
corrective action taken shall be reported to the Administrator.
    (4) Provisions of Sec. 86.1236-85(b) shall apply.
    (e) Pressure checks. No pressure checks of the evaporative system 
shall be allowed. Under no circumstances will any changes/repairs to the 
evaporative emissions control system be allowed.
    (f) Temperature stabilization. Immediately after the hot transient 
exhaust emission test, the vehicle shall be soaked in a temperature 
controlled area for a maximum of 6 hours until the fuel temperature is 
stabilized. The fuel may be heated or cooled to stabilize fuel 
temperatures, but the fuel heating rate must not exceed 5  deg.F in any 
1-hour interval during the soak period. A manufacturer may use a faster 
heating rate or a longer period for stabilizing fuel temperatures if the 
needed heating cannot be easily accomplished in the 6-hour period, 
subject to Administrator approval.
    (1) Fuel temperatures must be held at 95<plus-minus>3  deg.F for at 
least one hour before the start of the running loss test.
    (2) If a vehicle's fuel temperature profile has an initial 
temperature lower than 95  deg.F, as described in Sec. 86.1229-
85(d)(7)(v), the fuel in the test vehicle must be stabilized to within 3 
 deg.F of that temperature for at least one hour before the start of the 
running loss test.
    (g) Running loss test. The running loss test may be conducted either 
by the

[[Page 184]]

enclosure method, or by the point-source method.
    (1) Enclosure method. (i) The running loss enclosure shall be purged 
for several minutes immediately prior to the test. Warning: If at any 
time the concentration of hydrocarbons, of methanol, or of methanol and 
hydrocarbons exceeds 15,000 ppm C the enclosure should be immediately 
purged. This concentration provides at least a 4:1 safety factor against 
the lean flammability limit.
    (ii) The FID hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and spanned 
immediately prior to the test.
    (iii) If not already on, the running loss enclosure mixing fan(s) 
shall be turned on at this time. Throughout the test, the mixing fan(s) 
shall circulate the air at a rate of at least 1.0 cfm per cubic foot of 
ambient volume.
    (iv) The test vehicle, with the engine off, shall be moved onto the 
dynamometer in the running loss enclosure. The vehicle engine 
compartment cover shall be unlatched, but closed as much as possible, 
allowing for the air intake equipment specified in paragraph (g)(1)(vii) 
of this section. The vehicle engine compartment cover may be closed if 
alternate routing is found for the air intake equipment. Any windows, 
doors, and luggage compartments shall be closed. A window may be opened 
to direct cooling air into the passenger compartment of the vehicle, if 
the vehicle is not equipped with its own air conditioning.
    (v) Fans shall be positioned as described in Secs. 86.1207-96 (d) 
and (h).
    (vi) The vehicle air conditioning system (if so equipped) shall be 
set to the ``normal'' air conditioning mode and adjusted to the minimum 
discharge air temperature and high fan speed. Vehicles equipped with 
automatic temperature controlled air conditioning systems shall be set 
to operate in ``automatic'' temperature and fan modes with the system 
set at 72  deg.F.
    (vii) Connect the air intake equipment to the vehicle, if 
applicable. This connection shall be made to minimize leakage.
    (viii) The temperature and pressure recording systems shall be 
started. Measurement of vapor temperature is optional during the running 
loss test. If vapor temperature is not measured, fuel tank pressure need 
not be measured.
    (ix) Turn off purge blowers (if not already off).
    (x) The temperature of the liquid fuel shall be monitored and 
recorded at least every 15 seconds with the temperature recording system 
specified in Sec. 86.1207-96(e).
    (xi) Close and seal the enclosure doors.
    (xii) When the ambient temperature is 95<plus-minus>5  deg.F 
(35<plus-minus>3  deg.C) and the fuel has been stabilized according to 
paragraph (f) of this section, the running loss test may begin. Measure 
the initial ambient temperature and pressure.
    (A) Analyze enclosure atmosphere for hydrocarbons and record. This 
is the initial (time=0 minutes) hydrocarbon concentration, 
C<INF>HCi</INF>, required in Sec. 86.1243. Hydrocarbon emissions may be 
sampled continuously during the test period.
    (B) Analyze the enclosure atmosphere for methanol, if applicable, 
and record. The methanol sampling must start simultaneously with the 
initiation of the hydrocarbon analysis and continue for 
4.0<plus-minus>0.5 minutes. This is the initial (time=0 minutes) 
methanol concentration, C<INF>CH</INF>3<INF>OHi</INF>, required in 
Sec. 86.1243. Record the time elapsed during this analysis. If the 4-
minute sample period is inadequate to collect a sample of sufficient 
concentration to allow accurate GC analysis, rapidly collect the 
methanol sample in a bag and then bubble the bag sample through the 
impingers at the specified flow rate. The time elapsed between 
collection of the bag sample and flow through the impingers should be 
minimized to prevent any losses.
    (xiii) Start the engine and begin operation of the vehicle over the 
drive cycle specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (xiv) The ambient temperature shall be maintained at 95<plus-minus>5 
 deg.F (95<plus-minus>2  deg.F on average) during the running loss test, 
measured at the inlet to the cooling fan in front of the vehicle; it 
shall be recorded at least every 60 seconds.
    (xv) The fuel temperature during the dynamometer drive shall be 
controlled to match the fuel tank temperature

[[Page 185]]

profile determined in Sec. 86.1229. Measured fuel temperatures must be 
within <plus-minus>3  deg.F of the target profile throughout the test 
run. Vapor temperatures, if measured, must be within <plus-minus>5 
deg.F of the target profile during the first 4186 seconds of the running 
loss test, and within <plus-minus>3  deg.F for the remaining 120 seconds 
of the test run. For any vehicle complying with the test standards, 
vapor temperatures may be higher than the specified tolerances without 
invalidating test results. For testing by the Administrator, vapor 
temperatures may be lower than the specified tolerances without 
invalidating test results. If the test vehicle has more than one fuel 
tank, the temperatures for both fuel tanks shall follow the target 
profiles determined in Sec. 86.1229. The control system shall be tuned 
and operated to provide smooth and continuous tank temperature profiles 
that are representative of the on-road profiles.
    (xvi) Tank pressure shall not exceed 10 inches of water at any time 
during the running loss test unless a pressurized system is used and the 
manufacturer demonstrates that vapor would not be vented to the 
atmosphere upon fuel cap removal. A vehicle may exceed the pressure 
limit for temporary periods during the running loss test, up to 10 
percent of the total driving time, provided that the vehicle has 
demonstrated conformance with the pressure limit during the entire 
outdoor driving period specified in Sec. 86.1229. Measurement of fuel 
tank pressures will be considered valid only if vapor temperatures are 
measured and controlled to the tolerances specified in paragraph 
(g)(1)(xv) of this section.
    (xvii) The FID (or HFID) hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and 
spanned immediately prior the end of the test.
    (xviii) Fresh impingers shall be installed in the methanol 
collection system immediately prior to the end of the test, if 
applicable.
    (xix) The running loss test ends with the completion of the third 2-
minute idle period.
    (xx) At the end of the running loss test:
    (A) Analyze the enclosure atmosphere for hydrocarbons and record. 
This is the final hydrocarbon concentration, C<INF>HCf</INF>, required 
in Sec. 86.1243.
    (B) Analyze the enclosure atmosphere for methanol, if applicable, 
and record. The methanol sampling must start prior to the end of the 
test and continue for 4.0<plus-minus>0.5 minutes. The methanol sampling 
must be completed within 2 minutes after the end of the running loss 
test. This is the final methanol concentration, 
C<INF>CH</INF>3<INF>OHf</INF>, required in Sec. 86.1243. Record the time 
elapsed during this analysis. If the 4-minute sample period is 
inadequate to collect a sample of sufficient concentration to allow 
accurate GC analysis, rapidly collect the methanol sample in a bag and 
then bubble the bag sample through the impingers at the specified flow 
rate. The time elapsed between collection of the bag sample and flow 
through the impingers should be minimized to prevent any losses.
    (C) Turn off all the fans specified in Sec. 86.1207-96(d). Also, the 
time that the vehicle's engine compartment cover is open for removal of 
air intake equipment, if applicable, shall be minimized to avoid loss of 
heat from the engine compartment.
    (xxi) Turn off any CVS apparatus (if not already turned off).
    (2) Point-source method. (i) The test vehicle, with the engine off, 
shall be moved onto the dynamometer. The vehicle engine compartment 
cover and any windows, doors, and luggage compartments shall be closed.
    (ii) Fans shall be positioned as described in Secs. 86.1235-85(b) 
and 86.1207-96(d).
    (iii) The running loss vapor vent collection system shall be 
properly positioned at the potential fuel vapor vents or leaks of the 
vehicle's fuel system. Typical vapor vents for current fuel systems are 
the ports of the evaporative emission canister and the pressure relief 
vent of the fuel tank (typically integrated into the fuel tank cap).
    (iv) The running loss vapor vent collection system may be connected 
to a PDP-CVS or CFV-CVS bag collection system. Otherwise, running loss 
vapors shall be sampled continuously with analyzers meeting the 
requirements of Sec. 86.1207-96(b).
    (v) Fans shall be positioned as described in Sec. 86.1207-96(d).

[[Page 186]]

    (vi) The vehicle air conditioning system (if so equipped) shall be 
set to the ``normal'' air conditioning mode and adjusted to the minimum 
discharge air temperature and high fan speed. Vehicles equipped with 
automatic temperature controlled air conditioning systems shall be set 
to operate in ``automatic'' temperature and fan modes with the system 
set at 72  deg.F.
    (vii) The temperature and pressure recording systems shall be 
started. Measurement of vapor temperature is optional during the running 
loss test. If vapor temperature is not measured, fuel tank pressure need 
not be measured.
    (viii) The temperature of the liquid fuel shall be monitored and 
recorded at least every 15 seconds with the temperature recording system 
specified in Sec. 86.1207-96(e).
    (ix) When the ambient temperature is 95<plus-minus>5  deg.F 
(35<plus-minus>3  deg.C) and the fuel tank temperature is 
95<plus-minus>3  deg.F the running loss test may begin.
    (x) The ambient temperature shall be maintained at 95<plus-minus>5 
deg.F (95<plus-minus>2  deg.F on average) during the running loss test, 
measured at the inlet to the cooling fan in front of the vehicle; it 
shall be recorded at least every 60 seconds.
    (xi) Fuel temperatures shall be controlled according to the 
specifications of paragraph (g)(1)(xv) of this section.
    (xii) The tank pressure requirements described in paragraph 
(g)(1)(xvi) of this section apply also to running loss testing by the 
point source method.
    (xiii) The running loss test ends with completion of the third 2-
minute idle period.
    (xiv) If emissions are collected in bags, the sample bags must be 
analyzed within 20 minutes of their respective sample collection phases, 
as described in Sec. 86.137-94(b)(15). The results of the analysis are 
used in Sec. 86.1243 to calculate the mass of hydrocarbons emitted.
    (xv) At the end of the running loss test, turn off all the fans 
specified in Sec. 86.1207-96(d).
    (h) Following the completion of the running loss drive, the vehicle 
may be tested for hot soak emissions as specified in Sec. 86.1238-96.

Sec. 86.1235-85  Dynamometer procedure.

    (a) The dynamometer run consists of one HDV urban dynamometer 
driving schedule cycle starting within one hour after completion of the 
diurnal loss test. This run includes engine startup (with all 
accessories turned off) and operation over the driving schedule.
    (b) During dynamometer operation, one or more cooling fans shall be 
positioned so as to direct cooling air to the vehicle in an appropriate 
manner. The engine compartment cover shall be closed. If, however, the 
manufacturer can show that the engine compartment cover must be open to 
provide a test representative of field operation, the Administrator will 
allow the engine cover to be open. In the case of vehicles with front 
engine compartments, the fan(s) shall be squarely positioned within 12 
inches of the vehicle. In the case of vehicles with rear engine 
compartments (or if special designs make the above impractical), the 
cooling fan(s) shall be placed in a position to provide sufficient air 
to maintain vehicle cooling. The fan capacity shall normally not exceed 
10,600 (cfm (5.0 m<SUP>3/</SUP> s)). If, however, the manufacturer can 
show that during field operation the vehicle receives additional 
cooling, and that such additional cooling is needed to provide a 
representative test, the fan capacity may be increased or additional 
fans used.
    (c) The vehicle speed as measured from the dynamometer rolls shall 
be used.
    (d) Practice runs over the prescribed driving schedule may be 
performed at test points, provided emissions are not measured, for the 
purpose of finding the minimum throttle action to maintain the proper 
speed-time relationship, or to permit test procedure adjustments.
    Note: When using two-roll dynamometers a truer speed-time trace may 
be obtained by minimizing the rocking of the vehicle in the rolls. The 
rocking of the vehicle changes the tire rolling radius on each roll. 
This rocking

[[Page 187]]

may be minimized by restraining the vehicle horizontally (or nearly so) 
by using a cable and winch, or chain.
    (e) Drive wheel tires shall be inflated to the maximum gauge 
pressure recommended to the ultimate purchaser. If drive wheel tires 
have a maximum recommended inflation gauge pressure of less than 45 psi 
(310 kPa), they may be inflated up to a gauge pressure of 45 psi (310 
kPa) in order to prevent tire damage. The drive wheel tire pressure 
shall be recorded with the test results.
    (f) If the dynamometer has not been operated during the 2-hour 
period immediately preceding the test it shall be warmed up for 15 
minutes by operating at 30 mph (48 km/h) using a non-test vehicle or as 
recommended by the dynamometer manufacturer.
    (g) If the dynamometer horsepower must be adjusted manually, the 
power shall be set within 1 hour prior to dynamometer operation 
preceding the hot soak test. The test vehicle shall not be used to make 
the adjustment.
    (h) If the dynamometer horsepower is selected by automatic control, 
the power may be set anytime prior to the beginning of the driving 
cycle.
    (i) Multiple drive axle vehicles will be tested in one axle drive 
mode of operation. Full time multiple drive axle vehicles will have all 
but one axle temporarily disengaged by the vehicle manufacturer. 
Multiple drive axle vehicles which can be manually shifted to a one axle 
drive mode will be tested in the one axle drive mode of operation, 
unless this would pose a safety hazard, in which case all but one axle 
will be temporarily disengaged by the vehicle manufacturer.

Sec. 86.1235-96  Dynamometer procedure.

    Section 86.1235-96 includes text that specifies requirements that 
differ from Sec. 86.1235-85. Where a paragraph in Sec. 86.1235-85 is 
identical and applicable to Sec. 86.1235-96, this may be indicated by 
specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. 
For guidance see Sec. 86.1235-85.''
    (a) The dynamometer run consists of one dynamometer driving schedule 
cycle (see Sec. 86.1215 and appendix I of this part) starting not less 
than 12 nor more than 36 hours after completion of the drive specified 
in Sec. 86.1232-96. This run includes engine startup (with all 
accessories turned off) and operation over the driving schedule.
    (b) through (i) [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.1235-85.

Sec. 86.1236-85  Engine starting and restarting.

    (a) Starting. (1) The engine shall be started (including choke 
operation) according to the manufacturers recommended starting 
procedures in the owner's manual. The initial idle period shall begin 
when the engine starts.
    (2) The operator may use the choke, accelerator pedal, etc., where 
necessary to keep the engine running.
    (3) If the manufacturer's operating instructions in the owner's 
manual do not specify a warm engine starting procedure, the engine shall 
be started by depressing the accelerator pedal about half way and 
cranking the engine until it starts.
    (4) If the vehicle does not start after the manufacturer's 
recommended cranking time (or 10 continuous seconds in the absence of a 
manufacturer's recommendation), cranking shall cease for the period 
recommended by the manufacturer (or 10 seconds in the absence of a 
manufacturer's recommendation). This may be repeated for up to three 
start attempts. If the vehicle does not start after three attempts, the 
reason for failure to start shall be determined. If failure to start is 
an operational error, the vehicle shall be rescheduled for the 
dynamometer run. If failure to start is caused by a vehicle malfunction, 
corrective action of less than 30 minutes duration may be taken, and the 
test continued. When the engine starts, the driving schedule timing 
sequence shall begin. If failure to start is caused by vehicle 
malfunction and the vehicle cannot be started, the test shall be voided, 
the vehicle removed from the dynamometer, and corrective action may be 
taken. The reasons for the malfunction (if determined) and the 
corrective action taken shall be recorded.
    (b) Stalling. (1) If the engine stalls during an idle period, the 
engine shall be restarted immediately and the driving schedule 
continued. If the engine

[[Page 188]]

cannot be started soon enough to allow the vehicle to follow the next 
acceleration as prescribed, the driving schedule indicator shall be 
stopped. When the vehicle restarts, the driving schedule indicator shall 
be reactivated.
    (2) If the engine stalls during some operating mode other than idle, 
the driving schedule indicator shall be stopped, the vehicle shall then 
be restarted and accelerated to the speed required at that point in the 
driving schedule and the driving schedule continued. During acceleration 
to this point, shifting shall be performed in accordance with 
Sec. 86.1228-85.
    (3) If the vehicle will not restart within one minute, the test 
shall be voided, the vehicle removed from the dynamometer, corrective 
action taken, and the vehicle rescheduled for testing. The reason for 
the malfunction (if determined) and the corrective action taken shall be 
recorded.

Sec. 86.1238-90  Hot soak test.

    The one-hour hot-soak evaporative emission test shall be conducted 
immediately following one cycle of the dynamometer driving schedule.
    (a) Prior to the completion of the dynamometer cycle, the 
evaporative emission enclosure shall be purged for several minutes.
    (b) The FID hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and spanned 
immediately prior to the test.
    (c) Fresh impingers shall be installed in the methanol sample 
collection system immediately prior to the start of the test, if 
applicable.
    (d) If not already on, the evaporative enclosure mixing fan(s) shall 
be turned on at this time.
    (e) Upon completion of the dynamometer run the exhaust tube shall be 
disconnected from the vehicle tailpipe(s), the cooling fan(s) shall be 
moved, and the vehicle shall be disconnected from the dynamometer and 
driven at minimum throttle to the vehicle entrance of the enclosure.
    (f) The vehicle's engine must be stopped before any part of the 
vehicle enters the enclosure. The vehicle may be pushed or coasted into 
the enclosure.
    (g) The test vehicle windows and any storage compartments shall be 
opened, if not already open.

[[Page 189]]

    (h) The temperature recording system shall be started and the time 
of engine shut off shall be noted on the evaporative emissions 
hydrocarbon data recording system.
    (i) The enclosure doors shall be closed and sealed within two 
minutes of engine shutdown and within seven minutes after the end of the 
exhaust emission test. The steps after the end of the driving cycle 
should be done as quickly as possible to minimize the time needed to 
start the hot soak test.
    (j) The 60<plus-minus>0.5 minute hot soak begins when the enclosure 
doors are sealed. The enclosure atmosphere shall be analyzed and 
recorded. This is the initial (time = 0 minutes) hydrocarbon 
concentration, C<INF>HCi</INF>, for use in calculating evaporative 
losses (see Sec. 86.1243). The ``zero'' time methanol sample shall be 
collected starting at the same time as the hydrocarbon analysis is 
started. Sampling shall continue for four minutes.
    (k) The test vehicle shall be permitted to soak for a period of one 
hour in the enclosure.
    (l) The FID hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and spanned 
immediately prior to the end of the test.
    (m) Fresh impingers shall be installed in the methanol collection 
system immediately prior to the end of the test, if applicable.
    (n) At the end of the 60<plus-minus>0.5 minute test period, the 
enclosure atmosphere shall again be analyzed (as described in 
Sec. 86.1238-90(j) and the time recorded. This is the final (time = 60 
minutes) hydrocarbon concentration, C<INF>HCf</INF> and the final 
methanol level for use in calculating evaporative losses (see 
Sec. 86.1243). This operation completes the evaporative emission 
measurement procedure.
    (o) Alternate method for methanol sampling. Since sample times of 
longer than four minutes may be necessary in order to collect an 
adequate and representative sample of methanol at the end of a test 
(when SHED concentrations are usually increasing rapidly), it may be 
necessary to rapidly collect the methanol sample in a bag and then 
bubble the bag sample through the impingers at the specified flow rate. 
The time elapsed between collection of the bag sample and flowing 
through the impingers should be minimized in order to prevent any 
losses. This alternative must be adopted if the four minute sample 
period is inadequate to collect a sample of sufficient concentration to 
allow accurate GC analysis.

<R05>
Sec. 86.1238-96  Hot soak test.

    (a)(1) Gasoline- and methanol-fueled vehicles. For gasoline- and 
methanol-fueled vehicles, the hot soak test shall be conducted 
immediately following the running loss test. However, sampling of 
emissions from the running loss test is not required as preparation for 
the hot soak test.
    (2) Gaseous-fueled vehicles. Since gaseous-fueled vehicles are not 
required to perform a running loss test, the hot soak test shall be 
conducted within seven minutes after completion of the hot start exhaust 
test.
    (b) The hot soak test may be conducted in the running loss enclosure 
as a continuation of that test or in a separate enclosure.
    (1) If the hot soak test is conducted in the running loss enclosure, 
the driver may exit the enclosure after the running loss test. If 
exiting, the driver should use the personnel door described in 
Sec. 86.1207-96(a)(2), exiting as quickly as possible with a minimum 
disturbance to the system. The final hydrocarbon and methanol 
concentration for the running loss test, measured in Sec. 86.1234-
96(g)(1)(xx), shall be the initial hydrocarbon and methanol 
concentration (time=0 minutes) C<INF>HCi</INF> and 
C<INF>CH</INF>3<INF>OHi</INF>, for the hot soak test.
    (2) If the vehicle must be moved to a different enclosure, the 
following steps must be taken:
    (i) The enclosure for the hot soak test shall be purged for several 
minutes prior to completion of the running loss test. Warning: If at any 
time the concentration of hydrocarbons, of methanol, or of methanol and 
hydrocarbons exceeds 15,000 ppm C the enclosure should be immediately 
purged. This concentration provides at least a 4:1 safety factor against 
the lean flammability limit.

[[Page 190]]

    (ii) The FID hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and spanned 
immediately prior to the test.
    (iii) Fresh impingers shall be installed in the methanol sample 
collection system immediately prior to the start of the test, if 
applicable.
    (iv) If not already on, the mixing fan(s) shall be turned on at this 
time. Throughout the hot soak test, the mixing fan(s) shall circulate 
the air at a rate of 0.8<plus-minus>0.2 cfm per cubic foot of the 
nominal enclosure volume.
    (v) Begin sampling as follows:
    (A) Analyze the enclosure atmosphere for hydrocarbons and record. 
This is the initial (time = 0 minutes) hydrocarbon concentration, 
C<INF>HCi,</INF> required in Sec. 86.1243. Hydrocarbon emissions may be 
sampled continuously during the test period.
    (B) Analyze the enclosure atmosphere for methanol, if applicable, 
and record. The methanol sampling must start simultaneously with the 
initiation of the hydrocarbon analysis and continue for 
4.0<plus-minus>0.5 minutes. This is the initial (time=0 minutes) 
methanol concentration, C<INF>CH</INF>3<INF>OHi</INF>, required in 
Sec. 86.1243. Record the time elapsed during this analysis. If the 4-
minute sample period is inadequate to collect a sample of sufficient 
concentration to allow accurate GC analysis, rapidly collect the 
methanol sample in a bag and then bubble the bag sample through the 
impingers at the specified flow rate. The time elapsed between 
collection of the bag sample and flow through the impingers should be 
minimized to prevent any losses.
    (vi) The vehicle engine compartment cover shall be closed (if not 
already closed), the cooling fan shall be moved, the vehicle shall be 
disconnected from the dynamometer and any sampling system, and then 
driven at minimum throttle to the enclosure for the hot soak test. These 
steps should be done as quickly as possible to minimize the time needed 
to start the hot soak test.
    (vii) The vehicle's engine must be stopped before any part of the 
vehicle enters the enclosure.
    (viii) The vehicle shall enter the enclosure; the enclosure doors 
shall be closed and sealed within 2 minutes of engine shutdown and 
within seven minutes after the end of the running loss test.
    (ix) The test vehicle windows and any luggage compartments shall be 
opened (if not already open). The vehicle engine compartment cover shall 
be closed (if not already closed).
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) The temperature recording system shall be started and the time 
of engine shutoff shall be noted on the evaporative emission hydrocarbon 
data recording system.
    (e) For the first 5 minutes of the hot soak test, the ambient 
temperature shall be maintained at 95<plus-minus>10  deg.F. For the 
remainder of the hot soak test, the ambient temperature shall be 
maintained at 95<plus-minus>5  deg.F (95<plus-minus>2  deg.F on 
average).
    (f) The 60<plus-minus>0.5 minute hot soak begins when the enclosure 
doors are sealed (or when the running loss test ends, if the hot soak 
test is conducted in the running loss enclosure).
    (g) The FID (or HFID) hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and 
spanned immediately prior to the end of the test.
    (h) Fresh impingers shall be installed in the methanol collection 
system immediately prior to the end of the test, if applicable.
    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) At the end of the 60<plus-minus>0.5 minute test period:
    (1) Analyze the enclosure atmosphere for hydrocarbons and record. 
This is the final (time=60 minutes) hydrocarbon concentration, 
C<INF>HCf</INF>, required in Sec. 86.1243.
    (2) Analyze the enclosure atmosphere for methanol and record, if 
applicable. The methanol sampling must start simultaneously with the 
initiation of the hydrocarbon analysis and continue for 
4.0<plus-minus>0.5 minutes. This is the final (time=60 minutes) methanol 
concentration, C<INF>CH</INF>3<INF>OHf</INF>, required in Sec. 86.1243. 
Record the time elapsed during this analysis. If the 4-minute sample 
period is inadequate to collect a sample of sufficient concentration to 
allow accurate GC analysis, rapidly collect the methanol sample in a bag 
and then bubble the bag sample through the impingers at the specified 
flow rate. The time elapsed between collection of the bag sample and 
flow through the

[[Page 191]]

impingers should be minimized to prevent any losses.
    (k) For the supplemental two-diurnal test sequence (see 
Sec. 86.1230-96), the hot soak test described in Sec. 86.1238-90 shall 
be conducted immediately following the dynamometer run. This test 
requires ambient temperatures between 68 deg. and 86  deg.F at all 
times. The equipment and calibration specifications of Secs. 86.1207-90 
and 86.1207-90 may apply for this testing. Enclosures meeting the 
requirements of Secs. 86.1207-96 and 86.1217-96 may also be used. This 
hot soak test is followed by two consecutive diurnal heat builds, 
described in Sec. 86.1233-96(p).
    (l) If the vehicle is to be tested for diurnal emissions, follow the 
procedure outlined in Sec. 86.1233-96.

Sec. 86.1246-96  Fuel dispensing spitback procedure.

    (a) The vehicle is fueled at a rate of 10 gal/min to test for fuel 
spitback emissions. All liquid fuel spitback emissions that occur during 
the test are collected in a bag made of a material impermeable to 
hydrocarbons or methanol. The bag shall be designed and used so that 
liquid fuel does not spit back onto the vehicle body, adjacent floor, 
etc., and it must not impede the free flow of displaced gasoline vapor 
from the orifice of the filler pipe. The bag must be designed to permit 
passage of the dispensing nozzle through the bag. If the bag has been 
used for previous testing, sufficient time shall be allowed for the bag 
to dry out. The dispensing nozzle shall be a commercial model, not 
equipped with vapor recovery hardware.
    (b) Ambient temperature levels encountered by the test vehicle shall 
be not less than 68  deg.F nor more than 86  deg.F. The temperatures 
monitored during testing must be representative of those experienced by 
the test vehicle. The vehicle shall be approximately level during all 
phases of the test sequence to prevent abnormal fuel distribution.
    (c) Measure and record the mass of the bag to be used for collecting 
spitback emissions to the nearest 0.01 gram.
    (d) Drain the fuel tank(s) and fill with test fuel, as specified in 
Sec. 86.1213, to 10 percent of the reported nominal fuel tank capacity. 
The fuel cap(s) shall be installed immediately after refueling.
    (e) The vehicle shall be soaked at 80<plus-minus>6  deg.F 
(27<plus-minus>3  deg.C) for a minimum of six hours, then placed, either 
by being driven or pushed, on a dynamometer and operated through one 
dynamometer driving schedule (specified in Sec. 86.1215 and appendix I 
of this part). The test vehicle may not be used to set the dynamometer 
horsepower.
    (f) Following the preconditioning drive, the vehicle shall be moved 
or driven at minimum throttle to the refueling area.
    (g) All areas in proximity to the vehicle fuel fill orifice and the 
dispenser nozzle itself shall be completely dry of liquid fuel.
    (h) The fuel filler neck shall be snugly fitted with the vented bag 
to capture any fuel emissions. The fuel nozzle shall be inserted through 
the bag into the filler neck of the test vehicle to its maximum 
penetration. The plane of the nozzle's handle shall be perpendicular to 
the floor of the laboratory.
    (i) The fueling procedure consists of dispensing fuel through a 
nozzle, interrupted by a series of automatic shutoffs. A minimum of 3 
seconds shall elapse between any automatic shutoff and subsequent 
resumption of dispensing. Dispensing may not be manually terminated, 
unless the test vehicle has already clearly failed the test. The vehicle 
shall be fueled according to the following procedure:
    (1) The fueling operation shall be started within 4 minutes after 
the vehicle is turned off and within 8 minutes after completion of the 
preconditioning drive. The average temperature of the dispensed fuel 
shall be 65<plus-minus>5  deg.F (18<plus-minus>3  deg.C).
    (2) The fuel shall be dispensed at a rate of 9.8<plus-minus>0.3 
gallons/minute (37.1<plus-minus>1.1 l/min) until the automatic shutoff 
is activated.
    (3) If the automatic shutoff is activated before the nozzle has 
dispensed an amount of fuel equal to 70 percent of the tank's nominal 
capacity, the dispensing may be resumed at a reduced rate. Repeat as 
necessary until the nozzle has dispensed an amount of fuel equal to at 
least 70 percent of the tank's nominal capacity.
    (4) Once the automatic shutoff is activated after the nozzle has 
dispensed an amount of fuel equal to 70 percent of the tank's nominal 
capacity, the fuel shall be dispensed at a rate of 5<plus-minus>1 
gallons/minute (19<plus-minus>4 [ell]/min) for all subsequent 
dispensing. Dispensing shall be restarted two additional times.
    (5) If the nozzle has dispensed an amount of fuel less than 85 
percent of the tank's nominal capacity after the two additional 
dispensing restarts, dispensing shall be resumed, and shall

[[Page 197]]

continue through as many automatic shutoffs as necessary to achieve this 
level. This completes the fueling procedure.
    (j) Withdraw the nozzle from the vehicle and the bag, holding the 
tip of the nozzle upward to avoid any dripping into the bag.
    (k) Within 1 minute after completion of the fueling event, the bag 
shall be folded to minimize the vapor volume inside the bag. The bag 
shall be folded as quickly as possible to prevent evaporation of 
collected emissions.
    (l) Within 5 minutes after completion of the fueling event, the mass 
of the bag and its contents shall be measured and recorded (consistent 
with paragraph (c) of this section). The bag shall be weighed as quickly 
as possible to prevent evaporation of collected emissions.

Sec. 86.1306-07  Equipment required and specifications; overview.

    Section 86.1306-07 includes text that specifies requirements that 
differ from Sec. 86.1306-96. Where a paragraph in Sec. 86.1306-96 is 
identical and applicable to Sec. 86.1306-07, this may be indicated by 
specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. 
For guidance see Sec. 86.1306-96.''.
    (a) and (b) [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.1306-96.
    (c)(1) Upon request, the Administrator may allow a manufacturer to 
use some of the test equipment allowed for model year 2006 and earlier 
engines instead of the test equipment required for model year 2007 and 
later engines, provided that good engineering judgment indicates that it 
would not adversely affect determination of compliance with the 
applicable emission standards of this part.
    (2) A manufacturer may use the test equipment required for model 
year 2007 and later engines for earlier model year engines, provided 
that good engineering judgment indicates that it would not adversely 
affect determination of compliance with the applicable emission 
standards of this part.
    (d) Approval of alternate test system. (1) If on the basis of the 
information described in paragraph (d)(5) of this section, the 
Administrator determines that an alternate test system would 
consistently and reliably produce emission test results that are at 
least equivalent to the results produced using the test systems 
described in this subpart, he/she shall approve the alternate system for 
optional use instead of the test systems described in this subpart.
    (2) Any person may submit an application for approval of an 
alternate test system.
    (3) In approving an alternate test system, the Administrator may 
approve it for general use, or may approve it conditionally.
    (4) The Administrator may revoke the approval on the basis of new 
information that indicates that the alternate test system is not 
equivalent. However, revocation of approval must allow manufacturers 
sufficient lead-time to change the test system to an approved system. In 
determining the amount of lead-time that is required, the Administrator 
will consider relevant factors such as:
    (i) The ease with which the test system can be converted to an 
approved system.
    (ii) The degree to which the alternate system affects the measured 
emission rates.
    (iii) Any relevant conditions included in the approval.
    (5) The application for approval must include:
    (i) An explanation of the theoretical basis of the alternate system. 
This technical description should explain why the detection principle of 
the alternate system would provide equivalent results to the detection 
principle of the prescribed system for the full range of emission 
properties being measured. This description may include equations, 
figures, and references. For example, a NO<INF>X</INF> measurement 
application should theoretically relate the alternate detection 
principle to the chemiluminescent detection principle of detecting 
nitric oxide for a typical range of NO to NO<INF>2</INF> ratios. A PM 
measurement application should explain the principle(s) by which the 
alternate system quantifies PM mass independent of PM composition, and 
how it is impacted by semi-volatile and volatile species= phase 
distributions. For any proportioning or integrating system, the 
application should compare the alternate system's theoretical response 
to the prescribed system's response.
    (ii) A technical description of the alternate system. This section 
shall detail all of the hardware and software included in the alternate 
system. Dimensioned drawings, flow-charts, schematics, and component 
specifications shall be included. Any data manipulation (i.e. 
calculations) that the system performs shall be presented in this 
section.

[[Page 199]]

    (iii) A description of the procedures used to operate the system 
including the level of training that an operator must have to achieve 
acceptable results. This section of the application shall describe all 
of the installation, calibration, operation, and maintenance procedures 
in a step-by-step format. Note that empirical calibration with respect 
to another prescribed or approved measurement system is not acceptable. 
Calibration should be performed with NIST traceable standards, or 
equivalent national standards. Diagrams, schematics, and other graphics 
may be used to enhance the description.
    (iv) A comparison of results from the alternate system and from the 
prescribed system (or other system approved by the Administrator). The 
two systems must be calibrated independently to NIST traceable standards 
or equivalent national standards for this comparison. While other 
statistical analyses may be acceptable, it is recommended that the 
comparison be based on a minimum of 7 collocated and simultaneous tests. 
This comparison shall be performed over the ``hot-start'' portion of the 
FTP test cycle. If the comparison is paired, it must demonstrate that 
the alternate system passes a two-sided, paired t-test described in this 
paragraph. If the test is unpaired, it must demonstrate that the 
alternate system passes a two-sided, unpaired t-test described in this 
paragraph. Other statistical criteria may be set by the Administrator. 
The average of these tests for the reference system must return results 
less than or equal to the applicable emissions standard. The t-test is 
performed as follows, where ``n'' equals the number of tests:
    (A) Calculate the average of the alternate system results; this is 
A<INF>avg</INF>.
    (B) Calculate the average of the results of the system to which the 
alternate system was referenced; this is R<INF>avg</INF>.
    (C) For an unpaired comparison, calculate the ``n-1'' standard 
deviation for the alternate and reference averages; these are 
A<INF>sd</INF> and R<INF>sd</INF> respectively. A<INF>sd</INF> must be 
less than or equal to R<INF>sd</INF>. If A<INF>sd</INF> is greater than 
R<INF>sd</INF>, the Administrator will not approve the application.
    (D) For an unpaired comparison, calculate the t-value:


t<INF>unpaired</INF> = (A<INF>avg</INF>-R<INF>avg</INF>)/
((A<INF>sd</INF>\2\+R<INF>sd</INF>\2\)/n)<SUP>\1/2\</SUP>

    (E) For a paired comparison, calculate the ``n-1'' standard 
deviation (squared) of the differences, d<INF>i</INF>, between the 
paired results, where ``i'' represents the i\th\ test of n number of 
tests:


S<INF>D</INF>\2\ = (Sd<INF>i</INF>\2\- ((Sd<INF>i</INF>)\2\/n))/(n-1)

    (F)(1) For a paired comparison, calculate the t-value:


t<INF>paired</INF> = (A<INF>avg</INF>-R<INF>avg</INF>)/
(S<INF>D</INF>\2\/n)<SUP>\1/2\</SUP>

    (2) The absolute value of t must be less than the critical t value, 
t<INF>crit</INF> at a 90% confidence interval for ``n-1'' degrees of 
freedom. The following table lists 90% confidence interval 
t<INF>crit</INF> values for n-1 degrees of freedom:

diesel engines are tested identically with the exception of the systems 
used to measure hydrocarbon, nitrogen oxide, methanol, formaldehyde and 
particulate; petroleum-fueled diesel engines require a heated, 
continuous hydrocarbon detector and a continuous nitrogen oxide detector 
(Sec. 86.1310); methanol-fueled engines require a heated hydrocarbon 
detector, a methanol detector and a formaldehyde detector; either a 
heated or a non-heated continuous hydrocarbon detector may be used with

<R05>
Sec. 86.1306-96  Equipment required and specifications; overview.

    (a) Exhaust emission tests. All engines subject to this subpart are 
tested for exhaust emissions. Petroleum-, natural gas-, liquefied 
petroleum gas-, and methanol-fueled Otto-cycle and diesel engines are 
tested identically with two exceptions. First, the systems used to 
measure hydrocarbon, nitrogen oxide, methanol, formaldehyde and 
particulate depend on the type of engine being tested; petroleum-fueled 
diesel engines require a heated, continuous hydrocarbon detector and a 
heated, continuous nitrogen oxide detector (see Sec. 86.1310); methanol-
fueled engines require a heated hydrocarbon detector, a methanol 
detector and a formaldehyde detector; either a heated or non-heated 
continuous hydrocarbon detector may be used with natural gas-fueled and 
liquefied petroleum gas-fueled diesel engines; gasoline-fueled, natural 
gas- fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled Otto-
cycle engines are not tested for particulate emissions (see 
Sec. 86.1309). Second, if a gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled engine 
is to be used in a vehicle equipped with an evaporative canister, the 
test engine must have a loaded evaporative canister attached for the 
exhaust emission test. Necessary equipment and specifications appear in 
Secs. 86.1308, 86.1309, 86.1310 and 86.1311.
    (b) Fuel, analytical gas, and engine cycle specifications. Fuel 
specifications for exhaust emission testing are specified in 
Sec. 86.1313. Analytical gases are specified in Sec. 86.1314. The EPA 
heavy-duty transient engine cycles for use in exhaust testing are 
described in Sec. 86.1333 and specified in appendix I to this part.

<R05>
Sec. 86.1308-84  Dynamometer and engine equipment specifications.

    (a) Engine dynamometer. The engine dynamometer system must be 
capable of controlling engine torque and rpm simultaneously over 
transient cycles. The transient torque and rpm schedules described in 
Sec. 86.1333-84 and specified in appendix I ((f)(i), (2), and (3)) must 
be followed within the accuracy requirements specified in Sec. 86.1341-
84. In addition to these general requirements, the engine or dynamometer 
readout signals for speed and torque shall meet the following accuracy 
specifications:
    (1) Engine speed readout shall be accurate to within <plus-minus>2 
percent of the absolute standard value, as defined in paragraph (d) of 
this section.
    (2) Engine flywheel torque readout shall be accurate to either 
within <plus-minus>3 percent of the NBS ``true'' value torque (as 
defined in paragraph (e) of this section), or the following accuracies:
    (i) <plus-minus>2.5 ft-lbs. of the NBS ``true'' value if the full 
scale value is 550 ft-lbs. or less.
    (ii) <plus-minus>5 ft-lbs. of the NBS ``true'' value if the full 
scale value is 1050 ft-lbs. or less.
    (iii) <plus-minus>10 ft.-lbs., of the NBS ``true'' value if the full 
scale value is greater than 1050 ft.-lbs.
    (3) Option: Internal dynamometer signals (i.e., armature current, 
etc.) may be used for torque measurement provided that it can be shown 
that the engine flywheel torque during the test cycle conforms to the 
accuracy specifications in paragraph (a) of this section. Such a 
measurement system must include compensation for increased or decreased 
flywheel torque due to the armature inertia during accelerations and 
decelerations in the test cycle.
    (b) Cycle verification equipment. In order to verify that the test 
engine has followed the test cycle correctly, the dynamometer or engine 
readout signals for speed and torque must be collected

[[Page 201]]

in a manner that allows a statistical correlation between the actual 
engine performance and the test cycle (See Sec. 86.1341-84). Normally 
this collection process would involve conversion of analog dynamometer 
or engine signals into digital values for storage in a computer. The 
conversion of dynamometer or engine values (computer or other) that are 
used to evaluate the validity of engine performance in relation to the 
test cycle shall be performed in a manner such that:
    (1) Speed values used for cycle evaluation are accurate to within 2 
percent of the dynamometer or engine flywheel torque readout value.
    (2) Engine flywheel torque values used for cycle evaluation are 
accurate to within 2 percent of the dynamometer or engine flywheel 
torque readout value.
    (c) Option: For some systems it may be more convenient to combine 
the tolerances in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. This is 
permitted if the root mean square method (RMS) is used. The RMS values 
would then refer to accuracy in relationship to absolute standard or to 
NBS ``true'' values.
    (1) Speed values used for cycle evaluation shall be accurate to 
within <plus-minus>2.8 percent of the absolute standard values, as 
defined in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) Engine flywheel torque values used for cycle evaluation shall be 
accurate to within <plus-minus>3.6 percent of NBS ``true'' values, as 
determined in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (d) Speed calibration equipment. A 60-tooth (or greater) wheel in 
combination with a common mode rejection frequency counter is considered 
an absolute standard for engine or dynamometer speed.
    (e) Torque calibration equipment. Two techniques are allowed for 
torque calibration. Alternate techniques may be used if shown to yield 
equivalent accuracies. The NBS ``true'' value torque is defined as the 
torque calculated by taking the product of an NBS traceable weight or 
force and a sufficiently accurate horizontal lever arm distance, 
corrected for the hanging torque of the lever arm.
    (1) The lever-arm dead-weight technique involves the placement of 
known weights at a known horizontal distance from the center of rotation 
of the torque measuring device. The equipment required is:
    (i) Calibration weights. A minimum of six calibration weights for 
each range of torque measuring device used are required. The weights 
must be approximately equally spaced and each must be traceable to NBS 
weights. Laboratories located in foreign countries may certify 
calibration weights to local government bureau standards. Certification 
of weight by state government Bureau of Weights and Measures is 
acceptable. Effects of changes in gravitational constant at the test 
site may be accounted for if desired.
    (ii) Lever arm. A lever arm with a minimum length of 24 inches is 
required. The horizontal distance from the centerline of the engine 
torque measurement device to the point of weight application shall be 
accurate to within <plus-minus>0.10 inches. The arm must be balanced, or 
the hanging torque of the arm must be known to within <plus-minus>0.1 
ft-lbs.
    (2) The transfer technique involves the calibration of a master load 
cell (i.e., dynamometer case load cell). This calibration can be done 
with known calibration weights at known horizontal distances, or by 
using a hydraulically actuated precalibrated master load cell. This 
calibration is then transferred to the flywheel torque measuring device. 
The technique involves the following steps:
    (i) A master load cell shall be either precalibrated or be 
calibrated per paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section with known weights 
traceable to NBS, and used with the lever arm(s) specified in paragraph 
(e)(2)(ii) of this section. The dynamometer should be either running or 
vibrated during this calibration to minimize static hysteresis.
    (ii) A lever arm(s) with a minimum length of 24 inches is (are) 
required. The horizontal distances from the centerline of the master 
load cell, to the centerline of the dynamometer, and to the point of 
weight or force application shall be accurate to within <plus-minus>0.10 
inches. The arm(s) must be balanced or the net hanging torque of the 
arm(s) must be known to within <plus-minus>0.1 ft.-lbs.

[[Page 202]]

    (iii) Transfer of calibration from the case or master load cell to 
the flywheel torque measuring device shall be performed with the 
dynamometer operating at a constant speed. The flywheel torque 
measurement device readout shall be calibrated to the master load cell 
torque readout at a minimum of six loads approximately equally spaced 
across the full useful ranges of both measurement devices. (Note that 
good engineering practice requires that both devices have approximately 
equal useful ranges of torque measurement.) The transfer calibration 
shall be performed in a manner such that the accuracy requirements of 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section for the flywheel torque measurement 
device readout be met or exceeded.
    (3) Other techniques may be used if shown to yield equivalent 
accuracy.
    (f) Diesel engines only. If direct measurement of mass fuel 
consumption is chosen as an option in lieu of dilute exhaust 
CO<INF>2</INF> measurement, the fuel measurement device shall be 
accurate to within <plus-minus>2 percent of actual mass fuel flow.

Sec. 86.1309-90  Exhaust gas sampling system; Otto-cycle and 
non-petroleum-fueled engines.

    (a)(1) General. The exhaust gas sampling system described in this 
paragraph is designed to measure the true mass of gaseous emissions in 
the exhaust of either gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied 
petroleum gas-fueled or methanol-fueled engines. In the CVS concept of 
measuring mass emissions, two conditions must be satisfied; the total 
volume of the mixture of exhaust and dilution air must be measured, and 
a continuously proportioned volume of sample must be collected for 
analysis. Mass emissions are determined from the sample concentration 
and total flow over the test period.
    (2) Engine exhaust to CVS duct. For methanol-fueled engines, 
reactions of the exhaust gases in the exhaust duct connected to the 
dilution tunnel (for the purposes of this paragraph, the exhaust duct 
excludes the length of pipe representative of the vehicle exhaust pipe) 
shall be minimized. This may be accomplished by:
    (i) Using a duct of unrestricted length maintained at a temperature 
below 599  deg.F (315  deg.C). (Cooling capabilities as required); or
    (ii) Using a smooth wall duct less than five feet long with no 
required heating (a maximum of two short flexible connectors are allowed 
under this option); or
    (iii) Omitting the duct and performing the exhaust gas dilution 
function at the engine exhaust manifold, immediately after exhaust 
aftertreatment systems, or after a length of pipe representative of the 
vehicle exhaust pipe; or
    (iv) Partial dilution of the exhaust gas prior to entering the 
dilution tunnel, which lowers the duct temperature below 599  deg.F (315 
 deg.C).
    (3) Positive displacement pump. The Positive Displacement Pump 
Constant Volume Sampler (PDP-CVS), Figure N90-1 satisfies the first 
condition by metering at a constant temperature and pressure through the 
pump. The total volume is measured by counting the revolutions made by 
the calibrated positive displacement pump. The proportional samples for 
the bag sample, the methanol sample (Figure N90-2), and the formaldehyde 
sample (Figure N90-3), as applicable are achieved by sampling at a 
constant flow rate. For methanol-fueled engines, the sample lines for 
the methanol and formaldehyde samples are heated to prevent 
condensation. (Note: For 1990 through 1994 model year methanol-fueled 
engines, methanol and formaldehyde sampling may be omitted provided the 
bag sample (hydrocarbons and methanol) is analyzed using a HFID 
calibrated with methanol.)

    (4) Critical flow venturi. The operation of the Critical Flow 
Venturi Constant Volume Sampler (CFV-CVS), Figure N90-4 is based upon 
the principles of fluid dynamics associated with critical flow. The CFV 
system is commonly called a constant volume system (CVS) even though the 
flow varies. It would

[[Page 206]]

be more proper to call the critical flow venturi (CFV) system a constant 
proportion sampling system since proportional sampling throughout 
temperature excursions is maintained by use of a small CFVs in the 
sample lines. For engines requiring measurement of methanol and/or 
formaldehyde, one line supplies sample for the bag sample, another line 
supplies sample for the methanol sample, and a third line supplies 
sample for the formaldehyde sample. The lines for the methanol and 
formaldehyde samples are heated to prevent condensation with care being 
taken to ensure that the CFVs of the sample probes are not heated. 
(Note: For 1990 through 1994 model year methanol-fueled engines, 
methanol and formaldehyde sampling may be omitted provided the bag 
sample (hydrocarbons and methanol) is analyzed using a HFID calibrated 
with methanol. The variable mixture flow rate is maintained at choked 
flow, which is inversely proportional to the square root of the gas 
temperature, and is computed continuously. Since the pressure and 
temperature are the same at all venturi inlets, the sample volume is 
proportional to the total volume.)

[[Page 207]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.190

    (5) Electronic Flow Control. The Electronic Flow Control Critical 
Flow Venturi Constant Volume Sampler (EFC-CFV-CVS) is identical to the 
CFV-CVS system, except that it uses electronic mass flow meters to 
maintain proportional sampling for methanol and

[[Page 208]]

formaldehyde. The flow rate of the exhaust plus dilution air and the 
sample flow rate are measured electronically. Proportionality is 
maintained by electronically controlled metering valves in the methanol 
and formaldehyde sample lines. Control of the valves is based on the 
electronic response of the flow meters. It is recommended that total 
flow sample volumes be measured by separate flow meters. For methanol-
fueled engines, one line supplies sample for the bag sample, another 
line supplies sample for the methanol sample, and a third line supplies 
sample for the formaldehyde sample. The sample lines for methanol and 
for formaldehyde may both draw samples from a single static probe. The 
lines for the methanol and formaldehyde samples are heated to prevent 
condensation.
    (6) Other systems. Other sampling and/or analytical systems 
including the systems described in Sec. 86.1310 for petroleum-fueled 
diesel engines may be used if shown to yield equivalent results, and if 
approved in advance by the Administrator.
    (7) Since various configurations can produce equivalent results, 
exact conformance with these drawings is not required. Additional 
components such as instruments, valves, solenoids, pumps and switches 
may be used to provide additional information and coordinate the 
functions of the component systems. Other components such as snubbers, 
which are not needed to maintain accuracy on some systems, may be 
excluded if their exclusion is based upon good engineering judgment.
    (b) Component description, PDP-CVS. The PDP-CVS, Figure N90-1, 
consists of a dilution air filter and mixing assembly, heat exchanger, 
positive displacement pump, sampling systems (see Figure N90-2 for 
methanol sampling system and Figure N90-3 for formaldehyde sampling 
system) including sampling lines which are heated to prevent 
condensation in the case of the methanol-fueled engine, and associated 
valves, pressure and temperature sensors. The temperature of the sample 
lines shall be more than 5  deg.F (3  deg.C) above the maximum dew point 
of the mixture and less than 250  deg.F (121  deg.C). (It is recommended 
the they be maintained at 235<plus-minus> 15  deg.F (113 <plus-minus>8 
deg.C)). Heating of the sample lines may be omitted, provided the 
methanol and formaldehyde sample collection systems are close coupled to 
the probes thereby preventing loss of sample due to cooling and 
resulting condensation in the sample lines. The PDP-CVS shall conform to 
the following requirements:
    (1) Exhaust system backpressure must not be artificially lowered by 
the CVS or dilution air inlet system. Measurements to verify this should 
be made in the raw exhaust immediately upstream of the inlet to the CVS. 
(For diesel engines, this measurement should be made immediately 
upstream of the backpressure set device.) This verification requires the 
continuous measurement and comparison of raw exhaust static pressure 
observed during a transient cycle, both with and without the operating 
CVS. Static pressure measured with the operating CVS system shall remain 
within <plus-minus>5 inches of water (1.2 kPa) of the static pressure 
measured without connection to the CVS, at identical moments in the test 
cycle. (Sampling systems capable of maintaining the static pressure to 
within <plus-minus>1 inch of water (0.25 kPa) will be used by the 
Administrator if a written request substantiates the need for this 
closer tolerance.) This requirement is essentially a design 
specification for the CVS/dilution air inlet system, and should be 
performed as often as good engineering practice dictates (e.g., after 
installation of an uncharacterized CVS, addition of an unknown inlet 
restriction on the dilution air, etc.).
    (2) The gas mixture temperature, measured at a point immediately 
ahead of the positive displacement pump and after the heat exchanger, 
shall be maintained within <plus-minus>10  deg.F (<plus-minus>5.6 
deg.C) of the average operating temperature observed during the test. 
(The average operating temperature may be estimated from the average 
operating temperature from similar tests.) The temperature measuring 
system (sensors and readout) shall have an accuracy and precision of 
<plus-minus>3.4  deg.F (1.9  deg.C).
    (3) The pressure gauges shall have an accuracy and precision of 
<plus-minus>3 mm Hg (0.4 kPa).
    (4) The flow capacity of the CVS shall be large enough to eliminate 
water

[[Page 209]]

condensation in the system. This is especially critical for methanol-
fueled engines and may also be of concern with natural gas- and 
liquefied petroleum gas-fueled engines; see ``Calculation of Emissions 
and Fuel Economy When Using Alternative Fuels,'' EPA 460/3-83-009. 
Dehumidifying the dilution air before entering the CVS is allowed. 
Heating is also allowed, provided:
    (i) The air (or air plus exhaust gas) temperature does not exceed 
250  deg.F, or 125  deg.F if particulate emissions are measured;
    (ii) Calculation of the CVS flow rate necessary to prevent water 
condensation is based on the lowest temperature encountered in the CVS 
prior to sampling. (It is recommended that the CVS system be insulated 
when heated dilution air is used.);
    (iii) The dilution ratio is sufficiently high to prevent 
condensation in bag samples as they cool to room temperature.
    (5) Sample collection bags for dilution air and exhaust samples 
shall be of sufficient size so as not to impede sample flow. A single 
dilution air sample, covering the total test period, may be collected 
for the determination of methanol and formaldehyde background (where 
applicable).
    (6) The methanol sample collection system and the formaldehyde 
sample collection system shall each be of sufficient capacity so as to 
collect samples of adequate size for analysis without significant impact 
on the volume of dilute exhaust passing through the PDP. The systems 
shall also comply with the following requirements that apply to the 
design of the systems, not to individual tests:
    (i) The methanol system shall be designed such that, if a test 
engine emitted the maximum allowable level of methanol (based on all 
applicable standards) during the first phase of the test, the measured 
concentration in the primary impinger would exceed either 25 mg/l or a 
concentration equal to 25 times the limit of detection for the GC 
analyzer.
    (ii) The formaldehyde system shall be designed such that, if a test 
engine emitted formaldehyde at a rate equal to twenty percent of the 
maximum allowable level of THCE (i.e., 0.2 g/Bhp-hr for a 1.1 g/Bhp-hr 
THCE standard), or the maximum formaldehyde level allowed by a specific 
formaldehyde standard, whichever is less, during the first phase of the 
test, the concentration of formaldehyde in the DNPH solution of the 
primary impinger, or solution resulting from the extraction of the DNPH 
cartridge, shall exceed either 2.5 mg/l or a concentration equal to 25 
times the limit of detection for the HPLC analyzer.
    (iii) The methanol and formaldehyde systems shall be designed such 
that the primary impinger collects at least 90 percent of the analyte in 
the samples. The remaining analyte shall be collected by the secondary 
impinger. Sampling systems shall be identical for all phases.
    (c) Component description, CFV. The CFV sample system, Figure N90-4, 
consists of a dilution air filter (optional) and mixing assembly, 
cyclone particulate separator (optional), unheated sampling venturies 
for the bag, methanol and formaldehyde samples, as applicable, heated 
sample lines to prevent condensation in the case of the methanol-fueled 
engine, critical flow venturi, and associated valves, pressure and 
temperature sensors. The temperature of the sample lines shall be more 
than 5  deg.F (3  deg.C) above the maximum dew point of the mixture and 
less than 250  deg.F (121  deg.C). (It is recommended the they be 
maintained at 235 <plus-minus>15  deg.F (113 <plus-minus> 8  deg.C)). 
Heating of the sample lines may be omitted, provided the methanol and 
formaldehyde sample collection systems are close coupled to the probes 
thereby preventing loss of sample due to cooling and resulting 
condensation in the sample lines. The CFV sample system shall conform to 
the following requirements:
    (1) Static pressure variations in the raw exhaust shall conform to 
the specifications detailed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (2) The temperature measuring system (sensors and readout) shall 
have an accuracy and precision of <plus-minus>3.4  deg.F 
(<plus-minus>1.9  deg.C). The temperature measuring system used in a CVS 
without a heat exchanger shall have a response time of 1.50 seconds to 
62.5 percent of a temperature change (as measured in hot silicone oil). 
There is no response time

[[Page 210]]

requirement for a CVS equipped with a heat exchanger.
    (3) The pressure measuring system (sensors and readout) shall have 
an accuracy and precision of <plus-minus>3 mm Hg (0.4 kPa).
    (4) The flow capacity of the CVS shall be large enough to eliminate 
water condensation in the system. This is especially critical for 
methanol-fueled engines and may also be of concern with natural gas- and 
liquefied petroleum gas-fueled engines; see ``Calculation of Emissions 
and Fuel Economy When Using Alternative Fuels,'' EPA 460/3-83-009. 
Dehumidifying the dilution air before entering the CVS is allowed. 
Heating is also allowed, provided:
    (i) The air (or air plus exhaust gas) temperature does not exceed 
250  deg.F, or 125  deg.F if particulate emissions are measured.
    (ii) Calculation of the CVS flow rate necessary to prevent water 
condensation is based on the lowest temperature encountered in the CVS 
prior to sampling. (It is recommended that the CVS system be insulated 
when heated dilution air is used.)
    (iii) The dilution ratio is sufficiently high to prevent 
condensation in bag samples as they cool to room temperature.
    (5) Sample collection bags for dilution air and exhaust samples 
shall be of sufficient size so as not to impede sample flow. A single 
dilution air sample, covering the total test period, may be collected 
for the determination of methanol and formaldehyde background (where 
applicable).
    (6) The methanol sample collection system and the formaldehyde 
sample collection system shall each be of sufficient capacity so as to 
collect samples of adequate size for analysis without significant impact 
on the volume of dilute exhaust passing through the CFV. The systems 
shall also comply with the following requirements that apply to the 
design of the systems, not to individual tests:
    (i) The methanol system shall be designed such that, if a test 
engine emitted the maximum allowable level of methanol (based on all 
applicable standards) during the first phase of the test, the measured 
concentration in the primary impinger would exceed either 25 mg/l or a 
concentration equal to 25 times the limit of detection for the GC 
analyzer.
    (ii) The formaldehyde system shall be designed such that, if a test 
engine emitted formaldehyde at a rate equal to twenty percent of the 
maximum allowable level of THCE (i.e., 0.2 g/Bhp-hr for a 1.1 g/Bhp-hr 
THCE standard), or the maximum formaldehyde level allowed by a specific 
formaldehyde standard, whichever is less, during the first phase of the 
test, the concentration of formaldehyde in the DNPH solution of the 
primary impinger, or solution resulting from the extraction of the DNPH 
cartridge, shall exceed either 2.5 mg/l or a concentration equal to 25 
times the limit of detection for the HPLC analyzer.
    (iii) The methanol and formaldehyde systems shall be designed such 
that the primary impinger collects at least 90 percent of the analyte in 
the samples. The remaining analyte shall be collected by the secondary 
impinger. Sampling systems shall be identical for all phases of the 
test.
    (d) Component description, EFC-CFV. The EFC-CFV sample system, is 
identical to the CFV system described in paragraph (c) of this section, 
with the addition of electronic flow controllers, metering valves, 
separate flow meters to totalize sample flow volumes (optional), for 
methanol and formaldehyde samples. Both samples may be drawn from a 
single static probe. The EFC sample system shall conform to the 
following requirements:
    (1) All of the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) The ratio of sample flow to CVS flow must not vary by more 
<plus-minus>5 percent from the setpoint of the test.
    (3) The sample flow totalizers shall meet the accuracy 
specifications of Sec. 86.1320. Total sample flow volumes may be 
obtained from the flow controllers, with advance approval of the 
Administrator, provided that they can be shown to meet the accuracy 
specifications of Sec. 86.1320.

Sec. 86.1310-90  Exhaust gas sampling and analytical system; diesel engines.

    (a) General. The exhaust gas sampling system described in this 
paragraph is designed to measure the true mass of both gaseous and 
particulate emissions in the exhaust of petroleum-fueled, natural gas-
fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled heavy-duty 
diesel engines. This system utilizes the CVS concept (described in 
Sec. 86.1309) of measuring the combined mass emissions of HC, 
CH<INF>3</INF>OH and HCHO from methanol-fueled engines and CO, 
CO<INF>2</INF> and particulate from all fuel types. A continuously 
integrated system is required for THC (petroleum-fueled, natural gas-
fueled, and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled engines) and NO<INF>X</INF> 
(all engines) measurement, and is allowed for all CO and CO<INF>2</INF> 
measurements plus the combined emissions of CH<INF>3</INF>OH, HCHO, and 
HC from methanol-fueled engines. Where applicable, separate sampling 
systems are required for methanol and for formaldehyde. The mass of 
gaseous emissions is determined from the sample concentration and total 
flow over the test period. The mass of particulate emissions is 
determined from a proportional mass sample collected on a filter and 
from the sample flow and total flow over the test period. As an option, 
the measurement of total fuel mass consumed over a cycle may be 
substituted for the exhaust measurement of CO<INF>2</INF>. General 
requirements are as follows:
    (1) This sampling system requires the use of a PDP-CVS and a heat 
exchanger, a CFV-CVS (or an EFC-CFV-CVS) with either a heat exchanger or 
electronic flow compensation. Figure N90-5 is a schematic drawing of the 
PDP system. Figure N90-6 is a schematic drawing of the CFV-CVS system.

    (2) The HC analytical system for petroleum-fueled diesel engines 
requires a heated flame ionization detector (HFID) and heated sample 
system (375 <plus-minus>20  deg.F (191 <plus-minus>11  deg.C)). For 
natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled diesel engines 
either a heated flame ionization detector and heated sample system as 
required for petroleum fuel or a non-heated flame ionization detector 
may be used.
    (3) Methanol-fueled engines require the use of a heated flame 
ionization detector (HFID) (235 deg.<plus-minus>15  deg.F 
(113 deg.<plus-minus>8  deg.C)) for hydrocarbon analysis. With a heated 
FID, the hydrocarbon analysis can be made on the bag sample and the 
methanol and formaldehyde analyses are

[[Page 214]]

performed on the samples collected for these purposes (Figures N90-2 and 
N90-3).
    Note: For 1990 through 1994 model year methanol-fueled engines, 
methanol and formaldehyde sampling may be omitted provided the 
hydrocarbon plus methanol analyses are performed using a FID calibrated 
on methanol.
    (4) For methanol-fueled engines, cooling or reaction of the exhaust 
gases in the exhaust duct connected to the dilution tunnel (for the 
purposes of this paragraph, the exhaust duct excludes the length of pipe 
representative of the vehicle exhaust pipe) shall be minimized. This may 
be accomplished by:
    (i) Using a duct of unrestricted length maintained at a temperature 
below 599  deg.F (315  deg.C). (Heating and possibly cooling 
capabilities as required); or
    (ii) Using a smooth wall duct less than five feet long with no 
required heating (a maximum of two short flexible connectors are allowed 
under this option); or
    (iii) Omitting the duct and performing the exhaust gas dilution 
function at the engine exhaust manifold or immediately after exhaust 
aftertreatment systems, or after a length of pipe representative of the 
vehicle exhaust pipe; or
    (iv) Partial dilution of the exhaust gas prior to entering the 
dilution tunnel, which lowers the duct temperature below 599  deg.F (315 
 deg.C).
    (5) Heated sample lines are required for the methanol and 
formaldehyde samples (care must be taken to prevent heating of the 
sample probes unless compensation for varying flow rate is made). The 
sample collection lines shall be heated to a temperature more than 5 
deg.F (3  deg.C) above the maximum dew point of the mixture, but below 
250  deg.F (121  deg.C).
    (6) The CO and CO<INF>2</INF> analytical system requires:
    (i) Bag sampling (Sec. 86.1309) and analytical (Sec. 86.1311) 
capabilities, as shown in Figure N90-5 (or Figure N90-6), or
    (ii) Continuously integrated measurement of diluted CO and 
CO<INF>2</INF> meeting the minimum requirements and technical 
specifications contained in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. Unless 
compensation for varying flow is made, a constant flow system must be 
used to ensure a representative sample.
    (7) The NO<INF>X</INF> analytical system requires a continuously 
integrated measurement of diluted NO<INF>X</INF> meeting the minimum 
requirements and technical specifications contained in paragraph (b)(5) 
of this section. Unless compensation for varying flow is made, a 
constant flow system must be used to ensure a representative sample.
    (8) The mass of particulate in the exhaust is determined via 
filtration. The particulate sampling system requires dilution of the 
exhaust in either one or two steps to a temperature never greater than 
125  deg.F (51.7  deg.C) at the primary sample filter. A backup filter 
provides a confirmation of sufficient filtering efficiency.
    (9) Since various configurations can produce equivalent results, 
exact conformance with these drawings is not required. Additional 
components such as instruments, valves, solenoids, pumps, and switches 
may be used to provide additional information and coordinate the 
functions of the component systems. Other components, such as snubbers, 
which are not needed to maintain accuracy on some systems, may be 
excluded if their exclusion is based upon good engineering judgment.
    (10) Other sampling and/or analytical systems may be used if shown 
to yield equivalent results and if approved in advance by the 
Administrator.
    (b) Component description. The components necessary for exhaust 
sampling shall meet the following requirements:
    (1) Exhaust dilution system. The PDP-CVS shall conform to all of the 
requirements listed for the exhaust gas PDP-CVS in Sec. 86.1309(b). The 
CFV-CVS shall conform to all of the requirements listed for the exhaust 
gas CFV-CVS in Sec. 86.1309(c). The EFC-CFV-CVS shall conform to all of 
the requirements listed for the exhaust gas EFC-CVS in Sec. 86.1309(d). 
In addition, the CFV-CVS and EFC-CFV-CVS must conform to the following 
requirements:
    (i) The flow capacity of the CVS must be sufficient to maintain the 
diluted exhaust stream at or below the temperatures required for the 
measurement of particulate and hydrocarbon emission noted below and at, 
or above, the temperatures where condensation

[[Page 215]]

of water in the exhaust gases could occur. This may be achieved by 
either of the following two methods:
    (A) Single-dilution method. The flow capacity of the CVS must be 
sufficient to maintain the diluted exhaust stream at a temperature of 
125  deg.F (51.7  deg.C) or less, at the sampling zone in the primary 
dilution tunnel and as required to prevent condensation at any point in 
the dilution tunnel. Direct sampling of the particulate material may 
then take place (Figure N90-5).
    (B) Double-dilution method. The flow capacity of the CVS must be 
sufficient to maintain the diluted exhaust stream in the primary 
dilution tunnel at a temperature of 375  deg.F (191  deg.C) (250  deg.F 
(121  deg.C) for methanol fueled engines) or less at the sampling zone 
and as required to prevent condensation at any point in the dilution 
tunnel. Gaseous emission samples may be taken directly from this 
sampling point. An exhaust sample must then be taken at this point to be 
diluted a second time for use in determining particulate emissions. The 
secondary dilution system must provide sufficient secondary dilution air 
to maintain the double-diluted exhaust stream at a temperature of 125 
deg.F (51.7  deg.C) or less immediately before the primary particulate 
filter in the secondary dilution tunnel.
    (ii) For the CFV-CVS or EFC-CFV-CVS, either a heat exchanger or 
electronic flow compensation (which also includes the particulate sample 
flows) is required (see Figure N90-6).
    (iii) For the CFV-CVS or EFC-CFV-CVS when a heat exchanger is used, 
the gas mixture temperature, measured at a point immediately ahead of 
the critical flow venturi, shall be within <plus-minus>20  deg.F 
(<plus-minus>11  deg.C) of the average operating temperature observed 
during the test with the simultaneous requirement that condensation does 
not occur. The temperature measuring system(sensors and readout) shall 
have an accuracy and precision of <plus-minus>3.4  deg.F (1.9  deg.C). 
For systems utilizing a flow compensator to maintain proportional 
sampling, the requirement for maintaining constant temperature is not 
necessary.
    (iv) The primary dilution air and secondary dilution air (if 
applicable):
    (A) Shall have a temperature of 77 deg.<plus-minus>9  deg.F 
(25 deg.<plus-minus>5  deg.C). For the first l0 seconds this 
specification is 77 deg.<plus-minus>20  deg.F (25 deg.<plus-minus>11 
deg.C).
    (B) May be filtered at the dilution air inlet.
    (C) Primary dilution air may be sampled to determine background 
particulate levels, which can then be subtracted from the values 
measured in the diluted exhaust stream. The primary dilution air shall 
be sampled at the inlet to the primary dilution tunnel, if unfiltered, 
or downstream of any primary dilution air conditioning devices, if used.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (3) Continuous HC measurement system. (i) The continuous HC sample 
system (as shown in Figure N90-7 or N90-8) uses an ``overflow'' zero and 
span system. In this type of system, excess zero or span gas spills out 
of the probe when zero and span checks of the analyzer are made. The 
``overflow'' system may also be used to calibrate the HC analyzer per 
Sec. 86.1321(b), although this is not required.

sample probe, line or system, unless a common sample pump is used for 
all analyzers and the sample line system design reflects good 
engineering practice.
    (iii) The overflow gas flow rates into the sample line shall be at 
least 105 percent of the sample system flow rate.
    (iv) The overflow gases shall enter the heated sample line as close 
as practicable to the outside surface of the CVS duct or dilution 
tunnel.
    (v) The continuous HC sampling system shall consist of a probe 
(which must raise the sample to the specified temperature) and, where 
used, a sample transfer system (which must maintain

[[Page 218]]

the specified temperature). The continuous hydrocarbon sampling system 
(exclusive of the probe) shall:
    (A) Maintain a wall temperature of 464K <plus-minus> 11K (191  deg.C

the system at initial installation and after any major maintenance 
performed on the system. The temperature profile of the HC sampling 
system shall be demonstrated by inserting thermocouple wires (typically 
Teflon<SUP>[reg]</SUP> coated for ease of insertion) into the sampling 
system assembled in-situ where possible, using good engineering 
judgement. The wire should be inserted up to the HFID inlet. Stabilize 
the sampling system heaters at normal operating temperatures. Withdraw 
the wires in increments of 5 cm to 10 cm (2 inches to 4 inches) 
including all fittings. Record the stabilized temperature at each 
position. The system temperature will be monitored during testing at the

Comment: It is understood that profiling of the sample line can be done 
under flowing conditions also as required with the probe.

    (E) Increase the gas stream temperature to 464K <plus-minus>11K (191 
 deg.C <plus-minus>11  deg.C) by the exit of the probe. The ability of 
the probe to accomplish this shall be demonstrated at typical sample 
flow rates using the insertion thermocouple technique at initial 
installation and after any major maintenance. Compliance with the 
temperature specification shall be demonstrated by monitoring during 
each test the temperature of either the gas stream or the wall of the 
sample probe at its terminus.

be no greater than:
    (A) 1.5 seconds from an instantaneous step change at the port 
entrance to the analyzer to within 90 percent of the step change.
    (B) 20 seconds from an instantaneous step change at the entrance to 
the sample probe or overflow span gas port to within 90 percent of the 
step change. Analysis system response time shall be coordinated with CVS 
flow fluctuations and sampling time/test cycle offsets if necessary.
    (C) For the purpose of verification of response times, the step 
change shall be at least 60 percent of full-scale chart deflection.
    (4) Primary-dilution tunnel. (i) The primary dilution tunnel shall 
be:
    (A) Small enough in diameter to cause turbulent flow (Reynolds 
Number greater than 4000) and of sufficient length to cause complete 
mixing of the exhaust and dilution air;
    (B) At least 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter with a single-dilution 
system or at least 8 inches (20 cm) in diameter with a double-dilution 
system;

    (5) Continuously integrated NO<INF>X</INF>, CO, and CO<INF>2</INF> 
measurement systems. (i) The sample probe shall:
    (A) Be in the same plane as the continuous HC probe, but shall be 
sufficiently distant (radially) from other probes and the tunnel wall so 
as to be free from the influences of any wakes or eddies.
    (B) Heated and insulated over the entire length, to prevent water 
condensation, to a minimum temperature of 131  deg.F (55  deg.C). Sample 
gas temperature immediately before the first filter in the system shall 
be at least 131  deg.F (55  deg.C).
    (ii) The continuous NO<INF>X</INF>, CO, or CO<INF>2</INF> sampling 
and analysis system shall conform to the specifications of 40 CFR part 
86, subpart D, with the following exceptions and revisions:
    (A) The system components required to be heated by subpart D need 
only be heated to prevent water condensation, the minimum component 
temperature shall be 131  deg.F (55  deg.C).
    (B) The system response defined in Sec. 86.329-79 shall be no

Sec. 86.346-79 are not permitted for NO<INF>X</INF> measurement in this 
subpart.
    (D) All analytical gases shall conform to the specifications of 
Sec. 86.1314.

a calibration curve conforming to Sec. 86.330-79.
    (F) The measurement accuracy requirements specified in Sec. 86.338-
79 are superseded by those specified in Sec. 86.1338.
    (iii) The chart deflections or voltage output of analyzers with non-
linear calibration curves shall be converted to concentration values by 
the calibration curve(s) specified in subpart D (Sec. 86.330-79) before 
flow correction (if used) and subsequent integration takes place.
    (6) Particulate sampling system. The particulate collection system 
must be configured in either of two ways. The single-dilution method 
collects a proportional sample from the primary tunnel, and then passes 
this sample through the collection filter. The double-dilution method 
collects a proportional sample from the primary tunnel, and then 
transfers this sample to a secondary dilution tunnel where the sample is 
further diluted; the double-diluted sample is then passed through the 
collection filter. Proportionality (i.e., mass flow ratio) between the 
primary tunnel flow rate and the sample flow rate must be maintained 
within <plus-minus>5 percent. The requirements for these two systems 
are:
    (i) Single dilution method. (A) The particulate sample probe shall 
be:
    (1) Installed facing upstream at a point where the dilution air and 
exhaust air are well mixed (i.e., on the primary tunnel centerline,

    (3) 0.5 in. (1.3 cm) minimum inside diameter.
    (4) The distance from the sampling tip to the filter holder shall be 
at least 5 probe diameters for filters located inside the primary 
dilution tunnel, and not more than 40 inches (102 cm) for filters 
located outside the primary dilution tunnel.
    (5) Designed to minimize the deposition of particulate in the probe 
(i.e., bends should be as gradual as possible, protrusions (due to 
sensors, etc.) should be smooth and not sudden, etc.).
    (B) The particulate sample pump(s) shall be located sufficiently 
distant from the dilution tunnel so that the inlet gas temperature is 
maintained at a constant temperature (<plus-minus>5  deg.F 
(<plus-minus>2.8  deg.C)) if flow compensation is not used.
    (C) The gas meters or flow instrumentation shall be located 
sufficiently distant from the tunnel so that the inlet gas temperature 
remains constant (<plus-minus>5  deg.F (<plus-minus>2.8  deg.C)) if flow 
compensation is not used.
    (D) Other sample flow handling and/or measurement systems may be

tunnel).
    (2) The particulate sample exits on the centerline of the secondary 
tunnel and points downstream.
    (B) The particulate sample transfer tube shall be:

    (3) No longer than 36 in (91 cm) from inlet plane to exit plane.
    (4) Designed to minimize the deposition of particulate during 
transfer (i.e., bends should be as gradual as possible, protrusions (due 
to sensors, etc.) should be smooth and not sudden, etc.).
    (5) Constructed of electrically conductive material which does not 
react with the exhaust components, and electrically grounded.
    (C) The secondary dilution air shall be at a temperature of 
77 deg.<plus-minus>9  deg.F (25 deg.<plus-minus>5  deg.C). For the first 
10 seconds this specification is 77 deg.<plus-minus>20  deg.F 
(25 deg.<plus-minus>11  deg.C).
    (D) The secondary-dilution tunnel shall be:
    (1) 3.0 inches (7.6 cm) minimum inside diameter.
    (2) Of sufficient length so as to provide a residence time of at 
least 0.25 seconds for the double-diluted sample.
    (3) Constructed of electrically conductive material which does not 
react with the exhaust components, and electrically grounded.
    (E) Additional dilution air must be provided so as to maintain a

the Administrator.
    (7) Particulate sampling filters. (i) Fluorocarbon-coated glass 
fiber filters or fluorocarbon-based (membrane) filters are required.
    (ii) Particulate filters must have a minimum diameter of 70 mm (60

    (iii) The dilute exhaust will be simultaneously sampled by a pair of 
filters (one primary and one back-up filter) during the cold-start test 
and by a second pair of filters during the hot-start test. The back-up 
filter holder shall be located no more than 4 inches (10 cm) downstream 
of the primary filter holder. The primary and back-up filters shall not 
be in contact with each other.
    (iv) It is recommended that the filter loading should be maximized 
consistent with other temperature requirements and the requirement to 
avoid moisture condensation. A filter pair loading of 1 mg is typically 
proportional to a 0.1 g/bhp-hr emission level. All particulate filters, 
reference filters, and background filters shall be handled in pairs 
during all weighing operations for emissions testing.

Sec. 86.1310-2007  Exhaust gas sampling and analytical system for gaseous 
emissions from heavy-duty diesel-fueled engines and particulate emissions 
from all 
          engines.

    (a) General. The exhaust gas sampling system described in this 
paragraph is designed to measure the true mass of both gaseous and 
particulate emissions in the exhaust of heavy-duty diesel engines, and 
particulate emissions in the exhaust of all heavy-duty engines.

[[Page 221]]

(Gaseous emissions from non-petroleum-fueled diesel engines are measured 
using the system described in Sec. 86.1309.) This system utilizes the 
CVS concept (described in Sec. 86.1309) of measuring the combined mass 
emissions of THC, NO<INF>X</INF>, CH<INF>4</INF> (if applicable) CO, 
CO<INF>2</INF> and particulate matter. For all emission measurement 
systems described in this section, multiple or redundant systems may be 
used during a single test. Statistical averages of data from multiple 
systems may be used to calculate test results, consistent with good 
engineering judgment. Weighted averages are allowed, where appropriate 
Statistical outliers may be discarded, but all results must be reported. 
If the Administrator determines that the statistical analysis is not 
consistent with good engineering judgment, he/she may determine 
compliance from the arithmetic mean of the results. A continuously 
integrated system may be used for THC, NO<INF>X</INF> , CO and 
CO<INF>2</INF> measurement. The use of proportional bag sampling for 
sample integration is allowed for THC, NO<INF>X</INF>, CO, and 
CO<INF>2</INF> measurement, but requirements specific to bag sampling 
from diesel exhaust must be met for the THC and NO<INF>X</INF> emissions 
measurements. CH<INF>4</INF> measurement for calculation of NMHC (if 
applicable) is measured using GC-FID analysis of a proportional bag 
sample. The mass of gaseous emissions is determined from the sample 
concentration and total flow over the test period. The mass of 
particulate emissions is determined from a proportional mass sample 
collected on a filter and from the sample flow and total flow over the 
test period. As an option, the measurement of total fuel mass consumed 
over a cycle may be substituted for the exhaust measurement of 
CO<INF>2</INF>. General requirements are as follows:
    (1) This sampling system requires the use of a CVS The CVS system 
may use a PDP or a CFV. PDP systems must use a heat exchanger. CFV 
systems may use either a heat exchanger or electronic flow compensation. 
When electronic flow compensation is used, the CFV may be replaced by a 
subsonic venturi (SSV) as long as the CVS concept as defined in 
Sec. 86.1309 is maintained (i.e., a constant volumetric flow-rate 
through the CVS is maintained for the duration of the test). Figure N07-
1 is a schematic drawing of the CVS system.
    (2) The THC analytical system for diesel engines requires a heated 
flame ionization detector (HFID) and heated sample system (191 
<plus-minus> 11  deg.C) using either:
    (i) Continuously integrated measurement of diluted THC meeting the 
minimum requirements and technical specifications contained in paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section. Unless compensation for varying mass flow is 
made, a constant mass flow system must be used to ensure a proportional 
sample; or
    (ii) Heated (191 <plus-minus> 11  deg.C) proportional bag sampling 
systems for hydrocarbon measurement will be allowed if the bag sampling 
system meets the performance specifications for outgassing and 
permeability as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (3) CH<INF>4</INF> measurement, if applicable, shall be conducted 
using a proportional bag sampling system with subsequent analysis using 
a gas chromatograph and FID. The CH<INF>4</INF> measurement shall be 
done in accordance with SAE Recommended Practice J1151, ``Methane 
Measurement Using Gas Chromatography'' (1994 SAE Handbook, Volume 1: 
Materials, Fuels, Emissions, and Noise, Section 13, Page 13.170), which 
is incorporated by reference pursuant to Sec. 86.1(b)(2). As an 
alternative, the manufacturer may choose one of the options set forth in 
Sec. 86.004-28(c)(8).
    (4)-(5) [Reserved]
    (6) The CO and CO<INF>2</INF> analytical system requires:
    (i) Bag sampling (Sec. 86.1309) and analytical (Sec. 86.1311) 
capabilities, as shown in Figure N07-1; or
    (ii) Continuously integrated measurement of diluted CO and 
CO<INF>2</INF> meeting the minimum requirements and technical 
specifications contained in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. Unless 
compensation for varying flow is made, a constant flow system must be 
used to ensure a proportional sample; and
    (7) The NO<INF>X</INF> analytical system requires:
    (i) Continuously integrated measurement of diluted NO<INF>X</INF> 
meeting the minimum requirements and technical specifications contained 
in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. Unless compensation

[[Page 222]]

for varying flow is made, a constant flow system must be used to ensure 
a proportional sample.
    (ii) Bag sampling (Sec. 86.1309) and analytical (Sec. 86.1311) 
capabilities, as shown in Figure N07-1 (or Figure 07-2) will be allowed 
provided that sample gas temperature is maintained above the sample's 
aqueous dewpoint at all times during collection and analysis.
    (8) The mass of particulate in the exhaust is determined via 
filtration. The particulate sampling system requires dilution of the 
exhaust to a temperature of 47  deg.C <plus-minus> 5  deg.C, measured 
upstream of a single high-efficiency sample filter (as close to the 
filter as practical).
    (9) Since various configurations can produce equivalent results, 
exact conformance with these drawings is not required. Additional 
components such as instruments, valves, solenoids, pumps, and switches 
may be used to provide additional information and coordinate the 
functions of the components of the system. Other components, such as 
snubbers, which are not needed to maintain accuracy on some systems, may 
be excluded if their exclusion is based upon good engineering judgment.
    (10) Other sampling and/or analytical systems may be used if shown 
to yield equivalent results and if approved in advance by the 
Administrator (see Sec. 86.1306-07).
    (b) Component description. The components necessary for exhaust 
sampling shall meet the following requirements:
    (1) Exhaust dilution system. The CVS shall conform to all of the 
requirements listed for the exhaust gas CVS systems in Sec. 86.1309(b), 
(c), and (d). With respect to PM measurement, the intent of this 
measurement procedure is to perform the sample cooling primarily via 
dilution and mixing with air rather than via heat transfer to the 
surfaces of the sampling system. In addition the CVS must conform to the 
following requirements:
    (i) The flow capacity of the CVS must be sufficient to maintain the 
diluted exhaust stream at the temperatures required for the measurement 
of particulate and hydrocarbon emission noted below and at, or above, 
the temperatures where aqueous condensation in the exhaust gases could 
occur. This is achieved by the following method. The flow capacity of 
the CVS must be sufficient to maintain the diluted exhaust stream in the 
primary dilution tunnel at a temperature of 191  deg.C or less at the 
sampling zone and as required to prevent condensation at any point in 
the dilution tunnel. Gaseous emission samples may be taken directly from 
this sampling point. An exhaust sample must then be taken at this point 
to be diluted a second time for use in determining particulate 
emissions. The secondary dilution system must provide sufficient 
secondary dilution air to maintain the double-diluted exhaust stream at 
a temperature of 47 C <plus-minus> 5 C, measured at a point located 
between the filter face and 16 cm upstream of the filter face.
    (ii) For the CVS , either a heat exchanger (i.e. CFV-CVS) or 
electronic flow compensation (i.e. EFC-CFV-CVS), which also includes the 
particulate sample flows is required Refer to Figure N07-1.
    (iii) When a heat exchanger is used, the gas mixture temperature, 
measured at a point immediately ahead of the critical flow venturi, 
shall be within <plus-minus>11  deg.C of the average operating 
temperature observed during the test with the simultaneous requirement 
that aqueous condensation does not occur. The temperature measuring 
system (sensors and readout) shall have an accuracy and precision of 
<plus-minus>1.9  deg.C. For systems utilizing a flow compensator to 
maintain proportional sampling, the requirement for maintaining constant 
temperature is not necessary.
    (iv) The primary dilution air and secondary dilution air:
    (A) Shall have a primary and secondary dilution air temperature 
equal to or greater than 15  deg.C.
    (B) Primary dilution air shall be filtered at the dilution air 
inlet. The manufacturer of the primary dilution air filter shall state 
that the filter design has successfully achieved a minimum particle 
removal efficiency of 98% (less than 0.02 penetration) as determined 
using ASTM test method F 1471-93 (incorporated by reference at section 
86.1). Secondary dilution air shall be filtered at the dilution air 
inlet using a high-efficiency particulate air filter (HEPA). The HEPA 
filter

[[Page 223]]

manufacturer shall state the HEPA filter design has successfully 
achieved a minimum particle removal efficiency of 99.97% (less than 
0.0003 penetration) as determined using ASTM test method F 1471-93. It 
is recommended that the primary dilution air be filtered using a HEPA 
filter. EPA intends to utilize HEPA filters to condition primary 
dilution air in its test facilities. It is acceptable to use of a 
booster blower upstream or downstream of a HEPA filter in the primary 
dilution tunnel (and upstream of the introduction of engine exhaust into 
the CVS) to compensate for the additional pressure loss associated with 
the filter. The design of any booster blower located downstream of the 
filter should minimize the introduction of additional particulate matter 
into the CVS.
    (C) Primary dilution air may be sampled to determine background 
particulate levels, which can then be subtracted from the values 
measured in the diluted exhaust stream. In the case of primary dilution 
air, the background particulate filter sample shall be taken immediately 
downstream of the dilution air filter and upstream of the engine exhaust 
flow (Figure N07-1). The provisions of paragraphs (b)(7) of this 
section, and of Sec. 86.1312-2007 also apply to the measurement of 
background particulate matter, except that the filter temperature must 
be maintained below 52  deg.C.
    (2) Heated proportional bag sampling systems. If a heated (191 
<plus-minus> 11  deg.C) proportional bag sampling system is used for THC 
measurement, sample bags must demonstrate minimal outgassing and 
permeability by passing the following performance test:
    (i) Performance test for sample bag HC outgassing and CO<INF>2</INF> 
permeability. Bring the bag system to its operational temperature. Fill 
the heated sample bag with a nominal mixture of 1% CO<INF>2</INF> in 
N<INF>2</INF>. Perform an initial measurement of CO<INF>2</INF> and THC 
from the sample bag, and repeat the measurement after one hour. 
Acceptable performance criteria are <2% decrease of the initial 
CO<INF>2</INF> reading and <1 ppmC THC.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (3) Continuous HC measurement system. (i) The continuous HC sample 
system (as shown in Figure N07-1) uses an ``overflow'' zero and span 
system. In this type of system, excess zero or span gas spills out of 
the probe when zero and span checks of the analyzer are made. The 
``overflow'' system may also be used to calibrate the HC analyzer per 
Sec. 86.1321(b), although this is not required.
    (ii) No other analyzers may draw a sample from the continuous HC 
sample probe, line or system, unless a common sample pump is used for 
all analyzers and the sample line system design reflects good 
engineering practice.
    (iii) The overflow gas flow rates into the sample line shall be at 
least 105% of the sample system flow rate.
    (iv) The overflow gases shall enter the heated sample line as close 
as practicable to the outside surface of the CVS duct or dilution 
tunnel.
    (v) The continuous HC sampling system shall consist of a probe 
(which must raise the sample to the specified temperature) and, where 
used, a sample transfer system (which must maintain the specified 
temperature). The continuous hydrocarbon sampling system (exclusive of 
the probe) shall:
    (A) Maintain a wall temperature of 191  deg.C <plus-minus> 11  deg.C 
as measured at every separately controlled heated component (i.e., 
filters, heated line sections), using permanent thermocouples located at 
each of the separate components.
    (B) Have a wall temperature of 191  deg.C <plus-minus> 11  deg.C 
over its entire length. The temperature of the system shall be 
demonstrated by profiling the thermal characteristics of the system at 
initial installation and after any major maintenance performed on the 
system. The temperature profile of the HC sampling system shall be 
demonstrated by inserting thermocouple wires (typically Teflon\TM\ 
coated for ease of insertion) into the sampling system assembled in-situ 
where possible, using good engineering judgment. The wire should be 
inserted up to the HFID inlet. Stabilize the sampling system heaters at 
normal operating temperatures. Withdraw the wires in increments of 5 cm 
to 10 cm (2 inches to 4 inches) including all fittings. Record the 
stabilized temperature at each position. The system temperature will be 
monitored during testing at the locations and temperature described in 
Sec. 86.1310-90(b)(3)(v)(A).


[[Page 224]]


    Note: It is understood that profiling of the sample line can be done 
under flowing conditions also as required with the probe. This test may 
be cumbersome if test facilities utilize long transfer lines and many 
fittings; therefore it is recommended that transfer lines be kept as 
short as possible and the use of fittings should be kept minimal.

    (C) Maintain a gas temperature of 191  deg.C <plus-minus>11  deg.C 
immediately before the heated filter and HFID. These gas temperatures 
will be determined by a temperature sensor located immediately upstream 
of each component.
    (vi) The continuous hydrocarbon sampling probe shall:
    (A) Be defined as the first 25.4 cm (10 in) to 76.2 cm (30 in) of 
the continuous hydrocarbon sampling system;
    (B) Have a 0.483 cm (0.19 in) minimum inside diameter;
    (C) Be installed in the primary dilution tunnel at a point where the 
dilution air and exhaust are well mixed (i.e., approximately 10 tunnel 
diameters downstream of the point where the exhaust enters the dilution 
tunnel);
    (D) Be sufficiently distant (radially) from other probes and the 
tunnel wall so as to be free from the influence of any wakes or eddies; 
and
    (E) Increase the gas stream temperature to 191  deg.C <plus-minus> 
11  deg.C by the exit of the probe. The ability of the probe to 
accomplish this shall be demonstrated at typical sample flow rates using 
the insertion thermocouple technique at initial installation and after 
any major maintenance. Compliance with the temperature specification 
shall be demonstrated by monitoring during each test the temperature of 
either the gas stream or the wall of the sample probe at its terminus.
    (vii) The response time of the continuous measurement system shall 
be no greater than:
    (A) 1.5 seconds from an instantaneous step change at the port 
entrance to the analyzer to within 90 percent of the step change;
    (B) 10 seconds from an instantaneous step change at the entrance to 
the sample probe or overflow span gas port to within 90 percent of the 
step change. Analysis system response time shall be coordinated with CVS 
flow fluctuations and sampling time/test cycle offsets if necessary; and
    (C) For the purpose of verification of response times, the step 
change shall be at least 60 percent of full-scale chart deflection.
    (4) Primary-dilution tunnel. (i) The primary dilution tunnel shall 
be:
    (A) Small enough in diameter to cause turbulent flow (Reynolds 
Number greater than 4000) and of sufficient length to cause complete 
mixing of the exhaust and dilution air. Good engineering judgment shall 
dictate the use of mixing plates and mixing orifices to ensure a well-
mixed sample. To verify mixing, EPA recommends flowing a tracer gas 
(i.e. propane or CO<INF>2</INF>) from the raw exhaust inlet of the 
dilution tunnel and measuring its concentration at several points along 
the axial plane at the sample probe. Tracer gas concentrations should 
remain nearly constant (i.e. within 2%) between all of these points.
    (B) At least 8 inches (20 cm) in diameter.
    (C) Constructed of electrically conductive material which does not 
react with the exhaust components.
    (D) Electrically grounded.
    (E) EPA recommends that the tunnel should have minimal thermal 
capacitance such that the temperature of the walls tracks with the 
temperature of the diluted exhaust.
    (ii) The temperature of the diluted exhaust stream inside of the 
primary dilution tunnel shall be sufficient to prevent water 
condensation.
    (iii) The engine exhaust shall be directed downstream at the point 
where it is introduced into the primary dilution tunnel.
    (5) Continuously integrated NO<INF>X</INF>, CO, and CO2 measurement 
systems. (i) The sample probe shall:
    (A) Be in the same plane as the continuous HC probe, but shall be 
sufficiently distant (radially) from other probes and the tunnel wall so 
as to be free from the influences of any wakes or eddies; and
    (B) Heated and insulated over the entire length, to prevent water 
condensation, to a minimum temperature of 131  deg.F (55  deg.C). Sample 
gas temperature immediately before the first filter in the system shall 
be at least 131  deg.F (55  deg.C).
    (ii) The continuous NO<INF>X</INF>, CO, or CO2 sampling and analysis 
system shall

[[Page 225]]

conform to the specifications of subpart D of this part, with the 
following exceptions:
    (A) The system components required to be heated by subpart D need 
only be heated to prevent water condensation, the minimum component 
temperature shall be 131  deg.F (55  deg.C);
    (B) The system response defined in Sec. 86.329-79 shall be no 
greater than 10 seconds. Analysis system response time shall be 
coordinated with CVS flow fluctuations and sampling time/test cycle 
offsets, if necessary;
    (C) Alternative NO<INF>X</INF> measurement techniques outlined in 
Sec. 86.346-79 are not permitted for NO<INF>X</INF> measurement in this 
subpart;
    (D) All analytical gases shall conform to the specifications of 
Sec. 86.1314;
    (E) Any range on a linear analyzer below 100 ppm shall have and use 
a calibration curve conforming to Sec. 86. 1323-07; and
    (F) The measurement accuracy requirements are specified in Sec. 86. 
1338-07 .
    (iii) The signal output of analyzers with non-linear calibration 
curves shall be converted to concentration values by the calibration 
curve(s) specified in subpart D of this part (Sec. 86.330-79) before 
flow correction (if used) and subsequent integration takes place.
    (6) Particulate sampling system. This method collects a proportional 
sample from the primary tunnel, and then transfers this sample to a 
secondary dilution tunnel where the sample is further diluted. The 
double-diluted sample is then passed through the collection filter. 
Proportionality (i.e., mass flow ratio) between the primary tunnel flow 
rate and the sample flow rate must be maintained within <plus-minus>5%, 
excluding the first 10 seconds of the test at start-up. The requirements 
for this system are:
    (i) The particulate sample transfer tube shall be configured and 
installed so that:
    (A) The inlet faces upstream in the primary dilution tunnel at a 
point where the primary dilution air and exhaust are well mixed.
    (B) The particulate sample exits on the centerline of the secondary 
tunnel.
    (ii) The entire particulate sample transfer tube shall be:
    (A) Sufficiently distant (radially) from other sampling probes (in 
the primary dilution tunnel) so as to be free from the influence of any 
wakes or eddies produced by the other probes.
    (B) 0.85 cm minimum inside diameter.
    (C) No longer than 36 in (91 cm) from inlet plane to exit plane.
    (D) Designed to minimize the diffusional and thermophoretic 
deposition of particulate matter during transfer (i.e., sample residence 
time in the transfer tube should be as short as possible, temperature 
gradients between the flow stream and the transfer tube wall should be 
minimized). Double-wall, thin-wall, air-gap insulated, or a controlled 
heated construction for the transfer tube is recommended.
    (E) Constructed such that the surfaces exposed to the sample shall 
be an electrically conductive material, which does not react with the 
exhaust components, and this surface shall be electrically grounded so 
as to minimize electrostatic particulate matter deposition.
    (iii) The secondary dilution air shall be at a temperature equal to 
or greater than 15  deg.C.
    (iv) The secondary-dilution tunnel shall be constructed such that 
the surfaces exposed to the sample shall be an electrically conductive 
material, which does not react with the exhaust components, and this 
surface shall be electrically grounded so as to minimize electrostatic 
particulate deposition.
    (v) Additional dilution air must be provided so as to maintain a 
sample temperature of 47  deg.C <plus-minus> 5  deg.C upstream of the 
sample filter. Temperature shall be measured with a thermocouple with a 
\3/16\' shank, having thermocouple wires with a gage diameter 24 AWG or 
smaller, a bare-wire butt-welded junction; or other suitable temperature 
measurement with an equivalent or faster time constant and an accuracy 
and precision of <plus-minus> 1.9  deg.C.
    (vi) The filter holder assembly shall be located within 12.0 in 
(30.5 cm) of the exit of the secondary dilution tunnel.
    (vii) The face velocity through the sample filter shall not exceed 
100 cm/s (face velocity is defined as the standard volumetric sample 
flow rate (i.e.,

[[Page 226]]

scm3/sec) divided by the sample filter stain area (i.e., cm2)).
    (7) Particulate sampling. (i) Filter specifications. (A) 
Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE or Teflon\TM\) coated borosilicate glass 
fiber high-efficiency filters or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE or 
Teflon\TM\) high-efficiency membrane filters with an integral support 
ring of polymethylpentene (PMP) or equivalent inert material are 
required. Filters shall have a minimum clean filter efficiency of 99% as 
measured by the ASTM D2986-95a DOP test (incorporated by reference at 
Sec. 86.1).
    (B) Particulate filters must have a diameter of 46.50 <plus-minus> 
0.6 mm ( 38 mm minimum stain diameter).
    (C) The dilute exhaust is simultaneously sampled by a single high-
efficiency filter during the cold-start test and by a second high 
efficiency filter during the hot-start test.
    (D) It is recommended that the filter loading should be maximized 
consistent with temperature requirements.
    (ii) Filter holder assembly. The filter holder assembly shall comply 
with the specifications set forth for ambient PM measurement in 40 CFR 
Part 50, Appendix L 7.3.5, figures L-25 and L-26, with the following 
exceptions:
    (A) The material shall be 302, 303, or 304 stainless steel instead 
of anodized aluminum.
    (B) The 2.84 cm diameter entrance to the filter holder may be 
adapted, using sound engineering judgment and leak-free construction, to 
an inside diameter no smaller than 0.85 cm, maintaining the 12.5 deg. 
angle from the inlet of the top filter holder to the area near the 
sealing surface of the top of the filter cartridge assembly. Figure N07-
2 shows acceptable variation from the design in 40 CFR Part 50, Appendix 
L. Similar variations using sound engineering design are also acceptable 
provided that they provide even flow distribution across the filter 
media and a similar leak-free seal with the filter cartridge assembly.
    (C) If additional or multiple filter cartridges are stored in a 
particulate sampler as part of an automatic sequential sampling 
capability, all such filter cartridges, unless they are installed in the 
sample flow (with or without flow established) shall be covered or 
sealed to prevent communication of semi-volatile matter from filter to 
filter; contamination of the filters before and after sampling; or loss 
of volatile or semi-volatile particulate matter after sampling.
    (iii) Filter cartridge assembly. The filter cartridge assembly shall 
comply with the specifications set forth for ambient PM measurement in 
40 CFR Part 50, Appendix L 7.3.5, figures L-27, L-28, and L-29, with the 
following exceptions:
    (A) In addition to the specified Delrin <SUP>TM</SUP> material, 302, 
303, or 304 stainless steel, polycarbonate or acrylonitrile/butadiene/
styrene (ABS) resin, or a combination of these materials may also be 
used.
    (B) A bevel introduced on the inside diameter of the entrance to the 
filter cartridge, as used by some commercially available automated 
sequential particulate filter cartridge changers, is also acceptable 
(see Figure N07-3).
    (iv) Particle preclassifier. A particle preclassifier shall be 
installed immediately upstream of the filter holder assembly (N07-1). 
The purpose of the preclassifier is to remove coarse, mechanically 
generated particles (e.g., rust from the engine exhaust system or carbon 
sheared from the sampling system walls) from the sample flow stream 
while allowing combustion-generated particles to pass through to the 
filter. The preclassifier may be either an inertial impactor or a 
cyclonic separator. The preclassifier manufacturer 50% cutpoint particle 
diameter shall be between 2.5 [mu]m and 10 [mu]m at the volumetric flow 
rate selected for sampling of particulate matter emissions. Sharpness of 
cut is not specifically defined, but the preclassifier geometry shall 
allow at least 99% of the mass concentration of 1 [mu]m particles to 
pass through the exit of the preclassifier to the filter at the 
volumetric flow rate selected for sampling particulate matter emissions. 
Periodic servicing of the preclassifier will be necessary to prevent a 
buildup of mechanically separated particles. The particle preclassifier 
may be made integral with the top of the filter holder assembly. The 
preclassifier may also be made integral with a mixing-tee for 
introduction of secondary dilution air, thus

[[Page 227]]

replacing the secondary dilution tunnel; provided that the preclassifier 
provides sufficient mixing.

dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) derivatives using ultraviolet (UV) 
detection. The exhaust gas analytical system shall conform to the 
following requirements:

    (2) The carbon monoxide (NDIR) analyzer may require a sample 
conditioning column containing CaSO<INF>4</INF>, or dessicating silica 
gel to remove water vapor, and containing ascarite to remove carbon 
dioxide from the CO analysis stream.
    (i) If CO instruments are used which are essentially free of 
CO<INF>2</INF> and water vapor interference, the use of the conditioning 
column may be deleted. (See Secs. 86.1322 and 86.1342.)
    (ii) A CO instrument will be considered to be essentially free of 
CO<INF>2</INF> and water vapor interference if its response to a mixture 
of 3 percent CO<INF>2</INF> in N<INF>2</INF>, which has been bubbled 
through water at room temperature, produces an equivalent CO response, 
as measured on the most sensitive CO range, which is less than 1 percent 
of full scale CO concentration on ranges above 300 ppm full scale or 
less than 3 ppm on ranges below 300 ppm full scale. (See Sec. 86.1322.)
    (c) Alternate analytical systems. Analysis systems meeting the

this subpart. Heated analyzers may be used in their heated 
configuration.

Sec. 86.1312-88  Weighing chamber and microgram balance specifications.

    (a) Ambient conditions. (1) Temperature. The ambient temperature of 
the chamber (or room) in which the particulate filters are conditioned 
and weighed shall be maintained at 295 K <plus-minus> 3 K (22  deg.C 
<plus-minus> 3  deg.C) during all filter conditioning and weighing.
    (2) Humidity. The humidity of the chamber (or room) in which the 
particulate filters are conditioned and weighed shall be maintained at a 
dew point temperature of 282.5 K <plus-minus> 3 K (9.4  deg.C 
<plus-minus> 3  deg.C) and a relative humidity of 45% <plus-minus>8%. 
Either the dew point temperature or the relative humidity or both may be 
averaged over the preceding 10 minute period on a moving average basis.
    (3) The chamber (or room) environment shall be free of any ambient 
contaminates (such as dust) that would settle on the particulate filters 
during their stabilization. It is required that at least two unused

covered (to reduce dust contamination) but unsealed (to permit humidity 
exchange) petri dishes. These reference filter pairs shall be placed in 
the same general area as the sample filters. These reference filter 
pairs shall be weighed within 4 hours of, but preferably at the same 
time as, the sample filter pair weighings.
    (4) If the average weight of the reference filter pairs changes 
between sample filter weighings by more than 40 micrograms, then all 
sample filters and background filters in the process of stabilization 
shall be discarded and the emissions tests repeated.
    (5) If the room (or chamber) environmental conditions are not met, 
then the filters shall remain in the conditioning room for at least one 
hour after correct conditions are met prior to weighing.
    (6) The reference filter pairs shall be changed at least once a 
month, but never between clean and used weighings of a given sample 
filter pairs. More than one set of reference filter pair may be used. 
The reference filters shall be the same size and material as the sample 
filters.

Sec. 86.1312-2007  Filter stabilization and microbalance workstation 
environmental conditions, microbalance specifications, and particulate 
matter filter 
          handling and weighing procedures.

    (a) Ambient conditions for filter stabilization and weighing--(1) 
Temperature and humidity. (i) The filter stabilization environment shall 
be maintained at 22  deg.C <plus-minus> 3  deg.C and a dewpoint of 9.5 
deg.C <plus-minus> 1  deg.C. Dewpoint shall be measured with an 
instrument that exhibits an accuracy of at least <plus-minus>0.25  deg.C 
NIST traceable as stated by the instrument manufacturer. Temperature 
shall be measured with an instrument that exhibits an accuracy of at 
least <plus-minus>0.2  deg.C or better.
    (ii) The immediate microbalance workstation environment shall be 
maintained at 22  deg.C <plus-minus> 1  deg.C and a dewpoint of 9.5 
deg.C <plus-minus> 1  deg.C. If the microbalance workstation environment 
freely circulates with the filter stabilization environment, and this 
entire environment meets 22  deg.C <plus-minus> 1  deg.C and a dewpoint 
of 9.5  deg.C <plus-minus> 1  deg.C , then there is no requirement to 
measure temperature and dewpoint at the microbalance separate from the 
filter stabilization location. Otherwise, temperature at the 
microbalance workstation shall be measured with an instrument that 
exhibits an accuracy of at least <plus-minus>0.2  deg.C or better, and 
dewpoint shall be measured with an instrument that exhibits an accuracy 
of at least <plus-minus>0.25  deg.C NIST traceable as stated by the 
instrument manufacturer.
    (2) Cleanliness. (i) The microbalance and filter stabilization 
environments shall be free of ambient contaminants (such as dust or 
other aerosols) that could settle on the particulate filters. It is 
recommended that these environments be built to conform with the Class 
1000 specification (or cleaner) as determined by Federal Standard 209D 
or 209E for clean room classification (Available from the Institute of 
Environmental Standards and Technology website at www.iest.org or phone 
(847) 255-1561). An alternative recommendation would be to equilibrate 
and/or weigh the filters within a separate, smaller, particle-free, 
temperature and humidity-controlled chamber (i.e., ``glove box'').
    (ii) Reference filters shall be used to monitor for gross particle 
contamination. It is required that at least two unused reference filters 
remain in the filter stabilization environment at all times in partially 
covered glass petri dishes, as in paragraph (c) (1) of this section. 
These reference filters shall be placed in the filter stabilization 
environment. The reference filters shall be weighed within 2 hours of, 
but preferably at the same time as, the sample filters. The reference 
filters shall be changed at least once a month, but never while any 
sample filters are between their tare weight (pre-sampling) and gross 
weight (post-sampling) measurements. The reference filters shall be the 
same size and material as the sample filters.
    (3) Quality control of ambient conditions. (i) If, before the start 
of a weighing session, the temperature or dewpoint of the filter 
stabilization environment are not within specifications, then filters 
must remain in the environment for at least 30 minutes after conditions 
are corrected. If the filter stabilization environment changes during a 
weighing session such that the specifications are no longer met, the 
weighing session shall be suspended until the environment has returned 
to within specifications for at least 30 minutes. Once the environment 
has returned to within specifications for at least 30 minutes, the 
reference filters shall be reweighed and the criteria in paragraph 
(a)(3)(ii) of this section shall apply. Note that temperature and 
dewpoint shall be sampled once per second, and an unweighted 5-minute 
moving average of this data shall be calculated once per second. This 
moving average shall be used to determine the environment temperature 
and dewpoint for the purpose of determining whether or not the 
environment is within specifications.
    (ii) If the average change in weight of the reference filters is 
more than 10 micrograms (after correcting for buoyancy as described in 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section), then all filters in the process of 
stabilization shall be discarded and all data collected with respect to 
the discarded filters shall be considered void. Note that more than 2 
reference filters may be used to

[[Page 235]]

achieve a more robust average of the change in weight of the reference 
filters.
    (b) Microbalance specifications. The microbalance used to determine 
the weights of all filters shall have a precision (standard deviation) 
of at least <plus-minus>0.25 micrograms or better for repeated weighing 
of a calibration weight, a precision of at least <plus-minus>2.5 
micrograms or better for repeated weighing of a clean filter, and a 
readability equal to or less than 0.1 micrograms. It is recommended that 
the microbalance be installed on a vibration isolation platform to 
isolate the microbalance's load cell from external vibration. It is also 
recommended that the microbalance should be shielded from convective 
airflow by means of an electrically grounded static dissipative draft 
shield. Microbalance manufacturer specifications for all preventive 
maintenance, periodic certification, calibration, and re-zeroing shall 
be followed. All certification and calibration procedures shall be NIST 
traceable, or traceable to an equivalent national standard.
    (c) Particulate matter filter handling and weighing. Care should be 
taken to prevent contamination of the sample filters and to prevent a 
buildup of static charge on the filters that could interfere with filter 
weighing. Static neutralizers, such as Po-210 sources, shall be used to 
neutralize charge on a filter prior to each weighing. A static 
neutralizer should be replaced at the interval recommended by its 
manufacturer, or when it is no longer able to reduce static charge on a 
filter to less than <plus-minus>2 VDC as measured with an electrostatic 
monitor at the microbalance workstation. The person weighing filters 
shall be grounded with respect to the microbalance to prevent imparting 
a static charge on the filters. This can be accomplished safely by using 
a grounding strap such as the wrist straps that are commonly used in the 
microelectronics industry, or by connecting a similar grounding strap to 
the tweezers. To prevent electrical shock, a 1-megohm resistor should be 
installed in series between the person weighing filters and ground.
    (1) Within the filter stabilization environment, a pair of clean and 
electrically conductive tweezers shall be used to place a filter in the 
lower half of a filter cassette and the cassette shall be placed in a 
partially open glass petri dish. The petri dish lid should extend over 
the filter to prevent gross contamination, but it should be left 
slightly open on one edge to permit stabilization with the environment 
for at least 30 minutes.
    (2) After at least 30 minutes of stabilization, each filter shall be 
weighed using the specified microbalance. The process of weighing a 
filter may be repeated and a statistical mean weight of a single filter 
may be calculated. Sound engineering judgment shall dictate the use of 
statistics to discard outliers and the weighting of averages. For a 
clean filter its single weight or statistical mean weight shall be 
considered the uncorrected tare weight of the filter.
    (3) All filter weights shall be corrected for filter buoyancy in 
air. For the uncorrected tare weight of a filter, this calculated value 
is the corrected tare weight of the filter, and it must be recorded (see 
Sec. 86.1344(e)(18)). Barometric pressure of the microbalance 
environment shall be measured with an instrument that exhibits 
<plus-minus>0.01% full-scale accuracy and 0.01% per-year full scale 
stability, and the full-scale value used for such a specification shall 
not exceed 200 kPa.
    (i) Buoyancy correction calculation. (A) Calculate vapor pressure of 
liquid water using the dewpoint temperature in the Magnus formula:

P<INF>w</INF> = 0.6113 x 10[caret] ((7.5 x T<INF>dp</INF>)/(237.3 + 
T<INF>dp</INF>))

Where:

P<INF>w</INF>=vapor pressure of liquid water, kPa.
T<INF>dp</INF>=dewpoint temperature,  deg.C.

    (B) Calculate air density using the ideal gas relationship and 
molecular weights of standard air and water:


A=(3.484xP-1.317xP<INF>w</INF>)/(T+273.15)


Where:

A=air density, kg/m\3\.
P=barometric pressure, kPa.
P<INF>w</INF>=vapor pressure of liquid water, kPa.
T=temperature,  deg.C.

    (C) Buoyancy correction:


M=Rx(1-(A/[rho]<INF>w</INF>))/(1-(A/[rho]<INF>s</INF>)).


[[Page 236]]


Where:

M=corrected mass in units of the balance display.
R=uncorrected filter weight in units of the balance display.
A=calculated air density, kg/m\3\.
[rho]<INF>w</INF>=density of calibration weight used to calibrate the 
balance, kg/m\3\.
[rho]<INF>s</INF>=density of filter material used to sample PM 
emissions, kg/m\3\.


    (ii) For determining [rho]<INF>s</INF> note that PTFE (Teflon\TM\) 
and borosilicate glass both have densities in the range of 2,200 to 
2,400 kg/m\3\. Therefore, for PTFE-coated borosilicate glass fiber 
filters, an acceptable [rho]<INF>s</INF> is 2,300 kg/m\3\. Note also 
that polymethylpentene has a density of 850 kg/m\3\. Because Teflon PTFE 
membrane filters have an integral polymethylpentene support ring that 
accounts for 95% of the filter mass, an acceptable [rho]<INF>s</INF> for 
these filters is 920 kg/m\3\. Other [rho]<INF>s</INF> values for other 
filters may be obtained similarly. Information about ``[rho]<INF>s</INF> 
should be available from the calibration weight manufacturer.
    (iii) This paragraph (c)(3)(iii) shows an example of the buoyancy 
correction. This example assumes the following inputs: Barometric 
pressure (P)=101.325 kPa, temperature (T)=22.0  deg.C, dewpoint 
temperature (T<INF>dp</INF>)=9.5  deg.C, balance display (R)=100.0000 
mg, calibration weight density ([rho]<INF>w</INF>)=8,000 kg/m\3\, and 
filter material density ([rho]<INF>s</INF>)=2,300 kg/m\3\. Then:
    (A) The water vapor pressure (P<INF>w</INF>) is calculated as:


P<INF>w</INF> = 0.6113 x 10 ((7.5 x 9.5)/(237.3 + 9.5)) = 1.186 kPa.

    (B) The air density (A) is calculated as:


A = (3.484 x101.325 - 1.317 x 1.186)/(22.0 + 273.15) = 1.191 kg/m\3\.

    (C) The corrected mass (M) is calculated as:


M=100.0000 x (1 - (1.191/8000))/(1 - (1.191/2300)) = 100.0369 mg.

    (4) The uncorrected weight, corrected weight, barometric pressure, 
temperature and humidity, of the filter shall be recorded. Afterward the 
filter shall be returned to the lower half of the filter cassette, and 
the upper half of the cassette shall be set in place. The cassette-with 
filter-shall then be stored in a covered glass petri dish or a sealed 
(i.e., ends plugged) filter holder assembly, either of which shall 
remain in the filter stabilization environment until needed for testing. 
It is recommended that the filter be transported between the filter 
stabilization environment and the location of the emissions test within 
a sealed filter holder assembly.
    (5) After the emissions test, the filter cassette shall be removed 
from the filter holder assembly. If this removal is performed in the 
filter stabilization environment, the upper half of the cassette shall 
be removed using a properly designed separator tool, the lower half of 
the cassette-with filter-shall be placed in a partially covered petri 
dish, and allowed to stabilize for at least 30 minutes. Otherwise, the 
cassette and filter shall be placed in a closed petri dish until it can 
be returned to the filter stabilization environment. Once the closed 
petri dish is returned to the filter stabilization environment, the 
petri dish shall be opened, the upper half of the cassette shall be 
removed using a properly designed separator tool, the lower half of the 
cassette-with filter-shall be placed in a partially covered petri dish, 
and allowed to stabilize for at least one hour.
    (6) After at least 30 minutes, but no more than 60 hours of 
stabilization, each filter may be weighed using the specified 
microbalance. The process of weighing a filter may be repeated and a 
statistical mean may be calculated. Sound engineering judgment shall 
dictate the use of statistics to discard outliers and the weighting of 
averages. For a used filter, its single weight or statistical mean 
weight shall be identified as the uncorrected gross weight of the 
filter. The uncorrected gross weight shall be corrected for filter 
buoyancy using the procedure in (c)(3) of this section. The uncorrected 
gross filter weight, corrected gross filter weight, barometric pressure, 
temperature, and dewpoint shall be recorded.
    (7) The net particulate matter weight (Pf) of each filter shall be 
equal to the corrected gross filter weight minus the corrected tare 
filter weight.
    (8) Should the particulate matter on the filters contact the petri 
dish, tweezers, microbalance or any other

[[Page 237]]

surface, the data with respect to that filter is void.

    (3)(i) Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, unleaded 
gasoline representative of commercial gasoline that will be generally 
available through retail outlets must be used in service accumulation. 
Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, this gasoline must have 
a minimum sulfur content of 15 ppm. Unless otherwise approved by the 
Administrator, fuel used for evaporative emission durability 
demonstration must contain ethanol as required by Sec. 86.1824-
01(a)(2)(iii). Leaded gasoline must not be used in service accumulation.
    (ii) Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, the octane 
rating of the gasoline used must be no higher than 1.0 Retail octane 
number above the lowest octane rating that meets the fuel grade the 
manufacturer will recommend to the ultimate purchaser for the relevant 
production vehicles. If the manufacturer recommends a Retail octane 
number rather than a fuel grade, then the octane rating of the service 
accumulation gasoline can be no higher than 1.0 Retail octane number 
above the recommended Retail octane number. The service accumulation 
gasoline must also have a minimum sensitivity of 7.5 octane numbers, 
where sensitivity is defined as the Research octane number minus the 
Motor octane number.
    (iii) The Reid Vapor Pressure of the gasoline used must be 
characteristic of the motor fuel used during the season in which the 
service accumulation takes place.
    (4) The specification range of the gasoline to be used under 
paragraph (a) of this section must be reported in accordance with 
Sec. 86.094-21(b)(3).

<R05>
Sec. 86.1319-84  CVS calibration.

    (a) The CVS is calibrated using an accurate flowmeter and restrictor 
valve. The flowmeter calibration shall be traceable to the NBS, and will 
serve as the reference value (NBS ``true'' value) for the CVS 
calibration. (Note: In no case should an upstream screen or other 
restriction which can affect the flow be used ahead of the flowmeter 
unless calibrated throughout the flow range with such a device.) The CVS 
calibration procedures are designed for use of a ``metering venturi'' 
type flowmeter. Large radius or ASME flow nozzles are considered 
equivalent if traceable to NBS measurements. Other measurement systems 
may be used if shown to be equivalent under the test conditions in this 
action and traceable to NBS measurements. Measurements of the various 
flowmeter parameters are recorded and related to flow through the CVS. 
Procedures used by EPA for both PDP- and CFV-CVS's are outlined below. 
Other procedures yielding equivalent results may be used if approved in 
advance by the Administrator.
    (b) After the calibration curve has been obtained, verification of 
the entire system may be performed by injecting a known mass of gas into 
the system and comparing the mass indicated by the system to the true 
mass injected. An indicated error does not necessarily mean that the 
calibration is wrong, since other factors can influence the accuracy of 
the system (e.g., analyzer calibration, leaks, or HC hangup). A 
verification procedure is found in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (c) PDP calibration. (1) The following calibration procedure 
outlines the equipment, the test configuration, and the various 
parameters which must be measured to establish the flow rate of the CVS 
pump.
    (i) All the parameters related to the pump are simultaneously 
measured

[[Page 252]]

with the parameters related to a flowmeter which is connected in series 
with the pump.
    (ii) The calculated flow rate, ft<SUP>3</SUP>/min. (at a pump inlet 
absolute pressure and temperature), can then be plotted versus a 
correlation function which is the value of a specific combination of 
pump parameters.
    (iii) The linear equation which relates the pump flow and the 
correlation function is then determined.
    (iv) In the event that a CVS has a multiple speed drive, a 
calibration for each range used must be performed.
    (2) This calibration procedure is based on the measurement of the 
absolute values of the pump and flowmeter parameters that relate the 
flow rate at each point. Two conditions must be maintained to assure the 
accuracy and integrity of the calibration curve:
    (i) The temperature stability must be maintained during calibration. 
(Flowmeters are sensitive to inlet temperature oscillations; this can 
cause the data points to be scattered. Gradual changes in temperature 
are acceptable as long as they occur over a period of several minutes.)
    (ii) All connections and ducting between the flowmeter and the CVS 
pump must be absolutely void of leakage.
    (3) During an exhaust emission test the measurement of these same 
pump parameters enables the user to calculate the flow rate from the 
calibration equation.
    (4) Connect a system as shown in Figure N84-6. Although particular 
types of equipment are shown, other configurations that yield equivalent 
results may be used if approved in advance by the Administrator. For the 
system indicated, the following measurements and accuracies are 
required:

    (5) After the system has been connected as shown in Figure N84-6, 
set the variable restrictor in the wide open position and run the CVS 
pump for 20 minutes. Record the calibration data.
    (6) Reset the restrictor valve to a more restricted condition in an 
increment of pump inlet depression that will yield a minimum of six data 
points for the total calibration. Allow the system to stabilize for 3 
minutes and repeat the data acquisition.
    (7) Data analysis: (i) The air flow rate, Q<INF>s</INF>, at each 
test point is calculated in standard cubic feet per minute (68  deg.F, 
29.92[dprime] Hg) from the flowmeter data using the manufacturer's 
prescribed method.
    (ii) The air flow rate is then converted to pump flow, 
V<INF>o</INF>, in cubic feet per revolution at absolute pump inlet 
temperature and pressure:

    (iii) The correlation function at each test point is then calculated 
from the calibration data.

Where:

PPO = Pressure head at pump outlet, inches fluid (kPa).

    (iv) A linear least squares fit is performed to generate the 
calibration equation which has the form:

    V<INF>o</INF>=D<INF>o</INF> - M(X<INF>o</INF>)

    D<INF>o</INF> and M are the intercept and slope constants, 
respectively, describing the regression lines.
    (8) A CVS system that has multiple speeds should be calibrated on 
each speed used. The calibration curves generated for the ranges will be 
approximately parallel and the intercept values, D<INF>o</INF>, will 
increase as the pump flow range decreases.
    (9) If the calibration has been performed carefully, the calculated 
values from the equation will be within <plus-minus>0.50 percent of the 
measured value of V<INF>o</INF>. Values of M will vary from one pump to 
another, but values of D<INF>o</INF> for pumps of the same make, model 
and range should agree within <plus-minus>3 percent of each other. 
Particulate influx over time will cause the pump slip to decrease, as 
reflected by lower values for M. Calibrations should be performed at 
pump start-up and after major maintenance to assure the stability of the 
pump slip rate. Analysis of mass injection data will also reflect pump 
slip stability.

    (d) CFV calibration. (1) Calibration of the CFV is based upon the 
flow equation for a critical venturi. Gas flow is a function of inlet 
pressure and temperature:

    (4) Set up equipment as shown in Figure N84-7 and eliminate leaks. 
(Leaks between the flow measuring devices and the critical flow venturi 
will seriously affect the accuracy of the calibration.)
    (5) Set the variable flow restrictor to the open position, start the 
blower, and allow the system to stabilize. Record data from all 
instruments.
    (6) Vary the flow restrictor and make at least eight readings across 
the critical flow range of the venturi.
    (7) Data analysis. The data recorded during the calibration are to 
be used in the following calculations:
    (i) The air flow rate, Qs, at each test point is calculated in 
standard cubic feet per minute from the flow meter data using the 
manufacturer's prescribed method.
    (ii) Calculate values of the calibration coefficient for each test 
point:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.207

    (iii) Plot K<INF>v</INF> as a function of venturi inlet pressure. 
For choked flow, K<INF>v</INF> will have a relatively constant value. As 
pressure decreases (vacuum increases), the venturi becomes unchoked and 
K<INF>v</INF> decreases. (See Figure N84-8.)

[[Page 255]]

<GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>

    (iv) For a minimum of 8 points in the critical region calculate an 
average K<INF>v</INF> and the standard deviation.
    (v) If the standard deviation exceeds 0.3 percent of the average 
K<INF>v</INF>, take corrective action.
    (e) CVS system verification. The following ``gravimetric'' technique 
can be used to verify that the CVS and analytical instruments can 
accurately measure a mass of gas that has been injected into the system. 
(Verification can also be accomplished by constant flow metering using 
critical flow orifice devices.)
    (1) Obtain a small cylinder that has been charged with pure propane.
    (2) Determine the weight of the reference propane cylinder to an 
accuracy of <plus-minus>0.2 percent or less of the actual amount of 
propane discharged into the system.
    (3) Operate the CVS in the normal manner and release a quantity of 
pure propane into the system during the sampling period (approximately 5 
minutes).
    (4) The calculations of Sec. 86.1342 are performed in the normal way 
except in the case of propane. The density of propane (17.30 g/
ft<SUP>3</SUP>/carbon atom (0.6109 kg/m<SUP>3</SUP>/carbon atom)) is 
used in place of the density of exhaust hydrocarbons.
    (5) The gravimetric mass is subtracted from the CVS measured mass 
and then divided by the gravimetric mass to determine the percent 
accuracy of the system.
    (6) Good engineering practice requires that the cause for any 
discrepancy greater than <plus-minus> 2 percent must be found and 
corrected.

    (a) The CVS is calibrated using an accurate flowmeter and restrictor 
valve. The flowmeter calibration shall be traceable to the NBS, and will 
serve as the reference value (NBS ``true'' value) for the CVS 
calibration. (Note: In no case should an upstream screen or other 
restriction which can affect the

flow be used ahead of the flowmeter unless calibrated throughout the 
flow range with such a device.) The CVS calibration procedures are 
designed for use of a ``metering venturi'' type flowmeter. Large radius 
or ASME flow nozzles are considered equivalent if traceable to NBS 
measurements. Other measurement systems may be used if shown to be 
equivalent under the test conditions in this section and traceable to 
NBS measurements. Measurements of the various flowmeter parameters are 
recorded and related to flow through the CVS. Procedures used by EPA for 
both PDP-CVS and CFV-CVS are outlined below. Other procedures yielding 
equivalent results may be used if approved in advance by the 
Administrator.
    (b) After the calibration curve has been obtained, verification of 
the entire system may be performed by injecting a known mass of gas into 
the system and comparing the mass indicated by the system to the true 
mass injected. An indicated error does not necessarily mean that the 
calibration is wrong, since other factors can influence the accuracy of 
the system (e.g., analyzer calibration, leaks, or HC hangup). A 
verification procedure is found in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (c) PDP calibration. (1) The following calibration procedure 
outlines the equipment, the test configuration, and the various 
parameters which must be measured to establish the flow rate of the CVS 
pump.
    (i) All the parameters related to the pump are simultaneously 
measured with the parameters related to a flowmeter which is connected 
in series with the pump.
    (ii) The calculated flow rate, ft \3\/min, (at pump inlet absolute 
pressure and temperature) can then be plotted versus a correlation 
function which is the value of a specific combination of pump 
parameters.
    (iii) The linear equation which relates the pump flow and the 
correlation function is then determined.
    (iv) In the event that a CVS has a multiple speed drive, a 
calibration for each range used must be performed.
    (2) This calibration procedure is based on the measurement of the 
absolute values of the pump and flowmeter parameters that relate the 
flow rate at each point. Two conditions must be maintained to assure the 
accuracy and integrity of the calibration curve:
    (i) The temperature stability must be maintained during calibration. 
(Flowmeters are sensitive to inlet temperature oscillations; this can 
cause the data points to be scattered. Gradual changes in temperature 
are acceptable as long as they occur over a period of several minutes.)
    (ii) All connections and ducting between the flowmeter and the CVS 
pump must be absolutely void of leakage.
    (3) During an exhaust emission test the measurement of these same 
pump parameters enables the user to calculate the flow rate from the 
calibration equation.
    (4) Connect a system as shown in Figure N84-6. Although particular 
types of equipment are shown, other configurations that yield equivalent 
results may be used if approved in advance by the Administrator. For the 
system indicated, the following measurements and accuracies are 
required:

    (5) After the system has been connected as shown in Figure N84-6, 
set the variable restrictor in the wide open position and run the CVS 
pump for 20 minutes. Record the calibration data.
    (6) Reset the restrictor valve to a more restricted condition in an 
increment of pump inlet depression that will yield a minimum of six data 
points for the total calibration. Allow the system to stabilize for 3 
minutes and repeat the data acquisition.
    (7) Data analysis:
    (i) The air flow rate, Q<INF>s</INF>, at each test point is 
calculated in standard cubic feet per minute (68 deg., 29.92 in. Hg.) 
from the flowmeter data using the manufacturer's prescribed method.
    (ii) The air flow rate is then converted to pump flow, 
V<INF>o</INF>, in cubic feet per revolution at absolute pump inlet 
temperature and pressure:

V<INF>o</INF> = (Q<INF>s/n</INF>) x (T<INF>p</INF>/528) x (29.92/
P<INF>p</INF>)

Where:
    (A) V<INF>o</INF> = Pump flow, ft\3\/rev (m\3\/rev) at 
T<INF>p</INF>, P<INF>p</INF>.
    (B) Q<INF>s</INF> = Meter air flow rate in standard cubic feet per 
minute, standard conditions are 68  deg.F, 29.92 in. Hg (20  deg.C, 
101.3 kPa).
    (C) n = Pump speed in revolutions per minute.
    (D) T<INF>p</INF> = Pump inlet temperature  deg.R( deg.K) = PTI + 
460 ( deg.R), or = PTI + 273 ( deg.K).
    (E) P<INF>p</INF> = Absolute pump inlet pressure, in. Hg. (kPa)
    = P<INF>B</INF> - PPI(Sp.Gr./13.5955) and
    = PB - PPI for SI units.

Where:
    (F) P<INF>B</INF> = barometric pressure, in. Hg. (kPa).
    (G) PPI = Pump inlet depression, in. fluid (kPa).
    (H) Sp.Gr. = Specific gravity of manometer fluid.
    (iii) The correlation function at each test point is then calculated 
from the calibration data:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.209


Where:
    (A) X<INF>o</INF> = correlation function.
    (B) D<INF>p</INF> = The pressure differential from pump inlet to 
pump outlet, in. Hg. (kPa).
    = P<INF>e-Pp</INF>.
    (C) P<INF>e</INF> = Absolute pump outlet pressure, in. Hg. (kPa)
    = P<INF>B</INF> + PPO (Sp.Gr./13.5955) and
    = P<INF>B</INF> + PPO for SI units.

Where:
    (D) PPO = Pressure head at pump outlet, in. fluid (kPa).
    (iv) A linear least squares fit is performed to generate the 
calibration equation which has the form:
    V<INF>o</INF> = D<INF>o</INF> - M(X<INF>o</INF>)
    D<INF>o</INF> and M are the intercept and slope constants, 
respectively, describing the regression line.
    (8) A CVS system that has multiple speeds should be calibrated on 
each speed used. The calibration curves generated for the ranges will be 
approximately parallel and the intercept values, D<INF>o</INF>, will 
increase as the pump flow range decreases.
    (9) If the calibration has been performed carefully, the calculated 
values from the equation will be within <plus-minus>0.50 percent of the 
measured value of V<INF>o</INF>.

[[Page 258]]

Values of M will vary from one pump to another, but values of 
D<INF>o</INF> for pumps of the same make, model and range should agree 
within <plus-minus>3 percent of each other. Particulate influx over time 
will cause the pump slip to decrease, as reflected by lower values for 
M. Calibrations should be performed at pump start-up and after major 
maintenance to assure the stability of the pump slip rate. Analysis of 
mass injection data will also reflect pump slip stability.
    (d) CFV calibration. (1) Calibration of the CFV is based upon the 
flow equation for a critical venturi. Gas flow is a function of inlet 
pressure and temperature:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.210


Where:
    (i) Q<INF>s</INF> = flow.
    (ii) K<INF>v</INF> = calibration coefficient.
    (iii) P = absolute pressure.
    (iv) T = absolute temperature.
    The calibration procedure described in paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section establishes the value of the calibration coefficient at measured 
values of pressure, temperature and air flow.
    (2) The manufacturer's recommended procedure shall be followed for 
calibrating electronic portions of the CFV.
    (3) Measurements necessary for flow calibration are as follows:

    (4) Set up equipment as shown in Figure N84-7 and eliminate leaks. 
(Leaks between the flow measuring devices and the critical flow venturi 
will seriously affect the accuracy of the calibration.)
    (5) Set the variable flow restrictor to the open position, start the 
blower, and allow the system to stabilize. Record data from all 
instruments.
    (6) Vary the flow restrictor and make at least eight readings across 
the critical flow range of the venturi.
    (7) Data analysis. The data recorded during the calibration are to 
be used in the following calculations:
    (i) The air flow rate, Q<INF>s,</INF> at each test point is 
calculated in standard cubic feet per minute from the flow meter data 
using the manufacturer's prescribed method.
    (ii) Calculate values of the calibration coefficient for each test 
point:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC07JA94.021


Where:
    (A) Q<INF>s</INF> = Flow rate in standard cubic feet per minute, at 
the standard conditions of 68  deg.F, 29.92 in Hg (20  deg.C, 101.3 
kPa).
    (B) T<INF>v</INF> = Temperature at venturi inlet,  deg.R( deg.K).
    (C) P<INF>v</INF> = Pressure at venturi inlet, in. Hg. (kPA)
         = P<INF>B</INF> - PPI (Sp.GR./13.5955), and
         = P<INF>B</INF> - PPI for SI units.

Where:
    (D) PPI = Venturi inlet pressure depression, in. fluid (kPa).
    (E) Sp.Gr. = Specific gravity of manometer fluid.
    (iii) Plot K<INF>v</INF> as a function of venturi inlet pressure. 
For choked flow, K<INF>v</INF> will have a relatively constant value. As 
pressure decreases (vacuum increases),

[[Page 259]]

the venturi becomes unchoked and K<INF>v</INF> decreases. (See Figure 
N84-8.)
    (iv) For a minimum of 8 points in the critical region calculate an 
average K<INF>v</INF> and the standard deviation.
    (v) If the standard deviation exceeds 0.3 percent of the average 
K<INF>v</INF>, take corrective action.
    (8) Calculation of a parameter for monitoring sonic flow in the CFV 
during exhaust emissions tests:
    (i) Option 1. (A) CFV pressure ratio. Based upon the calibration 
data selected to meet the criteria for paragraphs (d)(7)(iv) and (v) of 
this section, in which K<INF>v</INF> is constant, select the data values 
associated with the calibration point with the lowest absolute venturi 
inlet pressure. With this set of calibration data, calculated the 
following CFV pressure ratio limit, Pr<INF>ratio-lim</INF>:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18FE00.024


Where:
P<INF>in-cal</INF> = Venturi inlet pressure (PPI in absolute pressure 
    units), and
P<INF>out-cal</INF> = Venturi outlet pressure (PPO in absolute pressure 
    units), measured at the exit of the venturi diffuser outlet.

    (B) The venturi pressure ratio (Pr<INF>ratio-i</INF>) during all 
emissions tests must be less than, or equal to, the calibration pressure 
ratio limit (Pr<INF>ratio-lim</INF>) derived from the CFV calibration 
data, such that:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18FE00.025



Where:
P<INF>in-i</INF> and P<INF>out-i</INF> are the venturi inlet and outlet 
    pressures, in absolute pressure units, at each i-th interval during 
    the emissions test.

    (ii) Option 2. Other methods: With prior Administrator approval, any 
other method may be used that assure that the venturi operates at sonic 
conditions during emissions tests, provided the method is based upon 
sound engineering principles.
    (e) SSV calibration. (1) The calibration of the SSV located in the 
tunnel shall be conducted in a similar manner as the CFV or PDP 
calibration. Gas flow within the SSV is a function of inlet pressure, 
P<INF>1</INF>, the inlet temperature, T<INF>1</INF>, and the pressure 
drop between the throat and the inlet, DP. Note that the following 
procedure is consistent with SAE J244. The calibration procedure 
described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section establishes the values of 
the coefficients at measured values of pressure, temperature and 
airflow.
    (i) The flow rate for a subsonic venturi is calculated as a 
volumetric flow rate (Q<INF>s</INF>) or a mass flow rate (Q<INF>m</INF>) 
as follows: or

[rho]<INF>s</INF> = Density at inlet conditions, lbm/ft<SUP>3</SUP> (kg/
m<SUP>3</SUP>), as specified in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section.
C<INF>d</INF> = Coefficient of Discharge = Actual Air Flow/Theoretical 
Air Flow.
Y = Expansion factor, as specified in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this 
section.
d = Throat diameter, inch (mm).
[beta] = Ratio of venturi throat diameter to approach pipe diameter.

(kPa).

    (ii) The expansion factor (Y) is calculated as follows:

    (iii) The inlet density ([rho]1) is calculated as follows:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JA01.068
    
Where:
P<INF>abs</INF> = P<INF>1</INF>+P<INF>B</INF>
T<INF>abs</INF> = T<INF>1</INF> + 2731

R<INF>u</INF> = 8.3144 kJ/kg-mole-K
MW<INF>mix</INF> = the molecular weight of the mix, as calculated in 
paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section.

    (iv) The molecular weight of the mix, is calculated as follows:

    (v) The density at standard conditions of 101.33 kPa and 20  deg.C 
is calculated as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JA01.015

    (2) The venturi manufacturer's recommended procedure shall be 
followed for calibrating electronic portions of the SSV.
    (3) Measurements necessary for flow calibration of the SSV are as 
follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (4) Set up equipment similar to CFV or PDP calibration except the 
variable flow restrictor valve can be deleted or set in the open 
position, and the pressure drop reading device must be added. The 
calibration test must be conducted with the test subsonic venturi in 
place in its permanent position. Any subsequent changes in upstream or 
downstream configuration could cause a shift in calibration. Leaks 
between the calibration metering device and the SSV must be eliminated.
    (5) Adjust the variable flow blower or restrictor valve to its 
maximum in-use flow rate. Allow the system to stabilize and record data 
from all instruments. Be sure to avoid choke condition.
    (6) Vary the flow through a minimum of eight steps covering the 
intended in-use operating range of the SSV.
    (7) Data analyses. If the calibration venturi is used at the tunnel 
inlet (free standing), then assume a value of [beta]=0. If the SSV 
installed in the CVS tunnel, use the actual inside tunnel diameter and 
the throat diameter to compute [beta].
    (i) Assume an initial value for Cd = 0.98 to calculate Q<INF>m</INF> 
for the calculation of Reynolds number, Re,:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JA01.016

Where: [mu] = viscosity of air, centipoise
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JA01.017

K<INF>[mu]</INF>=1.458E-3
T<INF>K</INF>=(T<INF>1</INF>  deg.C+273.16)

    (ii) From the initial calibration of the venturi, establish an 
equation of Cd as a function of Re. The following functional forms 
should be reviewed, but a power series, least-squares fit polynomial 
equation may result in the best fit. Many factors involved in the 
installation of SSV and the operating range of the Reynolds number can 
affect the functional relationship of the Cd with Re. Calculate Cd based 
on this initial equation of Re. Compute a final Q<INF>m</INF> based on 
this calculated Cd for both the calibration nozzle and the inline SSV.
    (8)(i) Compute the percent difference in air flow between the 
calibration venturi and the inline SSV. If the difference in percent of 
point is greater than 1%, compute a new Cd and Re for the in-tunnel 
venturi as follows:

Cd<INF>new</INF>=Actual Air Flow/Theoretical Air Flow=Qm<INF>act</INF> /
    Qm<INF>theo</INF>
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JA01.018
    
    (ii) Qm<INF>act</INF> is flow measured by the calibration venturi 
and Qm<INF>theo</INF> is the theoretical calculated flow based on the 
in-tunnel SSV conditions with Cd set equal to 1. Re<INF>new</INF> is 
based on the calibrated venturi flow, but the in-tunnel SSV properties. 
Recalculate a new curve fit of Cd<INF>new</INF> for the inline venturi 
as a function of Re<INF>new</INF> following the guidelines in paragraph 
(e)(7) of this section. Agreement of the fit should be within 1.0% of 
point. Install the new Cd curve fit in the test cell flow computing 
device and conduct the propane injection, flow verification test.
    (f) CVS system verification. The following ``gravimetric'' technique 
can be used to verify that the CVS and analytical instruments can 
accurately measure a mass of gas that has been injected into the system. 
(Verification can also be accomplished by constant flow metering using 
critical flow orifice devices.)
    (1) Obtain a small cylinder that has been charged with pure propane 
or carbon monoxide gas (CAUTION--carbon monoxide is poisonous).

[[Page 262]]

    (2) Determine a reference cylinder weight to the nearest 0.01 grams.
    (3) Operate the CVS in the normal manner and release a quantity of 
pure propane into the system during the sampling period (approximately 5 
minutes).
    (4) Following completion of step (3) above (if methanol injection is 
required), continue to operate the CVS in the normal manner and release 
a known quantity of pure methanol (in gaseous form) into the system 
during the sampling period (approximately five minutes). This step does 
not need to be performed with each verification, provided that it is 
performed at least twice annually.
    (5) The calculations of Sec. 86.1342 are performed in the normal way 
except in the case of propane. The density of propane (17.30 g/ft\3\/
carbon atom (0.6109 kg/m\3\/carbon atom)) is used in place of the 
density of exhaust hydrocarbons. In the case of methanol, the density of 
37.71 g/ft\3\ (1.332 kg/m\3\) is used.
    (6) The gravimetric mass is subtracted from the CVS measured mass 
and then divided by the gravimetric mass to determine the percent 
accuracy of the system.
    (7) The cause for any discrepancy greater than <plus-minus>2 percent 
must be found and corrected. (For 1991-1995 calendar years, 
discrepancies greater than <plus-minus>2 percent are allowed for the 
methanol test, provided that they do not exceed <plus-minus>6 percent.)
    (8) The Administrator, upon request, may waive the requirement to 
comply with <plus-minus>2 percent methanol recovery tolerance, and 
instead require compliance with a higher tolerance (not to exceed 
<plus-minus>6 percent), provided that:
    (i) The Administrator determines that compliance with these 
specified tolerances is not practically feasible; and
    (ii) The manufacturer makes information available to the 
Administrator which indicates that the calibration tests and their 
results are consistent with good laboratory practice, and that the 
results are consistent with the results of calibration testing conducted 
by the Administrator.

Sec. 86.1320-90  Gas meter or flow instrumentation calibration; particulate, 
methanol, and formaldehyde measurement.

    (a) Sampling for particulate, methanol and formaldehyde emissions 
requires the use of gas meters or flow instrumentation to determine flow 
through the particulate filters, methanol impingers and formaldehyde 
impingers. These instruments shall receive initial and periodic 
calibrations as follows:
    (1)(i) Install a calibration device in series with the instrument. A 
critical flow orifice, a bellmouth nozzle, or a laminar flow element or 
an NBS traceable flow calibration device is required as the standard 
device.
    (ii) The flow system should be checked for leaks between the 
calibration and sampling meters, including any pumps that may be part of 
the system, using good engineering practice.
    (2) Flow air through the calibration system at the sample flow rate 
used for particulate, methanol, and formaldehyde testing and at the 
backpressure which occurs during the sample test.
    (3) When the temperature and pressure in the system have stabilized, 
measure the indicated gas volume over a time period of at least five 
minutes or until a gas volume of at least <plus-minus>1 percent accuracy 
can be determined by the standard device. Record the stabilized air 
temperature and pressure upstream of the instrument and as required for 
the standard device.
    (4) Calculate air flow at standard conditions as measured by both 
the standard device and the instrument(s). (Standard conditions are 
defined as 68  deg.F (20  deg.C) and 29.92 in Hg (101.3 kPa).)
    (5) Repeat the procedures of paragraphs (a) (2) through (4) of this 
section using at least two flow rates which bracket the typical 
operating range.

[[Page 263]]

    (6) If the air flow at standard conditions measured by the 
instrument differs by <plus-minus>1.0 percent of the maximum operating 
range or <plus-minus>2.0 percent of the point (whichever is smaller), 
then a correction shall be made by either of the following two methods:
    (i) Mechanically adjust the instrument so that it agrees with the 
calibration measurement at the specified flow rates using the criteria 
of paragraph (a)(6) of this section, or
    (ii) Develop a continuous best fit calibration curve for the 
instrument (as a function of the calibration device flow measurement) 
from the calibration points to determine corrected flow. The points on 
the calibration curve relative to the calibration device measurements 
must be within <plus-minus>1.0 percent of the maximum operating range of 
<plus-minus>2.0 percent of the point (whichever is smaller).
    (7) For double dilution systems, the accuracy of the secondary 
dilution flow measurement device should be within <plus-minus>1.0 
percent of the total flow through the filter.
    (b) Other systems. A bell prover may be used to calibrate the 
instrument if the procedure outlined in ANSI B109.1-1973 is used. Prior 
approval by the Administrator is not required to use the bell prover.

Sec. 86.1321-90  Hydrocarbon analyzer calibration.

    The FID hydrocarbon analyzer shall receive the following initial and 
periodic calibration. The HFID used with petroleum-fueled diesel engines 
shall be operated to a set point <plus-minus>10  deg.F (<plus-minus>5.5 
deg.C) between 365 and 385  deg.F (185 and 197  deg.C). The HFID used 
with methanol-fueled engines shall be operated at 235<plus-minus>15 
deg.F (113<plus-minus>8  deg.C).
    (a) Initial and periodic optimization of detector response. Prior to 
introduction into service and at least annually thereafter, the FID 
hydrocarbon analyzer shall be adjusted for optimum hydrocarbon response.
    (1) Follow good engineering practices for initial instrument start-
up and basic operating adjustment using the appropriate fuel (see 
Sec. 86.1314) and zero-grade air.
    (2) Optimize the FID's response on the most common operating range. 
The response is to be optimized with respect to fuel pressure or flow 
while meeting the analyzer response time given in 
Sec. 86.1310(b)(3)(vii)(A) for continuous HC measurement. Efforts shall 
be made to minimize response variations to different hydrocarbon species 
that are expected to be in the exhaust. Good engineering judgement is to 
be used to trade off optimal FID response to propane-in-air against 
reductions in relative responses to other hydrocarbons. A good example 
of trading off response on propane for relative responses to other 
hydrocarbon species is given in Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) 
Paper No. 770141, ``Optimization of Flame Ionization Detector for 
Determination of Hydrocarbon in Diluted Automotive Exhausts''; author 
Glenn D. Reschke. It is also required that the response be set to 
optimum condition with respect to air flow and sample flow. Heated Flame 
Ionization Detectors (HFIDs) must be at their specified operating 
temperature.
    (3) One of the following procedures is to be used for FID or HFID 
optimization:
    (i) Use the procedures outlined in Society of Automotive Engineers 
(SAE) paper No. 770141, ``Optimization of Flame Ionization Detector for 
Determination of Hydrocarbons in Diluted Automobile Exhaust''; author, 
Glenn D. Reschke, as an example.
    (ii) The HFID optimization procedures outlined in 40 CFR part 86, 
subpart D, Sec. 86.331-79(c).
    (iii) Alternative procedures may be used if approved in advance by 
the Administrator.
    (iv) The procedures specified by the manufacturer of the FID or 
HFID.
    (4) After the optimum fuel, air, and sample pressures or flow rates 
have been determined, they shall be recorded for future reference.
    (b) Initial and periodic calibration. Prior to introduction into 
service and monthly thereafter, the FID or HFID hydrocarbon analyzer 
shall be calibrated on all normally used instrument ranges. Use the same 
flow rate and pressures as when analyzing samples. Calibration gases 
shall be introduced directly at the analyzer, unless the

[[Page 264]]

``overflow'' calibration option of Sec. 86.1310(b)(3)(i) for the HFID is 
taken.
    (1) Adjust analyzer to optimize performance.
    (2) Zero the hydrocarbon analyzer with zero-grade air.
    (3) Calibrate on each used operating range with a minimum of 6, 
approximately equally spaced, propane-in-air calibration gases (e.g., 
15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 percent of that range). For each range 
calibrated, if the deviation from a least-squares best-fit straight line 
is within <plus-minus>2 percent of the value at each non-zero data point 
and within <plus-minus>0.3 percent of full scale on the zero data point, 
then concentration values may be calculated by using the linear 
calibration equation for that range. If the deviation exceeds these 
limits, then the best-fit non-linear equation which represents the data 
within these limits shall be used to determine concentration values.
    (c) FID response factor to methanol. When the FID analyzer is to be 
used for the analysis of hydrocarbon samples containing methanol, the 
methanol response factor of the analyzer shall be established. The 
methanol response factor shall be determined at several concentrations 
in the range of concentrations in the exhaust sample.
    (1) The bag sample of methanol for analysis in the FID shall be 
prepared using the apparatus shown in Figure N90-10. A known volume of 
methanol is injected, using a microliter syringe, into the heated mixing 
zone (250  deg.F (121  deg.C)) of the apparatus. The methanol is 
vaporized and swept into the sample bag with a known volume of zero-
grade air measured by a dry gas meter.

[[Page 265]]

<GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>

    (2) The bag sample is analyzed using the FID.
    (3) The FID response factor, r, is calculated as follows:

    r = FIDppm/SAMppm

    Where:
    (i) r = FID response factor.
    (ii) FIDppm = FID reading in ppmC.
    (iii) SAMppm = methanol concentration in the sample bag in ppmC.

samples or gas bottles meeting the requirements of Sec. 86.1314.
    (1) The bag sample of methanol for analysis in the FID, if used, 
shall be prepared using the apparatus shown in Figure N94-10. A known 
volume of methanol is injected, using a microliter syringe, into the 
heated mixing zone (250  deg.F (121  deg.C)) of the apparatus. The

be at least 10 percent unreacted NO at this point. Record the 
concentration of residual NO.
    (8) Switch the oxides of nitrogen analyzer to the NO<INF>X</INF> 
mode and measure total NO<INF>X</INF>. Record this value.
    (9) Switch off the NO<INF>X</INF> generator but maintain gas flow 
through the system. The oxides of nitrogen analyzer will indicate the 
NO<INF>X</INF> in the NO + O<INF>2</INF> mixture. Record this value.
    (10) Turn off the NO<INF>X</INF> generator O<INF>2</INF> (or air) 
supply. The analyzer will now indicate the NO<INF>X</INF> in the 
original NO-in-N<INF>2</INF> mixture. This value should be no more than 
5 percent above the value indicated in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
    (11) Calculate the efficiency of the NO<INF>X</INF> converter by 
substituting the concentrations obtained into the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.212

Where:

a = concentration obtained in paragraph (a)(8),
b = concentration obtained in paragraph (a)(9),
c = concentration obtained in paragraph (a)(6),
d = concentration obtained in paragraph (a)(7).


If converter efficiency is not greater than 90 percent corrective action 
will be required.
    (b) Initial and periodic calibration. Prior to its introduction into 
service and monthly thereafter, the chemiluminescent oxides of nitrogen 
analyzer shall be calibrated on all normally used instrument ranges. Use 
the same flow rate as when analyzing samples. Proceed as follows:
    (1) Adjust analyzer to optimize performance.
    (2) Zero the oxides of nitrogen analyzer with zero-grade air or 
zero-grade nitrogen.
    (3) Calibrate on each used operating range with a minimum of 6, 
approximately equally spaced, NO-in-N<INF>2</INF> calibration gases 
(e.g., 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 percent of that range). For each range 
calibrated, if the deviation from a least-squares best-fit straight line 
is within <plus-minus>2 percent of the value at each non-zero data point 
and within <plus-minus>0.3 percent of full scale on the zero data point, 
then concentration values may be calculated using the linear calibration 
equation for that range. If the deviation exceeds these limits, then the 
best-fit non-linear equation which represents the data within these 
limits shall be used to determine concentration values.
    (c) The initial and periodic interference, system check, and 
calibration test procedures specified in 40 CFR part 86, subpart D, may 
be used in lieu of the procedures specified in this section.
    (d) When testing methanol-fueled engines it may be necessary to 
clean the analyzer frequently to prevent interference with 
NO<INF>X</INF> measurements (see EPA/60/S3-88/040).

Sec. 86.1323-2007  Oxides of nitrogen analyzer calibration.

    This section describes the initial and periodic calibration of the 
chemiluminescent oxides of nitrogen analyzer.
    (a) Prior to introduction into service and at least monthly 
thereafter, the chemiluminescent oxides of nitrogen analyzer must be 
checked for NO2 to NO converter efficiency. The Administrator may 
approve less frequent checks of the converter efficiency. Figure N84-9 
is a reference for paragraphs (a) (1) through (11) of this section.
    (1) Follow good engineering practices for instrument start-up and 
operation. Adjust the analyzer to optimize performance.
    (2) Zero the oxides of nitrogen analyzer with zero-grade nitrogen.

[[Page 272]]

    (3) Connect the outlet of the NO<INF>X</INF> generator to the sample 
inlet of the oxides of nitrogen analyzer, which has been set to the most 
common operating range.
    (4) Introduce into the NO<INF>X</INF> generator-analyzer system an 
NO-in-nitrogen (N2) mixture with an NO concentration equal to 
approximately 80 percent of the most common operating range. The NO2 
content of the gas mixture shall be less than 5 percent of the NO 
concentration.
    (5) With the oxides of nitrogen analyzer in the NO mode, record the 
concentration of NO indicated by the analyzer.
    (6) Turn on the NO<INF>X</INF> generator O2 supply and adjust the O2 
flow rate so that the NO indicated by the analyzer is about 10 percent 
less than indicated in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. Record the 
concentration of NO in this NO + O2 mixture.
    (7) Switch the NO<INF>X</INF> generator to the generation mode and 
adjust the generation rate so that the NO measured by the analyzer is 20 
percent of that measured in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. There must 
be at least 10 percent unreacted NO at this point. Record the 
concentration of residual NO.
    (8) Switch the oxides of nitrogen analyzer to the NO<INF>X</INF> 
mode and measure total NO<INF>X</INF>. Record this value.
    (9) Switch off the NO<INF>X</INF> generator but maintain gas flow 
through the system. The oxides of nitrogen analyzer will indicate the 
NO<INF>X</INF> in the NO + O2 mixture. Record this value.
    (10) Turn off the NO<INF>X</INF> generator O2 supply. The analyzer 
will now indicate the NO<INF>X</INF> in the original NO-in-N2 mixture. 
This value should be no more than 5 percent above the value indicated in 
paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
    (11) Calculate the efficiency of the NO<INF>X</INF> converter by 
substituting the concentrations obtained into the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18JA01.019

Where:
a = concentration obtained in paragraph (a)(8) of this section,
b = concentration obtained in paragraph (a)(9) of this section,
c = concentration obtained in paragraph (a)(6) of this section,
d = concentration obtained in paragraph (a)(7) of this section.

    (12) If converter efficiency is not greater than 90 percent, repair 
the analyzer. The repaired analyzer must achieve a converter efficiency 
greater than 90 percent before the analyzer may be used.
    (b) Accuracy. The accuracy at the minimum limit of the 
NO<INF>X</INF> analyzer is defined in Sec. 86.1338-2007. In general the 
analyzer's minimum limit shall be the lowest concentration within a 
given range, in which it has an accuracy of <plus-minus>2 percent of 
point.
    (c) Initial and periodic calibration. Prior to its introduction into 
service and monthly thereafter, the chemiluminescent oxides of nitrogen 
analyzer shall be calibrated on all normally used instrument ranges. Use 
the same flow rate as when analyzing samples. Proceed as follows:
    (1) Adjust analyzer to optimize performance.
    (2) Zero the oxides of nitrogen analyzer with zero-grade nitrogen 
(N2).
    (3) (i) Calibrate all operating ranges with a minimum of 9 NO-in-N2 
calibration gases (e.g., 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 percent 
of that range) and one zero-grade N2 gas. Sound engineering judgment 
shall dictate appropriate spacing and weighting of the calibration 
points.
    (ii) For each range calibrated, if all deviations from a least-
squares best-fit straight line are within <plus-minus>2 percent of the 
value at each non-zero data point and within <plus-minus>0.3 percent of 
full scale on the zero data point, then concentration values may be 
calculated using the linear calibration equation for that range. If the 
specified deviations are exceeded for ranges that have a minimum limit 
of 1 ppm or greater, then the best-fit non-linear equation that 
represents the data within these deviations may be used to determine 
concentration values. For ranges that have a minimum limit less than 1 
ppm, only a linear or second order non-linear equation that represents 
the data within these deviations, may be used to determine concentration 
values.
    (d) Chemiluminescent NO<INF>X</INF> analyzer interference check 
(i.e., quench check).

[[Page 273]]

Prior to its introduction into service and at least once per year 
thereafter, the quench check described in this section shall be 
performed on CLD NO<INF>X</INF> analyzers. CO2 and water vapor interfere 
with the response of a CLD by collisional quenching. The combined quench 
effect at their highest expected concentrations shall not exceed 2 
percent.
    (1) CO<INF>2</INF> quench check procedure: (i) For the procedure 
described in this paragraph, variations are acceptable provided that 
they produce equivalent %CO2<INF>quench</INF> results. Connect a 
pressure-regulated CO<INF>2</INF> span gas to one of the inlets of a 
three-way valve. Its CO2 concentration should be approximately twice the 
maximum CO<INF>2</INF> concentration expected during testing. The valve 
must be leak-free, and its wetted parts must be made of a stainless 
steel or other inert material. Connect a pressure-regulated zero-grade 
N<INF>2</INF> gas to the other inlet of the three-way valve. Connect the 
single outlet of the valve to the balance-gas port of a properly 
operating gas divider. Connect a pressure-regulated NO span gas, which 
has approximately twice the typical NO concentration expected during 
testing, to the span-port of the gas divider. Configure the gas divider 
such that nearly equal amounts of the span gas and balance gas are 
blended with each other. Viscosity corrections shall be applied 
appropriately to ensure correct mass flow determinations.
    (ii) With the CO<INF>2</INF> flowing to the balance port and the NO 
flowing to the span port, measure a stable CO<INF>2</INF> concentration 
from the gas divider's outlet with a properly calibrated NDIR analyzer. 
Record this concentration in percent (%); this is ``%CO<INF>2</INF>''. 
This value will be used in the water vapor quench check calculations 
that are detailed in the following section. After the %CO<INF>2</INF> 
measurement, measure the NO concentration at the gas divider outlet with 
the CLD analyzer in the NO mode. Record this concentration in ppm; this 
is ``NO<INF>CO2</INF>''. Then switch the three-way valve such that 100 
percent N<INF>2</INF> flows to the balance port inlet. Monitor the 
CO<INF>2</INF> concentration of the gas divider's outlet until its 
concentration stabilizes at zero. Then measure the stable NO 
concentration from the gas divider's outlet. Record this value in ppm; 
this is ``NO<INF>N2</INF>''. Calculate %CO<INF>2quench</INF> as follows:

%CO<INF>2quench</INF> = (1.00-(NO<INF>CO2</INF>/NO<INF>N2</INF>)) x 100

    (2) Water vapor quench check procedure:
    (i) For all dry CLD analyzers it must be demonstrated that for the 
highest expected water vapor concentration (i.e., 
``%H<INF>2</INF>O<INF>exp</INF>'' as calculated later in this section), 
the water removal technique maintains CLD humidity at less than or equal 
to 5 g<INF>water</INF>/kg<INF>dry air</INF> (or about 0.008 percent 
H<INF>2</INF>O), which is 100% RH at 3.9  deg.C and 101.3 kPa. This 
humidity specification is also equivalent to about 25% RH at 25  deg.C 
and 101.3 kPa. This may be demonstrated by measuring the temperature at 
the outlet of a thermal dehumidifier, or by measuring humidity at a 
point just upstream of the CLD. Humidity of the CLD exhaust might also 
be measured as long as the only flow into the CLD is the flow out of the 
dehumidifier.
    (ii) For all ``wet'' CLD analyzers the following water vapor quench 
check procedure shall be followed. Measure an NO span gas, which has 90% 
to 100% of the typical NO expected during testing, using the CLD in the 
NO mode. Record this concentration in ppm; this is ``NO<INF>dry</INF>''. 
Then bubble the same NO span gas through distilled water in a sealed 
vessel at 25  deg.C <plus-minus>10  deg.C. This temperature 
specification imposed to ensure that the H<INF>2</INF>O<INF>vol</INF> 
calculation (refer to (iii) of this section) returns an accurate result. 
To prevent subsequent condensation, this temperature must also be less 
than any temperature that the wetted sample will experience between the 
sealed vessel's outlet and the CLD. Record the vessel's water 
temperature in  deg.C; this is ``T<INF>sat</INF>''. Record the vessel's 
absolute pressure in kPa; this is ``P<INF>sat</INF>''. Measure the 
wetted span gas with the CLD, and record this value in ppm; this is 
``NO<INF>wet</INF>''.
    (iii) Calculations for water quench must consider dilution of the NO 
span gas with water vapor and scaling of the water vapor concentration 
to that expected during testing.
    (A) Calculate the volume fraction of water vapor in the wetted span 
gas, as H<INF>2</INF>O<INF>vol</INF> = (exp(3.69-(81.28/
T<INF>sat</INF>)) + 1.61)/P<INF>sat</INF>. This calculation approximates 
some of the thermodynamic properties of water

[[Page 274]]

based on the ``1995 Formulation for the Thermodynamic Properties of 
Ordinary Water Substance for General and Scientific Use'', issued by The 
International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS). 
However, this approximation should only be used as prescribed in this 
section because it is an exponential fit that is accurate for data at 25 
 deg.C <plus-minus>10  deg.C. Then, assuming a diesel fuel atomic 
hydrogen to carbon ratio of 1.8, and an intake and dilution air humidity 
of 75 grains (10.71 g<INF>water</INF>/kg<INF>dry air</INF> or 54.13 
percent RH at 25  deg.C and 101.3 kPa),
    (B) Calculate the maximum percent water vapor expected during 
testing; as %H<INF>2</INF>O<INF>exp</INF> = (0.90 x %CO<INF>2</INF>) + 
1.69. %CO<INF>2</INF> is the value measured during the %CO<INF>2</INF> 
quench check.
    (C) Calculate the expected wet concentration of NO in ppm; as 
NO<INF>exp</INF> = NO<INF>dry</INF> x (1.00-
H<INF>2</INF>O<INF>vol</INF>)

    (iv) Calculate the percent water vapor quench as:

%H<INF>2</INF>O<INF>quench</INF> = ((NO<INF>exp</INF>-NO<INF>wet</INF>)/
    NO<INF>exp</INF>) x (%H<INF>2</INF>O<INF>exp</INF>/
    H<INF>2</INF>O<INF>vol</INF>)

    (3) Add the %CO<INF>2quench</INF> and the 
%H<INF>2</INF>O<INF>quench</INF> values. Their sum may not exceed the 
limit set in paragraph (d). If their sum is greater than this limit, 
then the CLD instrument may not be used to perform testing unless it is 
repaired. The analyzer must be shown to pass this quench check after the 
repair before it may be used for testing.

Sec. 86.1324-84  Carbon dioxide analyzer calibration.

    Prior to its introduction into service and monthly thereafter, the 
NDIR carbon dioxide analyzer shall be calibrated as follows:
    (a) Follow good engineering practices for instrument start-up and 
operation. Adjust the analyzer to optimize performance.
    (b) Zero the carbon dioxide analyzer with either zero-grade air or 
zero-grade nitrogen.
    (c) Calibrate on each used operating range with a minimum of 6, 
approximately equally spaced, carbon dioxide-in-N<INF>2</INF> 
calibration or span gases (e.g., 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 percent of 
that range). For each range calibrated, if the deviation from a least-
squares best-fit straight line is within <plus-minus>2 percent or less 
of the value at each non-zero data point and within <plus-minus>0.3 
percent of full scale on the zero data point, then concentration values 
may be calculated by using the linear calibration equation for that 
range. If the deviation exceeds these limits, then the best-fit non-
linear equation which represents the data within these limits shall be 
used to determine concentration values.
    (d) The initial and periodic interference, system check, and 
calibration test procedures specified in 40 CFR part 86, subpart D, may 
be used in lieu of the procedures in this section.

methane analyzer shall be calibrated:
    (a) Follow the manufacturer's instructions for instrument startup 
and operation. Adjust the analyzer to optimize performance.
    (b) Zero the methane analyzer with zero-grade air.
    (c) Calibrate on each used operating range with a minimum of 6, 
approximately equally spaced, CH4 in air calibration gases (e.g., 15, 
40, 45, 60, 75, and 90 percent of that range). For each range 
calibrated, if the deviation from a least-squares best-fit straight line 
is within <plus-minus>2 percent of the value at each non-zero data point 
and within <plus-minus>0.3 percent of full scale on the zero data point, 
then concentration values may be calculated by using the linear 
calibration equation for that range. If the deviation exceeds these 
limits, then the best-fit non-linear equation which represents the data 
within these limits shall be used to determine concentration values.

Sec. 86.1327-90  Engine dynamometer test procedures; overview.

    (a) The engine dynamometer test procedure is designed to determine 
the brake specific emissions of hydrocarbons, nonmethane hydrocarbons 
carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, particulate, methanol and 
formaldehyde, as applicable. The test procedure consists of a ``cold'' 
start test following either natural or forced cool-down periods 
described in Secs. 86.1334 and 86.1335, respectively. A ``hot'' start 
test follows the ``cold'' start test after a hot soak of 20 minutes. The 
idle test of subpart P of this part may be run after the ``hot'' start 
test. The exhaust emissions are diluted with ambient air and a 
continuous proportional sample is collected for analysis during both the 
cold- and hot-start tests. The composite samples collected are analyzed 
either in bags or continuously for hydrocarbons (HC), methane 
(CH<INF>4</INF>--as applicable), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide 
(CO<INF>2</INF>), and oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>), or in sample 
collection impingers for methanol (CH<INF>3</INF>OH) and sample 
collection impingers (or cartridges) for formaldehyde (HCHO). 
Measurement of CH<INF>3</INF>OH and HCHO may be omitted for 1990 through 
1994 model year methanol-fueled engines when a FID calibrated on 
methanol is used. A bag or continuous sample of the dilution air is 
similarly analyzed for background levels of hydrocarbon, carbon 
monoxide, carbon dioxide, and oxides of nitrogen and, if appropriate, 
methane and/or methanol and/or formaldehyde. In addition, for diesel-
cycle engines, particulates are collected on fluorocarbon-coated glass 
fiber filters or fluorocarbon-based (membrane) filters, and the dilution 
air may be prefiltered.
    (b) Engine torque and rpm command set points shall be issued at 5 
(10 Hz recommended) Hz or greater during both the cold and hot start 
tests. Feedback engine torque and rpm shall be recorded at least once 
every second during the test.
    (c) Using the torque and rpm feedback signals the brake horsepower 
is integrated with respect to time for the cold and hot cycles. This 
produces a brake horsepower-hour value that enables the brake-specific 
emissions to be determined (see Sec. 86.1342, Calculations; gaseous 
exhaust emissions., and Sec. 86.1343, Calculations; particulate exhaust 
emissions.).
    (d)(1) When an engine is tested for exhaust emissions or is operated 
for service accumulation on an engine dynamometer, the complete engine 
shall be tested, with all emission control devices installed and 
functioning.
    (2) Evaporative emission controls need not be connected if data are 
provided to show that normal operating conditions are maintained in the 
engine induction system.
    (3) On air-cooled engines, the fan shall be installed.
    (4) Additional accessories (e.g., oil cooler, alternators, air 
compressors, etc.) may be installed or their loading simulated if 
typical of the in-use application.
    (5) The engine may be equipped with a production type starter.
    (e) Means of engine cooling which will maintain the engine operating 
temperatures (e.g., temperatures of intake air, oil, water, etc.) at 
approximately the same temperature as specified by the manufacturer 
shall be used. Auxiliary fan(s) may be used to maintain engine cooling 
during operation on the dynamometer. Rust inhibitors and lubrication 
additives may be used, up to the levels recommended by the additive 
manufacturer. Antifreeze mixtures and other coolants typical of those 
approved for use by the manufacturer may be used.
    (f) Exhaust system. The exhaust system shall meet the following 
requirements:
    (1) Gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled Otto-cycle engines. A 
chassis-type exhaust system shall be used. For all catalyst systems, the 
distance from the exhaust manifold flange(s) to the catalyst shall be 
the same as in the vehicle configuration unless the manufacturer 
provides data showing equivalent performance at another location. The 
catalyst container may be removed during all test sequences prior to the 
practice

[[Page 276]]

cycle, and replaced with an equivalent container having an inactive 
catalyst support.
    (2) Petroleum-fueled and methanol-fueled diesel engines. Either a 
chassis-type or a facility-type exhaust system or both systems 
simultaneously may be used. If the engine is equipped with an exhaust 
aftertreatment device, the exhaust pipe must be the same diameter as 
found in-use for at least 4 pipe diameters upstream to the inlet of the 
beginning of the expansion section containing the aftertreatment device. 
The exhaust backpressure or restriction shall follow the same criteria 
as in Sec. 86.1330-90(f) and may be set with a valve (muffler omitted). 
The catalyst container may be removed during all test sequences prior to 
the practice cycle, and replaced with an equivalent container having an 
inactive catalyst support.
    (i) The engine exhaust system shall meet the following requirements:
    (A) The total length of the tubing from the exit of the engine 
exhaust manifold, turbocharger outlet or aftertreatment device to the 
primary dilution tunnel shall not exceed 32 feet (9.8 m).
    (B) The initial portion of the exhaust system may consist of a 
typical in-use (i.e., length, diameter, material, etc.) chassis-type 
exhaust system.
    (C) The distance from the exhaust manifold flange(s) or turbocharger 
outlet to any exhaust aftertreatment device shall be the same as in the 
vehicle configuration or within the distance specifications provided by 
the manufacturer.
    (D) For engines which are not equipped with exhaust aftertreatment 
devices, all tubing in excess of 12 feet (3.7 m) from the exit of the 
turbocharger or exhaust manifold shall be insulated. For engines 
equipped with exhaust aftertreatment devices, all tubing after the 
aftertreatment device which is in excess of 12 feet (3.7 m) shall be 
insulated.
    (E) If the tubing is required to be insulated, the radial thickness 
of the insulation must be at least 1.0 inch (25 mm). The thermal 
conductivity of the insulating material must have a value no greater 
than 0.75 BTU-in/hr/ft\2\/  deg.F (0.065 W/m-K) measured at 700  deg.F 
(371  deg.C).
    (F) A smoke meter or other instrumentation may be inserted into the 
exhaust system tubing. If this option is exercised in the insulated 
portion of the tubing, then a minimal amount of tubing not to exceed 18 
inches may be left uninsulated. However, no more than 12 feet (3.66 m) 
of tubing can be left uninsulated in total, including the length at the 
smoke meter.
    (ii) The facility-type exhaust system shall meet the following 
requirements:
    (A) It must be composed of smooth tubing made of typical in-use 
steel or stainless steel. This tubing shall have a maximum inside 
diameter of 6.0 in (15 cm).
    (B) Short sections (altogether not to exceed 20 percent of the 
entire tube length) of flexible tubing at connection points are allowed.

Sec. 86.1327-94  Engine dynamometer test procedures; overview.

    (a) The engine dynamometer test procedure is designed to determine 
the brake specific emissions of hydrocarbons, nonmethane hydrocarbons 
(for natural gas-fueled engines only), carbon monoxide, oxides of 
nitrogen, particulate (petroleum-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied 
petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled diesel engines), and methanol 
and formaldehyde (for methanol-fueled diesel engines). The test 
procedure consists of a ``cold'' start test following either natural or 
forced cool-down periods described in Secs. 86.1334 and 86.1335, 
respectively. A ``hot'' start test follows the ``cold'' start test after 
a hot soak of 20 minutes. The idle test of subpart P may be run after

[[Page 277]]

methanol (CH<INF>3</INF>OH) and sample collection impingers (or 
capsules) for formaldehyde (HCHO). Measurement of CH<INF>3</INF>OH and 
HCHO may be omitted for 1990 through 1994 model year methanol-fueled 
engines when a FID calibrated on methanol is used. A bag or continuous 
sample of the dilution air is similarly analyzed for background levels 
of hydrocarbon, methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and oxides of

    (b) Engine torque and rpm command set points shall be issued at 5 
(10 Hz recommended) Hz or greater during both the cold and hot start 
tests. Feedback engine torque and rpm shall be recorded at least once

produces a brake horsepower-hour value that enables the brake-specific

Sec. 86.1327-96  Engine dynamometer test procedures; overview.

    (a) The engine dynamometer test procedure is designed to determine 
the brake specific emissions of hydrocarbons, nonmethane hydrocarbons, 
carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, particulate, methanol and 
formaldehyde, as applicable. The test procedure consists of a ``cold'' 
start test following either natural or forced cool-down periods 
described in Secs. 86.1334 and 86.1335, respectively. A ``hot'' start 
test follows the ``cold'' start test after a hot soak of 20 minutes. The 
idle test of subpart P of this part may be run after the ``hot'' start 
test. The exhaust emissions are diluted with ambient air and a 
continuous proportional sample is collected for analysis during both the 
cold- and hot-start tests. The composite samples collected are analyzed 
either in bags or continuously for hydrocarbons (HC), methane 
(CH<INF>4</INF>) carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO<INF>2</INF>), 
and oxides of nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>), or in sample collection 
impingers for methanol (CH<INF>3</INF>OH) and sample collection 
impingers (or cartridges) for formaldehyde (HCHO), as applicable. 
Measurement of CH<INF>3</INF>OH and HCHO may be omitted for 1990 through 
1994 model year methanol-fueled engines when a FID calibrated on 
methanol is used. A bag or continuous sample of the dilution air is 
similarly analyzed for background levels of hydrocarbon, carbon 
monoxide, carbon dioxide, and oxides of nitrogen and, if appropriate, 
methane and/or methanol and/or formaldehyde. In addition, for diesel-
cycle engines, particulates are collected on fluorocarbon-coated glass 
fiber filters or fluorocarbon-based (membrane) filters, and the dilution 
air may be prefiltered.
    (b) Engine torque and rpm command set points shall be issued at 5 
(10 Hz recommended) Hz or greater during both the cold and hot start 
tests. Feedback engine torque and rpm shall be recorded at least once 
every second during the test.
    (c) Using the torque and rpm feedback signals, integrate the brake 
horsepower with respect to time for the cold and hot cycles. This 
produces a brake horsepower-hour value that enables the brake-specific 
emissions to be determined (see Secs. 86.1342 and 86.1343).
    (d)(1) When an engine is tested for exhaust emissions or is operated 
for service accumulation on an engine dynamometer, the complete engine 
shall be tested, with all emission control devices installed and 
functioning.
    (2) For gasoline- and methanol-fueled engines, evaporative emission 
canisters

[[Page 279]]

must be loaded with fuel vapors and connected to the engine. The 
canisters used for testing must be of the same design as those used in 
engine applications.
    (3) On air-cooled engines, the fan shall be installed.
    (4) Additional accessories (e.g., oil cooler, alternators, air 
compressors, etc.) may be installed or their loading simulated if 
typical of the in-use application.
    (5) The engine may be equipped with a production-type starter.
    (e) Means of engine cooling that will maintain the engine operating

shall be used. An auxiliary fan(s) may be used to maintain engine 
cooling during operation on the dynamometer. Rust inhibitors and 
lubrication additives may be used, up to the levels recommended by the 
additive manufacturer. Antifreeze mixtures and other coolants typical of 
those approved for use by the manufacturer may be used.

chassis-type exhaust system shall be used. For all catalyst systems, the 
distance from the exhaust manifold flange(s) to the catalyst shall be 
the same as in the vehicle configuration unless the manufacturer 
provides data showing equivalent performance at another location. The 
catalyst container may be removed during all test sequences prior to the 
practice cycle, and replaced with an equivalent container having an 
inactive catalyst support.
    (2) Petroleum-fueled and methanol-fueled diesel engines. Either a 
chassis-type or a facility-type exhaust system or both systems 
simultaneously may be used. If the engine is equipped with an exhaust 
aftertreatment device, the exhaust pipe must be the same diameter as 
found in-use for at least 4 pipe diameters upstream to the inlet of the 
beginning of the expansion section containing the aftertreatment device. 
The exhaust backpressure or restriction shall follow the same criteria

outlet to any exhaust aftertreatment device shall be the same as in the 
vehicle configuration or within the distance specifications provided by 
the manufacturer.

devices, all tubing in excess of 12 feet (3.7 m) from the exit of the 
turbocharger or exhaust manifold shall be insulated. For engines 
equipped with exhaust aftertreatment devices, all tubing after the 
aftertreatment device which is in excess of 12 feet (3.7 m) shall be 
insulated.
    (E) If the tubing is required to be insulated, the radial thickness 
of the insulation must be at least 1.0 inch (25 mm). The thermal 
conductivity of the insulating material must have a value no greater 
than 0.75 BTU-in/hr/ft<SUP>2</SUP>/  deg.F (0.065 W/m-K) measured at 700 
 deg.F (371  deg.C).
    (F) A smoke meter or other instrumentation may be inserted into the 
exhaust system tubing. If this option is exercised in the insulated

Sec. 86.1332-90  Engine mapping procedures.

    (a) Mount test engine on the engine dynamometer.
    (b) Determine minimum mapping speed. The minimum speed is defined as 
the warm engine curb idle rpm.

[[Page 284]]

    (c) Determine maximum mapping speed per the following methodologies. 
(Note paragraph (d)(1) below.)
    (1) Otto-cycle engines. (i) For ungoverned engines using the 
transient operating cycle set forth in paragraph (f)(1) of appendix I to 
this part, the maximum mapping speed shall be no less than that 
calculated from the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.213


or when a 3.0 percent drop in maximum horsepower occurs, whichever of 
the two is greater
    (ii) For ungoverned engines using the transient operating cycle set 
forth in paragraph (f)(3) of appendix I to this part, the maximum 
mapping shall be no less than that calculated from the following 
equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.214


or when a 3.0 percent drop in maximum horsepower occurs, whichever of 
the two is greater
    (iii) For governed engines the maximum mapped speed shall be no less 
than either that speed at which the wide-open throttle torque drops off 
to zero, or the maximum speed as calculated for ungoverned engines 
(paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section)
    (2) Diesel engines. (i) For ungoverned engines, the maximum mapping 
speed shall be no less than that calculated from the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.215


or when a 3.0 drop in horsepower occurs, whichever of the two is greater
    (ii) For governed engines, the maximum mapping speed shall be no 
less than either that speed at which wide-open throttle torque drops off 
to zero, or the maximum speed as calculated for ungoverned engines 
(paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section).
    (d) Perform an engine power map.
    (1) During engine preparation or warm-up, the engine may be operated 
such that a preliminary estimate of measured rated rpm can be made.
    (2) Otto-cycle engines. (i) For a cold engine, start the engine and 
operate at zero load in accordance with the manufacturer's start-up and 
warm-up procedures for 1 minute <plus-minus>30 seconds.
    (ii) Operate the engine at a torque equivalent to 10<plus-minus>3 
percent of the most recent determination of maximum torque for 4 minutes 
<plus-minus>30 seconds at 2000 rpm.
    (iii) Operate the engine at a torque equivalent to 55<plus-minus>5 
percent of the most recent determination of maximum torque for 35 
minutes <plus-minus>1 minute at 2000 rpm.
    (iv) Operate the engine at idle (minimum speed).
    (v) Open the throttle fully.
    (vi) While maintaining wide-open throttle and full-load, maintain 
minimum engine speed for at least 15 seconds. Record the average torque 
during the last 5 seconds.

[[Page 285]]

    (vii) In no greater than 100<plus-minus>20 rpm increments, determine 
the maximum torque curve from minimum speed to maximum speed. Hold each 
test point for 15 seconds, and record the average torque over the last 5 
seconds.
    (viii) Alternate mappinq technique. In place of paragraphs (d)(2) 
(vi) and (vii) of this section, a continual sweep of rpm is allowed. 
While operating at wide-open throttle, the engine speed is increased at 
an average rate of 8 rpm/sec (<plus-minus>1 rpm/sec) from minimum speed 
to maximum speed. Speed and torque points shall be recorded at a sample 
rate of at least one point per second.
    (ix) Recalculate the maximum speed per paragraph (c)(1) (i) or (ii) 
of this section using the measured rated speed derived from the new 
maximum torque curve. If the new maximum speed lies outside the range of 
speeds encompassed by the actual map, then the map shall be considered 
void, and another map will need to be run using the newly derived 
measured rated speed in all calculations.
    (x) For warm engines, the entire warm-up procedure specified in 
paragraphs (d)(2) (i) through (iii) of this section need not be 
repeated. It is sufficient for an engine already at normal operating 
temperatures to be operated at the conditions specified in paragraph 
(d)(2)(iii) of this section until oil and water temperatures are 
stabilized, after which the procedures of paragraph (d)(2) (iv) through 
(vii) of this section may be performed. The oil and water temperatures 
are defined as stabilized if they are maintained within 2 percent of 
point for 2 minutes.
    (3) Diesel engines. (i) If the engine is cold, start and operate at 
free idle for 2 to 3 minutes.
    (ii) Operate the engine at approximately 50 percent power at the 
peak torque speed for 5 to 7 minutes.
    (iii) Operate the engine at rated speed and wide-open throttle for 
25 to 30 minutes.
    (iv) Option. The engine may be pre-conditioned by operating at rated 
speed and maximum horsepower until the oil and water temperatures are 
stabilized. The temperatures are defined as stabilized if they are 
maintained within 2 percent of point for 2 minutes. This optional 
procedure may be substituted for paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section.
    (v) Unload the engine and operate at the curb idle speed.
    (vi) Operate the engine at wide open throttle and minimum engine 
speed. Increase the engine speed at an average rate of 8 rpm/sec 
(<plus-minus>1 rpm/sec) from minimum to maximum speed. Engine speed and 
torque points shall be recorded at a sample rate of at least one point 
per second.
    (vii) Recalculate the maximum speed per paragraph (c)(2) (i) or (ii) 
of this section using the measured rated speed derived from the new 
maximum torque curve. If the new maximum speed lies outside the range of 
speeds encompassed by the actual map, then the map shall be considered 
void. The entire mapping procedure shall be repeated, using the newly 
derived measured rated speed in all calculations.
    (viii) For warm engines, the entire warm-up procedure specified in 
paragraphs (d)(3) (i) through (iv) of this section need not be repeated. 
It is sufficient for an engine already at normal operating temperatures 
to be operated per the requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this 
section, after which the procedures of paragraph (d)(3) (v) through (vi) 
of this section may be performed.
    (e) Mapping curve generation.
    (1) Otto-cycle engines. (i) Fit all data points recorded under 
paragraphs (d)(2) (vi) and (vii) of this section (100 rpm increments) 
with a cubic spline, Akima, or other technique approved in advance by 
the Administrator. The resultant curve shall be accurate to within 
<plus-minus>1.0 ft-lbs of all recorded engine torques.
    (ii) All points generated under the continuous rpm sweep by 
paragraphs (d)(2) (vi) and (viii) of this section shall be connected by 
linear interpolation between points.
    (iii) For governed engines, all points above the maximum speed (see 
paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section) shall be assigned maximum torque 
values of zero for purposes of cycle generation.
    (iv) For all engines, all speed points below the minimum speed shall 
be assigned a maximum torque value equal to that observed at minimum 
speed for purposes of cycle generation.

[[Page 286]]

    (v) The torque curve resulting from paragraphs (e)(1) (i) through 
(iv) of this section is the mapping curve and will be used to convert 
the normalized torque values in the engine cycle (see paragraph (f)(1) 
of appendix I to this part) to actual torque values for the test cycle.
    (2) Diesel engines. (i) Connect all data points recorded under 
paragraph (d)(3)(vi) of this section using linear interpolation between 
points.
    (ii) For governed engines, all points above the maximum speed (see 
paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section) shall be assigned maximum torque 
values of zero for purposes of cycle generation.
    (iii) For all engines, all speed points below the minimum speed 
shall be assigned a maximum torque value equal to that observed at the 
minimum speed for purposes of cycle generation.
    (iv) The torque curve resulting from paragraphs (e)(2) (i) through 
(iii) of this section is the mapping curve and will be used to convert 
the normalized torque values in the engine cycle (see paragraph (f)(2) 
of appendix I to this part) into actual torque values for the test 
cycle.
    (f) Alternate mapping. If a manufacturer believes that the above 
mapping techniques are unsafe or unrepresentative for any given engine 
or engine family, alternate mapping techniques may be used. These 
alternate techniques must satisfy the intent of the specified mapping 
procedures to determine the maximum available torque at all engine 
speeds achieved during the test cycles. Deviations from the mapping 
techniques specified in this section for reasons of safety or 
representativeness shall be reported per Sec. 86.1344(e)(6), along with 
the justification for their use. In no case, however, shall descending 
continual sweeps of rpm be used for governed or turbocharged engines.
    (g) Replicate Tests. An engine need not be mapped before each and 
every cold cycle test. An engine shall be remapped prior to a cold cycle 
test if:
    (1) An unreasonable amount of time has transpired since the last 
map, as determined by engineering judgment, or
    (2) The barometric pressure prior to the start of the cold cycle 
test has changed more than 1 in hg. from the average barometric pressure 
observed durinq the map, or
    (3) Physical changes or recalibrations have been made to the engine 
which may potentially affect engine performance.

Sec. 86.1333-90  Transient test cycle generation.

    (a) The heavy-duty transient engine cycles for Otto-cycle and diesel 
engines are listed in appendix I ((f) (1), (2) and (3)) to this part. 
These second-by-second listings represent torque and rpm maneuvers 
characteristic of heavy-duty engines. Both rpm and torque are normalized 
(expressed as a percentage of maximum) in these listings.
    (1) To unnormalize rpm, use the following equation:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.216
    

The method of calculating measured rated rpm is detailed in paragraph 
(g) of this section.
    (2) Torque is normalized to the maximum torque at the rpm listed 
with it. Therefore, to unnormalize the torque values in the cycle, the 
maximum torque curve for the engine in question must be used. The 
generation of the maximum torque curve is described in Sec. 86.1332.
    (3) The EPA Engine Dynamometer Schedule for Heavy Duty Diesel 
Engines listed in appendix I (f)(2) contains torque points referred to 
as ``closed rack motoring.'' For reference cycle calculation torque 
points shall take on unnormalized values determined in either of the 
following three ways:

[[Page 287]]

    (i) Negative 40 percent of the positive torque available at the 
associated speed point. The generation of this positive maximum torque 
curve is described in Sec. 86.1332.
    (ii) Map the amount of negative torque required to motor the engine 
between idle and maximum mapping speed and use this map to determine the 
amount of negative torque required at the associated speed point.
    (iii) Determine the amount of negative torque required to motor the 
engine at idle and rated speeds and linearly interpolate using these two 
points.
    (b) Example of the unnormalization procedure. The following test 
point shall be unnormalized:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.219


Given the following values:
    Measured Rated rpm = 3800.
    Curb Idle rpm = 600.
    (1) Calculate actual rpm:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.217
    
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.218
    
    (2) Determine actual torque: Determine the maximum observed torque 
at 1976 rpm from the maximum torque curve. Then multiply this value 
(e.g., 358 ft-lbs) by 0.82. This results in an actual torque of 294 ft-
lbs.
    (c) Engine speed and torque shall be recorded at least once every 
second during the cold start test and hot start test. The torque and rpm 
feedback signals may be filtered.
    (d) Idle Speed Enhancement Devices (e.g. cold idle, alternator idle, 
etc.). For an engine equipped with an idle speed enhancement device, the 
zero percent speed specified in the engine dynamometer schedules 
(appendix I (f)(1), (f)(2), or (f)(3) to this part) does not apply. The 
idle speed shall be the speed that results from the proper operation of 
the engine's idle speed enhancement device.
    (1) During idle speed enhancement device operation, a manual 
transmission engine shall be allowed to idle at whatever speed is 
required to target a feedback torque equal to zero (using, for example, 
clutch disengagement, speed to torque control switching, software 
overrides, etc.) at those points in appendix I(f)(1), (f)(2), or (f)(3) 
to this part where both reference speed and reference torque are zero 
percent values. For each idle segment that is ten seconds or longer, the 
average feedback torque must be within <plus-minus>10 ft-lbs of zero. To 
allow for transition, up to the first four seconds may be deleted from 
each idle segment calculation.
    (2) During idle speed enhancement device operation, an automatic 
transmission engine shall be allowed to idle at whatever speed is 
required to target a feedback torque equal to CITT (see paragraph (e)(2) 
of this section for definition of CITT) at those points in appendix 
I(f)(1), (f)(2), or (f)(3) to this part where both reference speed and 
reference torque are zero percent values. For each idle segment that is 
ten seconds or longer, the average feedback torque must be within 
<plus-minus>10 ft-lbs of CITT. To allow for transition, up to the first 
four seconds may be deleted from each idle segment calculation.
    (e) Automatic transmissions. The reference cycles in paragraphs (f) 
(1) and (2) of appendix I to this part shall be altered for test engines 
intended primarily for use with automatic transmissions.
    (1) Zero percent speed for automatic transmission engines is defined 
as curb idle rpm (i.e., in-vehicle, coupled with automatic transmission 
in gear).
    (2) All zero-percent speed, zero-percent torque points (idle points) 
shall be

[[Page 288]]

modified to zero percent speed, Curb Idle Transmission Torque (CITT), 
except as permitted in Sec. 86.1337-90(a)(9). Also, all points with 
speed equal to or less than zero percent and torque less than CITT shall 
be modified to CITT. Motoring torque shall remain unchanged. In order to 
provide a smooth torque transition, all consecutive torque points that 
are between 0 and CITT shall be changed to CITT if the first of these is 
preceded or the last of these is succeeded by idle points. The 
manufacturer's specified CITT shall be based upon that value observed in 
typical applications at the mean of the manufacturers' specified idle 
speed range at stabilized temperature conditions.
    (f) Clutch operation. Manual transmission engines may be tested with 
a clutch. If used, the clutch shall be disengaged at all zero percent 
speeds, zero percent torque points, but may be engaged up to two points 
preceeding a non-zero point, and may be engaged for time segments with 
zero percent speed and torque points of durations less than four 
seconds. (See Sec. 86.1341 for allowances in the cycle validation 
criteria.)
    (g) Measured rated rpm. The measured rated rpm corresponds to the 
100 percent rpm values specified in the reference cycles (paragraphs (f) 
(1) and (2) of appendix I to this part). It is generally intended to 
represent the rpm at which maximum brake horsepower occurs. For the 
purposes of this test sequence, it shall either be defined as the 
manufacturer's specified rated speed, or calculated in the following 
way, whichever yields the higher speed:
    (1) From the maximum torque curve generated per Sec. 86.1332, find 
the maximum observed brake horsepower of the engine.
    (2) Calculate 98 percent of the observed maximum brake horsepower, 
and determine from the maximum torque curve the highest and lowest 
engine rpms at which this brake horsepower is observed.
    (3) The highest and lowest of the 98 percent power rpms represent 
the endpoints of an rpm range. The midpoint of this range shall be 
considered the measured rated rpm for cycle generation purposes.

Sec. 86.1334-84  Pre-test engine and dynamometer preparation.

    (a) Control system calibration. (1) Before the cold soak or cool 
down:
    (i) Final calibration of the dynamometer and throttle control 
systems may be performed. These calibrations may consist of steady-state 
operations and/or actual practice cycle runs, and must be completed 
before sampling system preconditioning (if applicable).
    (ii) Conduct sampling system preconditioning for diesel engines 
(optional for model years prior to 2007) by operating the engine at a 
condition of rated-speed, 100 percent torque for a minimum of 20 minutes 
while simultaneously operating the CVS and secondary dilution system and 
taking particulate matter emissions samples from the secondary dilution 
tunnel . Particulate sample filters need not be stabilized or weighed, 
and may be discarded. Filter media may be changed during conditioning as 
long as the total sampled time through the filters and sampling system 
exceeds 20 minutes. Flow rates shall be set at the approximate flow 
rates selected for transient testing. Torque shall be reduced from 100 
percent torque while maintaining the rated speed condition as necessary 
to prevent exceeding the maximum sample zone temperature specifications 
of Sec. 86.1310-2007.
    (2) Following sampling system preconditioning cycle, the engine 
shall be cooled per Sec. 86.1335-90.

<R05>
Sec. 86.1335-90  Cool-down procedure.

    (a) This cool-down procedure applies to Otto-cycle and diesel 
engines.
    (b) Engines may be soaked at ambient conditions. No substances or 
fluids may be applied to the engine's internal or external surfaces 
except for water and air as prescribed in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this 
section.

[[Page 289]]

    (c) For water-cooled engines, two types of cooling are permitted:
    (1) Water may be circulated through the engine's water coolant 
system.
    (i) The coolant may be flowed in either direction and at any desired 
flow rate. The thermostat may be removed or blocked open during the 
cool-down but must be restored before the exhaust emissions test begins.
    (ii) The temperature of the circulated or injected water shall be at 
least 10  deg.C (50  deg.F). In addition, the temperature of the cooling 
water shall not exceed 30  deg.C (86  deg.F) during the last 30 minutes 
of the cool-down.
    (iii) Only water, including the use of a building's standard water 
supply, or the coolant type that is already in the engine (per 
Sec. 86.1327-90(e)) is permitted for cool-down purposes.
    (2) Flows of air may be directed at the exterior of the engine.
    (i) The air shall be directed essentially uniformly over the 
exterior surface of the engine at any desired flow rate.
    (ii) The temperature of the cooling air shall not exceed 86  deg.F 
(30  deg.C) during the last 30 minutes of the cool-down, but may be less 
than 68  deg.F (20  deg.C) at any time.
    (d) For air-cooled engines, only cooling as prescribed in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section is permitted.
    (e)(1) The cold cycle exhaust emission test may begin after a cool-
down only when the engine oil and water temperatures are stabilized 
between 68  deg.F and 86  deg.F (20  deg.C and 30  deg.C) for a minimum 
of fifteen minutes.
    (i) These temperature measurements are to be made by temperature 
measurement devices immersed in the sump oil and in the thermostat 
housing or cylinder head cooling circuit, the sensor parts of which are 
not in contact with any engine surface.
    (ii) The flow of oil and water shall be shut off during this 
measurement. Air flow, except as necessary to keep the cell temperature 
between 68  deg.F and 86  deg.F (20  deg.C and 30  deg.C), shall be shut 
off. No engine oil change is permitted during the test sequence.
    (2) Direct cooling of engine oil through the use of oil coolers or 
heat exchangers is permitted. The cold cycle emission test may begin 
only when the requirements in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) are met.
    (3) Any other means for the direct cooling of the engine oil must be 
approved in advance by the Administrator.
    (f)(1) The cold cycle exhaust emission test for engines equipped 
with exhaust aftertreatment devices may begin after a cool-down only 
when the aftertreatment device is 77  deg.F <plus-minus>9  deg.F (25 
deg.C <plus-minus>5  deg.C), in addition to the temperature restrictions 
in paragraph (e) of this section. For catalysts, this temperature must 
be measured at the outlet of the catalyst bed.
    (2) Exhaust aftertreatment device cool-down may be accomplished in 
whatever manner and using whatever coolant deemed appropriate by proper 
engineering judgment. The aftertreatment device, engine, and exhaust 
piping configurations shall not be separated, altered, or moved in any 
way during the cool-down.
    (g) For engines with auxiliary emission control devices which are 
temperature dependent, the cold start shall not begin until the 
temperature readings of the auxiliary emission control devices are 
stable at 77  deg.F <plus-minus>9  deg.F (25  deg.C <plus-minus>5 
deg.C).
    (h) At the completion of the cool-down all of the general 
requirements specified in Sec. 86.1330, the oil temperature 
specification set forth in paragraph (e) of this section, and the 
catalyst temperature specifications in paragraph (f) of this section 
must be met before the cold cycle exhaust emission test may begin.

Sec. 86.1336-84  Engine starting, restarting, and shutdown.

    (a) The engine shall be started according to the manufacturer's 
recommended starting procedure in the owner's manual, using either a 
production starter motor or the dynamometer. The speed at which the 
engine is cranked (motored) with the dynamometer shall be equal to the 
cranking speed (nominal speed <plus-minus>10 percent) in the vehicle 
with a fully charged battery. The time taken to accelerate the engine to 
cranking speed by the dynamometer shall be equal (nominal 
<plus-minus>0.5 seconds) to the time required with a

[[Page 290]]

starter motor. Motoring by the dynamometer shall be terminated not more 
than one second after the engine starts. The 24 <plus-minus>1-second 
free idle period, and declutching if applicable, shall begin when the 
engine is determined to have started.
    (1) Engines equipped with automatic chokes shall be operated 
according to the manufacturer's operating instructions in the owner's 
manual, including choke setting and ``kick-down'' from cold fast idle.
    (2) Engines equipped with manual chokes shall be operated according 
to the manufacturer's operating instructions in the owner's manual.
    (3) The operator may use the choke, throttle, etc. where necessary 
to keep the engine running.
    (4) If the manufacturer's operating instructions in the owner's 
manual do not specify a warm engine starting procedure, the engine 
(automatic and manual choke engines) shall be started by depressing the 
throttle half way and cranking the engine until it starts.
    (b)(1) If the engine does not start after 15 seconds of cranking, 
cranking shall cease and the reason for failure to start shall be 
determined. The gas flow measuring device (or revolution counter) on the 
constant volume sampler (and the hydrocarbon integrator when testing 
diesel-fueled engines) shall be turned off during this diagnostic 
period. In addition, either the CVS should be turned off or the exhaust 
tube disconnected from the tailpipe during the diagnostic period. If 
failure to start is an operational error, the engine shall be 
rescheduled for testing from a cold start.
    (2) If longer cranking times are necessary and recommended to the 
ultimate purchaser, such cranking times may be used in lieu of the 15-
second limit, provided the owner's manual and the service repair manual 
indicate that the longer cranking times are normal.
    (3) If a failure to start occurs during the cold portion of the test 
and is caused by an engine malfunction, corrective action of less than 
30 minutes duration may be taken (according to Sec. 86.084-25), and the 
test continued. The sampling system shall be reactivated at the same 
time cranking begins. When the engine starts, the timing sequence shall 
begin. If failure to start is caused by engine malfunction and the 
engine cannot be started, the test shall be voided and corrective action 
may be taken according to Sec. 86.084-25.
    (4) If a failure to start occurs during the hot start portion of the 
test and is caused by engine malfunction, the engine must be started 
within one minute of key on. The sampling system shall be reactivated at 
the same time cranking begins. When the engine starts, the transient 
engine cycle timing sequence shall begin. If the engine cannot be 
started within one minute of key on, the test shall be voided, 
corrective action taken (according to Sec. 86.084-25), and the engine 
rescheduled for testing.
    (c) Engine stalling. (1) If the engine stalls during the initial 
idle period of either the cold or hot start test, the engine shall be 
restarted immediately using the appropriate cold or hot starting 
procedure and the test continued.
    (2) If the engine stalls anywhere in the cold cycle, except in the 
initial idle period, the test shall be voided.
    (3) If the engine stalls on the hot cycle portion of the test at any 
time other than the initial idle, the engine may be shut off and 
resoaked for 20 minutes. The hot cycle may then be rerun. Only one hot 
start resoak and restart is permitted.
    (d) Engine shutdown. Engine shutdown shall be performed in 
accordance with manufacturer's specifications.
    (e) Test equipment malfunction--(1) Gasoline- and methanol-fueled 
engines. If a malfunction occurs in any of the required test equipment 
during the test run, the test shall be voided.
    (2) Diesel-fueled, natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-
fueled engines. (i) If a malfunction occurs in any of the required test 
equipment during the cold cycle portion of the test, the test shall be 
voided.
    (ii) If a malfunction occurs in any of the required test equipment 
(computer, gaseous emissions analyzer, etc.) during the hot cycle 
portion of the test, complete the full engine cycle before engine shut-
down then resoak for 20 minutes.
    (A) If the test equipment malfunction can be corrected before the 
resoak period has been completed, the hot cycle portion of the test may 
be rerun.

[[Page 291]]

    (B)(1) If the test equipment malfunction is corrected after the 
completion of the resoak period, then the preconditioning cycle must be 
run before the hot cycle. This consists of a full 20 minute transient 
cycle followed by a 20 minute soak and then the for-record hot cycle.
    (2) In no case can the start of the cold cycle and the start of the 
hot cycle be separated by more than 4 hours.

<R05>
Sec. 86.1337-90  Engine dynamometer test run.

    (a) The following steps shall be taken for each test:
    (1) Prepare the engine, dynamometer, and sampling system for the 
cold-start test. Change filters, etc., and leak check as necessary.
    Note: For a single dilution particulate system, a propane check will 
not reveal a pressure side leak (that portion of the system downstream 
of the pump) since the volume concentration in ppm will not change if a 
portion of the sample is lost. A separate leak check is needed.
    A leak check of a filter assembly that has only one seal ring in 
contact with the filter media will not detect a leak when tested under 
vacuum. A pressure leak test should be performed.
    (2) Connect evacuated sample collection bags to the dilute exhaust 
and dilution air sample collection systems.
    (3) For methanol-fueled vehicles, install fresh methanol and 
formaldehyde impingers (or cartridges) in the exhaust and dilution air 
sample systems for methanol and formaldehyde. A single dilution air 
sample covering the total test period may be utilized for methanol and 
formaldehyde background. (Background measurements of methanol and 
formaldehyde may be omitted and concentrations assumed to be zero for 
calculations in Sec. 86.1344.)
    (4) Attach the CVS to the engine exhaust system any time prior to 
starting the CVS.
    (5) Start the CVS (if not already on), the sample pumps (except for 
the particulate sample pump(s), if applicable), the engine cooling 
fan(s), and the data collection system. The heat exchanger of the 
constant volume sampler (if used), and the heated components of any 
continuous sampling system(s) (if applicable) shall be preheated to 
their designated operating temperatures before the test begins. (See 
Sec. 86.1340(e) for continuous sampling procedures.)
    (6) Adjust the sample flow rates to the desired flow rates and set 
the CVS gas flow measuring devices to zero.
    Note: CFV-CVS sample flow rate is fixed by the venturi design.
    (7) For diesel engines tested for particulate emissions, carefully 
install a clean particulate sample filter into each of the filter 
holders and install the assembled filter holders in the sample flow line 
(filter holders may be preassembled).
    (8) Follow the manufacturers choke and throttle instructions for 
cold starting. Simultaneously start the engine and begin exhaust and 
dilution air sampling. For petroleum-fueled diesel engines (and natural 
gas-fueled, liquified petroleum gas-fueled or methanol-fueled diesels, 
if used), turn on the hydrocarbon and NO<INF>X</INF> (and CO and 
CO<INF>2</INF>, if continuous) analyzer system integrators (if used), 
and turn on the particulate sample pumps and indicate the start of the 
test on the data collection medium.
    (9) As soon as it is determined that the engine is started, start a 
``free idle'' timer. Allow the engine to idle freely with no-load for 24 
<plus-minus>1 seconds. This idle period for automatic transmission 
engines may be interpreted as an idle speed in neutral or park. All 
other idle conditions shall be interpreted as an idle speed in gear. It 
is permissible to lug the engine down to curb idle speed during the last 
8 seconds of the free idle period for the purpose of engaging 
dynamometer control loops.
    (10) Begin the transient engine cycles such that the first non-idle 
record of the cycle occurs at 25<plus-minus>1 seconds. The free idle 
time is included in the 25<plus-minus>1 seconds.
    (i) During diesel particulate sampling it must be demonstrated that 
the ratio of main tunnel flow to particulate sample flow does not change 
by more than

[[Page 292]]

<plus-minus>5.0 percent of its set point value (except for the first 10 
seconds of sampling).

    Note: For double dilution operation, sample flow is the net 
difference between the flow rate through the sample filters and the 
secondary dilution air flow rate.

    (ii) Record the average temperature and pressure at the gas meter(s) 
or flow instrumentation inlet, where needed to calculate flow. If the 
set flow rate cannot be maintained because of high particulate loading 
on the filter, the test shall be terminated. The test shall be rerun 
using a lower flow rate and/or a larger diameter filter.
    (11) Begin the transient engine cycles such that the first non-idle 
record of the cycle occurs at 25 <plus-minus>1 seconds. The free idle 
time is included in the 25 <plus-minus>1 seconds.
    (12) On the last record of the cycle, cease sampling. Immediately 
turn the engine off, and start a hot-soak timer. Also turn off the 
particulate sample pumps, the gas flow measuring device(s) and any 
continuous analyzer system integrators and indicate the end of the test 
on the data collection medium. Sampling systems should continue to 
sample after the end of the test cycle until system response times have 
elapsed.
    (13) Immediately after the engine is turned off, turn off the engine 
cooling fan(s) if used, and the CVS blower (or disconnect the exhaust 
system from the CVS). As soon as possible, transfer the ``cold start 
cycle'' exhaust and dilution air bag samples to the analytical system 
and process the samples according to Sec. 86.1340. A stabilized reading 
of the exhaust sample on all analyzers shall be obtained within 20 
minutes of the end of the sample collection phase of the test. Analysis 
of the methanol and formaldehyde samples shall be obtained within 24 
hours of the end of the sample collection period. For petroleum-fueled 
and methanol-fueled diesel engines, carefully remove the filter holder 
from the sample flow apparatus, and remove each particulate sample 
filter from its holder and invert the secondary filter and place it 
stain side to stain side on top of the primary filter. Place the filter 
pair in a petri dish and cover.
    (14) Allow the engine to soak for 20<plus-minus>1 minutes.
    (15) Prepare the engine and dynamometer for the hot start test.
    (16) Connect evacuated sample collection bags to the dilute exhaust 
and dilution air sample collection systems.
    (17) Install fresh methanol and formaldehyde impingers (or capsules) 
in the exhaust and dilution air sample systems for methanol and 
formaldehyde.
    (18) Start the CVS (if not already on) or connect the exhaust system 
to the CVS (if disconnected). Start the sample pumps (except the 
particulate sample pump(s), if applicable), the engine cooling fan(s) 
and the data collection system. The heat exchanger of the constant 
volume sampler (if used) and the heated components of any continuous 
sampling system(s) (if applicable) shall be preheated to their 
designated operating temperatures before the test begins. See 
Sec. 86.1340(e) for continuous sampling procedures.
    (19) Adjust the sample flow rates to the desired flow rate and set

    (20) For diesel engines tested for particulate, carefully install a 
clean particulate filter in each of the filter holders and install 
assembled filter holders in the sample flow line (filter holders may be 
preassembled).
    (21) Follow the manufacturer's choke and throttle instruction for 
hot starting. Simultaneously start the engine and begin exhaust and 
dilution air sampling. For diesel engines, turn on the hydrocarbon and 
NO<INF>X</INF> (and CO and CO<INF>2</INF>, if continuous) analyzer 
system integrators (if used), indicate the start of the test on the data 
collection medium, and turn on the particulate sample pump(s).
    (22) As soon as it is determined that the engine is started, start a 
``free idle'' timer.
    (23) Allow the engine to idle freely with no-load for 24 
<plus-minus>1 seconds. The provisions and interpretations of paragraph 
(a)(9) of this section apply.
    (24) Begin the transient-engine cycle such that the first non-idle 
record of the cycle occurs at 25<plus-minus>1 seconds. The free idle is 
included in the 25<plus-minus>1 seconds.
    (25) On the last record of the cycle, allow sampling system response 
times to elapse and cease sampling. Turn off

[[Page 293]]

the particulate sample pump(s) (if appropriate), the gas flow measuring 
device(s) and any continuous analyzer system integrators and indicate 
the end of the test on the data collection medium.
    (26) As soon as possible, transfer the ``hot start cycle'' exhaust 
and dilution air bag samples to the analytical system and process the 
samples according to Sec. 86.1340. A stabilized reading of the exhaust 
sample on all analyzers shall be obtained within 20 minutes of the end 
of the sample collection phase of the test. Analyze the methanol and 
formaldehyde samples within 24 hours. (If it is not possible to perform 
analysis within 24 hours, the samples should be stored in a cold 
(approximately 0  deg.C) dark environment until analysis can be 
performed). For petroleum-fueled and methanol-fueled diesel engines, 
carefully remove the assembled filter holder from the sample flow lines 
and remove each particulate sample filter from its holder and invert the 
secondary filter and place it stain side to stain side on top of the 
primary filter. Place the filter pairs in a clean petri dish and cover 
as soon as possible. Within 1 hour after the end of the hot start phase 
of the test, transfer the particulate filters to the weighing chamber 
for post-test conditioning.
    (27) The CVS and the engine may be turned off, if desired.
    (b) The procedure in paragraph (a) of this section is designed for 
one sample bag for the cold start portion and one for the hot start 
portion. It is also permissible to use more than one sample bag per test 
portion.
    (c) If a dynamometer test run is determined to be void, corrective 
action may be taken. The engine may then be allowed to cool (naturally 
or forced) and the dynamometer test rerun per paragraph (a) or (b) of 
this section.

Sec. 86.1337-96  Engine dynamometer test run.

    (a) The following steps shall be taken for each test:
    (1) Prepare for the cold-start test. (i) For gasoline- and methanol-
fueled engines only, evaporative emission canisters shall be prepared 
for use in this testing in accordance with the procedures specified in 
Sec. 86.1232-96 (h) or (j). The size of the canisters used for testing 
shall correspond with the largest canister capacity expected in the 
range of vehicle applications for each engine. The Administrator may, at 
his discretion, use a smaller canister capacity. Attach the evaporative 
emission canister(s) to the engine, using the canister purge plumbing 
and controls employed in vehicle applications of the engine being 
tested. Plug the canister port that is normally connected to the fuel 
tank.
    (ii) Prepare the engine, dynamometer, and sampling system.
    (iii) Change filters, etc., and leak check as necessary. For a 
single dilution particulate system, a propane check will not reveal a 
pressure side leak (that portion of the system downstream of the pump) 
since the volume concentration in ppm will not change if a portion of 
the sample is lost. A separate leak check is needed. A leak check of a 
filter assembly that has only one seal ring in contact with the filter 
media will not detect a leak when tested under vacuum. A pressure leak 
test should be performed.
    (2) Connect evacuated sample collection bags to the dilute exhaust 
and dilution air sample collection systems.
    (3) For methanol-fueled vehicles, install fresh methanol and 
formaldehyde impingers (or cartridges) in the exhaust and dilution air 
sample systems for methanol and formaldehyde. A single dilution air 
sample covering the total test period may be utilized for methanol and 
formaldehyde background. (Background measurements of methanol and 
formaldehyde may be omitted and concentrations assumed to be zero for 
calculations in Sec. 86.1344.)
    (4) Attach the CVS to the engine exhaust system any time prior to 
starting the CVS.
    (5) Start the CVS (if not already on), the sample pumps (except for 
the particulate sample pump(s), if applicable), the engine cooling 
fan(s), and the data collection system. The heat exchanger of the 
constant volume sampler (if used), and the heated components of any 
continuous sampling system(s) (if applicable) shall be preheated to 
their

[[Page 294]]

designated operating temperatures before the test begins. (See 
Sec. 86.1340(e) for continuous sampling procedures.)
    (6) Adjust the sample flow rates to the desired flow rates and set 
the CVS gas flow measuring devices to zero. CFV-CVS sample flow rate is 
fixed by the venturi design.
    (7) For diesel engines tested for particulate emissions, carefully 
install a clean particulate sample filter into each of the filter 
holders and install the assembled filter holders in the sample flow line 
(filter holders may be preassembled).
    (8) Follow the manufacturer's choke and throttle instructions for 
cold starting. Simultaneously start the engine and begin exhaust and 
dilution air sampling. For petroleum-fueled diesel engines (and natural 
gas-fueled, liquified petroleum gas-fueled or methanol-fueled diesels, 
if used) turn on the hydrocarbon and NO<INF>X</INF> (and CO and 
CO<INF>2</INF>, if continuous) analyzer system integrators (if used), 
and turn on the particulate sample pumps and indicate the start of the 
test on the data collection medium.
    (9) As soon as it is determined that the engine is started, start a 
``free idle'' timer. Allow the engine to idle freely with no-load for 
24<plus-minus>1 seconds. This idle period for automatic transmission 
engines may be interpreted as an idle speed in neutral or park. All 
other idle conditions shall be interpreted as an idle speed in gear. It 
is permissible to lug the engine down to curb idle speed during the last 
8 seconds of the free idle period for the purpose of engaging 
dynamometer control loops.
    (10) Begin the transient engine cycles such that the first non-idle 
record of the cycle occurs at 25<plus-minus>1 seconds. The free idle 
time is included in the 25<plus-minus>1 seconds.
    (i) During diesel particulate sampling it must be demonstrated that 
the ratio of main tunnel flow to particulate sample flow does not change 
by more than <plus-minus>5.0 percent of its set point value (except for 
the first 10 seconds of sampling). For double dilution operation, sample 
flow is the net difference between the flow rate through the sample 
filters and the secondary dilution air flow rate.
    (ii) Record the average temperature and pressure at the gas meter(s) 
or flow instrumentation inlet, where needed to calculate flow. If the 
set flow rate cannot be maintained because of high particulate loading 
on the filter, the test shall be terminated. The test shall be rerun 
using a lower flow rate and/or a larger diameter filter.
    (11) Begin the transient engine cycles such that the first non-idle 
record of the cycle occurs at 25<plus-minus>1 seconds. The free idle 
time is included in the 25<plus-minus>1 seconds.
    (12) On the last record of the cycle, cease sampling. Immediately 
turn the engine off and start a hot-soak timer. Also turn off the 
particulate sample pumps, the gas flow measuring device(s) and any 
continuous analyzer system integrator and indicate the end of the test 
on the data collection medium. Sampling systems should continue to 
sample after the end of the test cycle until system response times have 
elapsed.
    (13) Immediately after the engine is turned off, turn off the engine 
cooling fan(s) if used, and the CVS blower (or disconnect the exhaust 
system from the CVS). As soon as possible, transfer the ``cold start 
cycle'' exhaust and dilution air bag samples to the analytical system 
and process the samples according to Sec. 86.1340. A stabilized reading 
of the exhaust sample on all analyzers shall be obtained within 20 
minutes of the end of the sample collection phase of the test. Analysis 
of the methanol and formaldehyde samples shall be obtained within 24 
hours of the end of the sample collection period. For petroleum-fueled 
and methanol-fueled diesel engines, carefully remove the filter holder 
from the sample flow apparatus, remove each particulate sample filter 
from its holder and invert the secondary filter and place it stain side 
to stain side on top of the primary filter. Place the filter pair in a 
petri dish and cover.
    (14) Allow the engine to soak for 20<plus-minus>1 minutes.
    (15) Prepare the engine and dynamometer for the hot start test.
    (16) Connect evacuated sample collection bags to the dilute exhaust 
and dilution air sample collection systems.

[[Page 295]]

    (17) Install fresh methanol and formaldehyde impingers (or capsules) 
in the exhaust and dilution air sample systems for methanol and 
formaldehyde.
    (18) Start the CVS (if not already on) or connect the exhaust system 
to the CVS (if disconnected). Start the sample pumps (except the 
particulate sample pump(s), if applicable), the engine cooling fan(s) 
and the data collection system. The heat exchanger of the constant 
volume sampler (if used) and the heated components of any continuous 
sampling system(s) (if applicable) shall be preheated to their 
designated operating temperatures before the test begins. See 
Sec. 86.1340(e) for continuous sampling procedures.
    (19) Adjust the sample flow rates to the desired flow rate and set 
the CVS gas flow measuring devices to zero.
    (20) For diesel engines tested for particulate, carefully install a 
clean particulate filter in each of the filter holders and install 
assembled filter holders in the sample flow line (filter holders may be 
preassembled).
    (21) Follow the manufacturer's choke and throttle instruction for 
hot starting. Simultaneously start the engine and begin exhaust and 
dilution air sampling. For diesel engines, turn on the hydrocarbon and 
NO<INF>X</INF> (and CO and CO<INF>2</INF>, if continuous) analyzer 
system integrator (if used), indicate the start of the test on the data 
collection medium, and turn on the particulate sample pump(s).
    (22) As soon as it is determined that the engine is started, start a 
``free idle'' timer.
    (23) Allow the engine to idle freely with no-load for 
24<plus-minus>1 seconds. The provisions and interpretations of paragraph 
(a)(9) of this section apply.
    (24) Begin the transient-engine cycle such that the first non-idle 
record of the cycle occurs at 25<plus-minus>1 seconds. The free idle is 
included in the 25<plus-minus>1 seconds.
    (25) On the last record of the cycle, allow sampling system response 
times to elapse and cease sampling. Turn off the particulate sample 
pump(s) (if appropriate), the gas flow measuring device(s) and any 
continuous analyzer system integrator and indicate the end of the test 
on the data collection medium.
    (26) As soon as possible, transfer the ``hot start cycle'' exhaust 
and dilution air bag samples to the analytical system and process the 
samples according to Sec. 86.1340. A stabilized reading of the exhaust 
sample on all analyzers shall be obtained within 20 minutes of the end 
of the sample collection phase of the test. Analyze the methanol and 
formaldehyde samples within 24 hours. (If it is not possible to perform 
analysis within 24 hours, the samples should be stored in a cold 
(approximately 0  deg.C) dark environment until analysis can be 
performed). For petroleum-fueled and methanol-fueled diesel engines, 
carefully remove the assembled filter holder from the sample flow lines 
and remove each particulate sample filter from its holder and invert the 
secondary filter and place it stain side to stain side on top of the 
primary filter. Place the filter pairs in a clean petri dish and cover 
as soon as possible. Within 1 hour after the end of the hot start phase 
of the test, transfer the particulate filters to the weighing chamber 
for post-test conditioning.
    (27) The CVS and the engine may be turned off, if desired.
    (b) The procedure in paragraph (a) of this section is designed for 
one sample bag for the cold start portion and one for the hot start 
portion. It is also permissible to use more than one sample bag per test

this section.

<R05>
Sec. 86.1338-84  Emission measurement accuracy.

    (a) Measurement accuracy--Bag sampling. (1) Good engineering 
practice dictates that exhaust emission sample analyzer readings below 
15 percent of full scale chart deflection should generally not be used.
    (2) Some high resolution read-out systems such as computers, data 
loggers, etc., can provide sufficient accuracy and resolution below 15 
percent of full scale. Such systems may be used provided that additional 
calibrations of at least 4 non-zero nominally equally spaced points, 
using good engineering judgement, below 15 percent of full scale are 
made to ensure the accuracy of the calibration curves.
    (3) The following procedure shall be followed:
    (i) Span the analyzer using a calibration gas that meets the 
accuracy requirements of Sec. 86.1314-84(f)(2), is within the operating 
range of the analyzer and at least 90% of full scale.
    (ii) Generate calibration data over the full concentration range at 
a minimum of 6, approximately equally spaced, points (e.g. 15, 30, 45, 
60, 75 and 90 percent of the range of concentrations provided by the gas 
divider). If a gas divider or blender is being used to calibrate the 
analyzer and the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section are 
met, verify that a second calibration gas with a concentration between 
10 and 20 percent of full scale can be named within 2 percent of its 
certified concentration. If more calibration points are needed to meet 
the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, continue with 
paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section.
    (iii) If a gas divider or blender is being used to calibrate the 
analyzer, input the value of a second calibration gas (a span gas may be 
used for calibrating a CO<INF>2</INF> analyzer) having a named 
concentration between 10 and 20 percent of full scale. This gas shall be 
included on the calibration curve. Continue adding calibration points by 
dividing this gas until the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section are met.
    (iv) Fit a calibration curve per Secs. 86.1321 through 86.1324 for 
the full scale range of the analyzer using the calibration data obtained 
with both calibration gases.
    (b) Measurement accuracy--Continuous sampling. (1) Analyzers used 
for continuous analysis must be operated such that the measured 
concentration falls between 15 and 100 percent of full scale chart 
deflection. Exceptions to these limits are:
    (i) Analyzer response less than 15 percent or more than 100 percent 
of full scale may be used if automatic range change circuitry is used 
and the limits for range changes are between 15 and 100 percent of full 
scale chart deflection;
    (ii) Analyzer response less than 15 percent of full scale may be 
used if one of the following is true:
    (A) Alternative (a)(2) of this section is used to ensure that the 
accuracy of the calibration curve is maintained below 15 percent; or
    (B) The full scale value of the range is 155 ppm (C) or less.
    (iii) Analyzer response over 100% of full scale may be used if it 
can be shown that readings in this range are accurate.
    (iv) The HC and CO readings are allowed to ``spike'' above full 
scale of the analyzer's maximum operating range for a maximum 
accumulation of 5 seconds. These analyzer readings shall default to the 
maximum readable value during this time.
    (c) If a gas divider is used, the gas divider shall conform to the 
accuracy requirements specified in Sec. 86.1314-84(g),

[[Page 299]]

and shall be used according to the procedures contained in (a) and (b) 
of this section.

[62 FR 47133, Sept. 5, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 86.1338-2007  Emission measurement accuracy.

    (a) Minimum limit. (1) The minimum limit of an analyzer must be 
equal to or less than one-half of the average diluted concentration for 
an engine emitting the maximum amount of the applicable pollutant 
allowed by the applicable standard. For example, if with a given 
dilution and sampling system, an engine emitting NO<INF>X</INF> at the 
level of the standard (e.g., 0.20 g/bhp-hr NO<INF>X</INF>) would result 
in an average NO<INF>X</INF> concentration of 1.0 ppm in the diluted 
sample, then the minimum limit for the NO<INF>X</INF> analyzer must be 
less than or equal to 0.5 ppm.
    (2) For the purpose of this section, ``minimum limit'' means the 
lowest of the following levels:
    (i) The lowest NO<INF>X</INF> concentration in the calibration curve 
for which an accuracy of <plus-minus>2 percent of point has been 
demonstrated as specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section; or
    (ii) Any NO<INF>X</INF> concentration for which the test facility 
has demonstrated sufficient accuracy to the Administrator's satisfaction 
prior to the start of testing, such that it will allow a meaningful 
determination of compliance with respect to the applicable standard.
    (3) For determination of the analyzer's minimum limit, a 
NO<INF>X</INF> concentration that is less than or equal to one-half of 
the average NO<INF>X</INF> concentration determined in paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section shall be measured by the oxides of nitrogen analyzer 
following the analyzer's monthly periodic calibration. This measurement 
must be made to ensure the accuracy of the calibration curve to within 
<plus-minus>2 percent of point accuracy of the appropriate least-squares 
fit, at less than or equal to one half of the average expected diluted 
NO<INF>X</INF> concentration determined in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section.
    (b) Measurement accuracy--Bag sampling. Analyzers used for bag 
analysis must be operated such that the measured concentration falls 
between 15 and 100 percent of full scale, with the following exception: 
concentrations below 15 percent of full scale may be used if the minimum 
limit of the analyzer within the range meets the requirement of 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Measurement accuracy--Continuous measurement. (1) Analyzers used 
for continuous analysis must be operated such that the measured 
concentration falls between 15 and 100 percent of full scale, with the 
following exceptions:
    (i) Concentrations below 15 percent of full scale may be used if the 
minimum limit of the analyzer within the range meets the requirement of 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (ii) Analyzer response over 100% of full scale may be used if it can 
be shown that readings in this range are accurate.
    (2) If the analyzer response exceeds the level allowed by paragraph 
(c)(1)(ii) of this section, the test must be repeated using a higher 
range and both results must be reported. The Administrator may waive 
this requirement.
    (d) If a gas divider is used, the gas divider shall conform to the 
accuracy requirements specified in Sec. 86.1314-84(g), and shall be used 
according to the procedures contained in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section.

Sec. 86.1339-90  Particulate filter handling and weighing.

    (a) At least 1 hour before the test, place a filter pair in a closed 
(to eliminate dust contamination) but unsealed (to permit humidity 
exchange) petri dish and place in a weighing chamber meeting the 
specifications of Sec. 86.1312 for stabilization.
    (b) At the end of the stabilization period, weigh each filter pair 
on a balance having a precision of 20 micrograms and a readability of 10 
micrograms. This reading is the tare weight of the filter pair and must 
be recorded (see Sec. 86.1344(e)(18)).
    (c) The filter pair shall then be stored in a covered petri dish or 
a sealed filter holder, either of which shall remain in the weighing 
chamber until needed for testing.
    (d) If the filter pair is not used within 1 hour of its removal from 
the weighing chamber, it must be re-weighed before

[[Page 300]]

use. This limit of 1 hour may be replaced by an 8-hour limit if either 
of the following three conditions are met:
    (1) A stabilized filter pair is placed and kept in a sealed filter 
holder assembly with the ends plugged; or
    (2) A stabilized filter pair is placed in a sealed filter holder 
assembly, which is then immediately placed in a sample line through 
which there is no flow; or
    (3) A combination of the conditions specified in paragraphs (d) (1) 
and (2) of this section.
    (e) After the emissions test, remove the filters from the filter 
holder and place them face to face in a covered but unsealed petri dish. 
They must then be conditioned in the weighing chamber for at least one 
hour. The filters are then weighed as a pair. This reading is the gross 
weight of the filters (Pf) and must be recorded (see Sec. 86.1344-
90(e)(19)).
    (f) The net particulate weight (Pf) on each filter pair is the gross 
weight minus the tare weight. Should the sample on the filters (exhaust 
or background) contact the petri dish or any other surface, the test is 
void and must be rerun.
    (g) Static neutralizers shall be used on petri dishes in accordance 
with good engineering judgement.
    (h)This section does not apply for tests conducted according to the 
provisions of Sec. 86.1312-2007.

Sec. 86.1340-90  Exhaust sample analysis.

    (a) The analyzer response may be read by automatic data collection 
(ADC) equipment such as computers, data loggers, etc. If ADC equipment 
is used the following is required:
    (1) For bag analysis, the analyzer response must be stable at 
greater than 99 percent of the final reading for the dilute exhaust 
sample bag. A single value representing the average chart deflection 
over a 10-second stabilized period shall be stored. For the background 
bag, all readings taken during the 10-second interval must be stable at 
the final value to within <plus-minus>1 percent of full scale.
    (2) For continuous analysis systems, the ADC system must read at 
least two analyzer readings per second. A single value representing the 
average integrated concentration over a cycle shall be stored.
    (3) The chart deflections or average integrated concentrations 
required in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section may be stored on 
long-term computer storage devices such as computer tapes, storage 
discs, punch cards, or they may be printed in a listing for storage. In 
either case a chart recorder is not required and records from a chart 
recorder, if they exist, need not be stored.
    (4) If the data from ADC equipment is used as permanent records, the 
ADC equipment and the analyzer values as interpreted by the ADC 
equipment are subject to the calibration specifications in Secs. 86.1316 
through 86.1326, as if the ADC equipment were part of the analyzer.
    (b) Data records from any one or a combination of analyzers may be 
stored as chart recorder records.
    (c) Software zero and span. (1) The use of ``software'' zero and 
span is permitted. The process of software zero and span refers to the 
technique of initially adjusting the analyzer zero and span responses to 
the calibration curve values, but for subsequent zero and span checks 
the analyzer response is simply recorded without adjusting the analyzer 
gain. The observed analyzer response recorded from the subsequent check 
is mathematically corrected back to the calibration curve values for 
zero and span. The same mathematical correction is then applied to the 
analyzer's response to a sample of exhaust gas in order to compute the 
true sample concentration.
    (2) The maximum amount of software zero and span mathematical 
correction is <plus-minus>10 percent of full scale chart deflection.
    (3) Software zero and span may be used to switch between ranges 
without adjusting the gain of the analyzer.
    (4) The software zero and span technique may not be used to mask 
analyzer drift. The observed chart deflection before and after a given 
time period or event shall be used for computing the drift. Software 
zero and span may be used after the drift has been computed to 
mathematically adjust any span drift so that the ``after''

[[Page 301]]

span check may be transformed into the ``before'' span check for the 
next segment.
    (d) For bag sample analysis perform the following sequence:
    (1) Warm-up and stabilize the analyzers; clean and/or replace filter 
elements, conditioning columns (if used), etc., as necessary.
    (2) Obtain a stable zero reading.
    (3) Zero and span the analyzers with zero and span gases. The span 
gases shall have concentrations between 75 and 100 percent of full-scale 
chart deflection. The flow rates and system pressures during spanning 
shall be approximately the same as those encountered during sampling. A 
sample bag may be used to identify the required analyzer range.
    (4) Re-check zero response. If this zero response differs from the 
zero response recorded in paragraph (d)(3) of this section by more than 
1 percent of full scale, then paragraphs (d) (2), (3), and (4) of this 
section should be repeated.
    (5) If a chart recorder is used, identify and record the most recent 
zero and span response as the pre-analysis values.
    (6) If ADC equipment is used, electronically record the most recent 
zero and span response as the pre-analysis values.
    (7) Measure HC (except diesels), CO, CO<INF>2</INF>, and 
NO<INF>X</INF> sample and background concentrations in the sample bag(s) 
with approximately the same flow rates and pressures used in paragraph 
(d)(3) of this section. (Constituents measured continuously do not 
require bag analysis.)
    (8) A post-analysis zero and span check of each range must be 
performed and the values recorded. The number of events that may occur 
between the pre and post checks is not specified. However, the 
difference between pre-analysis zero and span values (recorded in 
paragraph (d) (5) or (6) of this section) versus those recorded for the 
post-analysis check may not exceed the zero drift limit or the span 
drift limit of 2 percent of full scale chart deflection for any range 
used. Otherwise the test is void.
    (e) For continuous sample analysis perform the following sequence:
    (1) Warm-up and stabilize the analyzers; clean and/or replace filter 
elements, conditioning columns (if used), etc., as necessary.
    (2) Leak check portions of the sampling system that operate at 
negative gauge pressures when sampling, and allow heated sample lines, 
filters, pumps, etc., to stabilize at operating temperature.
    (3) Optional: Perform a hang-up check for the HFID sampling system:
    (i) Zero the analyzer using zero air introduced at the analyzer 
port.
    (ii) Flow zero air through the overflow sampling system. Check the 
analyzer response.
    (iii) If the overflow zero response exceeds the analyzer zero 
response by 2 percent or more of the HFID full-scale deflection, hang-up 
is indicated and corrective action must be taken.
    (iv) The complete system hang-up check specified in paragraph (f) of 
this section is recommended as a periodic check.
    (4) Obtain a stable zero reading.
    (5) Zero and span each range to be used on each analyzer used prior 
to the beginning of the cold cycle. The span gases shall have a 
concentration between 75 and 100 percent of full scale chart deflection. 
The flow rates and system pressures shall be approximately the same as 
those encountered during sampling. The HFID analyzer shall be zeroed and 
spanned through the overflow sampling system.
    (6) Re-check zero response. If this zero response differs from the 
zero response recorded in paragraph (e)(5) of this section by more than 
1 percent of full scale, then paragraphs (e) (4), (5), and (6) of this 
section should be repeated.
    (7) If a chart recorder is used, identify and record the most recent 
zero and span response as the pre-analysis values.
    (8) If ADC equipment is used, electronically record the most recent 
zero and span response as the pre-analysis values.
    (9) Measure the emissions (HC required for diesels; NO<INF>X</INF>, 
CO, CO<INF>2</INF> optional) continuously during the cold start cycle. 
Indicate the start of the test, the range(s) used, and the end of the 
test on the recording medium

[[Page 302]]

(chart paper or ADC equipment). Maintain approximately the same flow 
rates and system pressures used in paragraph (e)(5) of this section.
    (10) Collect background HC, CO, CO<INF>2</INF>, and NO<INF>X</INF> 
in a sample bag.
    (11) Perform a post-analysis zero and span check for each range used 
at the conditions specified in paragraph (e)(5) of this section. Record 
these responses as the post-analysis values.
    (12) Neither the zero drift nor the span drift between the pre-
analysis and post-analysis checks on any range used may exceed 3 percent 
for HC, or 2 percent for NO<INF>X</INF>, CO, and CO<INF>2</INF>, of full 
scale chart deflection, or the test is void. (If the HC drift is greater 
than 3 percent of full-scale chart deflection, hydrocarbon hang-up is 
likely.)
    (13) Determine HC background levels for the cold start cycle by 
introducing the background sample into the overflow sample system.
    (14) Determine background levels of NO<INF>X</INF>, CO, or 
CO<INF>2</INF> (if necessary) by the bag technique outlined in paragraph 
(d) of this section.
    (15) Repeat paragraphs (e) (4) through (14) of this section for the 
hot cycle. The post-analysis zero and span check for the cold start (or 
previous hot start) cycle may be used for the pre-analysis zero and span 
for the following hot start cycle.
    (f) HC hang-up. If HC hang-up is indicated, the following sequence 
may be performed:
    (1) Fill a clean sample bag with background air.
    (2) Zero and span the HFID at the analyzer ports.
    (3) Analyze the background air sample bag through the analyzer 
ports.
    (4) Analyze the background air through the entire sample probe 
system.
    (5) If the difference between the readings obtained is 2 percent or 
more of the HFID full scale deflection, clean the sample probe and the 
sample line.
    (6) Reassemble the sample system, heat to specified temperature, and 
repeat the procedure in paragraphs (f) (1) through (6) of this section.
    (g) For CH<INF>3</INF>OH (where applicable), introduce test samples 
into the gas chromatograph and measure the concentration. This 
concentration is C<INF>MS</INF> in the calculations.
    (h) For HCHO (where applicable), introduce test samples into the 
high pressure liquid chromatograph and measure the concentration of 
formaldehyde as a dinitrophenylhydrazine derivative in acetonitrile. 
This concentration is C<INF>FS</INF> in the calculations.

Sec. 86.1341-90  Test cycle validation criteria.

    (a) To minimize the biasing effect of the time lag between the 
feedback and reference cycle values, the entire engine speed and torque 
feedback signal sequence may be advanced or delayed in time with respect 
to the reference speed and torque sequence. If the feedback signals are 
shifted, both speed and torque must be shifted the same amount in the 
same direction.
    (b) Brake horsepower-hour calculation. (1) Calculate the brake 
horsepower-hour for each pair of engine feedback speed and torque values 
recorded. Also calculate the reference brake horsepower-hour for each 
pair of engine speed and torque reference values. Calculations shall be 
to five significant digits.

[[Page 303]]

    (2) In integrating the reference and the feedback horsepower-hour, 
all negative torque values shall be set equal to zero and included. If 
integration is performed at a frequency of less than 5 Hz, and if during 
a given time segment, the torque value changes from positive to negative 
or negative to positive, then the negative portion must be computed by 
linear interpolation and set equal to zero and the positive portion 
included. The same methodology shall be used for integrating both 
reference and actual brake horsepower-hour.
    (c) Regression line analysis to calculate validation statistics. (1) 
Linear regressions of feedback value on reference value shall be 
performed for speed, torque and brake horsepower on 1 Hz data after the 
feedback shift has occurred (see paragraph (a) of this section). The 
method of least squares shall be used, with the best fit equation having 
the form:

y=mx+b

Where:

y = The feedback (actual) value of speed (rpm), torque (ft-lbs), or 
brake horsepower.
m = Slope of the regression line.
x = The reference value (speed, torque, or brake horsepower).
b = The y-intercept of the regression line.

    (2) The standard error of estimate (SE) of y on x and the 
coefficient of determination (r<SUP>2</SUP>) shall be calculated for 
each regression line.
    (3) For a test to be considered valid, the criteria in Figure N90-11 
must be met for both cold and hot cycles individually. Point deletions 
from the regression analyses are permitted where noted in Figure N90-11.

[[Page 306]]



Where:
    (1) A<INF>WM</INF> = Weighted mass emission level (HC, CO,

and, if appropriate, the weighted mass total hydrocarbon equivalent, in 
grams per brake horsepower-hour.

Sec. 86.1360-2007  Supplemental emission test; test cycle and procedures.

    The test procedures of this subpart N apply for supplemental 
emission testing, except as specified otherwise in this section.
    (a) Applicability. This section applies to 2007 and later diesel 
heavy duty engines.
    (b) Test cycle. (1)(i) The following 13-mode cycle must be followed 
in dynamometer operation on the test engine:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) Upon Administrator approval, the manufacturer may use mode 
lengths other than those listed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
    (2) In addition to the 13 test points identified in paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section, for engines not certified to a NO<INF>X</INF> standard 
or FEL less than1.5 g/bhp-hr, EPA may select, and require the 
manufacturer to conduct the test using, up to 3 additional test points 
within the control area (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section). 
EPA will notify the manufacturer of these supplemental test points in 
writing in a timely manner before the test. Emissions sampling for the 
additional test modes must include all regulated gaseous pollutants. 
Particulate matter does not need to be measured.
    (c) Determining engine speeds. (1) The engine speeds A, B and C, 
referenced in the table in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and speeds 
D and E, referenced in Sec. 86.1380, must be determined as follows:

Speed A = n<INF>lo</INF> + 0.25 x (n<INF>hi</INF>-n<INF>lo</INF>)

Speed B = n<INF>lo</INF>+ 0.50 x (n<INF>hi</INF>-n<INF>lo</INF>)

Speed C = n<INF>lo</INF> + 0.75 x (n<INF>hi</INF>-n<INF>lo</INF>)

Speed D = n<INF>hi</INF>

Speed E = n<INF>lo</INF> + 0.15 x (n<INF>hi</INF>-n<INF>lo</INF>)

Where:

n<INF>hi</INF> = High speed as determined by calculating 70% of the 
maximum power. The highest engine speed where this power value occurs on 
the power curve is defined as n<INF>hi</INF>.
n<INF>lo</INF> = Low speed as determined by calculating 50% of the 
maximum power. The lowest engine speed where this power value occurs on 
the power curve is defined as n<INF>lo</INF>.

[[Page 322]]

Maximum power = the maximum observed power calculated according to the 
engine mapping procedures defined in Sec. 86.1332.

    (d) Determining the control area. The control area extends from the 
engine speed A to C, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, and 
extends from 25 to 100 percent load.
    (e) Test requirements--(1) Engine warm-up. Prior to beginning the 
test sequence, the engine must be warmed-up according to the procedures 
in Sec. 86.1332-90(d)(3)(i) through (iv).
    (2) Test sequence. The test must be performed in the order of the 
mode numbers in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Where applicable, the 
EPA-selected test points identified under paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section must be performed immediately upon completion of mode 13. The 
engine must be operated for the prescribed time in each mode, completing 
engine speed and load changes in the first 20 seconds of each mode. The 
specified speed must be held to within <plus-minus>50 rpm and the 
specified torque must be held to within plus or minus two percent of the 
maximum torque at the test speed.
    (3) Particulate sampling. One filter shall be used for sampling PM 
over the 13-mode test procedure. The modal weighting factors specified 
in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be taken into account by 
taking a sample proportional to the exhaust mass flow during each 
individual mode of the cycle. This can be achieved by adjusting sample 
flow rate, sampling time, and/or dilution ratio, accordingly, so that 
the criterion for the effective weighting factors is met. The sampling 
time per mode must be at least 4 seconds per 0.01 weighting factor. 
Sampling must be conducted as late as possible within each mode. 
Particulate sampling shall be completed no earlier than 5 seconds before 
the end of each mode.
    (4) The test must be conducted with all emission-related engine 
control variables in the highest brake-specific NO<INF>X</INF> emissions 
state which could be encountered for a 30 second or longer averaging 
period at the given test point and for the conditions under which the 
engine is being tested.
    (5) Exhaust emissions measurements and calculations. Manufacturers 
must follow the exhaust emissions sample analysis procedures under 
Sec. 86.1340, and the calculation formulas and procedures under 
Sec. 86.1342, for the 13-mode cycle and the 3 EPA-selected test points 
as applicable for steady-state testing, including the NO<INF>X</INF> 
correction factor for humidity.
    (6) Calculating the weighted average emissions. (i) For each 
regulated gaseous pollutant, the weighted average emissions must be 
calculated as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC00.008

Where:

A<INF>WA</INF> = Weighted average emissions for each regulated gaseous 
pollutant, in grams per brake horse-power hour.
A<INF>M</INF> = Modal average mass emissions level, in grams per hour. 
Mass emissions must be calculated as described in Sec. 86.1342.
A<INF>P</INF> = Modal average power, in brake horse-power. Any power 
measured during the idle mode (mode 1) is not included in this 
calculation.
W<INF>F</INF> = Weighting factor corresponding to each mode of the 
steady-state test cycle, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
i = The modes of the steady-state test cycle, as defined in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section.
n = 13, corresponding to the 13 modes of the steady-state test cycle, as 
defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

    (ii) For PM measurements, a single filter must be used to measure PM 
over the 13 modes. The brake-specific PM emission level for the test 
must be calculated as described for a transient hot start test in 
Sec. 86.1343. Only the power measured during the sampling period shall 
be used in the calculation.
    (f) Maximum allowable emission limits. (1) For gaseous emissions, 
the 12 non-idle test point results and the four-point linear 
interpolation procedure specified in paragraph (g) of this section for 
intermediate conditions, shall define Maximum Allowable Emission Limits 
for purposes of Sec. 86.007-11(a)(3) except as modified under paragraph 
(f)(3) of this section. Each engine shall have it's own Maximum 
Allowable Emission Limits generated from the 12

[[Page 323]]

non-idle supplemental steady state test points from that engine. The 
control area extends from the 25% to the 75% engine speeds, at engine 
loads of 25% to 100%, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section. 
Figure 1 of this paragraph (f)(1) depicts a sample Maximum Allowable 
Emission Limit curve, for illustration purposes only, as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC00.006

    (2) If the weighted average emissions, calculated according to 
paragraph (e)(6) of this section, for any gaseous pollutant is equal to 
or lower than required by Sec. 86.007-11(a)(3), each of the 13 test 
values for that pollutant shall first be multiplied by the ratio of the 
applicable emission standard (under Sec. 86.007-11(a)(3)) to the 
weighted average emissions value, and then by 1.10 for interpolation 
allowance, before determining the Maximum Allowable Emission Limits 
under paragraph (f)(1) of this section.
    (3) If the Maximum Allowable Emission Limit for any point, as 
calculated under paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section, is greater 
than the applicable Not-to-Exceed limit (if within the Not-to-Exceed 
control area defined in Sec. 86.1370-2007(b)), then the Maximum 
Allowable Emission Limit for that point shall be defined as the 
applicable Not-to-Exceed limit.
    (g) Calculating intermediate test points. (1) For the three test 
points selected by EPA under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the 
emissions must be measured and calculated as described in paragraph 
(e)(6)(i) of this section (except that n = 1 and WF = 1). The measured 
values then must be compared to the

[[Page 324]]

interpolated values according to paragraph (g)(3) of this section. The 
interpolated values are determined from the modes of the test cycle 
closest to the respective test point according to paragraph (g)(2) of 
this section.
    (2) Interpolating emission values from the test cycle. The gaseous 
emissions for each regulated pollutant for each of the control points 
(Z) must be interpolated from the four closest modes of the test cycle 
that envelop the selected control point Z as shown in Figure 2 of this 
paragraph (g)(2).
    (i) For these modes (R, S, T, U), the following definitions apply:
    (A) Speed (R) = Speed(T) = n<INF>RT</INF>.
    (B) Speed (S) = Speed(U) = n<INF>SU</INF>.
    (C) Per cent load (R) = Per cent load (S).
    (D) Per cent load (T) = Per cent load (U).
    (ii) The interpolated value of the brake specific gaseous emissions 
of the selected control point Z(EZ) must be calculated as follows:

E<INF>Z</INF> = E<INF>RS</INF> + (E<INF>TU</INF>-E<INF>RS</INF>) * 
    (M<INF>Z</INF>-M<INF>RS</INF>) / (M<INF>TU</INF>-M<INF>RS</INF>)

E<INF>TU</INF> = E<INF>T</INF> + (E<INF>U</INF>-E<INF>T</INF>) * 
    (n<INF>Z</INF>-n<INF>RT</INF>) / (n<INF>SU</INF>-n<INF>RT</INF>)

E<INF>RS</INF> = E<INF>R</INF> + (E<INF>S</INF>-E<INF>R</INF>) * 
    (n<INF>Z</INF>-n<INF>RT</INF>) / (n<INF>SU</INF>-n<INF>RT</INF>)

M<INF>TU</INF> = M<INF>T</INF> + (M<INF>U</INF>-M<INF>T</INF>) * 
    (n<INF>Z</INF>-n<INF>RT</INF>) / (n<INF>SU</INF>-n<INF>RT</INF>)

M<INF>RS</INF> = M<INF>R</INF> + (M<INF>S</INF>-M<INF>R</INF>) * 
    (n<INF>Z</INF>-n<INF>RT</INF>) / (n<INF>SU</INF>-n<INF>RT</INF>)

Where:

E<INF>R</INF>, E<INF>S</INF>, E<INF>T</INF>, E<INF>U</INF> = for each 
regulated pollutant, brake specific gaseous emissions of the enveloping 
modes adjusted according to the factors in(f)(2).
M<INF>R</INF>, M<INF>S</INF>, M<INF>T</INF>, M<INF>U</INF> = engine 
torque of the enveloping modes.
M<INF>Z</INF> = engine torque of the selected control point Z.
n<INF>Z</INF> = engine speed of the selected control point Z.

    (iii) Figure 2 follows:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC00.007
    
    (3) Comparing calculated and interpolated emission values. The 
measured brake specific gaseous emissions of the

[[Page 325]]

control point Z (X<INF>Z</INF>) must be less than or equal to the 
interpolated value (E<INF>Z</INF>).
    (h) Test fuel specifications. The test fuel used for supplemental 
steady-state testing under this section must meet the requirements of 
Sec. 86.1313.
    (i) General requirements. Ambient conditions, charge cooling 
specifications, and intake and exhaust restrictions for supplemental 
steady-state testing and maximum allowable emission limit testing under 
this section must meet the requirements of Sec. 86.1330.

<R05>
Sec. 86.1370-2007  Not-To-Exceed test procedures.

    (a) General. The purpose of this test procedure is to measure in-use 
emissions of heavy-duty diesel engines while operating within a broad 
range of speed and load points (the Not-To-Exceed Control Area) and 
under conditions which can reasonably be expected to be encountered in 
normal vehicle operation and use. Emission results from this test 
procedure are to be compared to the Not-To-Exceed Limits specified in 
Sec. 86.007-11 (a)(4), or to later Not-To-Exceed limits. The Not-To-
Exceed Limits do not apply for engine starting conditions.
    (b) Not-to-exceed control area for diesel heavy-duty engines. The 
Not-To-Exceed Control Area for diesel heavy-duty engines consists of the 
following engine speed and load points:
    (1) All operating speeds greater than the speed calculated using the 
following formula, where n<INF>hi</INF> and n<INF>lo</INF> are 
determined according to the provisions in Sec. 86.1360(c):

n<INF>lo</INF>+0.15x(n<INF>hi</INF>-n<INF>lo</INF>)

    (2) All engine load points greater than or equal to 30% or more of 
the maximum torque value produced by the engine.
    (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) 
of this section, all operating speed and load points with brake specific 
fuel consumption (BSFC) values within 5% of the minimum BSFC value of 
the engine. For the purposes of this requirement, BFSC must be 
calculated under the general test cell conditions specified in 
Sec. 86.1330. The manufacturer may petition the Administrator at 
certification to exclude such points if the manufacturer can demonstrate 
that the engine is not expected to operate at such points in normal 
vehicle operation and use. Engines equipped with drivelines with multi-
speed manual transmissions or automatic transmissions with a finite 
number of gears are not subject to the requirements of this paragraph 
(b)(3).
    (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (b)(1) through 
(b)(3) of this section, speed and load points below 30% of the maximum 
power value produced by the engine shall be excluded from the Not-To-
Exceed Control Area for all emissions.
    (5) [Reserved]
    (6)(i) For petroleum-fueled diesel cycle engines, the manufacturer 
may identify particular engine-vehicle combinations and may petition the 
Administrator at certification to exclude operating points from the Not-
to-Exceed Control Area defined in Sec. 86.1370(b)(1) through (5) if the 
manufacturer can demonstrate that the engine is not capable of operating 
at such points when used in the specified engine-vehicle combination(s).
    (ii) For diesel cycle engines that are not petroleum-fueled, the 
manufacturer may petition the Administrator at certification to exclude 
operating points from the Not-to-Exceed Control Area defined in 
Sec. 86.1370(b)(1) through (5) if the manufacturer can demonstrate that 
the engine is not expected to operate at such points in normal vehicle 
operation and use.
    (7) Manufacturers may petition the Administrator to limit NTE 
testing in a single defined region of speeds and loads. Such a defined 
region must generally be of elliptical or rectangular shape, and must 
share some portion of its boundary with the outside limits of the NTE 
zone. Under this provision testing would not be allowed with sampling 
periods in which operation within that region constitutes more than 5.0 
percent of the time-weighted operation within the sampling period. 
Approval of this limit by the Administrator is contingent on the 
manufacturer satisfactorily demonstrating that operation at the speeds 
and loads within that region accounts for less than 5.0 percent

of all in-use operation (weighted by vehicle-miles-traveled or other 
EPA-approved weightings) for the in-use engines of that configuration 
(or sufficiently similar engines). At a minimum, this demonstration must 
include operational data from representative in-use vehicles.
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) Not-to-exceed control area limits. (1) When operated within the 
Not-To-Exceed Control Area defined in paragraph (b) of this section, 
diesel engine emissions shall not exceed the applicable Not-To-Exceed 
Limits specified in Sec. 86.007-11(a)(4) when averaged over any period 
of time greater than or equal to 30 seconds, except where a longer 
averaging period is required by paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (2) For engines equipped with emission controls that include 
discrete regeneration events, if a regeneration event occurs during the 
NTE test, then the averaging period must be at least as long as the time 
between the events multiplied by the number of full regeneration events 
within the sampling period. The requirement in this paragraph (d)(2) 
only applies for engines that send an electronic signal indicating the 
start of the regeneration event.
    (e) Ambient corrections. The measured data shall be corrected based 
on the ambient conditions under which it was taken, as specified in this 
section.
    (1) For engines operating within the ambient conditions specified in 
Sec. 86.007-11(a)(4)(ii)(a):
    (i) NO<INF>X</INF> emissions shall be corrected for ambient air 
humidity to a standard humidity level of 50 grains (7.14 g/kg) if the 
humidity of the intake air was below 50 grains, or to 75 grains (10.71 
g/kg) if above 75 grains.
    (ii) NO<INF>X</INF> and PM emissions shall be corrected for ambient 
air temperature to a temperature of 55 degrees F (12.8 degrees C) for 
ambient air temperatures below 55 degrees F or to 95 degrees F (35.0 
degrees C) if the ambient air temperature is above 95 degrees F.
    (iii) No ambient air temperature or humidity correction factors 
shall be used within the ranges of 50-75 grains or 55-95 degrees F.
    (iv) Where test conditions require such correction factors, the 
manufacturer must use good engineering judgement and generally accepted 
engineering practice to determine the appropriate correction factors, 
subject to EPA review.
    (2) For engines operating within the ambient conditions specified in 
Sec. 86.007-11(a)(4)(ii)(b):
    (i) NO<INF>X</INF> emissions shall be corrected for ambient air 
humidity to a standard humidity level of 50 grains (7.14 g/kg) if the 
humidity of the intake air was below 50 grains, or to 75 grains (10.71 
g/kg) if above 75 grains.
    (ii) NO<INF>X</INF> and PM emissions shall be corrected for ambient 
air temperature to a temperature of 55 degrees F (12.8 degrees C) for 
ambient air temperatures below 55 degrees F.
    (iii) No ambient air temperature or humidity correction factors 
shall be used within the ranges of 50-75 grains or for temperatures 
greater than or equal to 55 degrees F.
    (iv) Where test conditions require such correction factors, the 
manufacturer must use good engineering judgement and generally accepted 
engineering practice to determine the appropriate correction factors, 
subject to EPA review.
    (f) NTE cold temperature operating exclusion. Engines equipped with 
exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) whose operation within the NTE control 
area specified in Sec. 86.1370(b) when operating during cold temperature 
conditions as specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section are not 
subject to the NTE emission limits during the specified cold temperature 
operation conditions.
    (1) Cold temperature operation is defined as engine operating 
conditions meeting either of the following two criteria:
    (i) Intake manifold temperature (IMT) less than or equal to the 
temperature defined by the following relationship between IMT and 
absolute intake manifold pressure (IMP) for the corresponding IMP:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC00.009

Where:

P = absolute intake manifold pressure in bars.
IMT = intake manifold temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.


[[Page 327]]


    (ii) Engine coolant temperature (ECT) less than or equal to the 
temperature defined by the following relationship between ECT and 
absolute intake manifold pressure (IMP) for the corresponding IMP:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC00.010

Where:

P = absolute intake manifold pressure in bars.
ECT = engine coolant temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.

    (2) [Reserved]
    (g) NO<INF>X</INF> and NMHC aftertreatment warm-up. For engines 
equipped with one or more aftertreatment devices that reduce 
NO<INF>X</INF> or NMHC emissions, the NTE NO<INF>X</INF> and NMHC 
emission limits do not apply when the exhaust gas temperature is 
measured within 12 inches of the outlet of the aftertreatment device and 
is less the 250  deg.C. For multi-bed systems, it is the temperature at 
the outlet of the device with the maximum flow rate that determines 
whether the NTE limits apply.

    This section contains the measurement techniques to be used for 
determining compliance with the filter smoke limit or opacity limits in 
Sec. 86.007-11(b)(1)(iv).
    (a) For steady-state or transient smoke testing using full-flow 
opacimeters, equipment meeting the requirements of subpart I of this 
part or ISO/DIS-11614 ``Reciprocating internal combustion compression-
ignition engines--Apparatus for measurement of the opacity and for 
determination of the light absorption coefficient of exhaust gas'' is 
required. This document is incorporated by reference (see Sec. 86.1).
    (1) All full-flow opacimeter measurements shall be reported as the 
equivalent percent opacity for a five inch effective optical path length 
using the Beer-Lambert relationship.
    (2) Zero and full-scale (100 percent opacity) span shall be adjusted 
prior to testing.
    (3) Post test zero and full scale span checks shall be performed. 
For valid tests, zero and span drift between the pre-test and post-test 
checks shall be less than two percent of full-scale.
    (4) Opacimeter calibration and linearity checks shall be performed 
using manufacturer's recommendations or good engineering practice.
    (b) For steady-state testing using a filter-type smokemeter, 
equipment meeting the requirements of ISO/FDIS-10054 ``Internal 
combustion compression-ignition engines--Measurement apparatus for smoke 
from engines operating under steady-state conditions--Filter-type 
smokemeter'' is recommended. Other equipment may be used provided it is 
approved in advance by the Administrator.
    (1) All filter-type smokemeter results shall be reported as a filter 
smoke number (FSN) that is similar to the Bosch smoke number (BSN) 
scale.
    (2) Filter-type smokemeters shall be calibrated every 90 days using 
manufacturer's recommended practices or good engineering practice.
    (c) For steady-state testing using a partial-flow opacimeter, 
equipment meeting the requirements of ISO-8178-3 and ISO/DIS-11614 is 
recommended. Other equipment may be used provided it is approved in 
advance by the Administrator.

the equivalent percent opacity for a five inch effective optical path 
length using the Beer-Lambert relationship.
    (2) Zero and full scale (100 percent opacity) span shall be adjusted 
prior to testing.
    (3) Post-test zero and full scale span checks shall be performed. 
For valid tests, zero and span drift between the pre-test and post-test 
checks shall be less than two percent of full scale.
    (4) Opacimeter calibration and linearity checks shall be performed 
using manufacturer's recommendations or good engineering practice.
    (d) Replicate smoke tests may be run to improve confidence in a 
single test or stabilization. If replicate tests are run, three 
additional tests which confirm to this section shall be run, and the 
final reported test results must be the average of all the valid tests.

[[Page 328]]

    (e) A minimum of thirty seconds sampling time shall be used for 
average transient smoke measurements. The opacity values used for this 
averaging must be collected at a minimum rate of 1 data point per 
second, and all data points used in the averaging must be equally spaced 
in time.

Sec. 86.1380-2004  Load response test.

    (a) General. This section applies to 2004 through 2007 model year 
heavy-duty diesel engines. The purpose of this test procedure is to 
measure the brake-specific gaseous and particulate emissions from a 
heavy-duty diesel engine as it is suddenly loaded, with its fueling 
lever, at a given engine operating speed. The results of this test 
procedure are not compared to emission standards, and this test is not 
considered part of the Federal Test Procedure. This procedure shall be 
conducted on a dynamometer.
    (b) Test conditions and equipment. All laboratory conditions, 
laboratory equipment, engine set-up procedures, test fuel, and testing 
conditions specified in this subpart for transient testing shall apply 
to the Load Response Test where applicable.
    (c) Test sequence. (1) The test has 5 separate measurement segments, 
each identified by a specific engine speed. At each of the following 
speeds, beginning with the lowest torque point at that engine speed 
within the NTE control area for NMHC+NO<INF>X</INF>, the engine fuel 
control shall be moved suddenly to the full fuel position and held at 
that point for four seconds, while the specified speed is maintained 
constant within the tolerances of the test facility. After the four 
second full fuel position, the load should be immediately brought back 
to the minimum NTE control area load for the specified engine speed for 
a period of 6 seconds. Prior to the beginning of each measurement 
segment, the engine shall be warmed up at the supplemental steady-state 
Mode 4 conditions (75% engine load, Speed B as specified in 
Sec. 86.1360) until engine oil temperature has stabilized.
    (i) Speed A as determined in Sec. 86.1360(c);
    (ii) Speed B as determined in Sec. 86.1360(c);
    (iii) Speed C as determined in Sec. 86.1360(c);
    (iv) Speed D as determined in Sec. 86.1360(c);
    (v) Speed E as determined in Sec. 86.1360(c).
    (2) The test sequence at each engine speed may be repeated, without 
pause between repeats, if it is necessary to obtain sufficient 
particulate matter sample amount for analysis.
    (3) The exhaust emissions sample shall be analyzed using the 
applicable procedures under Sec. 86.1340, and the exhaust emission shall 
be calculated using the applicable procedures under Sec. 86.1342, for 
each measurement segment. Sampling rates for engine speed, engine load, 
and gaseous emissions shall performed a minium rate of 10 Hz. Emissions 
for all regulated pollutants must be calculated and reported for each 
test speed condition in terms of g/bhp-hr.
    (4) Data must be collected beginning with the start of the 
transition from the minimum NTE control area load to the full fuel 
position. Data must be collected until the end of the (final if 
repeated) 6 second operational period at the minimum NTE control area 
load described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Good engineering 
practice must be used to ensure that the sampling time is properly 
aligned with the engine operation.

mph to 50 mph (48 kph to 80 kph) must be performed for a minimum of 30 
seconds as specified in Sec. 86.1438(c).
    (7) Test procedure--(i) Manufacturer's data submittal. The test 
procedure consists of the Two Speed Idle Test (first chance only), which 
is performed as specified in Sec. 86.1437 (e) through (g).
    (ii) Testing by the Administrator. The Administrator will perform 
one or more test procedures described in Sec. 86.1439. For recall 
program testing, in-use vehicles will be set to the manufacturer's 
specifications, if appropriate.
    (b) The sets of test conditions identified in this subpart are based 
on the test fuel type present in the vehicle fuel tank and the ambient 
temperature during the test. Tables O-96-1 and O-96-2 outline the 
specific ranges of conditions to be employed in the CST. The 
manufacturer must perform the CST described in this subpart under at 
least one of the three sets of conditions shown in table O-96-1 for data 
submittal under the provisions of Sec. 86.096-23. The set of conditions 
selected is the one that, in the manufacturer's best judgment, 
represents the worst case, meaning the highest probability that the test 
vehicle would fail.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) For testing conducted in accordance with this subpart, the 
ambient temperature to which the test vehicle is exposed must not fall 
outside the range specified in this paragraph.
    (1) For the cold temperature compliance pathways--(i) For the 
manufacturer's data submittal. The ambient temperature for the steps 
following the fuel drain and fill or transient test procedure must 
remain between 15  deg.F and 25  deg.F (between -9  deg.C and -4 
deg.C).
    (ii) For testing by the Administrator. The ambient temperature for 
the remainder of the compliance pathway beginning with the step 
following the fuel drain and fill must remain between 15  deg.F and 68 
deg.F (between -9  deg.C and 20  deg.C). In addition, from the warmup 
operation step (if performed) or the wait time step forward through the 
remainder of the CST, the ambient temperature must be maintained within 
<plus-minus> 5  deg.F (3  deg.C) of the selected ambient temperature of 
the CST.
    (2) For the moderate and warm temperature compliance pathways--(i) 
For the manufacturer's data submittal. The ambient temperature for the 
steps preceding the warmup operation (if performed) or the wait time (if 
no warmup is performed) must remain within the specific ambient 
temperature range selected for the CST, that is, either moderate or 
warm, as specified in table O-96-1.
    (ii) For testing by the Administrator. The ambient temperature for 
the steps preceding the warmup operation (if performed) or the wait time 
(if no warmup is performed) must remain between 68  deg.F and 96  deg.F 
(between 20  deg.C and 36  deg.C), except as provided in paragraph 
(c)(3) of this section.
    (iii) The warmup operation (if performed) and the entire test run 
from the wait time forward, as described in Sec. 86.1437 or 
Sec. 86.1438, must remain within the specific ambient temperature range 
selected for the CST, that is, either moderate or warm, as specified in 
tables O-96-1 and O-96-2.
    (3) For testing by the Administrator only. If Cold CO fuel is 
selected in conjunction with the moderate temperature compliance 
pathway, the specific provisions described in paragraphs (c)(3) (i) and 
(ii) of this section apply.
    (i) The ambient temperature must be maintained within the moderate 
temperature range, as specified in table O-96-2, from the drain and fuel 
step forward throughout the remainder of the compliance pathway.
    (ii) The ambient temperature of the test cell may not exceed 80 
deg.F (27  deg.C) for the warmup operation (if performed) nor for the 
entire test run from the wait time forward, as described in 
Secs. 86.1438 and 86.1439.
    (d) If the engine stalls at any time during the test run, the CST is 
void unless the stall falls during the wait time within the guidelines 
for engine off time described in Sec. 86.1437 (b) and (d) and 
Sec. 86.1438(d)(1)(i).

Sec. 86.1432  Vehicle preparation.

    (a) The test conditions to be employed in the CST procedure must be 
selected from the applicable options specified in table O-96-1 or table 
O-96-2 of Sec. 86.1430(b). The fuel tank must be fitted, as required, to 
accommodate a fuel drain at the lowest point possible in the tank(s) as 
installed on the vehicle.
    (b) Fuel tank drain and fill, or transient test procedure--(1) CST 
performed as a stand-alone procedure. For the first CST compliance 
pathway performed as a stand-alone procedure on a particular test 
vehicle, the fuel tank(s) must be filled to approximately the prescribed 
``tank fuel volume'' (as defined in Sec. 86.082-2) with the specified 
test fuel.

[[Page 337]]

For the cold temperature compliance pathway, the temperature of the fuel 
prior to its delivery to the fuel tank must be less than or equal to 60 
deg.F (16  deg.C). If the existing fuel in the fuel tank(s) does not 
meet the specifications contained in Sec. 86.1413 and Sec. 86.1430(b), 
the existing fuel must be drained prior to the fuel fill as specified 
above. Other refueling during a CST may not be performed. Draining and 
refueling between successive CSTs is allowed and is required prior to 
any CST for which the specified fuel is different than that existing in 
the tank(s). Any soak or operation that follows this step, until the 
conclusion of the CST sequence, must occur at an ambient temperature 
that is within the allowable temperature range described in 
Sec. 86.1430(c).
    (2) CST performed in sequence with other confirmatory testing. 
Certain complete confirmatory test procedures, as indicated in 
paragraphs (b)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section, may be substituted for 
the vehicle preparation steps described in paragraph (b)(1), (c), and 
(d) of this section. If the vehicle is to be subjected to one or more of 
these other confirmatory test procedures, the vehicle is prepared in 
accordance with the applicable complete procedures from the point of 
fuel drain and fill.
    (i) Manufacturer's data submittal. The only test procedure that the 
manufacturer may select to substitute for paragraphs (b)(1), (c)(1), and 
(d)(1) of this section for the purposes of its data submittal is the 
Cold CO Test Procedure, performed in accordance with subpart C of this 
part.
    (ii) Testing by the Administrator. The complete confirmatory test 
sequences that the Administrator may select to substitute for paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section are listed in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) (A) through 
(C) of this section.
    (A) Federal Test Procedure for exhaust emissions (except when 
performing evaporative test sequence) or for fuel economy testing, in 
accordance with subpart B of this part.
    (B) Highway Fuel Economy Test Procedure, in accordance with part 600 
of this chapter (which must follow a Federal Test Procedure).
    (C) Cold CO Test Procedure, in accordance with subpart C of this 
part.
    (c) Soak--(1) Manufacturer's data submittal. A vehicle soak prior to 
the wait time is optional if the CST sequence is performed as a stand-
alone procedure. If the manufacturer elects to perform a Cold CO Test 
Procedure in conjunction with the CST as permitted in paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section, the soak and subsequent warmup are not conducted, and 
instead the procedure must move directly to the wait time step described 
in Sec. 86.1437(b). If the test vehicle undergoes a soak period, it must 
be maintained at an ambient temperature within the temperature range 
specified in Sec. 86.1430(c), for a period not to exceed 36 hours in 
duration, except as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. 
Ambient temperature during soak periods must remain within the 
appropriate temperature range for the selected test option.
    (2) Testing by the Administrator. (i) The test sequence may proceed 
directly to the wait time step described in Sec. 86.1438(b) within 60 
seconds of the end of vehicle operation conducted in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (ii) Optionally, the test vehicle may soak at an ambient temperature 
within the temperature range specified in Sec. 86.1430(c), for a period 
up to 36 hours in duration, except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of 
this section. If the Administrator opts to soak the test vehicle, warmup 
operation must be performed as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section.
    (d) Warmup operation--(1) Manufacturer's data submittal. Warmup 
operation is optional. Warmup consists of loaded operation over the 
first 505 seconds of the UDDS (in accordance with Sec. 86.115 and 
appendix I to this part), or optionally, if the soak period has exceeded 
36 hours, a full UDDS. Warmup operation must occur within the specific 
ambient temperature range for the selected test option, as given in 
table O-96-1 of Sec. 86.1430.
    (2) Testing by the Administrator. Warmup operation is performed if 
no transient operation of the type specified in Sec. 86.1432(b)(2) is 
performed prior to the wait time, or if the optional soak exceeds 60 
seconds. Warmup operation consists of, at a minimum, loaded operation 
over the first 505 seconds of

[[Page 338]]

the UDDS (in accordance with Sec. 86.115 and appendix I to this part), 
or, if the soak period has exceeded 36 hours, a full UDDS. Warmup 
operation must occur within the specific ambient temperature range for 
the selected test option, as given in table O-96-2 of Sec. 86.1430, 
except as specified in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section. 
Warmup operation must proceed immediately to the wait time step at 
Sec. 86.1438(b).
    (i) For moderate temperature testing utilizing Cold CO fuel only, 
the ambient temperature may not exceed 80  deg.F (27  deg.C) during 
warmup operation, or any of the succeeding steps in the CST sequence.
    (ii) For the cold temperature pathway only, warmup operation must 
occur not only within the specific ambient temperature range indicated 
in table O-96-2 of Sec. 86.1430, but must also occur within 5  deg.F (3 
deg.C) of the selected test temperature.

Sec. 86.1434  Equipment preparation.

    (a) Immediately prior to the wait time portion of the test run 
described in Sec. 86.1437 or Sec. 86.1438, or immediately prior to 
warmup operation, the steps described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of 
this section must be performed.
    (b) Check the device(s) for removing water from the exhaust sample 
and the sample filter(s). Remove any water from the water trap(s). Clean 
and replace the filter(s) as necessary.
    (c) Set the zero and span points of the analyzer with the electrical 
spanning network or with analytical gases.
    (d) Attach the tachometer to the vehicle in accordance with the 
analyzer manufacturer's instructions. The manufacturer must ensure, for 
all test and production vehicles and engines, that the rpm signal is 
capable of being read by an exhaust gas analyzer via:
    (1) A conventional inductive tachometer; or
    (2) The onboard diagnostics (OBD) connector, as described under the 
provisions of Sec. 86.094-17; or
    (3) A dedicated electrical lead, marked ``rpm'' and located under 
the hood, with a female-type, quarter-inch spade terminal. The digital 
transistor-transistor logic (TTL) signal must span the 0V-5V range at a 
rate of one pulse per engine revolution, synchronized to the top dead 
center position.

Secs. 86.1435-86.1436  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 86.1437  Test run--manufacturer.

    (a) This section describes the test run performed by the 
manufacturer for its data submittal pursuant to obtaining a certificate 
of conformity under the provisions of Sec. 86.096-23. The test run 
consists of the wait time, vehicle preconditioning (optional), and the 
selected test procedure. The entire test run is performed in accordance 
with the conditions in the option selected from table O-96-1 of 
Sec. 86.1430.
    (b) Wait time. (1) If the vehicle is not already idling, the vehicle 
is started and allowed to idle freely with the transmission in neutral. 
The vehicle wait time begins when the vehicle engine speed is between 
350 and 1100 rpm. The engine speed must attain the specified idle speed 
within ten seconds of beginning the idle period. A timer for the wait 
time portion of the test run will initiate (wt=0) when the vehicle is 
turned on or when it returns to idle after any transient test procedure, 
as described in Sec. 86.1432.
    (2) Following the first three minutes of idle, this wait time may be 
interrupted by engine off/restart cycles occurring no more frequently 
than every five minutes, with each engine off period having a maximum 
duration of two minutes. Each period of idle following a restart must be 
a minimum of three minutes in duration. During each idle period, the 
engine speed must not exceed 1100 rpm or fall below 350 rpm for more 
than five seconds in any one excursion. The total duration of the wait 
time, including time at idle and time during engine off periods, is 25 
to 30 minutes.
    (c) Optional preconditioning. Immediately following the wait time, 
the engine speed is increased to 2500<plus-minus> 300 rpm for 25 to 30 
seconds or, optionally, the vehicle will undergo loaded operation for a 
minimum of 30 seconds between the speeds of 30 and 50 mph (48 to 80 
kph). The period allowed for preconditioning commences upon attaining 
the specified rpm or speed range. No more

[[Page 339]]

than ten seconds may elapse between terminating the wait time and 
attaining the specified rpm or speed range for preconditioning.
    (d) Immediately following the wait time, described in paragraph (b) 
of this section, or, if performed, the optional preconditioning 
described in paragraph (c), the test procedure as described in 
paragraphs (e) through (g) of this section is performed on the test 
vehicle. The general requirements described in paragraphs (d) (1) 
through (4) of this section apply.
    (1) Exhaust gas sampling algorithm. The analysis of exhaust gas 
concentrations begins ten seconds after the applicable test mode begins. 
Exhaust gas concentrations must be analyzed at a minimum rate of once 
every 0.75 second. The measured value for pass/fail determinations is a 
simple running average of the measurements taken over five seconds.
    (2) Void test conditions. The test immediately terminates and any 
exhaust gas measurements are voided if the measured concentration of CO 
plus CO<INF>2</INF> falls below six percent or the vehicle's engine 
stalls at any time during the test sequence.
    (3) Multiple exhaust pipes. Exhaust gas concentrations from vehicle 
engines equipped with multiple exhaust pipes must be sampled 
simultaneously.
    (4) Pass/fail determination. A pass or fail determination is made 
for each applicable test mode based on a comparison of the short test 
standards contained in Sec. 86.096-8(a) for light-duty vehicles and in 
Sec. 86.096-9(a) for light-duty trucks, and the measured value for HC 
and CO as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. A vehicle 
passes the test mode if any pair of simultaneous values for HC and CO 
are below or equal to the applicable short test standards.
    (e) Test sequence--general requirements. (1) The test sequence 
consists of an idle mode followed by a high-speed mode. The test timer 
starts when the conditions specified in this paragraph are met. The 
overall maximum test time is 290 seconds (tt=290). The test terminates 
immediately upon reaching the overall maximum test time. A vehicle that 
has not yielded passing results by the expiration of the overall test 
time fails the test.
    (2) The test sequence begins only after the requirements described 
in paragraphs (e)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section are met. If these 
conditions are not met within one minute upon completion of the wait 
time or, if performed, the preconditioning, the CST must be aborted.
    (i) The vehicle is tested with the transmission in neutral or park 
and all accessories turned off. The engine must be at normal operating 
temperature (as indicated by a temperature gauge, temperature lamp, 
touch test on the radiator hose, or other visual observation indicating 
that overheating has not occurred).
    (ii) The tachometer must be attached to the vehicle in accordance 
with the analyzer manufacturer's instructions.
    (iii) The sample probe is inserted into the tailpipe to a minimum 
depth of 10 inches. If the vehicle's exhaust system prevents insertion 
to this depth, a tailpipe extension must be used, or the probe may be 
inserted into the tailpipe to CVS connector through an aperture provided 
for this purpose.
    (iv) The measured concentration of CO plus CO<INF>2</INF> must be 
greater than or equal to six percent.
    (f) Idle mode. (1) The mode timer starts (mt=0) when the vehicle 
engine speed is between 350 and 1100 rpm. If engine speed exceeds 1100 
rpm or falls below 350 rpm, the mode timer resets to zero and resumes 
timing. The minimum mode time is 30 seconds. The maximum idle mode 
length is 90 seconds elapsed time (mt=90).
    (2) The pass/fail analysis begins after an elapsed time of ten 
seconds (mt=10). A pass or fail determination is made for the vehicle 
and the mode terminated as described in paragraphs (f)(2) (i) through 
(iii) of this section.
    (i) The vehicle passes the idle mode and the mode is terminated at 
the end of an elapsed time of 30 seconds (mt=30) if the measured values 
are less than or equal to the applicable short test standards as 
described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
    (ii) The vehicle passes the idle mode and the mode is immediately 
terminated if, at any point between an elapsed time of 30 seconds 
(mt=30) and

[[Page 340]]

90 seconds (mt=90), the measured values are less than or equal to the 
applicable short test standards as described in paragraph (d)(4) of this 
section.
    (iii) The vehicle fails the idle mode and the test is terminated if 
none of the provisions of paragraphs (f)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section 
is met by an elapsed time of 90 seconds (mt=90).
    (g) High-speed mode. This mode follows immediately upon termination 
of the idle mode.
    (1) The mode timer resets (mt=0) when the vehicle engine speed is 
between 2200 and 2800 rpm. If engine speed falls below 2200 rpm or 
exceeds 2800 rpm for more than two seconds in one excursion, or more 
than six seconds over all excursions within 30 seconds of the final 
measured value used in pass/fail determination, the measured value is 
invalidated and the mode continued. If any excursion lasts for more than 
ten seconds, the mode timer resets to zero (mt=0) and timing resumes. 
The minimum high-speed mode length is determined as described in 
paragraph (g)(2) of this section. The maximum high-speed mode length is 
90 seconds elapsed time (mt=90).
    (2) The pass/fail analysis begins after an elapsed time of ten 
seconds (mt=10). A pass or fail determination is made for the vehicle 
and the mode terminated as described in paragraphs (g)(2)(i) through 
(iii) of this section.
    (i) The vehicle passes the high-speed mode and the mode is 
terminated at the end of an elapsed time of 30 seconds (mt=30) if the 
measured values are less than or equal to the applicable short test 
standards as described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
    (ii) The vehicle passes the high-speed mode and the mode is 
immediately terminated if, at any point between an elapsed time of 30 
seconds (mt=30) and 90 seconds (mt=90), the measured values are less 
than or equal to the applicable short test standards as described in 
paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
    (iii) The vehicle fails the high-speed mode and the test is 
terminated if none of the provisions of paragraphs (g)(2) (i) and (ii) 
of this section is met by an elapsed time of 90 seconds (mt=90).

Sec. 86.1438  Test run--EPA.

    (a) This section describes the test run performed by the 
Administrator for confirmatory testing pursuant to issuing a certificate 
of conformity under the provisions of Sec. 86.091-29. The Administrator 
may also employ this procedure for Selective Enforcement Audit and 
recall purposes. For recall program testing, in-use vehicles will be set 
to manufacturer's specifications prior to conduct of the CST. The test 
run consists of the wait time, vehicle preconditioning, and the selected 
test procedure. The test run is performed in accordance with the 
conditions in the option selected from table O-96-2 of Sec. 86.1430. If 
the CST is performed in conjunction with other confirmatory testing in 
accordance with Sec. 86.1432(b)(2) and (c)(2), the vehicle must undergo 
the CST at the same specified ambient temperature range as that of the 
other confirmatory testing performed immediately prior to the optional 
vehicle soak, except as specified in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this 
section.
    (1) If the transient confirmatory testing was performed at the 
moderate temperature range specified in Sec. 86.1430 and utilized Otto-
cycle test fuel, it may optionally be followed by a CST sequence as 
described in Sec. 86.1432 (b) and (c) at the warm ambient temperature 
range.
    (2) If the transient confirmatory testing was performed at the 
moderate temperature range specified in Sec. 86.1430 and utilized Cold 
CO test fuel, it may optionally be followed by a CST sequence as 
described in Sec. 86.1432 (b) and (c) at the moderate ambient 
temperature range, except that if the ambient temperature exceeds 80 
deg.F (27  deg.C) at any point for the remainder of the sequence from 
the wait time forward, a non-passing test result renders the test void.
    (b) Wait time. (1) If the vehicle is not already idling, the vehicle 
is started and allowed to idle freely with the transmission in neutral. 
The vehicle wait time begins when the vehicle engine speed is between 
350 and 1100 rpm. The specified idle speed range must be attained within 
ten seconds of beginning the idle operation. A timer for the wait time 
portion of the test run will initiate (wt=0) when it returns to idle

[[Page 341]]

after any transient operation that occurs immediately prior to the wait 
time, as described in Sec. 86.1432, or when the vehicle is restarted 
after being shut off prior to the wait time.
    (2) Following the first three minutes of idle, this wait time may be 
interrupted by vehicle engine off/restart cycles occurring no more 
frequently than every five minutes, with each engine off period having a 
maximum duration of two minutes. Each period of idle following a restart 
must be a minimum of three minutes in duration. During each idle period, 
the engine speed must not exceed 1100 rpm or fall below 350 rpm for more 
than five seconds in any one excursion, except during the allowable 
engine-off periods. The total duration of the wait time, including time 
at idle and time during engine off periods, is three to 30 minutes.
    (c) Preconditioning. Immediately following the wait time, the 
vehicle is preconditioned by increasing engine speed to 2500 
<plus-minus>300 rpm for a minimum of 30 seconds, or, optionally, the 
vehicle will undergo loaded operation for a minimum of 30 seconds 
between the speeds of 30 and 50 mph (48 to 80 kph).
    (d) Immediately following the preconditioning described in paragraph 
(c) of this section, the test procedure as described in paragraphs (e) 
through (g) of this section is performed on the test vehicle. When the 
CST--Loaded Test as described in Sec. 86.1439(d) is selected, the 
appropriate changes to dynamometer power absorption and inertia weight 
settings must be completed and the test sequence resumed as soon as 
possible following completion of preconditioning. The general 
requirements described in paragraphs (d) (1) through (4) of this section 
apply.
    (1) Exhaust gas sampling algorithm. The analysis of exhaust gas 
concentrations begins ten seconds after the applicable test mode begins. 
Exhaust gas concentrations must be analyzed at a minimum rate of once 
every 0.75 second. The measured value for pass/fail determinations is a 
simple running average of the measurements taken over five seconds.
    (2) Void test conditions. The test immediately terminates and any 
exhaust gas measurements are voided if the measured concentration of CO 
plus CO<INF>2</INF> falls below six percent or the vehicle's engine 
stalls at any time during the test sequence.
    (3) Multiple exhaust pipes. Exhaust gas concentrations from vehicle 
engines equipped with multiple exhaust pipes must be sampled 
simultaneously.
    (4) Pass/fail determination. For certification and Selective 
Enforcement Audit testing, a pass or fail determination is made for each 
applicable test mode based on a comparison of the measured value for HC 
and CO as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section with the short 
test standards contained in Sec. 86.096-8(a) for light-duty vehicles or 
in Sec. 86.096-9(a) for light-duty trucks. For recall testing, a pass or 
fail determination is made for each applicable test mode based on a 
comparison of the measured value for HC and CO as described in paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section with the short test standards contained in 
Sec. 86.708(a) for light-duty vehicles or in Sec. 86.709(a) for light-
duty trucks. A vehicle passes the test mode if any pair of simultaneous 
values for HC and CO are below or equal to the applicable short test 
standards.
    (e) Test sequence--general requirements. The test timer starts only 
after the requirements described in paragraphs (e) (1) through (4) of 
this section are met. If these conditions are not met within one minute 
upon completion of the preconditioning, the CST must be aborted.
    (1) The vehicle is tested with the transmission in neutral or park 
and all accessories turned off. The engine must be at normal operating 
temperature (as indicated by a temperature gauge, temperature lamp, 
touch test on the radiator hose, or other visual observation indicating 
that overheating has not occurred).
    (2) The tachometer must be attached to the vehicle in accordance 
with the analyzer manufacturer's instructions.
    (3) The sample probe is inserted into the tailpipe to a minimum 
depth of 10 inches. If the vehicle's exhaust system prevents insertion 
to this depth, a tailpipe extension must be used, or the probe may be 
inserted into the tailpipe to CVS connector through an aperture provided 
for this purpose.

[[Page 342]]

    (4) The measured concentration of CO plus CO<INF>2</INF> must be 
greater than or equal to six percent.
    (f) When the requirements listed in paragraph (e) of this section 
have been satisfied, the procedure selected by the Administrator from 
among the emission tests described in Sec. 86.1439 is performed on the 
test vehicle in accordance with the conditions prescribed in this 
section and Secs. 86.1430 and 86.1432.
    (g) If a certification test vehicle fails its initial confirmatory 
CST, a retest must be given in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 86.091-29(a)(3)(iii)(B)(1) unless the manufacturer withdraws the 
vehicle from the certification process.
    (1) A vehicle receiving a retest must re-enter the confirmatory 
pathway at either:
    (i) The soak time step, as described in Sec. 86.1432, or
    (ii) The drain and fill step preceding the soak time option, as 
described in Sec. 86.1432(b)(1), using the same type of fuel as was used 
in the initial CST. The vehicle may optionally be filled to the 
specified level defined in Sec. 86.082 without being drained.
    (2) A vehicle receiving a retest must either:
    (i) Be maintained in the same ambient temperature range as that 
specified for the initial confirmatory CST (as described in 
Sec. 86.1430(c)) from the termination of the initial confirmatory CST 
throughout the retest, or,
    (ii) If the vehicle is exposed to ambient temperatures outside of 
the specified temperature range, before it enters the wait time it must 
be given a warmup consisting of a full Urban Dynamometer Driving 
Schedule procedure at the specified ambient temperature range for the 
initial CST. The test vehicle will be maintained at the same ambient 
temperature range as that specified for the initial confirmatory CST 
from this step throughout the remainder of the retest.
    (h) Multiple CSTs. The Administrator may elect to conduct more than 
one type of CST on a test vehicle.
    (1) If the Administrator elects to change fuels between one CST and 
a subsequent CST, the subsequent CST initiates at the drain and fill 
step described in Sec. 86.1432(b)(1).
    (2) If the Administrator elects to utilize the same fuel between one 
CST and a subsequent CST other than a retest, the Administrator may 
optionally initiate the subsequent CST at the vehicle soak step 
specified in Sec. 86.1432(d).

Sec. 86.1439  Certification Short Test emission test procedures--EPA.

    (a) The portions of the performance warranty test procedures 
described in part 85, subpart W of this chapter designated as ``second-
chance'' which are analogous to the CST emission test procedures do not 
apply to the testing performed in accordance with this subpart. The 
Administrator selects from among the CST emission test procedures listed 
in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section, which are incorporated 
into the vehicle test run at the point described in Sec. 86.1438(f); 
that is, after the requirements of Sec. 86.1438(e) have been satisfied.
    (b) CST--Two-speed idle test. This test consists of an idle sampling 
mode followed immediately by a high-speed sampling mode. The test timer 
starts (tt=0) when the conditions specified in Sec. 86.1438(e) are met. 
The overall maximum test time is 290 seconds (tt=290). The test 
terminates immediately upon reaching the overall maximum test time. A 
vehicle that has not yielded passing results by the expiration of the 
overall test time fails the test.
    (1) Idle mode. (i) The mode timer starts (mt=0) when the vehicle 
engine speed is between 350 and 1100 rpm. If engine speed exceeds 1100 
rpm or falls below 350 rpm, the mode timer resets to zero and resumes 
timing. The minimum mode time is 30 seconds. The maximum idle mode 
length is 90 seconds elapsed time (mt=90).
    (ii) The pass/fail analysis begins after an elapsed time of ten 
seconds (mt=10). A pass or fail determination is made for the vehicle 
and the mode terminated as described in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) (A) and 
(B) of this section.
    (A) The vehicle passes the idle mode if the measured values are less 
than or equal to the applicable short test standards as described in 
Sec. 86.1438(d)(4) prior to an elapsed time of 90 seconds (mt=90). If 
the vehicle passes, the mode

[[Page 343]]

terminates immediately, or after an elapsed time of 30 seconds (mt=30), 
whichever comes second.
    (B) The vehicle fails the idle mode and the test is immediately 
terminated if the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) of this section 
are not satisfied by an elapsed time of 90 seconds (mt=90).
    (2) High-speed mode. This mode follows immediately upon termination 
of the idle mode.
    (i) The mode timer resets (mt=0) when the vehicle engine speed is 
between 2200 and 2800 rpm. If engine speed falls below 2200 rpm or 
exceeds 2800 rpm for more than two seconds in one excursion, or more 
than six seconds over all excursions within 30 seconds of the final 
measured value used in pass/fail determination, the measured value is 
invalidated and the mode continued. If any excursion lasts for more than 
ten seconds, the mode timer resets to zero (mt=0) and timing resumes. 
The minimum high-speed mode length is determined as described in 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. The maximum high-speed mode length 
is 90 seconds elapsed time (mt=90).
    (ii) The pass/fail analysis begins after an elapsed time of ten 
seconds (mt=10). A pass or fail determination is made for the vehicle 
and the mode terminates as described in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) (A) and 
(B) of this section.
    (A) The vehicle passes the high-speed mode and the test is 
immediately terminated if, at any point prior to an elapsed time of 90 
seconds (mt=90), the measured values are less than or equal to the 
applicable short test standards as described in Sec. 86.1438(d)(4).
    (B) The vehicle fails the high-speed mode and the test is terminated 
if the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section are not 
satisfied by an elapsed time of 90 seconds (mt=90).
    (c) CST--Idle test. This test consists of an idle sampling mode 
only. The test timer starts when the conditions specified in 
Sec. 86.1438(e) are met. The overall maximum test time is 145 seconds 
(tt=145). The test terminates immediately upon reaching the overall 
maximum test time. A vehicle that has not yielded passing results by the 
expiration of the overall test time fails the test.
    (1) The mode timer starts (mt=0) when the vehicle engine speed is 
between 350 and 1100 rpm. If engine speed exceeds 1100 rpm or falls 
below 350 rpm, the mode timer resets to zero and resumes timing. The 
minimum mode length is determined as described under paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section. The maximum mode length is 90 seconds elapsed time 
(mt=90).
    (2) The pass/fail analysis begins after an elapsed time of ten 
seconds (mt=10). A pass or fail determination is made for the vehicle 
and the mode is terminated in accordance with paragraphs (c)(2) (i) and 
(ii) of this section.
    (i) The vehicle passes the idle mode and the test is immediately 
terminated if, at any point prior to an elapsed time of 90 seconds 
(mt=90), the measured values are less than or equal to the applicable 
short test standards as described in Sec. 86.1438(d)(4).
    (ii) The vehicle fails the idle mode and the test is terminated if 
the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section are not 
satisfied by an elapsed time of 90 seconds (mt=90).
    (d) CST--Loaded test. This test consists of a loaded sampling mode 
followed immediately by an idle sampling mode. The test timer starts 
(tt=0) when the conditions specified in Sec. 86.1438(e) are met, and the 
gear selector is in `drive' for automatic transmissions, or in second 
gear (or third gear if more appropriate) for manual transmissions. The 
overall maximum test time is 240 seconds (tt=240). The test terminates 
immediately upon reaching the overall maximum test time. A vehicle that 
has not yielded passing results by the expiration of the overall test 
time fails the test.
    (1) Loaded mode. (i) The mode timer starts (mt=0) when the 
dynamometer speed is within the limits specified for the vehicle engine 
size according to the following schedule. If the dynamometer speed falls 
outside the limits for more than five seconds in one excursion, or 15 
seconds over all excursions, the mode timer resets to zero and resumes 
timing. The minimum mode length is determined as described in paragraph 
(d)(1)(ii) (A) and (B) of this section. The maximum mode length is 90 
seconds elapsed time (mt=90).

<R05>
Sec. 86.1527-84  Idle test procedure; overview.

    (a) The idle emission test procedure is designed to determine the 
raw concentration (in percent) of CO in the exhaust flow at idle. The 
test procedure begins with the engine at normal operating temperature. 
(For example, the warm-up for an engine may be the transient engine or 
chassis dynamometer test.)
    (b) Raw emission sampling must be made before dilution occurs from a 
single exhaust pipe in which exhaust products are homogeneously mixed. 
The configuration for dual-exhaust systems must also allow for raw 
emission measurements, which will require that an additional ``Y'' pipe 
be placed in the exhaust system before dilution.


<R05>
Sec. 86.1530-84  Test sequence; general requirements.

    (a) The following test sequence lists the major steps encountered 
during the idle test:

Preparation
Warm-up (or Emission Test)
Preconditioning, 30 seconds minimum, six minutes maximum
Idle Stabilization, 30<plus-minus>5 seconds
Idle Emission Sampling, one minute minimum, six minutes maximum


These steps are described by subsequent procedures.
    (b) Ambient test cell conditions during the test shall be those 
specified in Sec. 86.1330-84 or Sec. 86.130-78.


<R05>
Sec. 86.1537-84  Idle test run.

    The following steps shall be taken for each test:
    (a) Check the device(s) for removing water from the exhaust sample 
and the sample filter(s). Remove any water from the water trap(s). Clean 
and replace the filter(s) as necessary.
    (b) Set the zero and span points of the CO analyzer with the 
electrical spanning network or with analytical gases.
    (c) Achieve normal engine operating condition. The transient engine 
or chassis dynamometer test is an acceptable technique for warm-up to 
normal operating condition for the idle test. If the emission test is 
not performed prior to the idle emission test, a heavy-duty engine may 
be warmed-up according to Sec. 86.1332-84(d)(2) (i) through (iv). A 
light-duty truck may be warmed up by operation through one Urban 
Dynamometer Driving Schedule test procedure (see Sec. 86.115-78 and 
appendix I to this part).
    (d) Operate the warm engine at 2500 <plus-minus>50 rpm, or rated 
torque speed for diesel-cycle engines, and zero load for a minimum of 30 
seconds and a maximum of 6 minutes.
    (e) If the CVS sampling system is used, the following procedures 
apply:
    (1) If bag samples are drawn, with the sample selector valves in the 
standby position connect evacuated sample collection bags to the dilute 
exhaust and dilution air sample collection systems.
    (2) Start the CVS (if not already on), the sample pumps, 
integrators, and the raw CO<INF>2</INF> analyzer, as applicable. (The 
heat exchanger of the constant volume sampler, if used, shall be running 
at operating temperature before sampling begins.)
    (3) Adjust the sample flow rates to the desired flow rate and set 
the gas flow measuring devices to zero.
    (4) Operate the engine or vehicle at curb idle for 30<plus-minus>5 
seconds with the clutch disengaged or in neutral gear. A heavy-duty 
engine may also be disconnected from the dynamometer, or the dynamometer 
may be shut off.
    (5) Begin raw and dilute sampling.
    (6) For bag sampling, sample idle emissions long enough to obtain a 
sufficient bag sample, but in no case shorter than 60 seconds nor longer 
than 6 minutes. Follow the sampling and exhaust measurements 
requirements of Sec. 86.340-79(e) for the conducting of the raw 
CO<INF>2</INF> measurement.
    (7) As soon as possible, transfer the idle test exhaust and dilution 
air samples to the analytical system and process the samples according 
to Sec. 86.1540-84. Obtain a stabilized reading of the exhaust sample on 
all analyzers within 20 minutes of the end of the sample collection 
phase of the test.
    (f) If the raw exhaust sampling and analysis technique specified in 
Sec. 86.309-79 is used, the following procedures apply:
    (1) Warm up the engine or vehicle per paragraphs (c) and (d) of this 
section. Operate the engine or vehicle at the

[[Page 351]]

conditions specified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section.
    (2) Follow the sampling and exhaust measurement requirements of 
Sec. 86.340-79(e). The idle sample shall be taken for 60 seconds 
minimum, and no more than 64 seconds. The chart reading procedures of 
Sec. 86.343-79 shall be used to determine the analyzer response.
    (g) If the engine or vehicle stalls at any time during the test run, 
the test is void.

Sec. 86.1540-84  Idle exhaust sample analysis.

    (a) Record the CO idle concentrations in percent.
    (b) If the CVS sampling system is used, the analysis procedures for 
dilute CO and CO<INF>2</INF> specified in Sec. 86.1340-84 apply. Follow 
the raw CO<INF>2</INF> analysis procedure specified in Sec. 86.343-79 
for the raw CO<INF>2</INF> analyzer.
    (c) If the continuous raw exhaust sampling technique (Sec. 86.309-
79) is used, the analysis procedures for CO specified in Sec. 86.343-79 
apply.

    (a) The final idle emission test results shall be reported as 
percent for carbon monoxide on a dry basis.
    (b) If a CVS sampling system is used, the following procedure shall 
apply:
    (1) Use the procedures, as applicable, in Sec. 86.1342-84 to

assumption that the percent of water by volume in the raw sample is 
equal to the percent of raw dry-basis CO<INF>2</INF> minus 0.5 percent 
is acceptable. For example:

10.0% dry CO<INF>2</INF>-0.5%=9.5% water
(1.00-0.095) (10.0% dry CO<INF>2</INF>)=9.05% wet CO<INF>2</INF>

    (4) Calculate the CVS dilution factor (DF) by:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.138
    
    (5) Convert the dilute wet-basis CO to dilute dry-basis values. An 
assumption that the percent of water by volume in the sample bag is 2 
percent is acceptable. For example:

Dilute dry CO=(dilute wet CO)/(1.00-0.02)

    (6) Calculate the raw dry-basis CO values by:

Raw dry CO=(DF) (dilute dry CO)

    (c) If the raw exhaust sampling and analysis system specified in 
Sec. 86.309-79 is used, the percent for carbon monoxide on a dry basis 
shall be calculated using the procedure, as applicable, in Sec. 86.345-
79.

the Clean Air Act and may result in penalties as specified in section 
205 of the Clean Air Act. The Administrator may grant extensions of the 
schedule in paragraph (c) if the manufacturer submits a written request 
to the Administrator specifying the reasons for the need for the 
extension. Requests for an extension must be received by EPA at least 5 
working days prior to the submittal date contained in paragraph (d).
    (f) The adjustment instructions (including labels) that the 
Administrator approves under this subpart shall be made available by the 
manufacturer at no cost to service outlets and the general public. EPA 
encourages manufacturers to notify vehicle owners in high-altitude areas 
of the availability of high-altitude adjustments.
    (g) If altitude adjustments are performed according to the 
instructions approved by the Administrator, they will not be treated as 
violations of the tampering provisions of section 203(a) of the Act 
except as described below:


<R05>
Sec. 86.1604  Conditions for disapproval.

    (a) The Administrator shall not approve altitude performance 
adjustments that will:
    (1) Cause any regulated pollutant emission level to increase if the 
emission level exceeded the appropriate emission standard before 
adjustment was made.
    (2) Cause any regulated pollutant emission level to exceed the 
appropriate emission standard if the emission level did not exceed the 
emission standard before the adjustment was made.
    (3) For light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, motorcycles, heavy-
duty gasoline-fueled engines, cause any reduction of vehicle performance 
(as evaluated by the manufacturer) such that vehicle drivers will likely 
complain.
    (4) Be of such technical complexity or require such complex, 
expensive, or

[[Page 354]]

exclusive equipment that a competent mechanic in an average service 
establishment cannot perform the adjustments correctly. Adjustment 
procedures should not require knowledge or training beyond that required 
to perform normal engine maintenance. All required equipment must be 
available to any service establishment at competitive cost.
    (5) Require the use of manufacturer parts, unless they are necessary 
to ensure emission control performance and unless the Administrator 
grants a waiver under section 207(c)(3)(B) of the Act.
    (6) Removes or defeats the parameter adjustment controls for the 
parameters listed in Secs. 86.081-22(e)(1)(i) and 86.082-22(e)(1)(i) for 
light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, and Sec. 86.428-80(d) for 
motorcycles unless:
    (i) The manufacturer determines that it is reasonable to restore the 
parameter adjustment control in use and provides appropriate instruction 
as part of the high-altitude performance adjustment instructions, or
    (ii) The manufacturer determines that is is not reasonable to 
restore the parameter adjustment control in use and alternatively 
includes on the label required in Sec. 86.1606 a statement to the effect 
that the labeled vehicle can be adjusted but that adjustment to other 
than manufacturer specification may be considered violation of Federal 
law.
    (b) If the Administrator determines that the altitude performance 
adjustment instructions cannot be approved, the Administrator shall 
notify the manufacturer in writing of the disapproval. This notification 
shall explain the reasons for the disapproval.
    (1) Within 20 working days of the date of a notification of 
disapproval, the manufacturer may file a written appeal to the 
Administrator. The Administrator may allow additional oral or written 
testimony prior to rendering a final decision.
    (2) If the manufacturer files no appeal with the Administrator, the 
disapproval becomes final.
    (3) Within 30 days following the Administrator's final decision of 
disapproval, the manufacturer must submit new altitude performance 
adjustment instructions applying to all of the vehicles for which the 
disapproved instructions applied. If these new instructions are not 
submitted within 30 days, EPA may take action under sections 203(a)(3) 
and 205 of the Act. If the new altitude performance adjustment 
instructions are disapproved by the Administrator, the manufacturer may 
follow the appeal procedures under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this 
section.
    (c) If the Administrator makes a final decision to disapprove the 
new instructions, EPA may take action under sections 203(a)(3) and 205 
of the Act.

manufacturers pursuant to the provisions specified in Sec. 86.1705. The 
provisions of this subpart are generally applicable to 1999 and later 
model year light-duty vehicles and light light-duty trucks to be sold in 
the Northeast Trading Region, and 2001 and later model year light-duty 
vehicles and light light-duty trucks to be sold in the United States. In 
cases where a provision applies only to certain vehicles based on model 
year, vehicle class, motor fuel, engine type, vehicle emission category, 
intended sales destination, or other distinguishing characteristics, 
such limited applicability is cited in the appropriate section or 
paragraph. The provisions of this subpart shall be referred to as the 
``National Low Emission Vehicle Program'' or ``National LEV'' or 
``NLEV.''

[[Page 356]]

    (b) All requirements of 40 CFR parts 85 and 86, unless specifically 
superseded by the provisions of this subpart, shall apply to vehicles 
under the National LEV Program. Compliance with the provisions of this 
subpart will be deemed compliance with some of the requirements of 40 
CFR parts 85 and 86, as set forth elsewhere in this subpart.
    (c) The requirements of this subpart apply to new vehicles 
manufactured by covered manufacturers through model year 2003. In 
addition, the requirements of this subpart apply to new vehicles 
manufactured by covered manufacturers for model years prior to the first 
model year for which a mandatory federal exhaust emissions program for 
light-duty vehicles and light light-duty trucks is at least as stringent

exhaust emissions, as determined by the Administrator, provided that 
such a program is promulgated no later than December 15, 2000, and is 
effective no later than model year 2006.
    (d) Adoption of the National LEV program does not impose gasoline or 
other in-use fuel requirements and is not intended to require any new 
federal or state regulation of fuels. Vehicles under National LEV will 
be able to operate on any fuels, including conventional gasoline, that, 
in the absence of the National LEV program, could be sold under federal 
or state law.
    (e) References in this subpart to engine families and emission 
control systems shall be deemed to refer to durability groups and test 
groups as applicable for manufacturers certifying new light-duty 
vehicles and light-duty trucks under the provisions of subpart S of this 
part.
    (f) The provisions of this subpart are not applicable to 2004 or 
later model year vehicles, except where specific references to 
provisions of this subpart are made in conjunction with provisions 
applicable to such vehicles.

    (ii) States with Existing ZEV Mandates may add language to the 
letter submitted pursuant to this paragraph (e)(2) confirming that this 
opt-in will not affect the state's requirements pertaining to ZEVs.
    (3) A letter signed by the head of the appropriate state agency that 
would unconditionally (except as set forth in this section) include the 
following:
    (i) States without a Section 177 Program, or with a Section 177 
Program but not an Existing ZEV Mandate, shall include the following 
language:

    National LEV is designed as a compliance alternative for OTC State 
programs adopted pursuant to section 177 of the Clean Air Act that apply 
to passenger cars, light-duty trucks up through 6,000 pounds GVWR, and/
or medium-duty vehicles from 6,001 to 14,000 pounds GVWR if designed to 
operate on gasoline, as these categories of motor vehicles are defined 
in the California Code of Regulations, Title 13, Division 3, Chapter 1, 
Article 1, Section 1900. For the duration of STATE's participation in 
National LEV, [STATE will allow manufacturers to / manufacturers may] 
comply with National LEV or equally stringent mandatory Federal 
standards in lieu of compliance with any program adopted by STATE 
pursuant to the authority provided in section 177 of the Clean Air Act 
applicable to the vehicle classes specified above, including any ZEV 
mandates. STATE's participation in National LEV extends until model year 
2006, except as provided in 40 CFR 86.1707. If, no later than December 
15, 2000, the US EPA does not adopt standards at least as stringent as 
the National LEV standards provided in 40 CFR part 86 subpart R that 
apply to new motor vehicles in model year 2004, 2005 or 2006, STATE's 
participation in National LEV extends only until model year 2004, except 
as provided in 40 CFR 86.1707.
    For the duration of STATE's participation in National LEV, STATE 
[intends to/will] forbear from adopting and implementing a ZEV mandate 
effective before model year 2006.

    (ii) States with a Section 177 Program and an Existing ZEV Mandate, 
shall include the following language:

    National LEV is designed as a compliance alternative for OTC State 
programs adopted pursuant to section 177 of the Clean Air Act that apply 
to passenger cars, light-duty trucks up through 6,000 pounds GVWR, and 
medium-duty vehicles from 6,001 to 14,000 pounds GVWR if designed to 
operate on gasoline, as these categories of motor vehicles are defined 
in the California Code of Regulations, Title 13, Division 3, Chapter 1, 
Article 1, Section 1900. With the exception of any requirements 
pertaining to ZEVs, for the duration of STATE's participation in 
National LEV, [STATE will allow manufacturers to / manufacturers may] 
comply with National LEV or equally stringent mandatory Federal 
standards in lieu of compliance with any program adopted by STATE 
pursuant to the authority provided in section 177 of the Clean Air Act 
applicable to the vehicle classes specified above. STATE's participation 
in National LEV extends until model year 2006, except as provided in 40 
CFR 86.1707. If, no later than December 15, 2000, the US EPA does not 
adopt standards at least as stringent as the National LEV standards 
provided in 40 CFR part 86 subpart R that apply to new motor vehicles in 
model year 2004, 2005 or 2006, STATE's participation in National LEV 
extends only until model year 2004, except as provided in 40 CFR 
86.1707. Any existing or future requirement pertaining to ZEVs is not 
affected by STATE's acceptance of National LEV as a compliance 
alternative for other state requirements.

    (iii) All states shall include the following language:


[[Page 363]]


    Based on EPA's determination in the preamble to the final National 
LEV rule [CITE], STATE believes that National LEV will achieve 
reductions of VOC and NO<INF>X</INF> emissions that are equivalent to or 
greater than the reductions that would be achieved through OTC State 
adoption of California Low Emission Vehicle programs in the Ozone 
Transport Region.

    (iv) All states shall include the following language:

    STATE intends National LEV to be STATE's new motor vehicle emissions 
control program.

    (v) All states shall include the following language:

    STATE recognizes that motor vehicle manufacturers are committing to 
National LEV with the expectation that, until model year 2006 (or, under 
the circumstances specified above, model year 2004), the OTC States that 
commit to the National LEV program will allow National LEV as a 
compliance alternative for state programs adopted pursuant to the 
authority provided in section 177 of the Clean Air Act, applying to the 
vehicle classes specified above (except any requirements pertaining to 
ZEVs in states with Existing ZEV Mandates). It is our intent to abide by 
this commitment. [However, the provisions of this letter will not have 
the force of law until STATE adopts them as state regulations. / 
Regulations providing for STATE's opt-in to National LEV have been 
approved for proposed rulemaking by APPROPRIATE STATE AGENCY on [INSERT 
DATE]. However, they will not have the force and effect of law until 
they are approved as final regulations.] Adoption of state regulations 
and the contents of a final state implementation plan revision will be 
determined through a state rulemaking process pursuant to the state 
requirements at [CITE to STATE law] and Federal law. Also, STATE must 
comply with any subsequent STATE legislation that might affect this 
commitment.

    (vi) All states shall include the following language:

    If the manufacturers exit the National LEV program pursuant to the 
EPA National LEV regulations at 40 CFR 86.1707, STATE [acknowledges / 
provides in its proposed rule] that the transition from National LEV 
requirements to any STATE program adopted pursuant to the authority 
provided in section 177 of the Clean Air Act applying to the vehicle 
classes specified above, including any requirements pertaining to ZEVs 
(except any requirements pertaining to ZEVs in states with Existing ZEV 
Mandates), will proceed in accordance with the EPA National LEV 
regulations at 40 CFR 86.1707.

    (vii) All states shall include the following language:

    STATE supports the legitimacy of the National LEV program and EPA's 
authority to promulgate the National LEV regulations.

    (viii) Any state may include the following language:

    [This [commitment/opt-in] / As provided in the proposed regulations, 
STATE's opt-in] is conditioned on all motor vehicle manufacturers 
(listed in EPA regulations at 40 CFR 86.1706(c)) opting into National 
LEV and on EPA finding that National LEV is in effect pursuant to 40 CFR 
86.1706.

    (4) In lieu of statements described in paragraphs (e)(3)(i), 
(e)(3)(ii) and (e)(3)(vi) of this section, states may submit proposed 
regulations containing the provisions required under paragraphs (g)(1), 
(g)(2), (g)(3), and (g)(5) of this section.
    (f) A state shall be considered to have opted in upon the 
Administrator's receipt of the opt-in notification and satisfaction of 
the conditions set forth in paragraph (e)(3)(viii) of this section, if 
applicable.
    (g) Each OTC State that opts into National LEV pursuant to paragraph 
(e) of this section shall submit a state implementation plan (SIP) 
revision within one year and seventy-five days of December 16, 1997 
except for the District of Columbia, New Hampshire, Delaware, and 
Virginia, for which the deadline is 18 months and seventy-five days from

mandatory Federal standards in lieu of compliance with any program, 
including any mandates for sales of zero emission vehicles (ZEVs), 
adopted by STATE pursuant to the authority provided in section 177 of 
the Clean Air Act applicable to passenger cars, light-duty trucks up 
through 6,000 pounds GVWR, and/or medium-duty vehicles from 6,001 to 
14,000 pounds GVWR if designed to operate on gasoline, as these 
categories of motor vehicles are defined in the California

[[Page 364]]

Code of Regulations, Title 13, Division 3, Chapter 1, Article 1, Section 
1900.
    STATE's participation in National LEV extends until model year 2006, 
except as provided in 40 CFR 86.1707. If, no later than December 15, 
2000, the US EPA does not adopt standards at least as stringent as the 
National LEV standards provided in 40 CFR part 86 subpart R that apply 
to new motor vehicles in model year 2004, 2005 or 2006, STATE's 
participation in National LEV extends only until model year 2004, except 
as provided in 40 CFR 86.1707.

    (2) Covered states with a Section 177 Program and an Existing ZEV 
Mandate shall submit regulations containing the following language:

    With the exception of any STATE requirements pertaining to zero 
emission vehicles (ZEVs), for the duration of STATE's participation in 
National LEV, manufacturers may comply with National LEV or equally

participation in National LEV extends only until model year 2004, except 
as provided in 40 CFR 86.1707.
    Any existing or future STATE requirement pertaining to ZEVs is not 
affected by STATE's acceptance of National LEV as a compliance 
alternative for other state requirements.

    (3) All covered states shall submit regulations containing the 
following language:

    If a covered manufacturer, as defined at 40 CFR 86.1702, opts out of 
the National LEV program pursuant to the EPA National LEV regulations at 
40 CFR 86.1707, the transition from National LEV requirements to any

<R05>
Sec. 86.1707-99  General provisions; opt-outs.

    A covered manufacturer or covered state may opt out of the National 
LEV program only according to the provisions of this section. Vehicles 
certified under the National LEV program must continue to meet the 
standards to which they were certified, regardless of whether the 
manufacturer of those vehicles remains a covered manufacturer. A 
manufacturer that has opted out remains responsible for any debits 
outstanding on the effective date of opt-out, pursuant to 
Sec. 86.1710(d)(3).
    (a) Procedures for opt-outs--manufacturers. To opt out of the 
National LEV program, a covered manufacturer must notify the 
Administrator as provided in Sec. 86.1705(c)(1), except that the 
notification shall specify the condition and final action allowing opt-
out, indicate the manufacturer's intent to opt out of the program and no 
longer be subject to the provisions in this subpart, and specify an 
effective date for the opt-out. The effective date shall be specified in 
terms of the first model year for which the opt-out shall be effective, 
but shall be no earlier than the applicable date indicated in paragraphs 
(d) through (j) of this section. For an opt-out pursuant to paragraph 
(d) of this section, the manufacturer shall specify the revision 
triggering the opt-out and shall also provide evidence that the 
triggering revision does not harmonize the standard or requirement with 
a comparable California standard or requirement, if applicable, or that 
the triggering revision has increased the stringency of the revised 
standard or requirement, if applicable. The notification shall include 
the following language:

    XX COMPANY, its subsidiaries, successors and assigns hereby opt out 
of the voluntary National LEV program, as set forth in 40 CFR part 86, 
subpart R.

    (b) Procedures for opt-outs--OTC states. To opt out of the National 
LEV program, a covered state must notify the Administrator through a 
written statement from the head of the appropriate state agency. A copy 
of the notification shall be sent to the Director, Vehicle Programs and 
Compliance Division; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; 2565 Plymouth 
Road; Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48105. The notification shall specify the 
final action allowing opt-out, indicate the state's intent to opt out of 
the program and no longer be subject to the provisions in this subpart, 
and specify an effective date for the opt-out. The effective date shall 
be specified in terms of the first model year for which the opt-out 
shall be effective, but shall be no earlier than the applicable date 
indicated in paragraphs (d) through (k) of this section. The 
notification shall include the following language:

    STATE hereby opts out of the voluntary National LEV program, as set 
forth in 40 CFR part 86, subpart R.


[[Page 366]]


    (c) Procedures for opt-outs--EPA notification. Upon receipt of an 
opt-out notification under this section, EPA shall promptly notify the 
covered states and covered manufacturers of the opt-out. Publication in 
the Federal Register of notice of receipt of the opt-out notification is 
sufficient but not necessary to meet EPA's obligation to notify covered 
states and covered manufacturers.
    (d) Conditions allowing manufacturer opt-outs--change to Stable 
Standards. A covered manufacturer may opt out if EPA promulgates a final 
rule or takes other final agency action making a revision not specified 
in paragraph (d)(9)(iii) of this section to a standard or requirement 
listed in paragraph (d)(9)(i) of this section and the covered 
manufacturer objects to the revision.
    (1) A covered manufacturer may opt out within 180 calendar days of 
the EPA action allowing opt-out under this paragraph (d). A valid opt-
out based on a revision to a Core Stable Standard shall be effective no 
earlier than the model year named for the calendar year following the 
calendar year in which EPA receives the manufacturer's opt-out 
notification. A valid opt-out based on a revision to a Non-Core Stable 
Standard may become effective no earlier than the first model year to 
which that revision applies.
    (i) Only a covered manufacturer that objects to a revision may opt 
out if EPA adopts that revision, except that if such a manufacturer opts 
out, other manufacturers that did not object to the revision may also 
opt out pursuant to paragraph (j) of this section. An objection shall be 
sufficient for this purpose only if it was filed during the public 
comment period on the proposed revision and the objection states that 
the proposed revision is sufficiently significant to allow opt-out under 
this paragraph (d).
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (2) Within sixty days of receipt of an opt-out notification under 
this paragraph (d), EPA shall determine whether the opt-out is valid by 
determining whether the alleged condition allowing opt-out has occurred 
and whether the opt-out complies with the requirements under paragraphs 
(a) and (d) of this section. An EPA determination regarding the validity 
of an opt-out is not a rule, but is a nationally applicable final agency 
action subject to judicial review pursuant to section 307(b) of the 
Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7607(b)).
    (3) A manufacturer that has submitted an opt-out notification to EPA 
under this paragraph (d) remains a covered manufacturer until the opt-
out has come into effect under paragraph (d)(1) of this section and EPA 
or a reviewing court determines that the opt-out is valid.
    (4) In the event that a manufacturer petitions for judicial review 
of an EPA determination that an opt-out is invalid, the manufacturer 
remains a covered manufacturer until final judicial resolution of the 
petition. Pending resolution of the petition, and starting with the 
model year for which the opt-out would have come into effect under 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section if EPA had determined the opt-out was 
valid, the manufacturer may certify vehicles to any standards in this 
part applicable to vehicles certified in that model year and sell such 
vehicles without regard to the limitations contained in Sec. 86.1711. 
However, if the opt-out is finally determined to be invalid, the 
manufacturer will be liable for any failure to comply with Secs. 86.1710 
through 86.1712.
    (5) Upon the effective date of a manufacturer's opt-out under this 
paragraph (d), that manufacturer shall be subject to all requirements 
(except ZEV Mandates) that would apply to a manufacturer that had not 
opted into the National LEV program, including all applicable standards 
and other requirements promulgated under title II of the Clean Air Act 
(42 U.S.C. 7521 et seq.) and any state standards and other requirements 
(except ZEV Mandates) in effect pursuant to section 177 of the Clean Air 
Act (42 U.S.C. 7507). For any state Section 177 Program that allowed 
National LEV as a compliance alternative and was adopted at least two 
years before the effective date of a manufacturer's opt-out, a 
manufacturer waives its right under section 177 of the Clean Air Act to 
two years of lead time to the extent that the effective date of its opt-
out provides for less than two years of lead time and to the extent such 
a waiver is necessary. With respect to ZEV Mandates, the manufacturer 
will

[[Page 367]]

not be deemed to have waived its two-year lead time under section 177 of 
the Clean Air Act. A manufacturer shall not be subject to any ZEV 
Mandates (except Existing ZEV Mandates) in OTC States until the model 
year (as defined in part 85, subpart X) that commences two years after 
the date of EPA's receipt of the manufacturer's opt-out notice.
    (6) If a covered manufacturer opts out under this paragraph (d), any 
covered state that is not a violating state under paragraph (e), (f), 
(g) or (h) of this section may opt out within 90 calendar days of the 
date of either an EPA finding that the opt-out is valid, or a judicial 
ruling that a disputed opt-out is valid. The state's opt-out 
notification shall specify an effective date for the state's opt-out no 
earlier than two calendar years after the date of EPA's receipt of the 
state's opt-out notification and shall provide that the opt out is not 
effective for model years (as defined in part 85, subpart X) that 
commence prior to this effective date.
    (7) In a state that opts out pursuant to paragraph (d)(6) of this 
section, obligations under National LEV shall be unaffected for covered 
manufacturers until the effective date of the state's opt-out. Upon the 
effective date of the state's opt-out, in that state covered 
manufacturers shall comply with any state standards and other 
requirements in effect pursuant to section 177 of the Clean Air Act or, 
if such state standards are not in effect, with all requirements that 
would apply to a manufacturer that had not opted into the National LEV 
program, including all applicable standards and other requirements 
promulgated under title II of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7521 et 
seq.).
    (8) In a state that has not opted out, obligations under National 
LEV shall be unaffected for covered manufacturers.
    (9)(i) The following are the emissions standards and requirements 
that, if revised, may provide covered manufacturers the opportunity to 
opt out pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section:
    (A) The tailpipe emissions standards for NMOG, NO<INF>x</INF>, CO, 
HCHO, and PM specified in Sec. 86.1708(b) and (c) and Sec. 86.1709(b) 
and (c);
    (B) Fleet average NMOG standards and averaging, banking and trading 
provisions specified in Sec. 86.1710;
    (C) Provisions regarding limitations on sale of Tier 1 vehicles and 
TLEVs contained in Sec. 86.1711;
    (D) The compliance test procedure (Federal Test Procedure) as 
specified in subparts A and B of this part, as used for determining 
compliance with the exhaust emission standards specified in 
Sec. 86.1708(b) and (c) and Sec. 86.1709(b) and (c);
    (E) The compliance test fuel, as specified in Sec. 86.1771;
    (F) The definition of low volume manufacturer specified in 
Sec. 86.1702;
    (G) The on-board diagnostic system requirements specified in 
Sec. 86.1717;
    (H) The light-duty vehicle refueling emissions standards and 
provisions specified in Sec. 86.099-8(d), and the light-duty truck 
refueling emissions standards and provisions specified in Sec. 86.001-
9(d);
    (I) The cold temperature carbon monoxide standards and provisions 
for light-duty vehicles specified in Sec. 86.099-8(k), and for light 
light-duty trucks specified in Sec. 86.099-9(k);
    (J) The evaporative emissions standards and provisions for light-
duty vehicles specified in Sec. 86.099-8(b), and the evaporative 
emissions standards and provisions for light light-duty trucks specified 
in Sec. 86.099-9(b);
    (K) The reactivity adjustment factors and procedures specified in 
Sec. 86.1777(d);
    (L) The Supplemental Federal Test Procedure, standards and phase-in 
schedules specified in Secs. 86.1708(e), 86.1709(e), 86.127(f) and (g), 
86.129(e) and (f), 86.130(e), 86.131(f), 86.132(n) and (o), 86.158, 
86.159, 86.160, 86.161, 86.162, 86.163, 86.164, and Appendix I to this 
part, paragraphs (g) and (h).
    (ii) The standards and requirements listed in paragraphs 
(d)(9)(i)(A) through (d)(9)(i)(F) of this section are the ``Core Stable 
Standards''; the standards and requirements listed in paragraphs 
(d)(9)(i)(G) through (d)(9)(i)(L) of this section are the ``Non-Core 
Stable Standards.''
    (iii) The following types of revisions to the Stable Standards 
listed in paragraph (d)(9)(i) of this section do not provide covered 
manufacturers the

[[Page 368]]

right to opt out of the National LEV program:
    (A) Revisions to which covered manufacturers do not object;
    (B) Revisions to a Non-Core Stable Standard that do not increase the 
overall stringency of the standard or requirement;
    (C) Revisions to a Non-Core Stable Standard that harmonize the 
standard or requirement with the comparable California standard or 
requirement for the same model year (even if the harmonization increases 
the stringency of the standard or requirement), provided that, if the 
relevant California factor is raised to 1.0 or higher, EPA can only 
raise to 1.0 any of the reactivity adjustment factors specified in 
86.1777 applicable to gasoline meeting the specifications of 
86.1771(a)(1); and
    (D) Revisions to cold temperature carbon monoxide standards and 
provisions for light-duty vehicles (as specified in Sec. 86.099-8(k)) 
and for light light-duty trucks (as specified in Sec. 86.099-9(k)) that 
are effective after model year 2000.
    (10) Promulgation by EPA of mandatory tailpipe standards and other 
related requirements effective model year 2004 or later does not provide 
an opportunity to opt out of the National LEV program.
    (e) Conditions allowing manufacturer opt-outs--state Section 177 
Program that does not allow National LEV as a compliance alternative. A 
covered manufacturer may opt out of National LEV if a covered state 
takes final action such that it has in its regulations or state law a 
state Section 177 Program and/or a ZEV Mandate (except in a state with 
an Existing ZEV Mandate), that does not allow National LEV as a 
compliance alternative for the duration of the state's commitment to the 
National LEV program. The state's commitment to National LEV extends 
until model year 2006. If, no later than December 15, 2000, EPA has not 
adopted standards at least as stringent as the National LEV standards 
provided in 40 CFR part 86, subpart R that apply to new motor vehicles 
in model year 2004, 2005 or 2006, the state's commitment to National LEV 
only extends until model year 2004. A manufacturer could opt out based 
on this condition even if the state regulations or law are contrary to 
an approved SIP revision committing the state to National LEV pursuant 
to Sec. 86.1705(g). For purposes of this paragraph (e), such a state 
shall be called the ``violating state.''
    (1) A covered manufacturer may opt out any time after the violating 
state takes such final action, provided that the violating state has not 
withdrawn or otherwise nullified the relevant final action prior to 
EPA's receipt of the opt-out notification. An opt-out under this 
paragraph (e) shall be effective no earlier than the model year named 
for the calendar year following the calendar year in which EPA receives 
the manufacturer's opt-out notification.
    (2) As of the model year named for the calendar year following the 
calendar year of the violating state's final action, the violating state 
shall no longer be included in the applicable trading region for 
purposes of calculating covered manufacturers' compliance with the fleet 
average NMOG standards under Sec. 86.1710, and Sec. 86.1711 shall no 
longer apply to vehicles sold in the violating state. Beginning in that 
model year and until the violating state's requirements become effective 
pursuant to sections 110(l) and 177 of the Clean Air Act or until the 
date specified in the following sentence, whichever is earlier, the 
National LEV program allows covered manufacturers to certify and produce 
for sale vehicles meeting the exhaust emission standards of Sec. 86.096-
8(a)(1)(i) and subsequent model year provisions or Sec. 86.097-
9(a)(1)(i) and subsequent model year provisions in the violating state. 
If the violating state withdraws or otherwise nullifies the relevant 
violating final action, vehicles sold in that state shall count towards 
the covered manufacturers' fleet NMOG standards under Sec. 86.1710 and 
be subject to Sec. 86.1711 as of the model year named for the second 
calendar year following the calendar year in which the violating state 
took the final action nullifying or withdrawing the final violating 
action, or as of the model year named for the fourth calendar year 
following the calendar year in which the violating state took the 
violating final action, whichever is later. The two-year lead time

[[Page 369]]

required by section 177 of the Clean Air Act for the state Section 177 
Program or ZEV Mandate shall run from the date of the violating final 
action. Notwithstanding an earlier effective date of a manufacturer's 
opt-out under this paragraph (e), the manufacturer's opt-out is not 
effective in the violating state until the two-year lead time for the 
violating state's program has passed (which shall run from the date of 
the violating final action). For model years for which vehicles sold in 
the violating state do not count towards the National LEV NMOG average, 
in calculating emissions reductions from new motor vehicles creditable 
for state implementation plan requirements, the violating state's 
emissions reductions shall be based on the emission standards of 
Secs. 86.096--8(a)(1)(i), 86.097-9(a)(1)(i) and subsequent model year 
provisions, and shall not be based on the National LEV standards, 
provided that vehicles sold in the violating state are certified to Tier 
1 levels when sold in that state.
    (3) Upon the effective date of a manufacturer's opt-out under this 
paragraph (e) in any covered state that is not a violating state under 
this paragraph (e), that manufacturer shall be subject to all 
requirements (except ZEV Mandates) that would apply to a manufacturer 
that had not opted into the National LEV program, including all 
applicable standards and other requirements promulgated under title II 
of the Clean Air Act and any state standards and other requirements 
(except ZEV Mandates) in effect pursuant to section 177 of the Clean Air 
Act (42 U.S.C. 7507). For any state Section 177 Program that allowed 
National LEV as a compliance alternative and was adopted by a non-
violating state at least two years before the effective date of a 
manufacturer's opt-out, a manufacturer waives its right under section 
177 of the Clean Air Act to two years of lead time to the extent that 
the effective date of its opt-out provides for less than two years of 
lead time and to the extent such a waiver is necessary. With respect to 
ZEV Mandates, the manufacturer will not be deemed to have waived its 
two-year lead time under section 177 of the Clean Air Act. A 
manufacturer shall not be subject to any ZEV Mandates (except Existing 
ZEV Mandates) in OTC States until the model year (as defined in part 85, 
subpart X) that commences two years after the date of EPA's receipt of 
the manufacturer's opt-out notice.
    (4) If a covered manufacturer opts out under this paragraph (e), any 
covered state that is not a violating state under paragraph (e), (f), 
(g) or (h) of this section may opt out within 90 calendar days of EPA's 
receipt of the manufacturer's opt-out notification. The state's opt-out 
notification shall specify an effective date for the state's opt-out no 
earlier than two calendar years after the date of EPA's receipt of the 
state's opt-out notification and shall provide that the opt-out is not 
effective for model years (as defined in part 85, subpart X), that 
commence prior to this effective date.
    (5) In a non-violating state that opts out pursuant to paragraph 
(e)(4) of this section, obligations under National LEV shall be 
unaffected for covered manufacturers until the effective date of the 
non-violating state's opt-out. Upon the effective date of the state's 
opt-out, in that state covered manufacturers shall comply with any state 
standards and other requirements in effect pursuant to section 177 of 
the Clean Air Act or, if such state standards are not in effect, with 
all requirements that would apply to a manufacturer that had not opted 
into the National LEV program, including all applicable standards and 
other requirements promulgated under title II of the Clean Air Act (42 
U.S.C. 7521 et seq.).
    (6) In a non-violating state that has not opted out, obligations 
under National LEV shall be unaffected for covered manufacturers.
    (f) Conditions allowing manufacturer opt-outs--failure to submit SIP 
revision. A covered manufacturer may opt out of National LEV if a 
covered state fails to submit a National LEV SIP revision on the date 
specified in Sec. 86.1705(g). For purposes of this paragraph (f), such a 
state shall be called the ``violating state.''
    (1) A covered manufacturer may opt out any time after the violating 
state misses the deadline for its National LEV SIP revision, provided 
that EPA has not received a National LEV SIP

[[Page 370]]

revision from the violating state prior to EPA's receipt of the 
manufacturer's opt-out notification. If a manufacturer opts out within 
180 calendar days from the deadline for the state to submit its National 
LEV SIP revision, the opt-out must be conditioned on the state not 
submitting a National LEV SIP revision within 180 calendar days from the 
deadline for such SIP revision. If the state submits such a SIP revision 
within the 180-day period, any manufacturer opt-outs under this 
paragraph (f) would be invalidated and would not come into effect. An 
opt-out under this paragraph (f) shall be effective no earlier than 
model year 2000 (or model year 2001 if the violating state is the 
District of Columbia, New Hampshire, Delaware, or Virginia) or the model 
year named for the calendar year following the calendar year in which 
EPA receives the opt-out notification, whichever is later.
    (2) For a manufacturer that opts out under this paragraph (f), as of 
model year 2000 (or model year 2001 if the violating state is the 
District of Columbia, New Hampshire, Delaware, or Virginia) or the model 
year named for the calendar year following the calendar year in which 
EPA receives the opt-out notification, whichever is later, the violating 
state shall no longer be included in the applicable trading region for 
purposes of calculating that manufacturer's compliance with the fleet 
average NMOG standards under Sec. 86.1710 and the manufacturer does not 
have to comply with Sec. 86.1711 for vehicles sold in the violating 
state. Beginning in that model year and until the manufacturer's opt-out 
becomes effective, the National LEV program allows a manufacturer that 
has opted out under this paragraph (f) to certify and produce for sale 
vehicles meeting the exhaust emission standards of Sec. 86.096-
8(a)(1)(i) and subsequent model year provisions or Sec. 86.097-
9(a)(1)(i) and subsequent model year provisions in the violating state. 
For model years in which vehicles sold in the violating state do not 
count towards the National LEV NMOG average, in calculating emission 
reductions from new motor vehicles creditable for state implementation 
plan requirements, the violating state's emissions reductions shall be 
based on the emissions standards of Secs. 86.096-8(a)(1)(i), 86.097-
9(a)(1)(i), and subsequent model year provisions, and shall not be based 
on the National LEV standards, provided that vehicles sold in the 
violating state are certified to Tier 1 levels when sold in that state. 
National LEV obligations in the violating state remain unchanged for 
those manufacturers that do not opt out based on this condition.
    (3) Upon the effective date of a manufacturer's opt-out under this 
paragraph (f), in any covered state that is not a violating state under 
this paragraph (f), that manufacturer shall be subject to all 
requirements (except ZEV Mandates) that would apply to a manufacturer 
that had not opted into the National LEV program, including all 
applicable standards and other requirements promulgated under title II 
of the Clean Air Act and any state standards and other requirements 
(except ZEV Mandates) in effect pursuant to section 177 of the Clean Air 
Act (42 U.S.C. 7507). For any state Section 177 Program that allowed 
National LEV as a compliance alternative and was adopted by a non-
violating state at least two years before the effective date of a 
manufacturer's opt-out, a manufacturer waives its right under section 
177 of the Clean Air Act to two years of lead time to the extent that 
the effective date of its opt-out provides for less than two years of 
lead time and to the extent such a waiver is necessary. With respect to 
ZEV Mandates, the manufacturer will not be deemed to have waived its 
two-year lead time under section 177 of the Clean Air Act. A 
manufacturer shall not be subject to any ZEV Mandates (except Existing 
ZEV Mandates) in OTC States until the model year (as defined in part 85, 
subpart X) that commences two years after the date of EPA's receipt of 
the manufacturer's opt-out notice.
    (4) If a covered manufacturer opts out under this paragraph (f), any 
covered state that is not a violating state under paragraph (e), (f), 
(g) or (h) of this section may opt out within 90 calendar days of EPA's 
receipt of the manufacturer's opt-out notification. The state's opt-out 
notification shall specify an effective date for the state's opt-out no 
earlier than two calendar

[[Page 371]]

years after the date of EPA's receipt of the state's opt-out 
notification and shall provide that the opt-out is not effective for 
model years (as defined in part 85, subpart X), that commence prior to 
this effective date.
    (5) In a non-violating state that opts out pursuant to paragraph 
(f)(4) of this section, obligations under National LEV shall be 
unaffected for covered manufacturers until the effective date of the 
non-violating state's opt-out. Upon the effective date of the state's 
opt-out, in that state covered manufacturers shall comply with any state 
standards and other requirements in effect pursuant to section 177 of 
the Clean Air Act or, if such state standards are not in effect, with 
all requirements that would apply to a manufacturer that had not opted 
into the National LEV program, including all applicable standards and 
other requirements promulgated under title II of the Clean Air Act (42 
U.S.C. 7521 et seq.).
    (6) In a non-violating state that has not opted out, obligations 
under National LEV shall be unaffected for covered manufacturers.
    (g) Conditions allowing manufacturer opt-outs--inadequate National 
LEV SIP submission. A covered manufacturer may opt out of National LEV 
if EPA disapproves a covered state's National LEV SIP submission or 
finds that it fails to meet the requirements for a National LEV SIP 
revision set forth in Sec. 86.1705(g) or if EPA has not taken final 
action regarding such a SIP submission and more than one year has passed 
since such SIP submission was submitted to EPA. For purposes of this 
paragraph (g), such a state shall be called the ``violating state.''
    (1) A covered manufacturer may opt out any time after EPA has 
disapproved a state's National LEV SIP submission or found that it does 
not meet the requirements of Sec. 86.1705(g), provided that EPA has not 
subsequently approved a revised National LEV SIP revision from that 
state and found that the SIP revision meets the requirements of 
Sec. 86.1705(g). A covered manufacturer may also opt out any time after 
one year EPA's receipt of a state's National LEV SIP submission, 
provided that EPA has not approved the revision or has not found that 
the SIP revision meets the requirements of Sec. 86.1705(g). An opt-out 
under this condition shall be effective no earlier than the model year 
named for the calendar year following the calendar year in which the EPA 
receives the manufacturer's opt-out notification.
    (2) For a manufacturer that opts out under this paragraph (g), as of 
the model year named for the calendar year following the calendar year 
in which EPA receives the opt-out notification, the violating state 
shall no longer be included in the applicable trading region for 
purposes of calculating that manufacturer's compliance with the fleet 
average NMOG standards under Sec. 86.1710 and the manufacturer does not 
have to comply with Sec. 86.1711 for vehicles sold in the violating 
state. Beginning in that model year and until the manufacturer's opt-out 
becomes effective, the National LEV program allows a manufacturer that 
has opted out under this paragraph (g) to certify and produce for sale 
vehicles meeting the exhaust emission standards of Sec. 86.096-
8(a)(1)(i) and subsequent model year provisions or Sec. 86.097-
9(a)(1)(i) and subsequent model year provisions in the violating state. 
For model years in which vehicles sold in the violating state do not 
count towards the National LEV NMOG average, in calculating emission 
reductions from new motor vehicles creditable for state implementation 
plan requirements, the violating state's emissions reductions shall be 
based on the emissions standards of Secs. 86.096-8(a)(1)(i), 86.097-
9(a)(1)(i), and subsequent model year provisions, and shall not be based 
on the National LEV standards, provided that vehicles sold in the 
violating state are certified to Tier 1 levels when sold in that state. 
National LEV obligations in the violating state remain unchanged for 
those manufacturers that do not opt out based on this condition.
    (3) Upon the effective date of a manufacturer's opt-out under this 
paragraph (g), in any covered state that is not a violating state under 
this paragraph (g), that manufacturer shall be subject

[[Page 372]]

to all requirements (except ZEV Mandates) that would apply to a 
manufacturer that had not opted into the National LEV program, including 
all applicable standards and other requirements promulgated under title 
II of the Clean Air Act and any state standards and other requirements 
(except ZEV Mandates) in effect pursuant to section 177 of the Clean Air 
Act (42 U.S.C. 7507). For any state Section 177 Program that allowed 
National LEV as a compliance alternative and was adopted by a non-
violating state at least two years before the effective date of a 
manufacturer's opt-out, a manufacturer waives its right under section 
177 of the Clean Air Act to two years of lead time to the extent that 
the effective date of its opt-out provides for less than two years of 
lead time and to the extent such a waiver is necessary. With respect to 
ZEV Mandates, the manufacturer will not be deemed to have waived its 
two-year lead time under section 177 of the Clean Air Act. A 
manufacturer shall not be subject to any ZEV Mandates (except Existing 
ZEV Mandates) in OTC States until the model year (as defined in part 85, 
subpart X) that commences two years after the date of EPA's receipt of 
the manufacturer's opt-out notice.
    (4) If a covered manufacturer opts out under this paragraph (g), any 
covered state that is not a violating state under paragraph (e), (f), 
(g) or (h) of this section may opt out within 90 calendar days of EPA's 
receipt of the manufacturer's opt-out notification. The state's opt-out 
notification shall specify an effective date for the state's opt-out 
that is no earlier than two calendar years after the date of EPA's 
receipt of the state's opt-out notification and shall provide that the 
opt-out is not effective for model years (as defined in part 85, subpart 
X that commence prior to this effective date.
    (5) In a non-violating state that opts out pursuant to paragraph 
(g)(4) of this section, obligations under National LEV shall be 
unaffected for covered manufacturers until the effective date of the 
non-violating state's opt-out. Upon the effective date of the state's 
opt-out, in that state covered manufacturers shall comply with any state 
standards and other requirements in effect pursuant to section 177 of 
the Clean Air Act or, if such state standards are not in effect, with 
all requirements that would apply to a manufacturer that had not opted 
into the National LEV program, including all applicable standards and 
other requirements promulgated under title II of the Clean Air Act (42 
U.S.C. 7521 et seq.).
    (6) In a non-violating state that has not opted out, obligations 
under National LEV shall be unaffected for covered manufacturers.
    (h) Conditions allowing manufacturer opt-outs--adoption of a ZEV 
Mandate. A covered manufacturer to which a ZEV Mandate might apply may 
opt out of National LEV if a covered state without an Existing ZEV 
Mandate takes final action such that it has in its regulations or state 
law a ZEV Mandate that allows National LEV as a compliance alternative 
that would be effective during the state's commitment to National LEV. 
For purposes of this paragraph (h), such a state shall be called the 
``violating state.''
    (1) A covered manufacturer may opt out any time after the violating 
state takes the final action, provided that the violating state has not 
withdrawn or otherwise nullified the relevant final action prior to 
EPA's receipt of the opt-out notification. An opt-out under this opt-out 
condition shall be effective no earlier than the model year named for 
the calendar year following the calendar year in which EPA receives the 
manufacturer's opt-out notification.
    (2) For a manufacturer that opts out under this paragraph (h), as of 
the model year named for the calendar year following the calendar year 
in which EPA receives the opt-out notification, the violating state 
shall no longer be included in the applicable trading region for 
purposes of calculating that manufacturer's compliance with the fleet 
average NMOG standards under Sec. 86.1710 and the manufacturer does not 
have to comply with Sec. 86.1711 for vehicles sold in the violating 
state. Beginning in that model year and until the manufacturer's opt-out 
becomes effective, the National LEV program allows a manufacturer that 
has opted out under this paragraph (h) to certify and produce for sale 
vehicles meeting the

[[Page 373]]

exhaust emission standards of Sec. 86.096-8(a)(1)(i) and subsequent 
model year provisions or Sec. 86.097-9(a)(1)(i) and subsequent model 
year provisions in the violating state. For model years in which 
vehicles sold in the violating state do not count towards the National 
LEV NMOG average, in calculating emission reductions from new motor 
vehicles creditable for state implementation plan requirements, the 
violating state's emissions reductions shall be based on the emissions 
standards of Secs. 86.096-8(a)(1)(i), 86.097-9(a)(1)(i), and subsequent 
model year provisions, and shall not be based on the National LEV 
standards, provided that vehicles sold in the violating state are 
certified to Tier 1 levels when sold in that state. National LEV 
obligations in the violating state remain unchanged for those 
manufacturers that do not opt out based on this condition.
    (3) Upon the effective date of a manufacturer's opt-out under this 
paragraph (h), in any covered state that is not a violating state under 
this paragraph (h), that manufacturer shall be subject to all 
requirements (except ZEV Mandates) that would apply to a manufacturer 
that had not opted into the National LEV program, including all 
applicable standards and other requirements promulgated under title II 
of the Clean Air Act and any state standards and other requirements 
(except ZEV Mandates) in effect pursuant to section 177 of the Clean Air 
Act (42 U.S.C. 7507). For any state Section 177 Program that allowed 
National LEV as a compliance alternative and was adopted by a non-
violating state at least two years before the effective date of a 
manufacturer's opt-out, a manufacturer waives its right under section 
177 of the Clean Air Act to two years of lead time to the extent that 
the effective date of its opt-out provides for less than two years of 
lead time and to the extent such a waiver is necessary. With respect to 
ZEV Mandates, the manufacturer will not be deemed to have waived its 
two-year lead time under section 177 of the Clean Air Act. A 
manufacturer shall not be subject to any ZEV Mandates (except Existing 
ZEV Mandates) in OTC States until the model year (as defined in part 85, 
subpart X) that commences two years after the date of EPA's receipt of 
the manufacturer's opt-out notice.
    (4) If a covered manufacturer opts out under this paragraph (h), any 
covered state that is not a violating state under paragraph (e), (f), 
(g) or (h) of this section may opt out within 90 calendar days of EPA's 
receipt of the manufacturer's opt-out notification. The state's opt-out 
notification shall specify an effective date for the state's opt-out 
that is no earlier than two calendar years after the date of EPA's 
receipt of the state's opt-out notification and shall provide that the 
opt-out is not effective for model years (as defined in part 85, subpart 
X) that commence prior to this effective date.
    (5) In a non-violating state that opts out pursuant to paragraph 
(h)(4) of this section, obligations under National LEV shall be 
unaffected for covered manufacturers until the effective date of the 
non-violating state's opt-out. Upon the effective date of the state's 
opt-out, in that state covered manufacturers shall comply with any state 
standards and other requirements in effect pursuant to section 177 of 
the Clean Air Act or, if such state standards are not in effect, with 
all requirements that would apply to a manufacturer that had not opted 
into the National LEV program, including all applicable standards and 
other requirements promulgated under title II of the Clean Air Act (42 
U.S.C. 7521 et seq.).
    (6) In a non-violating state that has not opted out, obligations 
under National LEV shall be unaffected for covered manufacturers.
    (i) Conditions allowing manufacturer opt-outs--EPA failure to 
consider in-use fuel issues. A covered manufacturer may opt out of 
National LEV if EPA does not meet its obligations related to fuel sulfur 
effects, as those obligations are set forth in paragraph (i)(7) of this 
section.
    (1) A manufacturer may request in writing that EPA consider taking a 
specific action with regard to a fuel sulfur effect described in 
paragraph (i)(7) of this section. The request must identify the alleged 
fuel sulfur related problem, demonstrate that the problem exists and is 
caused by in-use fuel sulfur levels, ask EPA to consider taking a 
specific action, and demonstrate the

[[Page 374]]

emissions impact of the requested change. Within 60 calendar days of 
EPA's receipt of the manufacturer's request, EPA must consider the 
manufacturer's request and respond to it in writing, stating the 
Agency's decision and explaining the basis for the decision. The date of 
EPA's response is the date the response is signed.
    (2) If EPA fails to respond to a manufacturer's request within the 
time provided, the covered manufacturer that submitted the request may 
opt out within 180 calendar days of the deadline for the EPA response. 
(If such a manufacturer opts out, other manufacturers that did not 
submit requests may also opt out pursuant to paragraph (j) of this 
section.) An opt-out notification under this paragraph (i) is not valid 
if received by EPA after EPA responds to the request, even if EPA 
responds after the expiration of the 60-day EPA deadline. An opt-out 
under this paragraph (i) shall be effective no earlier than the model 
year named for the calendar year following the calendar year in which 
EPA receives the manufacturer's opt-out notification.
    (3) Upon the effective date of a manufacturer's opt-out under this 
paragraph (i), the manufacturer shall be subject to all requirements 
(except ZEV Mandates) that would apply to a manufacturer that had not 
opted into the National LEV program, including all applicable standards 
and other requirements promulgated under title II of the Clean Air Act 
(42 U.S.C. 7521 et seq.) and any state standards and other requirements 
(except ZEV Mandates) in effect pursuant to section 177 of the Clean Air 
Act (42 U.S.C. 7507). For any state Section 177 Program that allowed 
National LEV as a compliance alternative and was adopted at least two 
years before the effective date of a manufacturer's opt-out, a 
manufacturer waives its right under section 177 of the Clean Air Act to 
two years of lead time to the extent that the effective date of its opt-
out provides for less than two years of lead time and to the extent such 
a waiver is necessary. With respect to ZEV Mandates, the manufacturer 
will not be deemed to have waived its two-year lead time under section 
177 of the Clean Air Act. A manufacturer shall not be subject to any ZEV 
Mandates (except Existing ZEV Mandates) in OTC States until the model 
year (as defined in part 85, subpart X) that commences two years after 
the date of EPA's receipt of the manufacturer's opt-out notice.
    (4) If a covered manufacturer opts out under this paragraph (i), any 
covered state that is not a violating state under paragraph (e), (f), 
(g) or (h) of this section may opt out within 90 calendar days of EPA's 
receipt of the manufacturer's opt-out notification. The state's opt-out 
notification shall specify an effective date for the state's opt-out 
that is no earlier than two calendar years after the date of EPA's 
receipt of the state's opt-out notification and shall provide that the 
opt out is not effective for model years (as defined in part 85, subpart 
X), that commence prior to this effective date.
    (5) In a state that opts out pursuant to paragraph (i)(4) of this 
section, obligations under National LEV shall be unaffected for covered 
manufacturers until the effective date of the state's opt-out. Upon the 
effective date of the state's opt-out, in that state covered 
manufacturers shall comply with any state standards and other 
requirements in effect pursuant to section 177 of the Clean Air Act or, 
if such state standards are not in effect, with all requirements that 
would apply to a manufacturer that had not opted into the National LEV 
program, including all applicable standards and other requirements 
promulgated under title II of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7521 et 
seq.).
    (6) In a state that has not opted out, obligations under National 
LEV shall be unaffected for covered manufacturers.
    (7) Following are the actions that a manufacturer may request EPA to 
consider under paragraph (i)(1) of this section:
    (i) During the certification process and upon a manufacturer's 
written request, EPA will consider allowing the use of an on-board 
diagnostic system (as required by Sec. 86.1717), that functions properly 
on low sulfur gasoline, but indicates sulfur-induced passes when exposed 
to high sulfur gasoline.

[[Page 375]]

    (ii) Upon a manufacturer's written request, if vehicles exhibit 
illuminations of the emission control diagnostic system malfunction 
indicator light (as defined in Sec. 86.094-17(c)) due to high sulfur 
gasoline, EPA will consider allowing modifications to such vehicles on a 
case-by-case basis so as to eliminate the sulfur-induced illumination.
    (iii) Upon a manufacturer's written request, prior to in-use 
testing, that presents information to EPA regarding pre-conditioning 
procedures designed solely to remove the effects of high sulfur from 
currently available gasoline, EPA will consider allowing such procedures 
on a case-by-case basis.
    (j) Conditions allowing manufacturer opt-outs--OTC State or 
manufacturer opts out. A covered manufacturer may opt out of National 
LEV if a covered state or another covered manufacturer opts out of the 
National LEV program pursuant to this section.
    (1) If a covered manufacturer's opt-out under this paragraph (j) is 
based on a covered state's or covered manufacturer's opt-out under 
paragraph (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j) or (k) of this section, the 
manufacturer may opt out within 90 calendar days of EPA's receipt of the 
underlying state's or manufacturer's opt-out notification. If a 
manufacturer's opt-out under this paragraph (j) is based on a 
manufacturer's opt-out under paragraph (d) of this section, the 
manufacturer may only opt out within 90 calendar days of the date of 
either an EPA finding or a judicial ruling that the opt-out under 
paragraph (d) of this section is valid. An opt-out under this paragraph 
(j) shall be effective no earlier than the model year named for the 
calendar year following the calendar year in which the EPA receives the 
manufacturer's opt-out notification.
    (2) Upon the effective date of a manufacturer's opt-out under this 
paragraph (j), in any covered state that manufacturer shall be subject 
to all requirements (except ZEV Mandates) that would apply to a 
manufacturer that had not opted into National LEV, including all 
applicable standards and other requirements promulgated under title II 
of the Clean Air Act and any state standards and other requirements 
(except ZEV Mandates) in effect pursuant to section 177 of the Clean Air 
Act (42 U.S.C. 7507). For any state Section 177 Program that allowed 
National LEV as a compliance alternative and was adopted at least two 
years before the effective date of a manufacturer's opt-out, a 
manufacturer waives its right under section 177 of the Clean Air Act to 
two years of lead time to the extent that the effective date of its opt-
out provides for less than two years of lead time and to the extent such 
a waiver is necessary. With respect to ZEV Mandates, the manufacturer 
will not be deemed to have waived its two-year lead time under section 
177 of the Clean Air Act. A manufacturer shall not be subject to any ZEV 
Mandates (except Existing ZEV Mandates) in OTC States until the model 
year (as defined in part 85, subpart X) that commences two years after 
the date of EPA's receipt of the manufacturer's opt-out notice.
    (3) If a covered manufacturer opts out under this paragraph (j), any 
covered state that is not a violating state under paragraph (e), (f), 
(g) or (h) of this section may opt out within 90 calendar days of EPA's 
receipt of the manufacturer's opt-out notification. The state's opt-out 
notification shall specify an effective date for the state's opt-out no 
earlier than two calendar years after the date of EPA's receipt of the 
state's opt-out notification and shall provide that the opt-out is not 
effective for model years (as defined in part 85, subpart X), that 
commence prior to this effective date.
    (4) In a state that opts out pursuant to paragraph (j)(3) of this 
section, obligations under National LEV shall be unaffected for covered 
manufacturers until the effective date of the state's opt-out. Upon the 
effective date of the state's opt-out, in that state covered 
manufacturers shall comply with any state standards and other 
requirements in effect pursuant to section 177 of the Clean Air Act or, 
if such state standards are not in effect, with all requirements that 
would apply to a manufacturer that had not opted into the National LEV 
program, including all applicable standards and other requirements 
promulgated under title II of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7521 et 
seq.).

[[Page 376]]

    (5) In a state that has not opted out, obligations under National 
LEV remain unaffected for covered manufacturers.
    (k) Conditions allowing OTC State opt-outs--EPA finding of 
inequivalency. Any covered state may opt out of National LEV if EPA 
determines that National LEV would not produce (or is not producing) 
emissions reductions at least equivalent to the OTC State Section 177 
Programs.
    (1) At any time during National LEV, a covered state may request in 
writing that EPA reevaluate its initial equivalency determination (of 
December 16, 1997) that National LEV would produce emissions reductions 
at least equivalent to the OTC State Section 177 Programs that would be 
operative in the absence of National LEV. Within 180 calendar days of 
receipt of the state's request, EPA must take final agency action to 
determine whether the determination that National LEV will produce at 
least equivalent emission reductions to OTC State Section 177 Program is 
still valid. These EPA determinations are not rules, but are nationally 
applicable final agency actions subject to judicial review pursuant to 
section 307(b) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7607(b)). In reevaluating 
its equivalency determination, EPA shall use the same Mobile emission 
factor model and the same inputs and assumptions (including vehicle 
miles traveled, MOBILE5a model inputs, inspection and maintenance 
programs, reformulated gasoline, and permanent migration effects) as 
used in the initial determination, with the following exceptions:
    (i) In modeling the emission reductions from National LEV, EPA shall 
use any revised federal new motor vehicle standard or other requirement 
in place of the standard or other requirement as it existed when EPA 
made its initial determination; and, to the extent that the modeling 
reflects EPA's implementation of federal new motor vehicle standards or 
other requirements, EPA shall take any changes in such implementation 
into account.
    (ii) In modeling the emissions reductions that would be achieved 
through the OTC State Section 177 Programs that would apply in the 
absence of National LEV, EPA shall take into account all Section 177 
Programs adopted by OTC States (including programs that allow National 
LEV as a compliance alternative) that had been adopted subsequent to 
EPA's initial equivalency determination. In accounting for the emissions 
effect of OTC State Section 177 Programs, EPA shall continue to assume 
that all OTC State Section 177 Programs have the same substantive 
requirements used in EPA's initial equivalency determination and shall 
not model any effects of state regulation of medium-duty vehicles (as 
defined in the California Code of Regulations, Title 13, Division 3, 
Chapter 1, Article 1, Section 1900).
    (2) A covered state may opt out of National LEV within 90 calendar 
days of a final EPA determination pursuant to paragraph (k)(1) of this 
section that National LEV would not produce (or is not producing) 
emissions reductions at least equivalent to OTC State Section 177 
Programs. The state's opt-out notification shall specify an effective 
date for the state's opt-out that is no earlier than two calendar years 
after the date of EPA's receipt of the state's opt-out notification and 
shall provide that the opt-out is not effective for model years (as 
defined in part 85, subpart X), that commence prior to this effective 
date.
    (3) If a covered state opts out based on this condition, a covered 
manufacturer may opt out of National LEV pursuant to paragraph (j) of 
this section.
    (4) In a state that opts out pursuant to paragraph (k)(1) of this 
section, obligations under National LEV shall be unaffected for covered 
manufacturers until the effective date of that state's opt-out. Upon the 
effective date of the state's opt-out, in that state covered 
manufacturers shall comply with any state standards and other 
requirements in effect pursuant to section 177 of the Clean Air Act or, 
if such state standards and other requirements are not in effect, with 
all requirements that would apply to a manufacturer that had not opted 
into the National LEV program, including all applicable standards and 
other requirements promulgated under title II of the Clean Air Act (42 
U.S.C. 7521 et seq.).

    (d) NMOG measurement and reactivity adjustment. NMOG emissions shall 
be measured in accordance with Chapter 5 of the California Regulatory 
Requirements Applicable to the National Low Emission Vehicle Program 
(October, 1996). These requirements are incorporated by reference (see 
Sec. 86.1). NMOG emissions shall be compared to the applicable NMOG 
emissions certification or in-use standard according to the following 
calculation procedures:
    (1) For TLEVs, LEVs, and ULEVs designed to operate on any fuel other 
than conventional gasoline, and for flexible-fuel and dual-fuel TLEVs, 
LEVs, and ULEVs when operated on a fuel other than gasoline as specified 
in Sec. 86.1771, manufacturers shall multiply NMOG exhaust mass emission 
levels by the applicable reactivity adjustment factor set forth in 
Sec. 86.1777, or established by the Administrator pursuant to 
Sec. 86.1777. The product of the NMOG exhaust emission levels and the 
reactivity adjustment factor shall be compared to the applicable 
certification or in-use exhaust NMOG mass emission standards established 
for the particular vehicle emission category to determine compliance.
    (2) In addition to multiplying the exhaust NMOG mass emission levels 
by the applicable reactivity adjustment factor, TLEV, LEV, or ULEV 
natural gas vehicles shall multiply the exhaust methane mass emission 
level by the applicable methane reactivity adjustment factor in 
Sec. 86.1777 or established by the Administrator pursuant to 
Sec. 86.1777. The reactivity-adjusted NMOG value shall be added to the 
reactivity-adjusted methane value and then the sum shall be compared to 
the applicable certification or in-use exhaust NMOG mass emission 
standards established for the particular vehicle emission category to 
determine compliance.
    (3) The exhaust NMOG mass emission levels for fuel-flexible and 
dual-fuel vehicles when operating on gasoline as specified in 
Sec. 86.1771 shall not be multiplied by a reactivity adjustment factor.
    (e) SFTP Standards. Exhaust emissions from 2001 and later model year 
light-duty vehicles shall meet the additional SFTP standards in this 
paragraph (e) according to the implementation schedules in this 
paragraph (e). The standards set forth in this paragraph (e) refer to 
exhaust emissions emitted over the Supplemental Federal Test Procedure 
(SFTP) as set forth in subpart B of this part and collected and 
calculated in accordance with those procedures.
    (1) Tier 1 vehicles and TLEVs. The SFTP exhaust emission levels from 
new 2001 and subsequent model year light-duty vehicles certified to the 
exhaust emission standards in Sec. 86.099-8(a)(1)(i) and subsequent 
model year provisions and light-duty vehicles certified as TLEVs shall 
not exceed the standards in Table R99-7.1, according to the 
implementation schedule in this paragraph (e)(1).

    (B) [Reserved]
    (iii) Phase-in requirements--vehicles sold outside California. 
Light-duty vehicles and light light-duty trucks sold outside California 
shall be certified to the applicable emission standards in this 
paragraph (e) if a vehicle has been certifed to the emission standards

as the total projected number of light-duty vehicles and light light-
duty trucks certified as LEVs and ULEVs sold in California.
    (A) Manufacturers of light-duty vehicles and light light-duty

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (B) Manufacturers may use an ``Alternative or Equivalent Phase-in 
Schedule'' to comply with the phase-in requirements. An ``Alternative 
Phase-in'' is one that achieves at least equivalent emission reductions 
by the end of the last model year of the scheduled phase-in. Model-year 
emission reductions shall be calculated by multiplying the percent of 
vehicles (based on the manufacturer's projected California sales volume 
of the applicable vehicle fleet) meeting the new requirements per model 
year by the number of model years implemented prior to and including the 
last model year of the scheduled phase-in. The ``cumulative total'' is 
the summation of the model-year emission reductions (e.g., a four model-
year 25/50/85/100 percent phase-in schedule would be calculated as: 
(25%* 4 years) + (50%* 3 years) + (85%* 2 years) + (100%* 1 year) + 
520). Any alternative phase-in that results in an equal or larger 
cumulative total than the required cumulative total by the end of the 
last model year of the scheduled phase-in shall be considered acceptable 
by the Administrator under the following conditions: All vehicles 
subject to the phase-in shall comply with the respective requirements in 
the last model year of the required phase-in schedule; and if a 
manufacturer uses the optional phase-in percentage determination in 
paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, the cumulative total of model-year 
emission reductions as determined only for light-duty vehicles and light 
light-duty trucks certified to this paragraph (e)(2) must also be equal 
to or larger than the required cumulative total by end of the 2004 model 
year. Manufacturers shall be allowed to include vehicles introduced 
before the first model year of the scheduled phase-in (e.g., in the 
previous example, 10 percent introduced one year before the scheduled 
phase-in begins would be calculated as: (10%* 5 years) and added to the 
cumulative total).
    (ii) Phase-in requirements--2004 and later model years. For the 
purposes of this paragraph (e)(2)(ii) only, each manufacturer's light-
duty vehicle and light light-duty truck fleet shall be defined as the 
total projected number of light-duty vehicles and light light-duty 
trucks certified as LEVs and ULEVs sold in the United States.
    (A) In 2004 and subsequent model years, manufacturers of light-duty 
vehicles and light light-duty trucks, including low volume 
manufacturers, shall certify 100 percent of their light-duty vehicle and 
light light-duty truck fleet to the standards in this paragraph (e)(2).
    (iii) Phase-in requirements--vehicles sold outside California. 
Light-duty vehicles and light light-duty trucks sold outside California 
shall be certified to the applicable emission standards in this 
paragraph (e) if a vehicle has been certifed to the emission standards 
in this paragraph (e) for sale in California and is identical in the 
following respects:
    (A) Vehicle manufacturer;
    (B) Vehicle make and model;
    (C) Cylinder block configuration (L-6, V-8, and so forth);
    (D) Displacement;
    (E) Combustion cycle;
    (F) Transmission class; and
    (G) Axle ratio.
    (3) A/C-on specific calibrations. A/C-on specific calibrations (e.g. 
air to fuel ratio, spark timing, and exhaust gas recirculation), may be 
used which differ from A/C-off calibrations for given engine operating 
conditions (e.g., engine speed, manifold pressure, coolant temperature, 
air charge temperature, and any other parameters). Such calibrations 
must not unnecessarily reduce the NMHC+NO<INF>X</INF> emission control 
effectiveness during A/C-on operation when

[[Page 382]]

the vehicle is operated under conditions which may reasonably be 
expected to be encountered during normal operation and use. If 
reductions in control system NMHC+NO<INF>X</INF> effectiveness do occur 
as a result of such calibrations, the manufacturer shall, in the 
Application for Certification, specify the circumstances under which 
such reductions do occur, and the reason for the use of such 
calibrations resulting in such reductions in control system 
effectiveness. A/C-on specific ``open-loop'' or ``commanded enrichment'' 
air-fuel enrichment strategies (as defined below), which differ from A/
C-off ``open-loop'' or ``commanded enrichment'' air-fuel enrichment 
strategies, may not be used, with the following exceptions: Cold-start 
and warm-up conditions, or, subject to Administrator approval, 
conditions requiring the protection of the vehicle, occupants, engine, 
or emission control hardware. Other than these exceptions, such 
strategies which are invoked based on manifold pressure, engine speed, 
throttle position, or other engine parameters shall use the same engine 
parameter criteria for the invoking of this air-fuel enrichment strategy 
and the same degree of enrichment regardless of whether the A/C is on or 
off. ``Open-loop'' or ``commanded'' air-fuel enrichment strategy is 
defined as enrichment of the air to fuel ratio beyond stoichiometry for 
the purposes of increasing engine power output and the protection of 
engine or emissions control hardware. However, ``closed-loop biasing,'' 
defined as small changes in the air-fuel ratio for the purposes of 
optimizing vehicle emissions or driveability, shall not be considered an 
``open-loop'' or ``commanded'' air-fuel enrichment strategy. In 
addition, ``transient'' air-fuel enrichment strategy (or ``tip-in'' and 
``tip-out'' enrichment), defined as the temporary use of an air-fuel 
ratio rich of stoichiometry at the beginning or duration of rapid 
throttle motion, shall not be considered an ``open-loop'' or 
``commanded'' air-fuel enrichment strategy.
    (4) ``Lean-on-cruise'' calibration strategies. (i) In the 
Application for Certification, the manufacturer shall state whether any 
``lean-on-cruise'' strategies are incorporated into the vehicle design. 
A ``lean-on-cruise'' air-fuel calibration strategy is defined as the use 
of an air-fuel ratio significantly greater than stoichiometry, during 
non-deceleration conditions at speeds above 40 mph. ``Lean-on-cruise'' 
air-fuel calibration strategies shall not be employed during vehicle 
operation in normal driving conditions, including A/C usage, unless at 
least one of the following conditions is met:
    (A) Such strategies are substantially employed during the FTP or 
SFTP;
    (B) Such strategies are demonstrated not to significantly reduce 
vehicle NMHC+NO<INF>X</INF> emission control effectiveness over the 
operating conditions in which they are employed;
    (C) Such strategies are demonstrated to be necessary to protect the 
vehicle occupants, engine, or emission control hardware.
    (ii) If the manufacturer proposes to use a ``lean-on-cruise'' 
calibration strategy, the manufacturer shall specify the circumstances 
under which such a calibration would be used, and the reason or reasons 
for the proposed use of such a calibration.
    (iii) The provisions of this paragraph (e)(4) shall not apply to 
vehicles powered by ``lean-burn'' engines or diesel-cycle engines. A 
``lean-burn'' engine is defined as an Otto-cycle engine designed to run 
at an air-fuel ratio significantly greater than stoichiometry during the 
large majority of its operation.
    (5) Applicability to alternative fuel vehicles. These SFTP standards 
do not apply to vehicles certified on fuels other than gasoline and 
diesel fuel, but the standards do apply to the gasoline and diesel fuel 
operation of flexible-fuel vehicles and dual-fuel vehicles.
    (6) Single-roll electric dynamometer requirement. For all vehicles 
certified to the SFTP standards, a single-roll electric dynamometer or a 
dynamometer which produces equivalent results, as set forth in 
Sec. 86.108, must be used for all types of emission testing to determine 
compliance with the associated emission standards.

    (iv) Highway NO<INF>X</INF>. The maximum projected NO<INF>X</INF> 
emissions measured on the federal Highway Fuel Economy Test in 40 CFR 
part 600, subpart B, shall be not greater than 1.33 times the applicable 
light light-duty truck standards shown in tables R99-8 and R99-9. Both 
the projected emissions and the Highway Fuel Economy Test standard shall 
be rounded to the nearest 0.1 g/mi in accordance with the Rounding-Off 
Method specified in ASTM E29-90, Standard Practice for Using Significant 
Digits in Test Data to Determine Conformance with Specifications, before 
being compared. These procedures are incorporated by reference (see

hybrid electric vehicles shall be based on the emissions and mileage 
accumulation of the auxiliary power unit. For certification purposes 
only, Type A hybrid electric vehicles shall demonstrate compliance with 
50,000 mile emission standards (using 50,000 mile deterioration 
factors), and shall not be required to demonstrate compliance with 
100,000 mile emission standards. For certification purposes only, Type B 
hybrid electric vehicles shall demonstrate compliance with 50,000 mile 
emission standards (using 50,000 mile deterioration factors) and 100,000 
mile emission standards (using 75,000 mile deterioration factors). For 
certification purposes only, Type C hybrid electric vehicles shall

    (d) NMOG measurement and reactivity adjustment. NMOG emissions shall 
be measured in accordance with Chapter 5 of the California Regulatory 
Requirements Applicable to the National Low Emission Vehicle Program 
(October, 1996). These procedures are incorporated by reference (see 
Sec. 86.1). NMOG emissions shall be compared to the applicable NMOG 
emissions certification or in-use standard according to the following 
calculation procedures:
    (1) For TLEVs, LEVs, and ULEVs designed to operate on any fuel other 
than conventional gasoline, and for flexible-fuel and dual-fuel TLEVs, 
LEVs, and ULEVs when operated on a fuel other than gasoline as specified 
in Sec. 86.1771, manufacturers shall multiply NMOG mass exhaust emission 
levels by the applicable reactivity adjustment factor set forth in 
Sec. 86.1777 or established by the Administrator pursuant to 
Sec. 86.1777. The product of the NMOG exhaust emission levels and the 
reactivity adjustment factor shall be compared to the applicable 
certification or in-use exhaust NMOG mass emission standards established 
for the particular vehicle emission category to determine compliance.
    (2) In addition to multiplying the exhaust NMOG mass emission levels 
by the applicable reactivity adjustment factor, TLEV, LEV, or ULEV 
natural gas vehicles shall multiply the exhaust methane mass emission 
level by the applicable methane reactivity adjustment factor in 
Sec. 86.1777 or established by the Administrator pursuant to 
Sec. 86.1777. The reactivity-adjusted NMOG value shall be added to the 
reactivity-adjusted methane value and then the sum shall be compared to 
the applicable certification or in-use exhaust NMOG mass emission 
standards established for the particular vehicle emission category to 
determine compliance.
    (3) The exhaust NMOG mass emission levels for fuel-flexible and 
dual-fuel vehicles when operating on gasoline as specified in 
Sec. 86.1771 shall not be multiplied by a reactivity adjustment factor.
    (e) SFTP Standards. Exhaust emissions from 2001 and later model year 
light light-duty trucks shall meet the additional SFTP standards in this 
paragraph (e) according to the implementation schedules in this 
paragraph (e). The standards set forth in this paragraph (e) refer to 
exhaust emissions emitted over the Supplemental Federal Test Procedure 
(SFTP) as set forth in subpart B of this part and collected and 
calculated in accordance with those procedures.
    (1) Tier 1 vehicles and TLEVs. The SFTP exhaust emission levels from 
new 2001 and subsequent model year light light-duty trucks certified to 
the exhaust emission standards in Sec. 86.099-9(a)(1)(i) and subsequent 
model year provisions and light light-duty trucks certified as TLEVs 
shall not exceed the standards in Table R99-14.1, according to the 
implementation schedule in this paragraph (e)(1).

    (B) [Reserved]
    (ii) Phase-in requirements--2004 and later model years. For the 
purposes of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section only, each 
manufacturer's light-duty vehicle and light light-duty truck fleet shall 
be defined as the total projected number of the following types of 
vehicles sold in the United States: light-duty vehicles certified to the 
exhaust emission standards in Sec. 86.099-8(a)(1)(i) and subsequent 
model year provisions, light light-duty trucks certified to the exhaust 
emission standards in Sec. 86.099-9(a)(1)(i) and subsequent model year 
provisions, and light-duty vehicles and light light-duty trucks 
certified as TLEVs. As an option, a manufacturer may elect to have its

the purposes of this paragraph (e)(1)(ii) only, as the total projected 
number of the manufacturer's light-duty vehicles and light light-duty 
trucks, other than zero emission vehicles, certified and sold in the 
United States.
    (A) In 2004 and subsequent model years, manufacturers of light-duty 
vehicles and light light-duty trucks, including low volume 
manufacturers, shall certify 100 percent of their light-duty vehicle and 
light light-duty truck

fleet to the standards in this paragraph (e)(1).
    (B) [Reserved]
    (iii) Phase-in requirements--vehicles sold outside California. 
Light-duty vehicles and light light-duty trucks sold outside California 
shall be certified to the applicable emission standards in this 
paragraph (e) if a vehicle has been certifed to the emission standards 
in this paragraph (e) for sale in California and is identical in the 
following respects:
    (A) Vehicle manufacturer;
    (B) Vehicle make and model;
    (C) Cylinder block configuration (L-6, V-8, and so forth);
    (D) Displacement;

    (i) Phase-in requirements--2001 to 2003 model years. For the 
purposes of this paragraph (e)(2)(i) only, each manufacturer's light-
duty vehicle and light light-duty truck fleet shall be defined as the 
total projected number of light-duty vehicles and light light-duty 
trucks certified as LEVs and ULEVs sold in California.
    (A) Manufacturers of light-duty vehicles and light light-duty 
trucks, except low volume manufacturers, shall certify to the standards 
in this paragraph (e)(2) a minimum percentage of their light-duty 
vehicle and light light-duty truck fleet according to the following 
phase-in schedule:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (B) Manufacturers may use an ``Alternative or Equivalent Phase-in 
Schedule'' to comply with the phase-in requirements. An ``Alternative 
Phase-in'' is one that achieves at least equivalent emission reductions 
by the end of the last model year of the scheduled phase-in. Model-year 
emission reductions shall be calculated by multiplying the percent of 
vehicles (based on the manufacturer's projected California sales volume 
of the applicable vehicle fleet) meeting the new requirements per model 
year by the number of model years implemented prior to and including the 
last model year of the scheduled phase-in. The ``cumulative total'' is 
the summation of the model-year emission reductions (e.g., a four model-
year 25/50/85/100 percent phase-in schedule would be calculated as: 
(25%*4 years)+(50%*3 years)+(85%*2 years)+(100%*1 year) + 520). Any 
alternative phase-in that results in an equal or larger cumulative total 
than the required cumulative total by the end of the last model year of 
the scheduled phase-in shall be considered acceptable by the 
Administrator under the following conditions: All vehicles subject to 
the phase-in shall comply with the respective requirements in the last 
model year of the required phase-in schedule; and if a manufacturer uses 
the optional phase-in percentage determination in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of 
this section, the cumulative total of model-year emission reductions as 
determined only for light-duty vehicles and light light-duty trucks 
certified to this paragraph (e)(2) must also be equal to or larger than 
the required cumulative total by the end of the 2004 model year. 
Manufacturers shall be allowed to include vehicles introduced before the 
first model year of the scheduled phase-in (e.g., in the previous 
example, 10 percent introduced one year before the scheduled phase-in 
begins would be calculated as: (10%*5 years) and added to the cumulative 
total).
    (ii) Phase-in requirements--2004 and later model years. For the 
purposes of this paragraph (e)(2)(ii) only, each manufacturer's light-
duty vehicle and light light-duty truck fleet shall be defined as the 
total projected number of light-duty vehicles and light light-duty 
trucks certified as LEVs and ULEVs sold in the United States.
    (A) In 2004 and subsequent model years, manufacturers of light-duty 
vehicles and light light-duty trucks, including low volume 
manufacturers, shall certify 100 percent of their light-duty vehicle and 
light light-duty truck fleet to the standards in this paragraph (e)(2).
    (B) [Reserved]
    (iii) Phase-in requirements--vehicles sold outside California. 
Light-duty vehicles and light light-duty trucks sold outside California 
shall be certified to the applicable emission standards in

[[Page 388]]

this paragraph (e) if a vehicle has been certifed to the emission 
standards in this paragraph (e) for sale in California and is identical 
in the following respects:
    (A) Vehicle manufacturer;
    (B) Vehicle make and model;
    (C) Cylinder block configuration (L-6, V-8, and so forth);
    (D) Displacement;
    (E) Combustion cycle;
    (F) Transmission class; and
    (G) Axle ratio.
    (3) A/C-on specific calibrations. A/C-on specific calibrations 
(e.g., air to fuel ratio, spark timing, and exhaust gas recirculation), 
may be used which differ from A/C-off calibrations for given engine 
operating conditions (e.g., engine speed, manifold pressure, coolant 
temperature, air charge temperature, and any other parameters). Such 
calibrations must not unnecessarily reduce the NMHC+NO<INF>X</INF> 
emission control effectiveness during A/C-on operation when the vehicle 
is operated under conditions which may reasonably be expected to be 
encountered during normal operation and use. If reductions in control 
system NMHC+NO<INF>X</INF> effectiveness do occur as a result of such 
calibrations, the manufacturer shall, in the Application for 
Certification, specify the circumstances under which such reductions do 
occur, and the reason for the use of such calibrations resulting in such 
reductions in control system effectiveness. A/C-on specific ``open-
loop'' or ``commanded enrichment'' air-fuel enrichment strategies (as 
defined below), which differ from A/C-off ``open-loop'' or ``commanded 
enrichment'' air-fuel enrichment strategies, may not be used, with the 
following exceptions: Cold-start and warm-up conditions, or, subject to 
Administrator approval, conditions requiring the protection of the 
vehicle, occupants, engine, or emission control hardware. Other than 
these exceptions, such strategies which are invoked based on manifold 
pressure, engine speed, throttle position, or other engine parameters 
shall use the same engine parameter criteria for the invoking of this 
air-fuel enrichment strategy and the same degree of enrichment 
regardless of whether the A/C is on or off. ``Open-loop'' or 
``commanded'' air-fuel enrichment strategy is defined as enrichment of 
the air to fuel ratio beyond stoichiometry for the purposes of 
increasing engine power output and the protection of engine or emissions 
control hardware. However, ``closed-loop biasing,'' defined as small 
changes in the air-fuel ratio for the purposes of optimizing vehicle 
emissions or driveability, shall not be considered an ``open-loop'' or 
``commanded'' air-fuel enrichment strategy. In addition, ``transient'' 
air-fuel enrichment strategy (or ``tip-in'' and ``tip-out'' enrichment), 
defined as the temporary use of an air-fuel ratio rich of stoichiometry 
at the beginning or duration of rapid throttle motion, shall not be 
considered an ``open-loop'' or ``commanded'' air-fuel enrichment 
strategy.
    (4) ``Lean-on-cruise'' calibration strategies. (i) In the 
Application for Certification, the manufacturer shall state whether any 
``lean-on-cruise'' strategies are incorporated into the vehicle design. 
A ``lean-on-cruise'' air-fuel calibration strategy is defined as the use 
of an air-fuel ratio significantly greater than stoichiometry, during 
non-deceleration conditions at speeds above 40 mph. ``Lean-on-cruise'' 
air-fuel calibration strategies shall not be employed during vehicle 
operation in normal driving conditions, including A/C usage, unless at 
least one of the following conditions is met:
    (A) Such strategies are substantially employed during the FTP or 
SFTP;
    (B) Such strategies are demonstrated not to significantly reduce 
vehicle NMHC+NO<INF>x</INF> emission control effectiveness over the 
operating conditions in which they are employed;
    (C) Such strategies are demonstrated to be necessary to protect the 
vehicle occupants, engine, or emission control hardware.
    (ii) If the manufacturer proposes to use a ``lean-on-cruise'' 
calibration strategy, the manufacturer shall specify the circumstances 
under which such a calibration would be used, and the reason or reasons 
for the proposed use of such a calibration.
    (iii) The provisions of this paragraph (e)(4) shall not apply to 
vehicles powered by ``lean-burn'' engines or diesel-cycle engines. A 
``lean-burn'' engine is

[[Page 389]]

defined as an Otto-cycle engine designed to run at an air-fuel ratio 
significantly greater than stoichiometry during the large majority of 
its operation.
    (5) Applicability to alternative fuel vehicles. These SFTP standards 
do not apply to vehicles certified on fuels other than gasoline and 
diesel fuel, but the standards do apply to the gasoline and diesel fuel 
operation of flexible-fuel vehicles and dual-fuel vehicles.
    (6) Single-roll electric dynamometer requirement. For all vehicles 
certified to the SFTP standards, a single-roll electric dynamometer or a 
dynamometer which produces equivalent results, as set forth in 
Sec. 86.108, must be used for all types of emission testing to determine 
compliance with the associated emission standards.

    (2)(i) For the purpose of calculating the HEV contribution factor 
for the fleet average NMOG value, a manufacturer may use adjusted values 
to estimate the contributions of hybrid electric vehicles (or ``HEVs'') 
based on the range of the HEV without the use of the engine. See 
Sec. 86.1702 for definitions of HEV types for purposes of calculating 
adjusted NMOG emissions.
    (ii) For the purpose of calculating fleet average NMOG values, 
vehicles that have no tailpipe emissions but use fuel-fired heaters and 
that are not certified as ZEVs shall be treated as Type A HEV ULEVs.
    (3)(i) Each manufacturer's applicable fleet average NMOG value for 
all light

[[Page 390]]

light-duty trucks from 0-3750 lbs. loaded vehicle weight and light-duty 
vehicles sold in the applicable region according to Tables R99-15 and 
R99-16 shall be calculated in units of g/mi NMOG according to the 
following equation, where the term ``Sold'' means sold in the applicable 
region according to Tables R99-15 and R99-16, and the term ``Vehicles'' 
means light light-duty trucks from 0-3750 lbs loaded vehicle weight and 
light-duty vehicles: (((No. of Vehicles Certified to the Federal Tier 1 
Exhaust Emission Standards and Sold)x(0.25))+((No. of TLEVs Sold 
excluding HEVs)x (0.125))+((No. of LEVs Sold excluding 
HEVs)x(0.75))+((No. of ULEVs Sold excluding HEVs)x(0.040))+(HEV 
contribution factor))/(Total No. of Vehicles Sold, including ZEVs and 
HEVs).
    (A) For model years 1997 through 2000, ``Vehicles'' in the preceding 
equation shall include California-certified vehicles, including vehicles 
certified to California Tier 1 standards.
    (B) For model years 2001 and later, ``vehicles'' in the preceding 
equation shall not include California-certified vehicles unless they are 
also certified under the National LEV program.
    (ii)(A) ``HEV contribution factor'' shall mean the NMOG emission 
contribution of HEVs to the fleet average NMOG value. The HEV 
contribution factor shall be calculated in units of g/mi as follows, 
where the term ``Sold'' means sold in the applicable region according to 
tables R99-15 and R99-16.
    (B) HEV contribution factor = (((No. of Type A HEV TLEVs Sold) x 
(0.100)) + ((No. of Type B HEV TLEVs Sold) x (0.113)) + ((No. of Type C 
HEV TLEVs Sold) x (0.125))) + (((No. of Type A HEV LEVs Sold) x (0.057)) 
+ ((No. of Type B HEV LEVs Sold) x (0.066)) + ((No. of Type C HEV LEVs 
Sold) x (0.075))) + (((No. of Type A HEV ULEVs Sold) x (0.020)) + ((No. 
of Type B HEV ULEVs Sold) x (0.030)) + ((No. of Type C HEV ULEVs Sold) x 
(0.040))).
    (iii)(A) For any model year in which a manufacturer certifies its 
entire fleet of light-duty vehicles and light light-duty trucks from 0-
3750 lbs LVW to intermediate useful life NMOG emission standards 
specified in Secs. 86.1708 and 86.1709 that are less than or equal to 
the applicable fleet average NMOG standard specified in Tables R99-15 
and R99-16, the manufacturer may elect not to calculate a fleet average 
NMOG value for such vehicles for that model year.
    (B) The fleet average NMOG value for a manufacturer electing under 
paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A) of this section not to calculate a fleet 
average NMOG value shall be deemed to be the applicable fleet average 
NMOG standard specified in Table R99-15 or R99-16 for the applicable 
model year.
    (C) A manufacturer making the election under paragraph 
(a)(3)(iii)(A) of this section may not generate credits for that model 
year for light light-duty trucks from 0-3750 lbs LVW and light-duty 
vehicles.
    (4)(i) Each manufacturer's applicable fleet average NMOG value for 
all light light-duty trucks from 3751-5750 lbs loaded vehicle weight 
sold in the applicable region according to Tables R99-15 and R99-16 
shall be calculated in units of g/mi NMOG according to the following 
equation, where the term ``Sold'' means sold in the applicable region 
according to Tables R97-15 and R97-16, and the term ``Vehicles'' means 
light light-duty trucks from 3751-5750 lbs loaded vehicle weight: (((No. 
of Vehicles Certified to the Federal Tier 1 Exhaust Emission Standards 
and Sold)x(0.32))+((No. of TLEVs Sold excluding HEVs) x (0.160)) + ((No. 
of LEVs Sold excluding HEVs)x(0.100)) + (No. of ULEVs Sold excluding 
HEVs)x(0.050))+(HEV Contribution factor)) / (Total No. of Vehicles Sold, 
including ZEVs and HEVs).
    (A) For model years 1997 through 2000, ``Vehicles'' in the preceding 
equation shall include California-certified vehicles, including vehicles 
certified to California Tier 1 standards.
    (B) For model years 2001 and later, ``Vehicles'' in the preceding 
equation shall not include California-certified vehicles unless they are 
also certified under the National LEV program.
    (ii)(A) ``HEV contribution factor'' shall mean the NMOG emission 
contribution of HEVs to the fleet average NMOG. The HEV contribution 
factor shall be calculated in units of g/mi as follows, where the term 
``Sold'' means sold in the applicable region according to tables R99-15 
and R99-16.

[[Page 391]]

    (B) HEV contribution factor=(((No. of Type A HEV TLEVs Sold) x 
(0.130)) + ((No. of Type B HEV TLEVs Sold) x (0.145)) + ((No. of Type C 
HEV TLEVs Sold) x (0.160))) + (((No. of Type A HEV LEVs Sold) x (0.075)) 
+ ((No. of Type B HEV LEVs Sold) x (0.087)) + ((No. of Type C HEV LEVs 
Sold) x (0.100))) + (((No. of Type A HEV ULEVs Sold) x (0.025)) + ((No. 
of Type B HEV ULEVs Sold) x (0.037)) + ((No. of Type C HEV ULEVs Sold) x 
(0.050))).
    (iii)(A) For any model year in which a manufacturer certifies its 
entire fleet of light light-duty trucks from 3751-5750 lbs LVW to 
intermediate useful life NMOG emission standards specified in 
Sec. 86.1709 that are less than or equal to the applicable fleet average 
NMOG requirements specified in Tables R99-15 and R99-16, the 
manufacturer may elect not to calculate a fleet average NMOG value for 
such vehicles for that model year.
    (B) The fleet average NMOG value for a manufacturer electing under 
paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(A) of this section not to calculate a fleet 
average NMOG value shall be deemed to be the applicable fleet average 
NMOG standard specified in Table R99-15 or R99-16 for the applicable 
model year.
    (5)(i) The calculation of the fleet average NMOG value pursuant to 
paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section shall exclude ATVs, as 
defined in Sec. 86.1702, purchased in the NTR by state governments. In 
determining the quantity of vehicles to be excluded from the NMOG 
calculations, a manufacturer shall only be required to exclude vehicles 
that are reported by the purchasing government in a timely letter, 
containing adequate information, directed to the representative of the 
manufacturer listed in the manufacturer's application for certification. 
Such letter shall be considered timely only if it is received no later 
than February 1 of the calendar year following the model year of the 
purchased vehicles.
    (ii) Adequate information includes the number of vehicles purchased, 
vehicle makes and models, and the associated engine families. A copy of 
the letter should be sent to: Director, Vehicle Programs and Compliance 
Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2565 Plymouth Road, Ann 
Arbor, Michigan, 48105.
    (6) For any model year prior to model year 2001 for which a 
manufacturer meets the definition of ``low volume manufacturer'' in 
Sec. 86.1702, it shall be exempt from the requirements in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section. The requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section applicable to the 2001 and later model years shall apply to low 
volume manufacturers.
    (b) Fleet average NMOG credit and debit calculations. (1) For each 
averaging set, as defined in Sec. 86.1702, manufacturers that achieve 
fleet average NMOG values lower than the fleet average NMOG standard for 
the corresponding model year may generate credits.
    (2) For each averaging set, manufacturers that obtain applicable 
fleet average NMOG values exceeding the fleet average NMOG standard for 
the corresponding model year shall generate debits.
    (3) For each averaging set, credits and debits are to be calculated 
according to the following equation and rounded, in accordance with the 
Rounding-Off Method specified in ASTM E29-90, Standard Practice for 
Using Significant Digits in Test Data to Determine Conformance with 
Specifications, which is incorporated by reference (see Sec. 86.1), to 
the nearest whole number (intermediate calculations will not be 
rounded): Number of Credits/Debits = (((Applicable Fleet Average NMOG 
Standard) - (Manufacturer's Applicable Fleet Average NMOG Value)) x 
(Applicable Production)).
    (4) For each applicable region and model year, a manufacturer's 
available credits or level of debits shall be the sum of credits or 
debits derived from the respective class A and class B averaging sets 
for that region and model year. Paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C) of this section 
contains a special provision for manufacturers that end model year 2000 
with a debit balance in the NTR.
    (c) Intermediate in-use emission standards. (1) Only credits 
generated in the NTR may be used to offset NMOG debits incurred in the 
NTR. Manufacturers may use in the ASTR credits generated in the NTR.

[[Page 392]]

    (2) Only after credits are earned may they be used, traded, or 
carried over to another model year. Before trading or carrying over 
credits to the next model year, a manufacturer must apply available 
credits to offset any of its debits from the same region, where the 
deadline to offset such debits has not yet passed.
    (3) Credits earned in any given model year shall retain full value 
through the subsequent model year.
    (4) Unused credits that are available at the end of the second, 
third, and fourth model years after the model year in which the credits 
were generated shall be discounted to 50%, 25%, and 0% of the original 
value of the credits, respectively. The discounting of credits also 
applies to credits transferred to other parties.
    (5) Credits may not be used to remedy any nonconformities determined 
by a Selective Enforcement Audit, recall testing, or testing performed 
with respect to Title 13, Chapter 2, Articles 1 and 2 of the California 
Code of Regulations.
    (6) Prior to model year 2001, low volume manufacturers may earn 
credits in the NTR to transfer to other motor vehicle manufacturers for 
use in the NTR or the ASTR, or to bank for their own use in the ASTR. 
Such credits will be calculated as set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) 
of this section, except that the applicable fleet average NMOG standard 
shall be 0.25 g/mi NMOG for the averaging set for light light-duty 
trucks from 0-3750 lbs LVW and light-duty vehicles or 0.32 g/mi NMOG for 
the averaging set for light light-duty trucks from 3751-5750 lbs LVW. 
Credits shall be discounted in accordance with the provisions in 
paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
    (7) Prior to model year 2001, manufacturers may earn credits in the 
ASTR states that are not in the NTR and may bank those credits for use 
in the ASTR. Such credits will be calculated as set forth in paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section, except that the applicable fleet average 
NMOG standard shall be 0.25 g/mi NMOG for the averaging set for light 
light-duty trucks from 0-3750 lbs LVW and light-duty vehicles or 0.32 g/
mi NMOG for the averaging set for light light-duty trucks from 3751-5750 
lbs LVW, and ``sold'' shall mean sold in the ASTR states that are not in 
the NTR.
    (i) Emission credits earned in the ASTR states outside the NTR prior 
to model year 2001 shall be treated as generated in model year 2001.
    (ii) In the 2001 model year, a one-time discount rate of 10 percent 
shall be applied to all credits earned under the provisions of this 
paragraph (c)(7).
    (iii) These credits shall be discounted in accordance with the 
provisions in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
    (8) Manufacturers may earn and bank credits in the NTR for model 
years 1997 and 1998. In states without a Section 177 Program effective 
in model year 1997 or 1998, such credits will be calculated as set forth 
in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, except that the applicable 
fleet average NMOG standard shall be 0.200 g/mi NMOG for the averaging 
set for light light-duty trucks from 0-3750 lbs LVW and light-duty 
vehicles or 0.256 g/mi NMOG for the averaging set for light light-duty 
trucks from 3751-5750 lbs LVW. In states that opt into National LEV and 
have a Section 177 Program effective in model year 1997 or 1998, such 
credits will equal the unused credits earned in those states.
    (i) Emissions credits earned in the NTR prior to the 1999 model year 
shall be treated as generated in the 1999 model year.
    (ii) In the 1999 model year, a one-time discount rate of 10 percent 
shall be applied to all credits earned under the provisions of this 
paragraph (c)(8).
    (iii) These credits shall be discounted in accordance with the 
provisions in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
    (9) There are no property rights associated with credits generated 
under the provisions of this section. Credits are a limited 
authorization to emit the designated amount of emissions. Nothing in the 
regulations or any other provision of law should be construed to limit 
EPA's authority to terminate or limit this authorization through a 
rulemaking. If EPA were to terminate or limit the authorization to emit 
associated with emissions credits generated under the provisions of this 
section, this paragraph (c)(9) would have no effect on manufacturers' 
ability to opt

[[Page 393]]

out of the National LEV program pursuant to Sec. 86.1707.
    (d) Fleet average NMOG debits. (1) Manufacturers shall offset any 
debits for a given model year by the fleet average NMOG reporting 
deadline for the model year following the model year in which the debits 
were generated. Manufacturers may offset debits by generating credits or 
acquiring credits generated by another manufacturer. Only credits 
generated in the NTR may be used to offset NMOG debits generated in the 
NTR.
    (2) The provisions of this paragraph (d)(2) apply only when a 
manufacturer has a debit balance in the NTR at the end of model year 
2000. Manufacturers shall offset any debits incurred in the NTR for 
model year 2000 by the fleet average NMOG reporting deadline for model 
year 2001.
    (i) A manufacturer may offset debits generated in the NTR in model 
year 2000 either by generating credits in the NTR in model year 2001 or 
by applying NTR credits acquired under the provisions of this section.
    (ii) If a manufacturer has a debit balance in the NTR at the end of 
model year 2000, then such manufacturer shall be required to calculate 
fleet average NMOG values for both the NTR and the ASTR for model year 
2001.
    (A) The NTR values shall be calculated according to paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of this section, with the fleet average NMOG standards equal to 
the standards for model year 2001 in the ASTR.
    (B) If such a manufacturer has a credit balance in the NTR for model 
year 2001, before trading or carrying over credits to the next model 
year, the manufacturer must apply available NTR credits to offset its 
debits in the NTR.
    (C) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(4) of this section, for the ASTR 
and model year 2001, such a manufacturer's available credits or level of 
debits shall be the sum of credits or debits derived from the respective 
class A and class B averaging sets for the ASTR and model year 2001, 
minus any credits used pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B).
    (iii) To transfer a credit as an NTR credit earned in model year 
2001, a manufacturer must have credits generated in the NTR based on 
separate fleet average NMOG values calculated for the NTR in model year 
2001. In addition, the number of model year 2001 NTR credits available 
for a manufacturer to transfer cannot exceed the manufacturer's 
available number of model year 2001 ASTR credits. Any transferred model 
year 2001 NTR credits shall be deducted from the manufacturer's 
available model year 2001 ASTR credits.
    (3)(i) Failure to meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) through 
(d) of this section within the required timeframe for offsetting debits 
will be considered to be a failure to satisfy the conditions upon which 
the certificate(s) was issued and the individual noncomplying vehicles 
not covered by the certificate shall be determined according to this 
section.
    (ii) If debits are not offset within the specified time period, the 
number of vehicles not meeting the fleet average NMOG standards and not 
covered by the certificate shall be calculated by dividing the total 
amount of debits for the model year by the fleet average NMOG standard 
applicable for the model year and averaging set in which the debits were 
first incurred. If both averaging sets are in debit, any applicable 
credits will first be allocated between the averaging sets according to 
the manufacturer's expressed preferences. Then, the number of vehicles 
not covered by the certificate shall be calculated using the revised 
debit values.
    (iii) EPA will determine the vehicles for which the condition on the 
certificate was not satisfied by designating vehicles in those engine 
families with the highest certification NMOG emission values first and 
continuing until a number of vehicles equal to the calculated number of 
noncomplying vehicles as determined above is reached. If this 
calculation determines that only a portion of vehicles in an engine 
family contribute to the debit situation, then EPA will designate actual 
vehicles in that engine family as not covered by the certificate, 
starting with the last vehicle produced and counting backwards.
    (4) If a manufacturer opts out of the National LEV program pursuant 
to

[[Page 394]]

Sec. 86.1707, the manufacturer continues to be responsible for 
offsetting any debits outstanding on the effective date of the opt-out 
within the required time period. Any failure to offset the debits will 
be considered to be a violation of paragraph (d)(1) of this section and 
may subject the manufacturer to an enforcement action for sale of 
vehicles not covered by a certificate, pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of 
this section.
    (5) For purposes of calculating tolling of the statute of 
limitations, a violation of the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section, a failure to satisfy the conditions upon which a certificate(s) 
was issued and hence a sale of vehicles not covered by the certificate, 
all occur upon the expiration of the deadline for offsetting debits 
specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (e) NMOG credit transfers. (1) EPA may reject NMOG credit transfers 
if the involved manufacturers fail to submit the credit transfer 
notification in the annual report.
    (2) A manufacturer may not sell credits that are not available for 
sale pursuant to the provisions in paragraphs (c)(2) or (d)(2) of this 
section.
    (3) Except in instances of fraud on the part of the credit 
recipient, where a manufacturer sells credits that were not available 
for sale, the credits shall be treated as valid, and the manufacturer 
that sold the credits shall be liable for any resulting shortfall.
    (4)(i) If a manufacturer transfers a credit that it has not 
generated pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section or acquired from 
another party, the manufacturer will be considered to have generated a 
debit in the model year that the manufacturer transferred the credit. 
The manufacturer must offset such debits by the deadline for the annual 
report for that same model year.
    (ii) Failure to offset the debits within the required time period 
will be considered a failure to satisfy the conditions upon which the 
certificate(s) was issued and will be addressed pursuant to paragraph 
(d)(3) of this section.

date for the annual report. Records may be retained as

[[Page 395]]

hard copy or reduced to microfilm, ADP diskettes, and so forth, 
depending on the manufacturer's record retention procedure; provided, 
that in every case all information contained in the hard copy is 
retained.
    (4) Nothing in this section limits the Administrator's discretion to 
require the manufacturer to retain additional records or submit 
information not specifically required by this section.
    (5) Pursuant to a request made by the Administrator, the 
manufacturer shall submit to the Administrator the information that the 
manufacturer is required to retain.
    (6) EPA may void ab initio a certificate of conformity for a vehicle 
certified to National LEV certification standards as set forth or 
otherwise referenced in Sec. 86.1708 or Sec. 86.1709 for which the 
manufacturer fails to retain the records required in this section or to 
provide such information to the Administrator upon request.
    (b) Reporting. (1) Each covered manufacturer shall submit an annual 
report. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the 
annual report shall contain, for each averaging set, the fleet average 
NMOG value achieved, all values required to calculate the NMOG value, 
the number of credits generated or debits incurred, and all the values 
required to calculate the credits or debits. For each applicable region 
(NTR and ASTR), the annual report shall contain the resulting balance of 
credits or debits.
    (2) When a manufacturer calculates compliance with the fleet average 
NMOG standards using the provisions in Sec. 86.1710(a)(3)(iii) or 
Sec. 86.1710(a)(4)(iii), then the annual report shall state that the 
manufacturer has elected to use such provision and shall contain, for 
each averaging set, the fleet average NMOG values as specified in 
Sec. 86.1710(a)(3)(iii) or Sec. 86.1710(a)(4)(iii).
    (3) The annual report shall also include documentation on all credit 
transactions the manufacturer has engaged in since those included in the 
last report. Information for each transaction shall include:
    (i) Name of credit provider;
    (ii) Name of credit recipient;
    (iii) Date the transfer occurred;
    (iv) Quantity of credits transferred;

provisions in this section is a violation of section 203(a)(1) of the 
Clean Air Act for each subject vehicle and truck produced by that 
manufacturer.
    (6) If EPA or the manufacturer determines that a reporting error 
occurred on an annual report previously submitted to EPA, the 
manufacturer's credit or debit calculations will be recalculated. EPA 
may void erroneous credits, unless transferred, and shall adjust 
erroneous debits. In the case of transferred erroneous credits, EPA 
shall adjust the manufacturer's credit or debit balance to reflect the 
sale of such credits and any resulting generation of debits.
    (c) Notice of opportunity for hearing. Any voiding of the 
certificate under paragraph (a)(6) of this section will be made only 
after EPA has offered the manufacturer concerned an opportunity for a 
hearing conducted in accordance with Sec. 86.614 for light-duty vehicles

Driving Schedule as specified in appendix IV of this part. A modified 
procedure (Alternative Service Accumulation Durability Program, 
Sec. 86.094-13(e) and subsequent model year provisions) may also be used

light-duty trucks shall accumulate mileage at a measured curb weight 
that is within 100 pounds of the estimated curb weight. If the vehicle 
weight is within 100 pounds of being included in the next higher inertia 
weight class as specified in Sec. 86.129, the manufacturer may elect to 
conduct the respective emission tests at the higher weight. All mileage 
accumulation of hybrid electric vehicles shall be conducted with the 
battery pack at the manufacturer's indicated lowest state-of-charge at 
the beginning of the test cycle. At no time throughout mileage 
accumulation shall the battery pack be charged using any off-board

    (1) For vehicles certified to the SFTP exhaust emission standards, 
complete exhaust emission tests will include both the FTP and the SFTP 
tests. The Administrator will accept the manufacturer's determination of 
the mileage at which the engine-system combination is stabilized for 
emission data testing if (prior to testing) a manufacturer determines 
that the interval chosen yields emissions performance that is stable and 
representative of design

[[Page 402]]

intent. Sufficient mileage should be accumulated to reduce the possible 
effects of any emissions variability that is the result of insufficient 
vehicle operation. Of primary importance in making this determination is 
the behavior of the catalyst, EGR valve, trap oxidizer or any other part 
of the ECS which may have non-linear aging characteristics. In the 
alternative, the manufacturer may elect to accumulate 4,000 mile +/- 250 
miles on each test vehicle within an engine family without making a 
determination.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (d) The provisions of Sec. 86.096-26(a)(4) (i) and (ii) and 
subsequent model year provisions do not apply to this subpart. The 
following shall instead apply to this subpart:
    (1) For Otto-cycle and diesel vehicles and battery assisted 
combustion engine vehicles that use Otto-cycle or diesel engines:
    (i) Prior to initiation of mileage accumulation in a durability-data 
vehicle, manufacturers must establish the mileage test interval for 
durability-data vehicle testing of the engine family. Once testing has 
begun on a durability-data vehicle, the durability test interval for 
that family may not be changed. At a minimum, multiple tests must be 
performed at 5,000 miles, 50,000 miles, and the final mileage point as 
long as they meet the requirements of appendix XV of this part. The 
Administrator will accept durability test interval schedules determined 
by the manufacturer. The testing must provide a DF confidence level 
equal to or better than the confidence level using the former fixed 
mileage test and scheduled maintenance intervals. The procedure for 
making this determination is specified in appendix XV of this part. The 
mileage intervals between test points must be approximately of equal 
length. The <plus-minus>250 mile test point tolerance and the 
requirement that tests be conducted before and after scheduled 
maintenance is still mandatory. Emission control systems for Otto-cycle 
engines that have step function changes designed into the control system 
must use the 5,000 mile test interval schedule.
    (ii) Testing before and after scheduled (or unscheduled) maintenance 
points must be conducted, and these data are to be included in the 
deterioration factor calculation. Testing before unscheduled maintenance 
may be omitted with the prior consent of the Administrator when testing 
would be dangerous to a vehicle or an operator. The number of tests 
before and after scheduled maintenance and the mileage intervals between 
test points should be approximately equal. Durability test interval 
schedules with multiple testing at test points within 10,000 miles of or 
at the 50,000 mile and the final mileage test point must be submitted 
for approval. Multiple testing at maintenance mileage tests points 
within 10,000 miles of the 50,000 mile and the final mileage test points 
may be approved if it can be demonstrated by previously generated data 
that the emission effects of the maintenance are insignificant.
    (iii) For engine families that are to be certified to the full 
useful life emission standards, each exhaust emission durability-data 
vehicle shall be driven with all emission control systems installed and 
operating, for the full useful life or such lesser distance as the 
Administrator may agree to as meeting the objective of this procedure. 
Durability tests shall be at every 5,000 miles, from 5,000 miles to the 
full useful life, however, the above procedures may be used to determine 
alternate test intervals subject to the following:
    (A) For engine families that are to be certified to the full useful 
life emission standards, durability vehicles may accumulate less than 
the full useful life if the manufacturer submits other data or 
information sufficient to demonstrate that the vehicle is capable of 
meeting the applicable emission standards for the full useful life. At a 
minimum, 75% of the full useful life shall be accumulated.
    (B) For the purpose of conducting mileage accumulation on light-duty 
hybrid electric vehicles, the full useful life of the auxiliary power 
unit shall be defined as 50,000 miles for a Type A hybrid electric

    (iv) Alternative durability plans may also be used if the 
manufacturer provides a demonstration that the alternative plan provides 
equal or greater confidence that the vehicles will comply in-use with 
the emission standards. All alternative durability plans are subject to 
approval in advance by the Administrator.
    (2) For diesel vehicles equipped with periodically regenerating trap 
oxidizer systems, at least four regeneration emission tests (see 
Secs. 86.106 through 86.145) shall be made. The pollutant mass emission 
calculation procedures for vehicles equipped with periodically 
regenerating trap oxidizer systems are included in appendix XVI of this 
part. With the advance approval of the Administrator, the manufacturer 
may install: A manual override switch capable of preventing (i.e., 
delaying until the switch is turned off) the start of the regeneration 
process; and a light which indicates when the system would initiate 
regeneration if it had no override switch. Upon activation of the 
override switch the vehicle will be operated on a dynamometer to 
precondition it for the regeneration emission test in accordance with 
Secs. 86.132 and 86.1772. The Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) 
that is in progress at the time when the light comes on shall be 
completed and the vehicle shall proceed to the prescribed soak period 
followed by testing. With the advance approval of the Administrator, the 
manual override switch will be turned off at some predetermined point in 
the testing sequence, permitting the regeneration process to proceed 
without further manual interaction. The mileage intervals between test 
points shall be approximately equal. The first regeneration emission 
test shall be made at the 5,000 mile point. The regeneration emission 
tests must provide a deterioration factor confidence level equal to or 
better than the confidence level achieved by performing regeneration 
emission tests at the following mileage points: 5,000; 25,000; 50,000; 
75,000; and 100,000. The procedure for making this determination is 
shown in appendix XV of this part.
    (3) For gasoline-, gaseous-, and alcohol-fueled vehicles that are 
certified by a whole-vehicle durability protocol, the specified 
evaporative durability test points are at 5,000, 40,000, 75,000, and 
100,000 miles. These requirements are also applicable to hybrid electric 
vehicles. With the exception of flexible-fuel vehicles, a manufacturer 
may conduct evaporative testing at test points used for exhaust emission 
durability testing, provided that the same deterioration confidence 
level for the evaporative emission DF determination is retained (see 
appendix XIV of this part).
    (4) For flexible-fuel vehicles certifying to TLEV, LEV, or ULEV 
standards, the test schedule shall include exhaust emission tests at 
5,000 miles, 10,000 miles, and every 10,000 miles thereafter to the 
final mileage point using M85 or E85 and certification gasoline. For all 
flexible-fuel vehicles, if evaporative emission testing is conducted, 
exhaust and evaporative emission tests shall also be conducted using M35 
or E10, or another approved fuel, at the mileage points where M85 or E85 
testing is conducted. The results of these exhaust and evaporative 
emission tests will be used by the Administrator to evaluate the 
vehicle's emission control deterioration with various fuels (M85, M35, 
and unleaded gasoline; See fuel specifications in Sec. 86.1771). Only 
the M85 or E85 and certification gasoline exhaust emission results and 
the M35 or E10 evaporative emission results will be used to determine 
applicable exhaust and evaporative emission deterioration factors, 
respectively, as required in Sec. 86.1728 (Compliance with Emission 
Standards).
    (e) The provisions of Sec. 86.096-26(a)(5)(i) and subsequent model 
year provisions apply to this subpart, with the following addition:
    (1) In addition, the emission tests performed on emission-data 
vehicles and durability-data vehicles shall be non-regeneration emission 
tests for diesel light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks equipped with 
periodically regenerating trap oxidizer systems. For any of these 
vehicles equipped with continually regenerating trap oxidizer systems, 
manufacturers may use the provisions applicable to periodically 
regenerating trap oxidizer systems as an option. If such an option is 
elected, all references in these procedures to

vehicles equipped with periodically regenerating trap oxidizer systems 
shall be applicable to the vehicles equipped with continually 
regenerating trap oxidizer systems.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (f) The provisions of Sec. 86.096-26(a)(8) and subsequent model year 
provisions do not apply to this subpart. The following shall instead 
apply to this subpart:
    (1) Once a manufacturer submits the information required in 
Sec. 86.096-26(a)(7) and subsequent model year provisions for a 
durability-data vehicle, the manufacturer shall continue to run the 
vehicle to 50,000 miles if the family is certified to 50,000 mile 
emission standards or to the full useful life if it is certified to 
emission standards beyond 50,000 miles (or to a lesser distance that the 
Administrator may have previously agreed to), and the data from the 
vehicle will be used in the calculations under Sec. 86.094-28 and 
subsequent model year provisions. Discontinuation of a durability-data 
vehicle shall be allowed only with the consent of the Administrator.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (g) The provisions of Sec. 86.096-26(b) and subsequent model year 
provisions do not apply to this subpart.
    (h)(1) The exhaust emissions shall be measured from all exhaust 
emission data vehicles tested in accordance with the federal Highway 
Fuel Economy Test (HWFET; 40 CFR part 600, subpart B). The oxides of 
nitrogen emissions measured during such tests shall be multiplied by the 
oxides of nitrogen deterioration factor computed in accordance with 
Sec. 86.094-28 and subsequent model year provisions, and then rounded 
and compared with the applicable emission standard in Secs. 86.1708 and 
86.1709. All data obtained pursuant to this paragraph (h)(1) shall be 
reported in accordance with procedures applicable to other exhaust 
emissions data required pursuant to these procedures. Hybrid electric 
vehicles shall be tested with the battery state-of-charge set such that 
one of the following two conditions is satisfied:
    (i) The state-of-charge is at the lowest level allowed by the 
control unit of the auxiliary power unit; or
    (ii) The state-of-charge is set such that auxiliary power unit 
operation will be at its maximum level at the beginning and throughout 
the emission test.
    (2) In the event that one or more of the manufacturer's emission 
data vehicles fail the applicable HWFET standard in Secs. 86.1708 and 
86.1709, the manufacturer may submit to the Administrator engineering 
data or other evidence showing that the system is capable of complying 
with the standard. If the Administrator finds, on the basis of an 
engineering evaluation, that the system can comply with the HWFET 
standard, he or she may accept the information supplied by the 
manufacturer in lieu of vehicle test data.

shall be established for exhaust HC (non-alcohol vehicles, non-TLEVs, 
non-LEVs, and non-ULEVs), exhaust OMHCE or OMNMHCE (alcohol vehicles 
that are not TLEVs, LEVs, or ULEVs), exhaust NMOG (all TLEVs, LEVs, 
ULEVs), exhaust formaldehyde (alcohol vehicles, TLEVs, LEVs, ULEVs), 
exhaust CO, exhaust NO<INF>X</INF>, and exhaust particulate (diesel 
vehicles only) for each engine-system combination. A separate 
evaporative emission deterioration factor shall be determined for each 
evaporative emission family-evaporative emission control system 
combination from the testing conducted by the manufacturer (gasoline- 
and alcohol-fueled vehicles only). Separate emission correction factors 
(diesel light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks equipped with 
periodically regenerating trap oxidizer systems only) shall be 
determined from the exhaust emission results of the durability-data 
vehicle(s) for each engine-system combination. A separate factor shall 
be established for exhaust HC (non-alcohol vehicles, non-TLEVs, non-

    (2) [Reserved]
    (c) The provisions of Sec. 86.094-28(a)(4)(i)(A)(4) and subsequent 
model year provisions do not apply to this subpart. The following shall 
instead apply to this subpart:
    (1) The manufacturer must use the outlier identification procedure 
set forth in appendix VIII of this part to test for irregular data from 
a durability-data set. If any data point is identified as a statistical 
outlier, the Administrator shall determine, on the basis of an 
engineering analysis of the causes of the outlier submitted by the 
manufacturer, whether the outlier is to be rejected. The outlier shall 
be rejected only if the Administrator determines that the outlier does 
not reflect representative characteristics of the emission control 
system, i.e., the outlier is a result of an emission control system 
anomaly, test procedure error, or an extraordinary circumstance not 
expected to recur. Only the identified outlier shall be eliminated; 
other data at that test point (i.e., data for other pollutants) shall 
not be eliminated unless the Administrator determines, based on the 
engineering analysis, that they also do not reflect representative 
characteristics of the emission control system. Where the manufacturer 
chooses to apply both the outlier procedure and averaging to the same 
data set, the outlier procedure shall be completed prior to applying the 
averaging procedure. All durability test data, including any outliers 
and the manufacturer's engineering analysis, shall be submitted with the 
final application.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (d) The provisions of Sec. 86.094-28(a)(4)(i)(B) and subsequent 
model year provisions do not apply to this subpart. The following shall 
instead apply to this subpart:
    (1) All applicable exhaust emission results shall be plotted as a 
function of the mileage on the system, rounded to the nearest mile, and 
the best fit straight lines, fitted by the method of least squares, 
shall be drawn through all these data points. The emission data will be 
acceptable for use in the calculation of the deterioration factor only 
if the interpolated 4,000-mile, 50,000-mile, and full useful life points 
on this line are within the applicable emission standards in 
Secs. 86.1708 and 86.1709. For hybrid electric vehicles, the emission 
data will be acceptable for use in the calculation of the deterioration 
factor only if the engine mileage points corresponding to the 
interpolated 4,000 mile, 50,000 mile, and full useful life points of the 
vehicle on this line are within the applicable emission standards in 
Secs. 86.1708 and 86.1709. The engine mileage points shall be determined 
based on the test schedule submitted to the Administrator as required in 
Sec. 86.096-26. As an exception, the Administrator will review the data 
on a case-by-case basis and may approve its use in those instances where 
the best fit straight line crosses an applicable standard but no data 
point exceeds the standard or when the best fit straight line crosses 
the applicable standard at the 4,000-mile point but the 5,000-mile 
actual test point and the

[[Page 406]]

50,000 mile and full useful life interpolated points are both below the 
standards. A multiplicative exhaust emission deterioration factor shall 
be calculated for each engine system combination as follows:
    (i) For engine families certified to 50,000 mile emissions 
standards: Factor = Exhaust emissions interpolated to 50,000 miles 
divided by exhaust emissions interpolated to 4,000 miles.
    (ii) For engine families certified to full useful life emissions 
standards beyond 50,000 miles: Factor = Exhaust emissions interpolated 
to the full useful life divided by exhaust emissions interpolated to 
4,000 miles.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (e) The following requirements shall be in addition to the 
provisions of Sec. 86.094-28(a)(4) and subsequent model year provisions:
    (1)(i) The regeneration exhaust emission data (diesel light-duty 
vehicles and light-duty trucks equipped with periodically regenerating 
trap oxidizer systems only) from the tests required under Sec. 86.096-
26(a)(4) and subsequent model year provisions shall be used to determine 
the regeneration exhaust emissions interpolated to the 50,000-mile 
point. The regeneration exhaust emission results shall be plotted as a 
function of the mileage on the system, rounded to the nearest mile, and 
the best fit straight lines, fitted by the method of least squares, 
shall be drawn through all these data points. The interpolated 50,000-
mile point of this line shall be used to calculate the multiplicative 
exhaust emission correction factor for each engine-system combination as 
follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06JN97.000


where:

R = the ratio of the regeneration exhaust emissions interpolated to 
50,000 miles to the non-regeneration exhaust emissions interpolated to 
50,000 miles.
n = the number of complete regenerations which occur during the 
durability test.

    (ii) The interpolated values determined in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of 
this section shall be carried out to a minimum of four places to the 
right of the decimal point before dividing one by the other to determine 
the correction factor. The results shall be rounded to three places to 
the right of the decimal point in accordance with the Rounding-Off 
Method specified in ASTM E 29-90, Standard Practice for Using 
Significant Digits in Test Data to Determine Conformance with 
Specifications (incorporated by reference; see Sec. 86.1). For 
applicability to gaseous emission standards under the 100,000 mile 
option, R will be determined based upon projected 100,000 mile 
emissions.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (f) The provisions of Sec. 86.094-28(a)(4)(ii)(A) and subsequent 
model year provisions do not apply to this subpart. The following shall 
instead apply to this subpart:
    (1) The official exhaust emission test results for each emission-
data vehicle at the 4,000 mile test point shall be multiplied by the 
appropriate deterioration factor, and correction factor (diesel light-
duty vehicles and light-duty trucks equipped with periodically 
regenerating trap oxidizer systems only): Provided: that if a 
deterioration factor as computed in Sec. 86.094-28(a)(4)(i)(B) and 
subsequent model year provisions or a correction factor as computed in 
paragraph (e) of this section is less than one, that deterioration 
factor or correction factor shall be one for the purposes of this 
paragraph (f).
    (2) [Reserved]
    (g) The provisions of Sec. 86.094-28(a)(4)(iii) and subsequent model 
year provisions do not apply to this subpart. The following shall 
instead apply to this subpart:
    (1) The emissions to compare with the standard (or the family 
particulate emission limit, as appropriate) shall be the adjusted 
emissions of Sec. 86.094-28(a)(4)(ii) (A) and (B) and subsequent model 
year provisions for each emission-data vehicle. Before any emission 
value is compared with the standard (or the family particulate limit, as 
appropriate), it shall be rounded to one significant figure beyond the 
number of significant figures contained in the standard (or the family 
particulate emission limit, as appropriate) in accordance with the 
Rounding-Off Method specified in ASTM E 29-90, Standard Practice for 
Using Significant Digits in Test Data to Determine Conformance

with Specifications (incorporated by reference; see Sec. 86.1). The 
rounded emission values may not exceed the standard (or the family 
particulate emission limit, as appropriate). Fleet average NMOG value 
calculations shall be rounded to four significant figures in accordance 
with the Rounding-Off Method specified in ASTM E 29-90, Standard 
Practice for Using Significant Digits in Test Data to Determine 
Conformance with Specifications (incorporated by reference; see 
Sec. 86.1) before comparing with fleet average NMOG requirements.

Sec. 86.1772-99  Road load power, test weight, and inertia weight class 
determination.

    (a) The provisions of Sec. 86.129 apply to this subpart.
    (b) The following requirements shall also apply to this subpart:
    (1) For electric and hybrid electric vehicle lines where it is 
expected that more than 33 percent of a vehicle line will be equipped 
with air conditioning, per Sec. 86.096-24(g)(2) or Sec. 86.1832-01(a) as 
applicable, that derives power from the battery pack, the road load 
shall be increased by the incremental horsepower required to operate the 
air conditioning unit. The incremental increase shall be determined by 
recording the difference in energy required for a hybrid electric 
vehicle under all-electric power to complete the running loss test fuel 
tank temperature profile test sequence without air conditioning and the 
same vehicle tested over the running loss test fuel tank temperature 
profile test sequence with the air conditioning set to the ``NORMAL'' 
air conditioning mode and adjusted to the minimum discharge air 
temperature and high fan speed over the time period needed to perform 
the test sequence, and converting this value into units of horsepower. 
Vehicles equipped with automatic temperature controlled air conditioning 
systems shall be operated in ``AUTOMATIC'' temperature and fan modes 
with the system set at 72 deg. F. The running loss test fuel tank 
temperature profile test sequence is found in Sec. 86.129(d).

<R05>
Sec. 86.1773-99  Test sequence; general requirements.

    (a) The provisions of Sec. 86.130 apply to this subpart.
    (b) The following additional requirements shall also apply to this 
subpart:
    (1) For purposes of determining conformity with 50  deg.F test 
requirements, the procedures set forth in paragraph (c) of this section 
shall apply. For all hybrid electric vehicles and all 1995 and 
subsequent model-year vehicles certifying to running loss and useful 
life evaporative emission standards, the test sequence specified in 
subpart B of this part shall apply.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (c)(1) Following a 12 to 36 hour cold soak at a nominal temperature 
of 50  deg.F, emissions of CO and NO<INF>X</INF> measured on the Federal 
Test Procedure (subpart B of this part), conducted at a nominal test 
temperature of 50  deg.F, shall not exceed the standards for vehicles of 
the same emission category and vehicle type subject to a cold soak and 
emission test at 68 to 86  deg.F. For all TLEVs, emissions of NMOG and 
formaldehyde at 50  deg.F shall not exceed the 50,000 mile certification 
standard multiplied by a factor of 2.0. For all LEVs, emissions of NMOG 
and formaldehyde at 50  deg.F shall not exceed the 50,000 mile 
certification standard multiplied by a factor of 2.0. For all ULEVs, 
emissions of NMOG and formaldehyde at 50  deg.F shall not exceed the 
50,000 mile certification standard multiplied by a factor of 2.0. 
Emissions

[[Page 410]]

of NMOG shall be multiplied by a reactivity adjustment factor, if any, 
prior to comparing with the 50,000 certification standard multiplied by 
the specified factor. The test vehicles shall not be subject to a 
diurnal heat build prior to the cold start exhaust test or evaporative 
emission testing.
    (i) For the 50  deg.F emission test, the nominal preconditioning, 
soak, and test temperatures shall be maintained within 3  deg.F of the 
nominal temperature on an average basis and within 5  deg.F of the 
nominal temperature on a continuous basis. The temperature shall be 
sampled at least once every 15 seconds during the preconditioning and 
test periods and at least once each 5 minutes during the soak period. A 
continuous strip chart recording of the temperature with these minimum 
time resolutions is an acceptable alternative to employing a data 
acquisition system.
    (ii) The test site temperature shall be measured at the inlet of the 
vehicle cooling fan used for testing.
    (iii) The test vehicle may be fueled before the preconditioning 
procedure in a fueling area maintained within a temperature range of 68 
to 86  deg.F. The preconditioning shall be conducted at a nominal 
temperature of 50  deg.F. The requirement to saturate the evaporative 
control canister(s) shall not apply.
    (iv) If a soak area remote from the test site is used, the vehicle 
may pass through an area maintained within a temperature range of 68 to 
86  deg.F during a time interval not to exceed 10 minutes. In such 
cases, the vehicle shall be restabilized to 50  deg.F by soaking the 
vehicle in the nominal 50  deg.F test area for six times as long as the 
exposure time to the higher temperature area, prior to starting the 
emission test.
    (v) The vehicle shall be approximately level during all phases of 
the test sequence to prevent abnormal fuel distribution.
    (2) Manufacturers shall demonstrate compliance with this requirement 
each year by testing at least three LDV or LDT emission data and/or 
engineering development vehicles (with at least 4000 miles) which are 
representative of the array of technologies available in that model 
year. Only TLEVs, LEVs, and ULEVs are to be considered for testing at 50 
 deg.F. It is not necessary to apply deterioration factors (DFs) to the 
50  deg.F test results to comply with this requirement. Testing at 50 
deg.F shall not be required for fuel-flexible and dual-fuel vehicles 
when operating on gasoline. Natural gas, hybrid electric and diesel-
fueled vehicles shall also be exempt from 50  deg.F testing.
    (3) The following schedule outlines the parameters to be considered 
for vehicle selection:
    (i) Fuel control system (e.g., multiport fuel injection, throttle 
body electronic fuel injection, sequential multiport electronic fuel 
injection, etc.);
    (ii) Catalyst system (e.g., electrically heated catalyst, close-
coupled catalyst, underfloor catalyst, etc.);
    (iii) Control system type (e.g., mass-air flow, speed density, 
etc.);
    (iv) Vehicle category (e.g., TLEV, LEV, ULEV);
    (v) Fuel type (e.g., gasoline, methanol, etc.).
    (4) The same engine family shall not be selected in the succeeding 
two years unless the manufacturer produces fewer than three engine 
families. If the manufacturer produces more than three TLEV, LEV, or 
ULEV engine families per model year, the Administrator may request 50 
deg.F testing of specific engine families. If the manufacturer provides 
a list of the TLEV, LEV, and ULEV engine families that it will certify 
for a model year and provides a description of the technologies used on 
each engine family (including the vehicle selection parameters 
information in paragraphs (c)(3) (i) through (v) of this section), the 
Administrator shall select the engine families subject to 50  deg.F 
testing within a 30 day period after receiving such a list and 
description. The Administrator may revise the engine families selected 
after the 30 day period if the information provided by the manufacturer 
does not accurately reflect the engine families actually certified by 
the manufacturer.
    (5) For the purposes of this section, the Administrator will accept 
vehicles selected and tested in accordance with the 50  deg.F testing 
procedures specified by the California Air Resources Board.
    (d) A manufacturer has the option of simulating air conditioning 
operation during testing at other ambient test

[[Page 411]]

conditions provided it can demonstrate that the vehicle tailpipe exhaust 
emissions are representative of the emissions that would result from the 
SC03 cycle test procedure and the ambient conditions of paragraph 
86.161-00. The Administrator has approved two optional air conditioning 
test simulation procedures, AC1 and AC2, for the 2001 to 2003 model 
years only. If a manufacturer desires to conduct an alternative SC03 
test simulation other than AC1 and AC2, or the AC1 and AC2 simulations 
for the 2004 and subsequent model years, the simulation test procedure 
must be approved in advance by the Administrator.

on the best available scientific knowledge and sound engineering 
judgment. The Administrator shall notify manufacturers in writing of any 
such reactivity adjustment factor at least 3 years prior to January 1 of 
the calendar year which has the same numerical designation as the model 
year for which the revised reactivity adjustment factor first becomes 
effective. However, manufacturers may use the revised reactivity 
adjustment factor in certifying any new engine family whose 
certification application is submitted following such notification, if 
they so choose. Manufacturers may also continue to use the original 
reactivity adjustment factor for any existing engine family previously 
certified with that reactivity adjustment factor until a new durability-
data vehicle is tested for that engine family.
    (5) Manufacturers may request the use of a unique reactivity 
adjustment factor for a specific vehicle emission control technology

specified in appendix XVII of this part, the ``g ozone potential per g 
NMOG'' value for the vehicle emission control technology category and 
fuel system for which the manufacturer is requesting the use of a unique 
reactivity adjustment factor shall be divided by the ``g ozone potential 
per g NMOG'' value for a conventional gasoline-fueled vehicle 
established for the vehicle emission control technology category. The

Sec. 86.1805-01  Useful life.

    (a) For light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, intermediate 
useful life is a period of use of 5 years or 50,000 miles, whichever 
occurs first.
    (b) Full useful life is as follows:
    (1) For light-duty vehicles and light light-duty trucks full useful 
life is a period of use of 10 years or 100,000 miles, which ever occurs 
first.
    (2) For heavy light-duty trucks full useful life is a period of use 
of 11 years or 120,000 miles, which ever occurs first.
    (3) For complete heavy-duty vehicles, the full useful life is a 
period of use of 11 years or 120,000 miles, which ever occurs first.
    (c) Manufacturers may petition the Administrator to provide 
alternative useful life periods for light-duty trucks or complete heavy-
duty vehicles when they believe that the useful life periods are 
significantly unrepresentative for one or more test groups (either too 
long or too short). This petition must include the full rationale behind 
the request together with any supporting data and other evidence. Based 
on this or other information the Administrator may assign an alternative 
useful-life period. Any petition should be submitted in a timely manner, 
to allow adequate time for a thorough evaluation. For light-duty trucks, 
alternative useful life periods will be granted only for THC, THCE, and 
idle CO requirements.

Sec. 86.1805-04  Useful life.

    (a) Except as required under paragraph (b) of this section or 
permitted under paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) of this section, the full 
useful life for all LDVs, LDT1s and LDT2s is a period of use of 10 years 
or 120,000 miles, whichever occurs first. For all HLDTs, MDPVs, and 
complete heavy-duty vehicles full useful life is a period of 11 years or 
120,000 miles, whichever occurs first. This full useful life applies to 
all exhaust, evaporative and refueling emission requirements except for 
standards which are specified to only be applicable at the time of 
certification.
    (b) Manufacturers may elect to optionally certify a test group to 
the Tier 2 exhaust emission standards for 150,000 miles to gain 
additional NO<INF>X</INF> credits, as permitted in Sec. 86.1860-04(g), 
or to opt out of intermediate life standards as permitted in 
Sec. 86.1811-04(c). In such cases, useful life is a period of use of 15 
years or 150,000 miles, whichever occurs first, for all exhaust, 
evaporative and refueling emission requirements except for cold CO 
standards and standards

[[Page 429]]

which are applicable only at the time of certification.
    (c) Where intermediate useful life exhaust emission standards are 
applicable, such standards are applicable for five years or 50,000 
miles, whichever occurs first.
    (d) Where cold CO standards are applicable, the useful life 
requirement for compliance with the cold CO standard only, is 5 years or 
50,000 miles, whichever occurs first.
    (e) Where LDVs, LDT1s and LDT2s of the 2003 or earlier model years 
are certified to Tier 2 exhaust emission standards for purposes of 
generating early Tier 2 NO<INF>X</INF> credits, manufacturers may 
certify those vehicles to full useful lives of 100,000 miles in lieu of 
the otherwise required 120,000 mile full useful lives, as provided under 
Sec. 86.1861-04(c)(4).
    (f) For interim non-Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs, the useful life requirement 
for exhaust, evaporative and refueling emissions is 10 years or 100,000 
miles, whichever occurs first.

Sec. 86.1806-01  On-board diagnostics.

    (a)(1) Except as provided by paragraph (a)(2) of this section, all 
light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks and MDPVs must be equipped with 
an onboard diagnostic (OBD) system capable of monitoring, for each 
vehicle's useful life, all emission-related powertrain systems or 
components. All systems and components required to be monitored by these 
regulations must be evaluated periodically, but no less frequently than 
once per Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule as defined in Appendix I, 
paragraph (a), of this part, or similar trip as approved by the 
Administrator.
    (2) Diesel fueled chassis-certified MDPVs and engine-certified 
diesel engines used in MDPVs, are subject to the requirements of this 
section only if the exhaust emission certification of the applicable 
test group is being carried across from a California configuration to 
which California OBD-II requirements are applicable.
    (b) Malfunction descriptions. The OBD system shall detect and 
identify malfunctions in all monitored emission-related powertrain 
systems or components according to the following malfunction definitions 
as measured and calculated in accordance with test procedures set forth 
in subpart B of this part, excluding those test procedures described in 
Sec. 86.158-00. Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply to 
diesel cycle light-duty vehicles or diesel cycle light-duty trucks, 
except where the catalyst is needed for NMHC control. Paragraphs (b)(2), 
(b)(3), and (b)(4) of this section do not apply to diesel cycle light-
duty vehicles or diesel cycle light-duty trucks.
    (1) Catalyst deterioration or malfunction before it results in an 
increase in NMHC emissions 1.5 times the NMHC standard, as compared to 
the NMHC emission level measured using a representative 4000 mile 
catalyst system.
    (2) Engine misfire resulting in exhaust emissions exceeding 1.5 
times the applicable standard for NMHC, CO or NO<INF>X</INF>; and any 
misfire capable of damaging the catalytic converter.
    (3) Oxygen sensor deterioration or malfunction resulting in exhaust 
emissions exceeding 1.5 times the applicable standard for NMHC, CO or 
NO<INF>X</INF>.
    (4) Any vapor leak in the evaporative and/or refueling system 
(excluding the tubing and connections between the purge valve and the 
intake manifold) greater than or equal in magnitude to a leak caused by 
a 0.040 inch diameter orifice; any absence of evaporative purge air flow 
from the complete evaporative emission control system. On vehicles with 
fuel tank capacity greater than 25 gallons, the Administrator may, 
following a request from the manufacturer, revise the size of the 
orifice to the smallest orifice feasible, based on test data, if the 
most reliable monitoring method available cannot reliably detect a 
system leak equal to a 0.040 inch diameter orifice.
    (5) Any deterioration or malfunction occurring in a powertrain 
system or component directly intended to control emissions, including 
but not necessarily limited to, the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) 
system, if equipped, the secondary air system, if equipped, and the fuel 
control system, singularly resulting in exhaust emissions exceeding 1.5 
times the applicable emission

[[Page 430]]

standard for NMHC, CO or NO<INF>X</INF>. For vehicles equipped with a 
secondary air system, a functional check, as described in paragraph 
(b)(6) of this section, may satisfy the requirements of this paragraph 
provided the manufacturer can demonstrate that deterioration of the flow 
distribution system is unlikely. This demonstration is subject to 
Administrator approval and, if the demonstration and associated 
functional check are approved, the diagnostic system shall indicate a 
malfunction when some degree of secondary airflow is not detectable in 
the exhaust system during the check. For vehicles equipped with positive 
crankcase ventilation (PCV), monitoring of the PCV system is not 
necessary provided the manufacturer can demonstrate to the 
Administrator's satisfaction that the PCV system is unlikely to fail.
    (6) Any other deterioration or malfunction occurring in an 
electronic emission-related powertrain system or component not otherwise 
described above that either provides input to or receives commands from 
the on-board computer and has a measurable impact on emissions; 
monitoring of components required by this paragraph shall be satisfied 
by employing electrical circuit continuity checks and rationality checks 
for computer input components (input values within manufacturer 
specified ranges), and functionality checks for computer output 
components (proper functional response to computer commands) except that 
the Administrator may waive such a rationality or functionality check 
where the manufacturer has demonstrated infeasibility; malfunctions are 
defined as a failure of the system or component to meet the electrical 
circuit continuity checks or the rationality or functionality checks.
    (7) Oxygen sensor or any other component deterioration or 
malfunction which renders that sensor or component incapable of 
performing its function as part of the OBD system shall be detected and 
identified on vehicles so equipped.
    (8) For Tier 2 and interim non-Tier 2 hybrid electric vehicles 
(HEVs) only. Unless added to HEVs in compliance with other requirements 
of this section, or unless otherwise approved by the Administrator:
    (i) The manufacturer must equip each HEV with a maintenance 
indicator consisting of a light that must activate automatically by 
illuminating the first time the minimum performance level is observed 
for each battery system component. Possible battery system components 
requiring monitoring are: battery water level, temperature control, 
pressure control, and other parameters critical for determining battery 
condition.
    (ii) The manufacturer must equip ``off-vehicle charge capable HEVs'' 
with a useful life indicator for the battery system consisting of a 
light that must illuminate the first time the battery system is unable 
to achieve an all-electric operating range (starting from a full state-
of-charge) which is at least 75 percent of the range determined for the 
vehicle in the Urban Driving Schedule portion of the All-Electric Range 
Test (see the California Exhaust Emission Standards and Test Procedures 
for 2003 and Subsequent Model Zero-Emission Vehicles, and 2001 and 
Subsequent Model Hybrid Electric Vehicles, in the Passenger Car, Light-
Duty Truck and Medium-Duty Vehicle Classes. These requirements are 
incorporated by reference (see Sec. 86.1).
    (iii) The manufacturer must equip each HEV with a separate odometer 
or other device subject to the approval of the Administrator that can 
accurately measure the mileage accumulation on the engines used in these 
vehicles.
    (c) Malfunction indicator light. The OBD system shall incorporate a 
malfunction indicator light (MIL) readily visible to the vehicle 
operator. When illuminated, it shall display ``Check Engine,'' ``Service 
Engine Soon,'' a universally recognizable engine symbol, or a similar 
phrase or symbol approved by the Administrator. A vehicle shall not be 
equipped with more than one general purpose malfunction indicator light 
for emission-related problems; separate specific purpose warning lights 
(e.g. brake system, fasten seat belt, oil pressure, etc.) are permitted. 
The use of red for the OBD-related malfunction indicator light is 
prohibited.

[[Page 431]]

    (d) MIL illumination. (1) The MIL shall illuminate and remain 
illuminated when any of the conditions specified in paragraph (b) of 
this section are detected and verified, or whenever the engine control 
enters a default or secondary mode of operation considered abnormal for 
the given engine operating conditions. The MIL shall blink once per 
second under any period of operation during which engine misfire is 
occurring and catalyst damage is imminent. If such misfire is detected 
again during the following driving cycle (i.e., operation consisting of, 
at a minimum, engine start-up and engine shut-off) or the next driving 
cycle in which similar conditions are encountered, the MIL shall 
maintain a steady illumination when the misfire is not occurring and 
shall remain illuminated until the MIL extinguishing criteria of this 
section are satisfied. The MIL shall also illuminate when the vehicle's 
ignition is in the ``key-on'' position before engine starting or 
cranking and extinguish after engine starting if no malfunction has 
previously been detected. If a fuel system or engine misfire malfunction 
has previously been detected, the MIL may be extinguished if the 
malfunction does not reoccur during three subsequent sequential trips 
during which similar conditions are encountered (engine speed is within 
375 rpm, engine load is within 20 percent, and the engine's warm-up 
status is the same as that under which the malfunction was first 
detected), and no new malfunctions have been detected. If any 
malfunction other than a fuel system or engine misfire malfunction has 
been detected, the MIL may be extinguished if the malfunction does not 
reoccur during three subsequent sequential trips during which the 
monitoring system responsible for illuminating the MIL functions without 
detecting the malfunction, and no new malfunctions have been detected. 
Upon Administrator approval, statistical MIL illumination protocols may 
be employed, provided they result in comparable timeliness in detecting 
a malfunction and evaluating system performance, i.e., three to six 
driving cycles would be considered acceptable.
    (2)(i) For interim non-Tier 2 and Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs and HLDT/MDPVs, 
vehicles produced through the 2007 model year, upon a manufacturer's 
written request, EPA will consider allowing the use of an on-board 
diagnostic system during the certification process, that functions 
properly on low-sulfur gasoline, but indicates sulfur-induced passes 
when exposed to high sulfur gasoline.
    (ii) For interim non-Tier 2 and Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs and HLDT/MDPVs, if 
vehicles produced through the 2007 model year exhibit illuminations of 
the emission control diagnostic system malfunction indicator light due 
to high sulfur gasoline, EPA will consider, upon a manufacturer's 
written request, allowing modifications to such vehicles on a case-by-
case basis so as to eliminate the sulfur induced illumination.
    (e) Storing of computer codes. The emission control diagnostic 
system shall record and store in computer memory diagnostic trouble 
codes and diagnostic readiness codes indicating the status of the 
emission control system. These codes shall be available through the 
standardized data link connector per SAE J1979 specifications as 
incorporated by reference in paragraph (h) of this section.
    (1) A diagnostic trouble code shall be stored for any detected and 
verified malfunction causing MIL illumination. The stored diagnostic 
trouble code shall identify the malfunctioning system or component as 
uniquely as possible. At the manufacturer's discretion, a diagnostic 
trouble code may be stored for conditions not causing MIL illumination. 
Regardless, a separate code should be stored indicating the expected MIL 
illumination status (i.e., MIL commanded ``ON,'' MIL commanded ``OFF'').
    (2) For a single misfiring cylinder, the diagnostic trouble code(s) 
shall uniquely identify the cylinder, unless the manufacturer submits 
data and/or engineering evaluations which adequately demonstrate that 
the misfiring cylinder cannot be reliably identified under certain 
operating conditions. The diagnostic trouble code shall identify 
multiple misfiring cylinder conditions; under multiple misfire 
conditions, the misfiring cylinders need not

[[Page 432]]

be uniquely identified if a distinct multiple misfire diagnostic trouble 
code is stored.
    (3) The diagnostic system may erase a diagnostic trouble code if the 
same code is not re-registered in at least 40 engine warm-up cycles, and 
the malfunction indicator light is not illuminated for that code.
    (4) Separate status codes, or readiness codes, shall be stored in 
computer memory to identify correctly functioning emission control 
systems and those emission control systems which require further vehicle 
operation to complete proper diagnostic evaluation. A readiness code 
need not be stored for those monitors that can be considered 
continuously operating monitors (e.g., misfire monitor, fuel system 
monitor, etc.). Readiness codes should never be set to ``not ready'' 
status upon key-on or key-off; intentional setting of readiness codes to 
``not ready'' status via service procedures must apply to all such 
codes, rather than applying to individual codes. Subject to 
Administrator approval, if monitoring is disabled for a multiple number 
of driving cycles (i.e., more than one) due to the continued presence of 
extreme operating conditions (e.g., ambient temperatures below 40 deg.F, 
or altitudes above 8000 feet), readiness for the subject monitoring 
system may be set to ``ready'' status without monitoring having been 
completed. Administrator approval shall be based on the conditions for 
monitoring system disablement, and the number of driving cycles 
specified without completion of monitoring before readiness is 
indicated.
    (f) Available diagnostic data. (1) Upon determination of the first 
malfunction of any component or system, ``freeze frame'' engine 
conditions present at the time shall be stored in computer memory. 
Should a subsequent fuel system or misfire malfunction occur, any 
previously stored freeze frame conditions shall be replaced by the fuel 
system or misfire conditions (whichever occurs first). Stored engine 
conditions shall include, but are not limited to: engine speed, open or 
closed loop operation, fuel system commands, coolant temperature, 
calculated load value, fuel pressure, vehicle speed, air flow rate, and 
intake manifold pressure if the information needed to determine these 
conditions is available to the computer. For freeze frame storage, the 
manufacturer shall include the most appropriate set of conditions to 
facilitate effective repairs. If the diagnostic trouble code causing the 
conditions to be stored is erased in accordance with paragraph (d) of 
this section, the stored engine conditions may also be erased.
    (2) The following data in addition to the required freeze frame 
information shall be made available on demand through the serial port on 
the standardized data link connector, if the information is available to 
the on-board computer or can be determined using information available 
to the on-board computer: Diagnostic trouble codes, engine coolant 
temperature, fuel control system status (closed loop, open loop, other), 
fuel trim, ignition timing advance, intake air temperature, manifold air 
pressure, air flow rate, engine RPM, throttle position sensor output 
value, secondary air status (upstream, downstream, or atmosphere), 
calculated load value, vehicle speed, and fuel pressure. The signals 
shall be provided in standard units based on SAE specifications 
incorporated by reference in paragraph (h) of this section. Actual 
signals shall be clearly identified separately from default value or 
limp home signals.
    (3) For all emission control systems for which specific on-board 
evaluation tests are conducted (catalyst, oxygen sensor, etc.), the 
results of the most recent test performed by the vehicle, and the limits 
to which the system is compared shall be available through the 
standardized data link connector per SAE J1979 specifications as 
incorporated by reference in paragraph (h) of this section.
    (4) Access to the data required to be made available under this 
section shall be unrestricted and shall not require any access codes or 
devices that are only available from the manufacturer.
    (g) The emission control diagnostic system is not required to 
evaluate systems or components during malfunction conditions if such 
evaluation would result in a risk to safety or failure of systems or 
components. Additionally, the diagnostic system is not

[[Page 433]]

required to evaluate systems or components during operation of a power 
take-off unit such as a dump bed, snow plow blade, or aerial bucket, 
etc.
    (h) Incorporation by reference materials. The emission control 
diagnostic system shall provide for standardized access and conform with 
the following Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) standards and/or the 
following International Standards Organization (ISO) standards. The 
following documents are incorporated by reference. This incorporation by 
reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in 
accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be 
inspected at Docket No. A-90-35 at EPA's Air docket (LE-131), room 1500 
M, 1st Floor, Waterside Mall, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC, or at the 
Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 
700, Washington, DC.
    (1) SAE material. Copies of these materials may be obtained from the 
Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc., 400 Commonwealth Drive, 
Warrendale, PA 15096-0001.
    (i) SAE J1850 ``Class B Data Communication Network Interface,'' 
(July 1995) shall be used as the on-board to off-board communications 
protocol. All emission related messages sent to the scan tool over a 
J1850 data link shall use the Cyclic Redundancy Check and the three byte 
header, and shall not use inter-byte separation or checksums.
    (ii) Basic diagnostic data (as specified in Secs. 86.094-17(e) and 
(f)) shall be provided in the format and units in SAE J1979 July 1996 E/
E Diagnostic Test Modes.''
    (iii) Diagnostic trouble codes shall be consistent with SAE J2012 
July 1996 ``Recommended Practices for Diagnostic Trouble Code 
Definitions.''
    (iv) The connection interface between the OBD system and test 
equipment and diagnostic tools shall meet the functional requirements of 
SAE J1962 January 1995 ``Diagnostic Connector.''
    (2) ISO materials. Copies of these materials may be obtained from 
the International Organization for Standardization, Case Postale 56, CH-
1211 Geneva 20, Switzerland.
    (i) ISO 9141-2 February 1994 ``Road vehicles--Diagnostic systems--
Part 2: CARB requirements for interchange of digital information,'' may 
be used as an alternative to SAE J1850 as the on-board to off-board 
communications protocol.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (i) Deficiencies and alternate fueled vehicles. Upon application by 
the manufacturer, the Administrator may accept an OBD system as 
compliant even though specific requirements are not fully met. Such 
compliances without meeting specific requirements, or deficiencies, will 
be granted only if compliance would be infeasible or unreasonable 
considering such factors as, but not limited to, technical feasibility 
of the given monitor, lead time and production cycles including phase-in 
or phase-out of engines or vehicle designs and programmed upgrades of 
computers, and if any unmet requirements are not carried over from the 
previous model year except where unreasonable hardware or software 
modifications would be necessary to correct the non-compliance, and the 
manufacturer has demonstrated an acceptable level of effort toward 
compliance as determined by the Administrator. Furthermore, EPA will not 
accept any deficiency requests that include the complete lack of a major 
diagnostic monitor (``major'' diagnostic monitors being those for the 
catalyst, oxygen sensor, engine misfire, and evaporative leaks), with 
the possible exception of the special provisions for alternate fueled 
vehicles. For alternate fueled vehicles (e.g. natural gas, liquefied 
petroleum gas, methanol, ethanol), beginning with the model year for 
which alternate fuel emission standards are applicable and extending 
through the 2004 model year, manufacturers may request the Administrator 
to waive specific monitoring requirements of this section for which 
monitoring may not be reliable with respect to the use of the alternate 
fuel. At a minimum, alternate fuel vehicles shall be equipped with an 
OBD system meeting OBD requirements to the extent feasible as approved 
by the Administrator.
    (j) Demonstration of compliance with California OBD II requirements 
(Title

[[Page 434]]

13 California Code Sec. 1968.1), as modified pursuant to California Mail 
Out <greek-i>97-24 (December 9, 1997), shall satisfy the requirements of 
this section, except that compliance with Title 13 California Code Secs. 
1968.1(b)(4.2.2), pertaining to evaporative leak detection, and 
1968.1(d), pertaining to tampering protection, are not required to 
satisfy the requirements of this section, and the deficiency fine 
provisions of 1968.1(m)(6.1) and (6.2) shall not apply.
    (k) For engine families required to have an emission control 
diagnostic system (an OBD system), certification will not be granted if, 
for any test vehicle approved by the Administrator in consultation with 
the manufacturer, the malfunction indicator light does not illuminate 
under any of the following circumstances, unless the manufacturer can 
demonstrate that any identified OBD problems discovered during the 
Administrator's evaluation will be corrected on production vehicles. 
Only paragraphs (k)(5) and (k)(6) of this section apply to diesel cycle 
vehicles and diesel cycle trucks where such vehicles and trucks are so 
equipped.
    (1) A catalyst is replaced with a deteriorated or defective 
catalyst, or an electronic simulation of such, resulting in an increase 
of 1.5 times the NMHC standard above the NMHC emission level measured 
using a representative 4000 mile catalyst system.
    (2) An engine misfire condition is induced resulting in exhaust 
emissions exceeding 1.5 times the applicable standards for NMHC, CO or 
NO<INF>X</INF>.
    (3) Any oxygen sensor is replaced with a deteriorated or defective 
oxygen sensor, or an electronic simulation of such, resulting in exhaust 
emissions exceeding 1.5 times the applicable standard for NMHC, CO or 
NO<INF>X</INF>.
    (4) A vapor leak is introduced in the evaporative and/or refueling 
system (excluding the tubing and connections between the purge valve and 
the intake manifold) greater than or equal in magnitude to a leak caused 
by a 0.040 inch diameter orifice, or the evaporative purge air flow is 
blocked or otherwise eliminated from the complete evaporative emission 
control system.
    (5) A malfunction condition is induced in any emission-related 
powertrain system or component, including but not necessarily limited 
to, the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system, if equipped, the 
secondary air system, if equipped, and the fuel control system, 
singularly resulting in exhaust emissions exceeding 1.5 times the 
applicable emission standard for NMHC, CO or NO<INF>X</INF>.
    (6) A malfunction condition is induced in an electronic emission-
related powertrain system or component not otherwise described above 
that either provides input to or receives commands from the on-board 
computer resulting in a measurable impact on emissions.

<R05>
Sec. 86.1806-05  On-board diagnostics.

    (a) General. (1) Except as provided by paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, all light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks and complete heavy-
duty vehicles weighing 14,000 pounds GVWR or less (including MDPVs) must 
be equipped with an onboard diagnostic (OBD) system capable of 
monitoring all emission-related powertrain systems or components during 
the applicable useful life of the vehicle. All systems and components 
required to be monitored by these regulations must be evaluated 
periodically, but no less frequently than once per applicable 
certification test cycle as defined in paragraphs (a) and (d) of 
Appendix I of this part, or similar trip as approved by the 
Administrator.
    (2) Diesel fueled MDPVs and heavy-duty vehicles weighing 14,000 
pounds GVWR or less that are not MDPVs must meet the OBD requirements of 
this section according to the phase-in

[[Page 436]]

schedule in paragraph (l) of this section. Paragraph (l) of this section 
does not apply to Otto-cycle MDPVs.
    (3) An OBD system demonstrated to fully meet the requirements in 
Sec. 86.004-17 may be used to meet the requirements of this section, 
provided that such an OBD system also incorporates appropriate 
transmission diagnostics as may be required under this section, and 
provided that the Administrator finds that a manufacturer's decision to 
use the flexibility in this paragraph (a)(3) is based on good 
engineering judgement.
    (b) Malfunction descriptions. The OBD system must detect and 
identify malfunctions in all monitored emission-related powertrain 
systems or components according to the following malfunction definitions 
as measured and calculated in accordance with test procedures set forth 
in subpart B of this part (chassis-based test procedures), excluding 
those test procedures defined as ``Supplemental'' test procedures in 
Sec. 86.004-2 and codified in Secs. 86.158, 86.159, and 86.160.
    (1) Catalysts and particulate traps. (i) Otto-cycle. Catalyst 
deterioration or malfunction before it results in an increase in NMHC 
emissions 1.5 times the NMHC standard or FEL, as compared to the NMHC 
emission level measured using a representative 4000 mile catalyst 
system.
    (ii) Diesel. (A) If equipped, catalyst deterioration or malfunction 
before it results in exhaust emissions exceeding 1.5 times the 
applicable standard or FEL for NO<INF>X</INF> or PM. This requirement 
applies only to reduction catalysts; monitoring of oxidation catalysts 
is not required. This monitoring need not be done if the manufacturer 
can demonstrate that deterioration or malfunction of the system will not 
result in exceedance of the threshold.
    (B) If equipped with a particulate trap, catastrophic failure of the 
device must be detected. Any particulate trap whose complete failure 
results in exhaust emissions exceeding 1.5 times the applicable standard 
or FEL for NO<INF>X</INF> or PM must be monitored for such catastrophic 
failure. This monitoring need not be done if the manufacturer can 
demonstrate that a catastrophic failure of the system will not result in 
exceedance of the threshold.
    (2) Engine misfire. (i) Otto-cycle. Engine misfire resulting in 
exhaust emissions exceeding 1.5 times the applicable standard or FEL for 
NMHC, CO or NO<INF>X</INF>; and any misfire capable of damaging the 
catalytic converter.
    (ii) Diesel. Lack of cylinder combustion must be detected.
    (3) Oxygen sensors. If equipped, oxygen sensor deterioration or 
malfunction resulting in exhaust emissions exceeding 1.5 times the 
applicable standard or FEL for NMHC, CO or NO<INF>X</INF>.
    (4) Evaporative leaks. If equipped, any vapor leak in the 
evaporative and/or refueling system (excluding the tubing and 
connections between the purge valve and the intake manifold) greater 
than or equal in magnitude to a leak caused by a 0.040 inch diameter 
orifice; an absence of evaporative purge air flow from the complete 
evaporative emission control system. On vehicles with fuel tank capacity 
greater than 25 gallons, the Administrator may, following a request from 
the manufacturer, revise the size of the orifice to the smallest orifice 
feasible, based on test data, if the most reliable monitoring method 
available cannot reliably detect a system leak equal to a 0.040 inch 
diameter orifice.
    (5) Other emission control systems. Any deterioration or malfunction 
occurring in a powertrain system or component directly intended to 
control emissions, including but not necessarily limited to, the exhaust 
gas recirculation (EGR) system, if equipped, the secondary air system, 
if equipped, and the fuel control system, singularly resulting in 
exhaust emissions exceeding 1.5 times the applicable emission standard 
or FEL for NMHC, CO, NO<INF>X</INF>, or diesel PM. For vehicles equipped 
with a secondary air system, a functional check, as described in 
paragraph (b)(6) of this section, may satisfy the requirements of this 
paragraph provided the manufacturer can demonstrate that deterioration 
of the flow distribution system is unlikely. This demonstration is 
subject to Administrator approval and, if the demonstration and 
associated functional check are approved, the diagnostic system must 
indicate a malfunction when some degree of secondary

[[Page 437]]

airflow is not detectable in the exhaust system during the check. For 
vehicles equipped with positive crankcase ventilation (PCV), monitoring 
of the PCV system is not necessary provided the manufacturer can 
demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that the PCV system is 
unlikely to fail.
    (6) Other emission-related powertrain components. Any other 
deterioration or malfunction occurring in an electronic emission-related 
powertrain system or component not otherwise described in paragraphs 
(b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section that either provides input to or 
receives commands from the on-board computer and has a measurable impact 
on emissions; monitoring of components required by this paragraph (b)(6) 
must be satisfied by employing electrical circuit continuity checks and 
rationality checks for computer input components (input values within 
manufacturer specified ranges based on other available operating 
parameters), and functionality checks for computer output components 
(proper functional response to computer commands) except that the 
Administrator may waive such a rationality or functionality check where 
the manufacturer has demonstrated infeasibility. Malfunctions are 
defined as a failure of the system or component to meet the electrical 
circuit continuity checks or the rationality or functionality checks.
    (7) Performance of OBD functions. Oxygen sensor or any other 
component deterioration or malfunction which renders that sensor or 
component incapable of performing its function as part of the OBD system 
must be detected and identified on vehicles so equipped.
    (8) Hybrid electric vehicles. For Tier 2 and interim non-Tier 2 
hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) only. Unless added to HEVs in compliance 
with other requirements of this section, or unless otherwise approved by 
the Administrator:
    (i) The manufacturer must equip each HEV with a maintenance 
indicator consisting of a light that must activate automatically by 
illuminating the first time the minimum performance level is observed 
for each battery system component. Possible battery system components 
requiring monitoring are: battery water level, temperature control, 
pressure control, and other parameters critical for determining battery 
condition.
    (ii) The manufacturer must equip ``off-vehicle charge capable HEVs'' 
with a useful life indicator for the battery system consisting of a 
light that must illuminate the first time the battery system is unable 
to achieve an all-electric operating range (starting from a full state-
of-charge) which is at least 75 percent of the range determined for the 
vehicle in the Urban Driving Schedule portion of the All-Electric Range 
Test (see the California Exhaust Emission Standards and Test Procedures 
for 2003 and Subsequent Model Zero-Emission Vehicles, and 2001 and 
Subsequent Model Hybrid Electric Vehicles, in the Passenger Car, Light-
Duty Truck and Medium-Duty Vehicle Classes. These requirements are 
incorporated by reference (see Sec. 86.1).
    (iii) The manufacturer must equip each HEV with a separate odometer 
or other device subject to the approval of the Administrator that can 
accurately measure the mileage accumulation on the engines used in these 
vehicles.
    (c) Malfunction indicator light (MIL). The OBD system must 
incorporate a malfunction indicator light (MIL) readily visible to the 
vehicle operator. When illuminated, the MIL must display ``Check 
Engine,'' ``Service Engine Soon,'' a universally recognizable engine 
symbol, or a similar phrase or symbol approved by the Administrator. A 
vehicle should not be equipped with more than one general purpose 
malfunction indicator light for emission-related problems; separate 
specific purpose warning lights (e.g. brake system, fasten seat belt, 
oil pressure, etc.) are permitted. The use of red for the OBD-related 
malfunction indicator light is prohibited.
    (d) MIL illumination. (1) The MIL must illuminate and remain 
illuminated when any of the conditions specified in paragraph (b) of 
this section are detected and verified, or whenever the engine control 
enters a default or secondary mode of operation considered abnormal for 
the given engine operating conditions. The MIL must blink once per 
second under any period of operation during which engine misfire is

[[Page 438]]

occurring and catalyst damage is imminent. If such misfire is detected 
again during the following driving cycle (i.e., operation consisting of, 
at a minimum, engine start-up and engine shut-off) or the next driving 
cycle in which similar conditions are encountered, the MIL must maintain 
a steady illumination when the misfire is not occurring and then remain 
illuminated until the MIL extinguishing criteria of this section are 
satisfied. The MIL must also illuminate when the vehicle's ignition is 
in the ``key-on'' position before engine starting or cranking and 
extinguish after engine starting if no malfunction has previously been 
detected. If a fuel system or engine misfire malfunction has previously 
been detected, the MIL may be extinguished if the malfunction does not 
reoccur during three subsequent sequential trips during which similar 
conditions are encountered and no new malfunctions have been detected. 
Similar conditions are defined as engine speed within 375 rpm, engine 
load within 20 percent, and engine warm-up status equivalent to that 
under which the malfunction was first detected. If any malfunction other 
than a fuel system or engine misfire malfunction has been detected, the 
MIL may be extinguished if the malfunction does not reoccur during three 
subsequent sequential trips during which the monitoring system 
responsible for illuminating the MIL functions without detecting the 
malfunction, and no new malfunctions have been detected. Upon 
Administrator approval, statistical MIL illumination protocols may be 
employed, provided they result in comparable timeliness in detecting a 
malfunction and evaluating system performance, i.e., three to six 
driving cycles would be considered acceptable.
    (2)(i) For interim non-Tier 2 and Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs and HLDT/MDPVs, 
vehicles produced through the 2007 model year, upon a manufacturer's 
written request, EPA will consider allowing the use of an on-board 
diagnostic system during the certification process, that functions 
properly on low-sulfur gasoline, but indicates sulfur-induced passes 
when exposed to high sulfur gasoline.
    (ii) For interim non-Tier 2 and Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs and HLDT/MDPVs, if 
vehicles produced through the 2007 model year exhibit illuminations of 
the emission control diagnostic system malfunction indicator light due 
to high sulfur gasoline, EPA will consider, upon a manufacturer's 
written request, allowing modifications to such vehicles on a case-by-
case basis so as to eliminate the sulfur induced illumination.
    (e) Storing of computer codes. The OBD system shall record and store 
in computer memory diagnostic trouble codes and diagnostic readiness 
codes indicating the status of the emission control system. These codes 
shall be available through the standardized data link connector per 
specifications as referenced in paragraph (h) of this section.
    (1) A diagnostic trouble code must be stored for any detected and 
verified malfunction causing MIL illumination. The stored diagnostic 
trouble code must identify the malfunctioning system or component as 
uniquely as possible. At the manufacturer's discretion, a diagnostic 
trouble code may be stored for conditions not causing MIL illumination. 
Regardless, a separate code should be stored indicating the expected MIL 
illumination status (i.e., MIL commanded ``ON,'' MIL commanded ``OFF'').
    (2) For a single misfiring cylinder, the diagnostic trouble code(s) 
must uniquely identify the cylinder, unless the manufacturer submits 
data and/or engineering evaluations which adequately demonstrate that 
the misfiring cylinder cannot be reliably identified under certain 
operating conditions. For diesel vehicles only, the specific cylinder 
for which combustion cannot be detected need not be identified if new 
hardware would be required to do so. The diagnostic trouble code must 
identify multiple misfiring cylinder conditions; under multiple misfire 
conditions, the misfiring cylinders need not be uniquely identified if a 
distinct multiple misfire diagnostic trouble code is stored.
    (3) The diagnostic system may erase a diagnostic trouble code if the 
same code is not re-registered in at least 40

[[Page 439]]

engine warm-up cycles, and the malfunction indicator light is not 
illuminated for that code.
    (4) Separate status codes, or readiness codes, must be stored in 
computer memory to identify correctly functioning emission control 
systems and those emission control systems which require further vehicle 
operation to complete proper diagnostic evaluation. A readiness code 
need not be stored for those monitors that can be considered 
continuously operating monitors (e.g., misfire monitor, fuel system 
monitor, etc.). Readiness codes should never be set to ``not ready'' 
status upon key-on or key-off; intentional setting of readiness codes to 
``not ready'' status via service procedures must apply to all such 
codes, rather than applying to individual codes. Subject to 
Administrator approval, if monitoring is disabled for a multiple number 
of driving cycles (i.e., more than one) due to the continued presence of 
extreme operating conditions (e.g., ambient temperatures below 40 
deg.F, or altitudes above 8000 feet), readiness for the subject 
monitoring system may be set to ``ready'' status without monitoring 
having been completed. Administrator approval shall be based on the 
conditions for monitoring system disablement, and the number of driving 
cycles specified without completion of monitoring before readiness is 
indicated.
    (f) Available diagnostic data. (1) Upon determination of the first 
malfunction of any component or system, ``freeze frame'' engine 
conditions present at the time must be stored in computer memory. Should 
a subsequent fuel system or misfire malfunction occur, any previously 
stored freeze frame conditions must be replaced by the fuel system or 
misfire conditions (whichever occurs first). Stored engine conditions 
must include, but are not limited to: engine speed, open or closed loop 
operation, fuel system commands, coolant temperature, calculated load 
value, fuel pressure, vehicle speed, air flow rate, and intake manifold 
pressure if the information needed to determine these conditions is 
available to the computer. For freeze frame storage, the manufacturer 
must include the most appropriate set of conditions to facilitate 
effective repairs. If the diagnostic trouble code causing the conditions 
to be stored is erased in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, 
the stored engine conditions may also be erased.
    (2) The following data in addition to the required freeze frame 
information must be made available on demand through the serial port on 
the standardized data link connector, if the information is available to 
the on-board computer or can be determined using information available 
to the on-board computer: Diagnostic trouble codes, engine coolant 
temperature, fuel control system status (closed loop, open loop, other), 
fuel trim, ignition timing advance, intake air temperature, manifold air 
pressure, air flow rate, engine RPM, throttle position sensor output 
value, secondary air status (upstream, downstream, or atmosphere), 
calculated load value, vehicle speed, and fuel pressure. The signals 
must be provided in standard units based on SAE specifications 
incorporated by reference in paragraph (h) of this section. Actual 
signals must be clearly identified separately from default value or limp 
home signals.
    (3) For all OBD systems for which specific on-board evaluation tests 
are conducted (catalyst, oxygen sensor, etc.), the results of the most 
recent test performed by the vehicle, and the limits to which the system 
is compared must be available through the standardized data link 
connector per the appropriate standardized specifications as referenced 
in paragraph (h) of this section.
    (4) Access to the data required to be made available under this 
section shall be unrestricted and shall not require any access codes or 
devices that are only available from the manufacturer.
    (g) Exceptions. The OBD system is not required to evaluate systems 
or components during malfunction conditions if such evaluation would 
result in a risk to safety or failure of systems or components. 
Additionally, the OBD system is not required to evaluate systems or 
components during operation of a power take-off unit such as a dump bed, 
snow plow blade, or aerial bucket, etc.

[[Page 440]]

    (h) Reference materials. The OBD system shall provide for 
standardized access and conform with the following Society of Automotive 
Engineers (SAE) standards and/or the following International Standards 
Organization (ISO) standards. The following documents are incorporated 
by reference (see Sec. 86.1):
    (1) SAE material. Copies of these materials may be obtained from the 
Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc., 400 Commonwealth Drive, 
Warrendale, PA 15096-0001.
    (i) SAE J1850 ``Class B Data Communication Network Interface,'' 
(July 1995) shall be used as the on-board to off-board communications 
protocol. All emission related messages sent to the scan tool over a 
J1850 data link shall use the Cyclic Redundancy Check and the three byte 
header, and shall not use inter-byte separation or checksums.
    (ii) Basic diagnostic data (as specified in Secs. 86.094-17(e) and 
(f)) shall be provided in the format and units in SAE J1979 ``E/E 
Diagnostic Test Modes,''(July 1996).
    (iii) Diagnostic trouble codes shall be consistent with SAE J2012 
``Recommended Practices for Diagnostic Trouble Code Definitions,'' (July 
1996).
    (iv) The connection interface between the OBD system and test 
equipment and diagnostic tools shall meet the functional requirements of 
SAE J1962 ``Diagnostic Connector,'' (January 1995).
    (v) As an alternative to the above standards, heavy-duty vehicles 
may conform to the specifications of the SAE J1939 series of standards 
(SAE J1939-11, J1939-13, J1939-21, J1939-31, J1939-71, J1939-73, J1939-
81).
    (2) ISO materials. Copies of these materials may be obtained from 
the International Organization for Standardization, Case Postale 56, CH-
1211 Geneva 20, Switzerland.
    (i) ISO 9141-2 ``Road vehicles--Diagnostic systems--Part 2: CARB 
requirements for interchange of digital information,'' (February 1994) 
may be used as an alternative to SAE J1850 as the on-board to off-board 
communications protocol.
    (ii) ISO 14230-4 ``Road vehicles--Diagnostic systems--Keyword 
Protocol 2000--Part 4: Requirements for emission-related systems'' may 
also be used as an alternative to SAE J1850.
    (i) Deficiencies and alternate fueled vehicles. Upon application by 
the manufacturer, the Administrator may accept an OBD system as 
compliant even though specific requirements are not fully met. Such 
compliances without meeting specific requirements, or deficiencies, will 
be granted only if compliance would be infeasible or unreasonable 
considering such factors as, but not limited to: Technical feasibility 
of the given monitor and lead time and production cycles including 
phase-in or phase-out of engines or vehicle designs and programmed 
upgrades of computers. Unmet requirements should not be carried over 
from the previous model year except where unreasonable hardware or 
software modifications would be necessary to correct the deficiency, and 
the manufacturer has demonstrated an acceptable level of effort toward 
compliance as determined by the Administrator. Furthermore, EPA will not 
accept any deficiency requests that include the complete lack of a major 
diagnostic monitor (``major'' diagnostic monitors being those for 
exhaust aftertreatment devices, oxygen sensor, engine misfire, 
evaporative leaks, and diesel EGR, if equipped), with the possible 
exception of the special provisions for alternate fueled vehicles. For 
alternate fueled vehicles (e.g. natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, 
methanol, ethanol), beginning with the model year for which alternate 
fuel emission standards are applicable and extending through the 2004 
model year, manufacturers may request the Administrator to waive 
specific monitoring requirements of this section for which monitoring 
may not be reliable with respect to the use of the alternate fuel; 
manufacturers may request this alternate fuel waiver for heavy-duty 
vehicles through the 2006 model year. At a minimum, alternate fuel 
vehicles must be equipped with an OBD system meeting OBD requirements to 
the extent feasible as approved by the Administrator.
    (j) California OBDII compliance option. For light-duty vehicles, 
light-duty trucks, and heavy-duty vehicles at or

[[Page 441]]

below 14,000 pounds GVWR, demonstration of compliance with California 
OBD II requirements (Title 13 California Code section 1968.1), as 
modified pursuant to California Mail Out <greek-i>97-24 (December 9, 
1997), shall satisfy the requirements of this section, except that the 
exemption to the catalyst monitoring provisions of California Code 
section 1968.1(b)(1.1.2) for diesel vehicles does not apply, and 
compliance with California Code sections 1968.1(b)(4.2.2), pertaining to 
0.02 inch evaporative leak detection, and 1968.1(d), pertaining to 
tampering protection, are not required to satisfy the requirements of 
this section. Also, the deficiency fine provisions of California Code 
section 1968.1(m)(6.1) and (6.2) do not apply.
    (k) Certification. For test groups required to have an OBD system, 
certification will not be granted if, for any test vehicle approved by 
the Administrator in consultation with the manufacturer, the malfunction 
indicator light does not illuminate under any of the following 
circumstances, unless the manufacturer can demonstrate that any 
identified OBD problems discovered during the Administrator's evaluation 
will be corrected on production vehicles.
    (1)(i) Otto-cycle. A catalyst is replaced with a deteriorated or 
defective catalyst, or an electronic simulation of such, resulting in an 
increase of 1.5 times the NMHC standard or FEL above the NMHC emission 
level measured using a representative 4000 mile catalyst system.
    (ii) Diesel. (A) If monitored for emissions performance--a catalyst 
is replaced with a deteriorated or defective catalyst, or an electronic 
simulation of such, resulting in exhaust emissions exceeding 1.5 times 
the applicable standard or FEL for NO<INF>X</INF> or PM.
    (B) If monitored for performance--a particulate trap is replaced 
with a trap that has catastrophically failed, or an electronic 
simulation of such.
    (2)(i) Otto-cycle. An engine misfire condition is induced resulting 
in exhaust emissions exceeding 1.5 times the applicable standards or FEL 
for NMHC, CO or NO<INF>X</INF>.
    (ii) Diesel. An engine misfire condition is induced and is not 
detected.
    (3) If so equipped, any oxygen sensor is replaced with a 
deteriorated or defective oxygen sensor, or an electronic simulation of 
such, resulting in exhaust emissions exceeding 1.5 times the applicable 
standard or FEL for NMHC, CO or NO<INF>X</INF>.
    (4) If so equipped, a vapor leak is introduced in the evaporative 
and/or refueling system (excluding the tubing and connections between 
the purge valve and the intake manifold) greater than or equal in 
magnitude to a leak caused by a 0.040 inch diameter orifice, or the 
evaporative purge air flow is blocked or otherwise eliminated from the 
complete evaporative emission control system.
    (5) A malfunction condition is induced in any emission-related 
powertrain system or component, including but not necessarily limited 
to, the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system, if equipped, the 
secondary air system, if equipped, and the fuel control system, 
singularly resulting in exhaust emissions exceeding 1.5 times the 
applicable emission standard or FEL for NMHC, CO, NO<INF>X</INF> or PM.
    (6) A malfunction condition is induced in an electronic emission-
related powertrain system or component not otherwise described in this 
paragraph (k) that either provides input to or receives commands from 
the on-board computer resulting in a measurable impact on emissions.
    (l) Phase-in for complete heavy-duty vehicles. Complete heavy-duty 
vehicles weighing 14,000 pounds GVWR or less that are not Otto-cycle 
MDPVs must meet the OBD requirements of this section according to the 
following phase-in schedule, based on the percentage of projected 
vehicle sales. The 2004 model year requirements in the following phase-
in schedule are applicable only to heavy-duty Otto-cycle vehicles where 
the manufacturer has selected Otto-cycle Option 1 or 2 for alternative 
2003 or 2004 compliance according to Sec. 86.004-01(c)(1) or (2). The 
2005 through 2007 requirements in the following phase-in schedule apply 
to all heavy-duty vehicles weighing 14,000 pounds GVWR or less, 
excluding MDPVs. If the manufacturer has selected Otto-cycle Option 3 it 
may exempt 2005 model year

[[Page 442]]

complete heavy-duty engines and vehicles whose model year commences 
before July 31, 2004 from the requirements of this section. For the 
purposes of calculating compliance with the phase-in provisions of this 
paragraph (l), heavy-duty vehicles subject to the phase-in requirements 
of this section may be combined with heavy-duty vehicles subject to the 
phase-in requirements of paragraph Sec. 86.005-17 (k). The phase-in 
schedule follows:

maintenance the Administrator approves as being reasonable and 
necessary.
    (1) The maintenance instructions required by this section shall be 
in clear, and to the extent practicable, nontechnical language.
    (2) The maintenance instructions required by this section shall 
contain a general description of the documentation which the 
manufacturer will require from the ultimate purchaser or any subsequent 
purchaser as evidence of compliance with the instructions.
    (b) Instructions provided to purchasers under paragraph (a) of this 
section shall specify the performance of all scheduled maintenance 
performed by the manufacturer on certification durability vehicles and, 
in cases where the manufacturer performs less maintenance on

approved by the Administrator, from that approved under Sec. 86.1834-01.
    (d) Inspections of emission-related parts or systems with 
instructions to replace, repair, clean, or adjust the parts or systems 
if necessary, are not considered to be items of scheduled maintenance 
which insure the proper functioning of the emission control system. Such 
inspections, and any recommended maintenance beyond that approved by the 
Administrator as reasonable and necessary under paragraphs (a), (b), and 
(c) of this section, may be included in the written instructions 
furnished to vehicle owners under paragraph (a) of this section, 
provided that such instructions clearly state, in a form approved by the 
Administrator, that the owner need not perform such inspections or 
recommended maintenance in order to maintain the emission warranty or 
manufacturer recall liability.
    (e) If the vehicle has been granted an alternative useful life 
period under the provisions of Sec. 86.1805-01(c), the manufacturer may 
choose to include in such instructions an explanation of the distinction 
between the alternative useful life specified on the label, and the 
emissions defect and emissions performance warranty period. The 
explanation must clearly state that the useful life period specified on 
the label represents the average period of use up to retirement or 
rebuild for the test group represented by the engine used in the 
vehicle. An explanation of how the actual useful lives of engines used 
in various applications are expected to differ from the average useful 
life may be included. The explanation(s) shall be in clear, non-
technical language that is understandable to the ultimate purchaser.
    (f) Emission control diagnostic service information:
    (1) Manufacturers shall furnish or cause to be furnished to any

    (ii) Definitions. The following definitions apply for this paragraph 
(f):
    (A) Aftermarket service provider means any individual or business 
engaged in the diagnosis, service, and repair of a motor vehicle or 
engine, who is not directly affiliated with a manufacturer or 
manufacturer-franchised dealership.
    (B) Bi-directional control means the capability of a diagnostic tool 
to send messages on the data bus that temporarily overrides the module's 
control over a sensor or actuator and gives control to the diagnostic 
tool operator. Bi-directional controls do not create permanent changes 
to engine or component calibrations.
    (C) Data stream information means information (i.e., messages and 
parameters) originated within the vehicle by a module or intelligent 
sensors (i.e., a sensor that contains and is controlled by its own 
module) and transmitted between a network of modules and/or intelligent 
sensors connected in parallel with either one or more communication 
wires. The information is broadcast over the communication wires for use 
by the OBD system to gather information on emissions-related components 
or systems and from other vehicle modules that may impact emissions, 
including but not limited to systems such as chassis or transmission. 
For the purposes of this section, data stream information does not 
include engine calibration related information, or any data stream 
information from systems or modules that do not impact emissions.
    (D) Emissions-related information means any information related to 
the diagnosis, service, and repair of emissions-related components. 
Emissions-related information includes, but is not limited to, 
information regarding any system, component or part of a vehicle that 
controls emissions and any system, component and/or part associated with 
the powertrain system, including, but not limited to:
    (1) The engine, the fuel system and ignition system;
    (2) Information for any system, component or part that is likely to 
impact emissions, such as transmission systems, and any other 
information specified by the Administrator to be relevant to the 
diagnosis and repair of an emissions-related problem; and

[[Page 449]]

    (3) Any other information specified by the Administrator to be 
relevant for the diagnosis and repair of an emissions-related failure 
found through the inspection and maintenance program after such finding 
has been communicated to the affected manufacturer(s).
    (E) Emissions-related training information means any information 
related to training or instruction for the purpose of the diagnosis, 
service, and repair of emissions-related components.
    (F) Enhanced service and repair information means information which 
is specific for an original equipment manufacturer's brand of tools and 
equipment. This includes computer or anti-theft system initialization 
information necessary for the completion of any emissions-related repair 
on motor vehicles that employ integral vehicle security systems.
    (G) Equipment and tool company means a registered automotive 
equipment or software company either public or private that is engaged 
in, or plans to engage in, the manufacture of automotive scan tool 
reprogramming equipment or software.
    (H) Generic service and repair information means information which 
is not specific for an original equipment manufacturer's brand of tools 
and equipment.
    (I) Indirect information means any information that is not 
specifically contained in the service literature, but is contained in 
items such as tools or equipment provided to franchised dealers (or 
others). This includes computer or anti-theft system initialization 
information necessary for the completion of any emissions-related repair 
on motor vehicles that employ integral vehicle security systems.
    (J) Intermediary means any individual or entity, other than an 
original equipment manufacturer, which provides service or equipment to 
aftermarket service providers.
    (K) Manufacturer-franchised dealership means any service provider 
with which a manufacturer has a direct business relationship.
    (L) Third-party information provider means any individual or entity,

    (M) Third-party training provider means any individual or entity, 
other than an original equipment manufacturer who develops and/or 
delivers instructional and educational material for automotive training 
courses.
    (3) Information dissemination. By December 24, 2003, each 
manufacturer shall provide or cause to be provided to the persons 
specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section and to any other 
interested parties a manufacturer-specific World Wide Web site 
containing the information specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this 
section for 2001 and later model year vehicles which have been offered 
for sale; this requirement does not apply to indirect information, 
including the information specified in paragraphs (f)(12) through 
(f)(16) of this section. Upon request and approval of the Administrator, 
manufacturers who can demonstrate significant hardship in complying with 
this provision within four months after the effective date may request 
an additional six months lead time to meet this requirement. Each 
manufacturer Web site shall:
    (i) Provide access in full-text to all of the information specified 
in paragraph (f)(5) of this section.
    (ii) Be updated at the same time as manufacturer-franchised 
dealership World Wide Web sites;
    (iii) Provide users with a description of the minimum computer 
hardware and software needed by the user to access that manufacturer's

software). This description shall appear when users first log-on to the 
home page of the manufacturer's Web site.
    (iv) Provide Short-Term (24 to 72 hours), Mid-Term (30-day period), 
and Long-Term (365-day period) Web site subscription options to any 
person specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section whereby the user 
will be able to access the site, search for the information, and 
purchase, view and print the information at a fair and reasonable cost 
as specified in paragraph (f)(7) of this section for each of the 
options. In addition, for each of the subscription options, 
manufacturers are required to make their entire site accessible for the 
respective period of time and price. In other words, a manufacturer may 
not limit any or all of the subscription options to just one make or one 
model.
    (v) Allow the user to search the manufacturer Web site by various 
topics including but not limited to model, model year, key words or 
phrases, etc., while allowing ready identification of the latest vehicle 
calibration. Manufacturers who do not use model year to classify their 
vehicles in their service information may use an alternate vehicle 
delineation such as body series. Any manufacturer utilizing this 
flexibility shall create a cross-reference to the corresponding model 
year and provide this cross-reference on the manufacturer Web site home 
page.
    (vi) Provide accessibility using common, readily available software 
and shall not require the use of software, hardware, viewers, or 
browsers that are not readily available to the general public. 
Manufacturers shall also provide hyperlinks to any plug-ins, viewers or 
browsers (e.g. Adobe Acrobat or Netscape) needed to access the 
manufacturer Web site.
    (vii) Allow simple hyper-linking to the manufacturer Web site from 
government Web sites and automotive-related Web sites.

the modem speed by which aftermarket service providers or other 
interested parties can connect to the manufacturer Web site.
    (ix) Possess sufficient server capacity to allow ready access by all 
users and have sufficient capacity to assure that all users may obtain 
needed information without undue delay.
    (x) Correct or delete broken Web links on a weekly basis.
    (xi) Allow for Web site navigation that does not require a user to 
return to the manufacturer home page or a search engine in order to 
access a different portion of the site.
    (xii) Allow all users to print out any and all of the materials 
required to be made available on the manufacturers Web site, including 
the ability to print it at the users location.
    (4) Small volume provisions for information dissemination. (i) 
Manufacturers with annual sales of less than 5,000 vehicles shall have 
until June 28, 2004 to launch their individual Web sites as required by 
paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
    (ii) Manufacturers with annual sales of less than 1,000 vehicles 
may, in lieu of meeting the requirement of paragraph (f)(3) of this 
section, request the Administrator to approve an alternative method by 
which the required emissions-related information can be obtained by the 
persons specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section.
    (5) Required information. All information relevant to the diagnosis 
and completion of emissions-related repairs shall be posted on 
manufacturer Web sites. This excludes indirect information specified in 
paragraphs (f)(6) and (f)(12) through (f)(16) of this section. To the 
extent that this information does not already exist in some form for 
their manufacturer-franchised dealerships, manufacturers are required to 
develop and make available the information required by this section to 
both their manufacturer-franchised dealerships and the aftermarket. The 
required information includes, but is not limited to:
    (i) Manuals, including subsystem and component manuals developed by 
a manufacturer's third party supplier that are made available to 
manufacturer-franchised dealerships, technical service bulletins (TSBs), 
recall service information, diagrams, charts, and training materials. 
Manuals and other such service information from third party suppliers 
are not required to be made available in full-text on manufacturer Web 
sites as described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section. Rather, 
manufacturers must make available on the manufacturer Web site as 
required by paragraph (f)(3) of this section an index of the relevant 
information and instructions on how to order such third party 
information. In the alternative, a manufacturer can create a link from 
its Web site to the Web site(s) of the third party supplier.
    (ii) OBD system information which includes, but is not limited to, 
the following:
    (A) A general description of the operation of each monitor, 
including a description of the parameter that is being monitored;
    (B) A listing of all typical OBD diagnostic trouble codes associated 
with each monitor;
    (C) A description of the typical enabling conditions (either generic 
or monitor-specific) for each monitor (if equipped) to execute during 
vehicle operation, including, but not limited to, minimum and maximum 
intake air and engine coolant temperature, vehicle speed range, and time 
after engine startup. In addition, manufacturers shall list all monitor-
specific OBD drive cycle information for all major OBD monitors as 
equipped including, but not limited to, catalyst, catalyst heater, 
oxygen sensor, oxygen sensor heater, evaporative system, exhaust gas re-
circulation (EGR), secondary air, and air conditioning system. 
Additionally, for diesel vehicles under 14,000 pounds GVWR which also 
perform misfire, fuel system and comprehensive component monitoring 
under specific driving conditions (i.e., non-continuous monitoring; as 
opposed to spark ignition engines that monitor these systems under all 
conditions or continuous monitoring), the manufacturer shall make 
available monitor-specific drive cycles. Any manufacturer who develops 
generic drive cycles, either in addition to, or instead of, monitor-
specific drive cycles shall also make these available in full-text on 
manufacturer Web sites;
    (D) A listing of each monitor sequence, execution frequency and 
typical duration;
    (E) A listing of typical malfunction thresholds for each monitor;
    (F) For OBD parameters for specific vehicles that deviate from the 
typical parameters, the OBD description shall indicate the deviation and 
provide a separate listing of the typical values for those vehicles;
    (G) Identification and scaling information necessary to interpret 
and understand data available to a generic scan tool through ``mode 6'', 
pursuant to Society of Automotive Engineers SAE J1979, ``EE Diagnostic 
Test Modes''(Incorporated by reference, see Sec. 86.1).
    (H) Algorithms, look-up tables, or any values associated with look-
up tables are not required to be made available.
    (iii) Any information regarding any system, component, or part of a 
vehicle monitored by the OBD system that could in a failure mode cause 
the OBD system to illuminate the malfunction indicator light (MIL);
    (iv) Any information on other systems that can effect the emission 
system within a multiplexed system (including how information is sent 
between emission-related system

[[Page 451]]

modules and other modules on a multiplexed bus);
    (v) Manufacturer-specific emissions-related diagnostic trouble codes 
(DTCs) and any related service bulletins, trouble shooting guides, and/
or repair procedures associated with these manufacturer-specific DTCs; 
and
    (vi) Information regarding how to obtain the information needed to 
perform reinitialization of any vehicle computer or anti-theft system 
following an emissions-related repair.
    (6) Anti-theft system initialization information. Computer or anti-
theft system initialization information and/or related tools necessary 
for the proper installation of on-board computers or necessary for the 
completion of any emissions-related repair on motor vehicles that employ 
integral vehicle security systems or the repair or replacement of any 
other emission-related part shall be made available at a fair and 
reasonable cost to the persons specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this 
section.
    (i) Except as provided under paragraph (f)(6)(ii) of this section, 
manufacturers must make this information available to persons specified 
in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, such that such persons will not 
need any special tools or manufacturer-specific scan tools to perform 
the initialization. Manufacturers may make such information available 
through, for example, generic aftermarket tools, a pass-through device, 
or inexpensive manufacturer specific cables.
    (ii) A manufacturer may request Administrator approval for an 
alternative means to re-initialize vehicles for some or all model year 
vehicles through the 2007 model year by 1 month following the effective 
date of the final rule. The Administrator shall approve the request only 
after the following conditions have been met:
    (A) The manufacturer must demonstrate that the availability of such 
information to aftermarket service providers would significantly 
increase the risk of vehicle theft.
    (B) The manufacturer must make available a reasonable alternative 
means to install or repair computers, or to otherwise repair or replace 
an emission-related part.
    (C) Any alternative means proposed by a manufacturer cannot require 
aftermarket technicians to use a manufacturer-franchised dealership to 
obtain information or special tools to re-initialize the anti-theft 
system. All information must come directly from the manufacturer or a 
single manufacturer-specified designee.
    (D) Any alternative means proposed by and manufacturer must be 
available to aftermarket technicians at a fair and reasonable price.
    (E) Any alternative must be available to aftermarket technicians 
within twenty-four hours of the initial request.
    (F) Any alternative must not require the purchase of a special tool 
or tools, including manufacturer-specific tools, to complete this 
repair. Alternatives may include lease of such tools, but only for 
appropriately minimal cost.
    (G) In lieu of leasing their manufacturer-specific tool to meet this 
requirement, a manufacturer may also release the necessary information 
to equipment and tool manufacturers for incorporation into aftermarket 
scan tools. Any manufacturer choosing this option must release the 
information to equipment and tool manufacturers within 60 days of 
Administrator approval. Manufacturers may also comply with this 
requirement using SAE J2534 for some or all model years through model 
year 2007.
    (7) Cost of required information. (i) All information required to be 
made available by this section, shall be made available at a fair and 
reasonable price. In determining whether a price is fair and reasonable, 
consideration may be given to relevant factors, including, but not 
limited to, the following:
    (A) The net cost to the manufacturer-franchised dealerships for 
similar information obtained from manufacturers, less any discounts, 
rebates, or other incentive programs.
    (B) The cost to the manufacturer for preparing and distributing the 
information, excluding any research and development costs incurred in 
designing and implementing, upgrading or altering the onboard computer 
and its software or any other vehicle part or component. Amortized 
capital costs for the preparation and distribution of the information 
may be included.
    (C) The price charged by other manufacturers for similar 
information.
    (D) The price charged by manufacturers for similar information prior 
to the launch of manufacturer Web sites.
    (E) The ability of aftermarket technicians or shops to afford the 
information.
    (F) The means by which the information is distributed.
    (G) The extent to which the information is used, which includes the 
number of users, and frequency, duration, and volume of use.
    (H) Inflation.
    (ii) By August 26, 2003, each manufacturer shall submit to the 
Administrator a request for approval of their pricing structure for 
their Web sites and amounts to be charged for the information required 
to be made available under paragraphs (f)(3) and (f)(5) of this section. 
Subsequent to the approval of the manufacturer Web site pricing 
structure, each manufacturer shall notify the Administrator upon the 
increase in price of any one or all of the subscription options of 20 
percent or more above the previously approved price, taking inflation 
into account.
    (A) The manufacturer shall submit a request to the Administrator 
that sets forth a detailed description of the pricing structure

[[Page 452]]

and amounts, and support for the position that the pricing structure and 
amounts are fair and reasonable by addressing, at a minimum, each of the 
factors specified in paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section.
    (B) The Administrator will act upon on the request within 180 days 
following receipt of a complete request or following receipt of any 
additional information requested by the Administrator.
    (C) The Administrator may decide not to approve, or to withdraw 
approval for a manufacturer's pricing structure and amounts based on a 
conclusion that this pricing structure and/or amounts are not, or are no 
longer, fair and reasonable, by sending written notice to the 
manufacturer explaining the basis for this decision.
    (D) In the case of a decision by the Administrator not to approve or 
to withdraw approval, the manufacturer shall within three months 
following notice of this decision, obtain Administrator approval for a 
revised pricing structure and amounts by following the approval process 
described in this paragraph (f)(7)(ii).
    (8) Unavailable information. Any information which is not provided 
at a fair and reasonable price shall be considered unavailable, in 
violation of these regulations and section 202(m)(5) of the Clean Air 
Act.
    (9) Third-party information providers. By December 24, 2003, 
manufacturers shall, for model year 2004 and later vehicles and engines, 
make available to third-party information providers as defined in 
paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section with whom they engage in licensing 
or business arrangements;
    (i) The required emissions-related information as specified in 
paragraph (f)(5) of this section either:
    (A) Directly in electronic format such as diskette or CD-ROM using 
non-proprietary software, in English; or

(f)(9)(ii) of this section by making available diagnostic trouble trees 
on their manufacturer Web sites in full-text.
    (iv) Manufacturers are not responsible for the accuracy of the 
information distributed by third parties. However, where manufacturers 
charge information intermediaries for information, whether through 
licensing agreements or other arrangements, manufacturers are 
responsible for inaccuracies contained in the information they provide 
to third-party information providers.
    (10) Required emissions-related training information. By December 
24, 2003, for emissions-related training information, manufacturers 
shall:
    (i) Video tape or otherwise duplicate and make available for sale on 
manufacturer Web sites within 30 days after transmission any emissions-
related training courses provided to manufacturer-franchised dealerships 
via the Internet or satellite transmission;
    (ii) Provide on the manufacturer Web site an index of all emissions-
related training information available for purchase by aftermarket 
service providers for 1994 and newer vehicles. For model years 
subsequent to 2003, the required information must be made available for 
purchase within 3 months of model introduction and then must be made 
available at the same time it is made available to manufacturer-
franchised dealerships, whichever is earlier. The index shall describe 
the title of the course or instructional session, the cost of the video 
tape or duplicate, and information on how to order the item(s) from the 
manufacturer Web site. All of the items available must be shipped within 
24 hours of the order being placed and are to be made available at a 
fair and reasonable price as described in section (f)(7) of this 
section. Manufacturers unable to meet the 24 hour shipping requirement 
under circumstances where orders exceed supply and additional time is 
needed by the distributor to reproduce the item being ordered, may 
exceed the 24 hour shipping requirement, but in no instance can take 
longer than 14 days to ship the item.
    (iii) Provide access to third-party training providers as defined in 
paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section all emission-related training 
courses transmitted via satellite or Internet offered to their 
manufacturer-franchised dealerships. Manufacturers may not charge 
unreasonable up-front fees to third-party training providers for this 
access, but may require a royalty, percentage, or other arranged fee 
based on per-use enrollment/subscription basis. Manufacturers may take 
reasonable steps to protect any copyrighted information and are not 
required to provide this information to parties that do not agree to 
such steps.
    (11) Timeliness and maintenance of information dissemination. (i) 
General requirements. Subsequent to the initial launch of the 
manufacturer's Web site, manufacturers must make the information 
required under paragraph (f)(5) of this section available on their Web 
site within six months of model introduction, or at the same time it is 
made available to manufacturer-franchised dealerships, whichever is 
earlier. After this six-month period, the information must be available 
and updated on the manufacturer Web site at the same time that the 
updated

[[Page 453]]

information is made available to manufacturer-franchised dealerships, 
except as otherwise specified in this section.
    (ii) Archived information. Manufacturers must maintain the required 
information on their Web sites in full-text as defined in paragraph 
(f)(5) of this section for a minimum of 15 years after model 
introduction. Subsequent to this fifteen year period, manufacturers may 
archive the information in the manufacturer's format of choice and 
provide an index of the archived information on the manufacturer Web 
site and how it can be obtained by interested parties. Manufacturers 
shall index their available information with a title that adequately 
describes the contents of the document to which it refers. Manufacturers 
may allow for the ordering of information directly from their Web site, 
or from a Web site hyperlinked to the manufacturer Web site. In the 
alternative, manufacturers shall list a phone number and address where 
aftermarket service providers can call or write to obtain the desired 
information. Manufacturers must also provide the price of each item 
listed, as well as the price of items ordered on a subscription basis. 
To the extent that any additional information is added or changed for 
these model years, manufacturers shall update the index as appropriate. 
Manufacturers will be responsible for ensuring that all information, 
including information that is distributed through information 
distributors, is provided within one regular business day of receiving 
the order. Items that are less than 20 pages (e.g. technical service 
bulletins) shall be faxed, if requested, to the requestor and 
distributors are required to deliver the information overnight if 
requested and paid for by the ordering party. Archived information must 
be made available on demand and at a fair and reasonable price.
    (12) Reprogramming information. (i) Manufacturers shall make 
available to the persons specified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this 
section all emissions-related recalibration or reprogramming events 
(including driveability reprogramming events that may affect emissions) 
in the format of its choice at the same time they are made available to 
manufacturer-franchised dealerships. This requirement takes effect on 
September 25, 2003, and within 3 months of model introduction for all 
new model years.
    (ii) Manufacturers shall provide persons specified in paragraph 
(f)(2)(i) of this section with an efficient and cost-effective method 
for identifying whether the calibrations on vehicles are the latest to 
be issued. This requirement takes effect on September 25, 2003, and 
within 3 months of model introduction for all new model years.
    (iii) For all 2004 and later OBD vehicles equipped with 
reprogramming capability, manufacturers shall comply with SAE J2534 
(Incorporated by reference, see Sec. 86.1). Any manufacturer who cannot 
comply with SAE J2534 in model year 2004 may request one year additional 
lead time from the Administrator.
    (iv) For model years 2004 and later, manufacturers shall make 
available to aftermarket service providers the necessary manufacturer-
specific software applications and calibrations needed to initiate pass-
through reprogramming. This software shall be able to run on a standard 
personal computer that utilizes standard operating systems as specified 
in SAE J2534 (Incorporated by reference, see Sec. 86.1).
    (v) For model years prior to 2004, manufacturers may use SAE J2534 
as described above, provided they make available to the aftermarket any 
additional required hardware (i.e., cables). Manufacturers may not 
require the purchase or use of a manufacturer-specific scan tool to 
receive or use this additional hardware. Manufacturers must also make 
available the necessary manufacturer-specific software applications and 
calibrations needed to initiate pass-through reprogramming. 
Manufacturers must also make available to equipment and tool companies 
any information needed to develop aftermarket equivalents of the 
manufacturer-specific hardware.
    (vi) Manufacturers may take any reasonable business precautions 
necessary to protect proprietary business information and are not 
required to provide this information to any party that does not agree to 
these reasonable business precautions. The requirement to make hardware 
available and to release the information to equipment and tool companies 
takes effect on September 25, 2003, and within 3 months of model 
introduction for all new model years.
    (vii) Manufacturers who cannot comply with paragraphs (f)(12)(v) and 
(f)(12)(vi) of this section shall make available to equipment and tool 
companies by September 25, 2003 the following information necessary for 
reprogramming the ECU:
    (A) The physical hardware requirements for reprogramming events or 
tools (e.g. system voltage requirements, cable terminals/pins, 
connections such as RS232 or USB, wires, etc.).
    (B) ECU data communication (e.g. serial data protocols, transmission 
speed or baud rate, bit timing requirements, etc.).
    (C) Information on the application physical interface (API) or 
layers (descriptions for procedures such as connection, initialization, 
performing and verifying programming/download, and termination).
    (D) Vehicle application information or any other related service 
information such as special pins and voltages for reprogramming events 
or additional vehicle connectors that require enablement and 
specifications for the enablement.

[[Page 454]]

    (E) Information that describes what interfaces or combinations of 
interfaces are used to deliver calibrations from database media (e.g. PC 
using CDROM to the reprogramming device e.g. scan tool or black box).
    (viii) A manufacturer can propose an alternative to the requirements 
of paragraph (f)(12)(vii) of this section for how aftermarket service 
providers can reprogram an ECU. The Administrator will approve this 
alternative if the manufacturer demonstrates all of the following:
    (A) That it cannot comply with paragraph (f)(12)(v) of this section 
for the vehicles subject to the alternative plan;
    (B) That a very small percentage of its vehicles in model years 
prior to 2004 cannot be reprogrammed with the provisions described in 
paragraph (f)(12)(v) of this section, or that releasing the information 
to tool companies would likely not result in this information being 
incorporated into aftermarket tools; and
    (C) That aftermarket service providers will be able to reprogram 
promptly at a reasonable cost.
    (ix) In meeting the requirements of paragraphs (f)(12)(v) through 
(f)(12)(vii) of this section, manufacturers may take any reasonable 
business precautions necessary to protect proprietary business 
information and are not required to provide this information to any 
party that does not agree to these reasonable business precautions.
    (13) Generic and enhanced information for scan tools. By September 
25, 2003, manufacturers shall make available to equipment and tool 
companies all generic and enhanced service information including bi-
directional control and data stream information as defined in paragraph

model year vehicles.
    (i) The information required by this paragraph (f)(13) of this 
section shall be provided electronically using common document formats 
to equipment and tool companies with whom they have appropriate 
licensing, contractual, and/or confidentiality arrangements. To the 
extent that a central repository for this information (e.g. the TEK-NET 
library developed by the Equipment and Tool Institute) is used to 
warehouse this information, the Administrator shall have free 
unrestricted access. In addition, information required by paragraph 
(f)(13) of this section shall be made available to equipment and tool 
companies who are not otherwise members of any central repository and 
shall have access if the non-members have arranged for the appropriate 
licensing, contractual and/or confidentiality arrangements with the 
manufacturer and/or a central repository.
    (ii) In addition to the generic and enhanced information defined in 
paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, manufacturers shall also make 
available the following information necessary for developing generic 
diagnostic scan tools:
    (A) The physical hardware requirements for data communication (e.g. 
system voltage requirements, cable terminals/pins, connections such as 
RS232 or USB, wires, etc.)
    (B) ECU data communication (e.g. serial data protocols, transmission 
speed or baud rate, bit timing requirements, etc.),
    (C) Information on the application physical interface (API) or

shall make available for sale to the persons specified in paragraph 
(f)(2)(i) of this section their own manufacturer-specific diagnostic 
tools at a fair and reasonable cost. These tools shall also be made 
available in a timely fashion either through the manufacturer Web site 
or through a manufacturer-designated intermediary. Manufacturers who 
develop different versions of one or more of their diagnostic tools that 
are used in whole or in part for emission-related diagnosis and repair 
shall insure that all emission-related diagnosis and repair information 
is available for sale to the aftermarket at a fair and reasonable cost. 
Manufacturers shall provide technical support to aftermarket service 
providers for the tools described in this section, either themselves or 
through a third party of its choice. Factors for determining fair and 
reasonable cost include, but are not limited to:
    (i) The net cost to the manufacturer's franchised dealerships for 
similar tools obtained from manufacturers, less any discounts, rebates, 
or other incentive programs;
    (ii) The cost to the manufacturer for preparing and distributing the 
tools, excluding any research and development costs;
    (iii) The price charged by other manufacturers of similar sizes for 
similar tools;
    (iv) The capabilities and functionality of the manufacturer tool;
    (v) The means by which the tools are distributed;

[[Page 455]]

    (vi) Inflation;
    (vii) The ability of aftermarket technicians and shops to afford the 
tools.
    (15) Changing content of manufacturer-specific scan tools. 
Manufacturers who opt to remove non-emissions related content from their 
manufacturer-specific scan tools and sell them to the persons specified 
in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section shall adjust the cost of the tool 
accordingly lower to reflect the decreased value of the scan tool. All 
emissions-related content that remains in the manufacturer-specific tool 
shall be identical to the information that is contained in the complete 
version of the manufacturer specific tool. Any manufacturer who wishes 
to implement this option must request approval from the Administrator 
prior to the introduction of the tool into commerce.
    (16) Special tools. (i) Manufacturers who have developed special 
tools to extinguish the malfunction indicator light (MIL) for Model 
Years 2001 through 2003 shall make available the necessary information

Sec. 86.1809-01  Prohibition of defeat devices.

    (a) No new light-duty vehicle, light-duty truck, or complete heavy-
duty vehicle shall be equipped with a defeat device.
    (b) The Administrator may test or require testing on any vehicle at 
a designated location, using driving cycles and conditions which may 
reasonably be expected to be encountered in normal operation and use, 
for the purposes of investigating a potential defeat device.
    (c) For cold temperature CO emission control, the Administrator will 
use a guideline to determine the appropriateness of the CO emission 
control at ambient temperatures between 25 deg. F (-4 deg. C) and 68 
deg. F (20 deg. C). The guideline for CO emission congruity across the 
intermediate temperature range is the linear interpolation between the 
CO standard applicable at 25 deg. F (-4 deg. C) and the CO standard 
applicable at 68 deg. F (20 deg. C). For vehicles that exceed this CO 
emissions guideline upon intermediate temperature cold testing:
    (1) If the CO emission level is greater than the 20 deg. F (-7 deg. 
C) emission standard, the vehicle will automatically be considered to be 
equipped with a defeat device without further investigation.
    (2) If the CO emission level does not exceed the 20 deg. F emission 
standard, the Administrator may investigate the vehicle design for the 
presence of a defeat device under paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) For vehicle designs designated by the Administrator to be 
investigated for possible defeat devices:

[[Page 457]]

    (1) The manufacturer must show to the satisfaction of the 
Administrator that the vehicle design does not incorporate strategies 
that unnecessarily reduce emission control effectiveness exhibited 
during the Federal or Supplemental Federal emissions test procedures 
(FTP or SFTP) when the vehicle is operated under conditions which may 
reasonably be expected to be encountered in normal operation and use.
    (2) Information requirements:
    (i) Upon request by the Administrator, the manufacturer will provide 
an explanation containing detailed information regarding test programs, 
engineering evaluations, design specifications, calibrations, on-board 
computer algorithms, and design strategies incorporated for operation 
both during and outside of the Federal emission test procedure.
    (ii) For purposes of investigations of possible cold temperature CO 
defeat devices under this paragraph (d), the manufacturer shall provide 
an explanation which must show, to the satisfaction of the 
Administrator, that CO emissions are reasonably controlled in reference 
to the linear guideline, across the intermediate temperature range.
    (e) For each test group of Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs and HLDT/MDPVs and 
interim non-Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs and HLDT/MDPVs the manufacturer must 
submit, with the Part II certification application, an engineering 
evaluation demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Administrator that a 
discontinuity in emissions of non-methane organic gases, carbon 
monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and formaldehyde measured on the Federal 
Test Procedure (subpart B of this part) does not occur in the 
temperature range of 20 to 86 degrees F. For diesel vehicles, the 
engineering evaluation must also include particulate emissions.

<R05>
Sec. 86.1810-01  General standards; increase in emissions; unsafe conditions; waivers.

    This section applies to model year 2001 and later light-duty 
vehicles and light-duty trucks fueled by gasoline, diesel, methanol, 
natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas fuels. This section also applies 
to MDPVs and complete heavy-duty vehicles certified according to the 
provisions of this subpart. Multi-fueled vehicles (including dual-fueled 
and flexible-fueled vehicles) shall comply with all requirements 
established for each consumed fuel (or blend of fuels in the case of 
flexible fueled vehicles). The standards of this subpart apply to both 
certification and in-use vehicles unless otherwise indicated. For Tier 2 
and interim non-Tier 2 vehicles, this section also applies to hybrid 
electric vehicles and zero emission vehicles. Unless otherwise 
specified, requirements and provisions of this subpart applicable to 
methanol fueled vehicles are also applicable to Tier 2 and interim non-
Tier 2 ethanol fueled vehicles.
    (a) Any device, system or element of design installed on or 
incorporated in a new motor vehicle to enable such vehicle to conform to 
the standards imposed by this subpart:
    (1) Shall not in its operation or function cause the emission into 
the ambient air of any noxious or toxic substance that would not be 
emitted in the operation of such vehicle without such system, except as 
specifically permitted by regulation; and
    (2) Shall not in its operation, function or malfunction result in 
any unsafe condition endangering the vehicle, its occupants, or persons 
or property in close proximity to the vehicle.
    (b) In establishing the physically adjustable range of each 
adjustable parameter on a new motor vehicle, the manufacturer shall 
ensure that, taking into consideration the production tolerances, safe 
vehicle drive ability characteristics are available within that range, 
as required by section 202(a)(4) of the Clean Air Act.
    (c) Every manufacturer of new motor vehicles subject to any of the 
standards imposed by this subpart shall, prior to taking any of the 
actions specified in section 203(a)(1) of the Act, test or cause to be 
tested motor vehicles (or motor vehicle engines) in accordance with good 
engineering judgment to ascertain that such test vehicles will meet the 
requirements of this section for the useful life of the vehicle.

[[Page 458]]

    (d) Crankcase emissions prohibited. No crankcase emissions shall be 
discharged into the ambient atmosphere from any 2001 and later model 
year light-duty vehicle, light-duty truck, or complete heavy-duty 
vehicle certified according to the provisions of this subpart.
    (e) On-board diagnostics. All light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks 
and complete heavy-duty vehicles must have an on-board diagnostic system 
as described in Sec. 86.1806-01 or Sec. 86.1806-04, as applicable.
    (f) Altitude requirements. Except for supplemental exhaust emission 
standards (which apply only at low altitude conditions), all emission 
standards apply at low altitude conditions and at high altitude 
conditions. Interim non-Tier 2 LDV/Ts may be certified to applicable 
Tier 1 exhaust emission standards at high altitude as set forth in 
Secs. 86.1811-01, 86.1812-01, 86.1813-01, 86.1814-02 and 86.1815-02. 
Requirements to meet emission standards at high altitude are optional 
for interim non-Tier 2 MDPVs.
    (g) The standards set forth in this part refer to test procedures 
set forth in subparts B, C, O and P of this part.
    (h) For methanol-fueled and natural gas-fueled vehicles, hydrocarbon 
standards refer to hydrocarbon equivalents and nonmethane hydrocarbon 
standards refer to nonmethane hydrocarbon equivalents.
    (i) Supplemental FTP general provisions. (1) Implementation 
schedules. A minimum of the percentage of a manufacturer's model year 
sales of light-duty vehicles or light light-duty trucks (considered 
independently) shown in Table S01-1 and heavy light-duty trucks shown in 
Table S01-2 shall not exceed the applicable SFTP standards found in 
paragraph (b) of Secs. 86.1811-01, 1812-01, 1813-01, 1814-02, and 1815-
02 when tested under the applicable procedures in subpart B of this

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Optionally, a minimum of the percentage shown in Table S01-1 of 
a manufacturer's combined sales of the applicable model year's light-
duty vehicles and light light-duty trucks shall not exceed the 
applicable SFTP standards. Under this option, the light-duty vehicles 
shall not exceed the applicable SFTP standards in Sec. 86.1811-01(b), 
and the light light-duty trucks shall not exceed the applicable SFTP 
standards in Sec. 86.1812-01(b) or Sec. 86.1813-01(b) as applicable.
    (3) Sales percentages for the purposes of determining compliance 
with the applicable SFTP emission standards shall be based on total 
actual U.S. sales of light-duty vehicles of the applicable model year by 
a manufacturer to a dealer, distributor, fleet operator, broker, or any 
other entity which comprises the point of first sale. If the option of 
paragraph (i)(2) of this section is taken, such sales percentages shall 
be based on the total actual combined U.S. sales of light-duty vehicles 
and light light-duty trucks of the applicable model year by a 
manufacturer to a dealer, distributor, fleet operator, broker, or any 
other entity which comprises the point of first sale.
    (4) The SFTP standards do not apply to vehicles or trucks certified 
on alternative fuels, but the standards do apply to the gasoline and 
diesel fuel operation of flexible fuel vehicles and trucks and dual fuel 
vehicles and trucks.
    (5) The SFTP standards do not apply to vehicles or trucks tested at 
high altitude.
    (6) The air to fuel ratio shall not be richer at any time than the 
leanest air

[[Page 459]]

to fuel mixture required to obtain maximum torque (lean best torque), 
plus a tolerance of six percent. The Administrator may approve a 
manufacturer's request for additional enrichment if it can be shown that 
additional enrichment is needed to protect the engine or emissions 
control hardware. For Tier 2 and interim non-Tier 2 vehicles, this 
provision does not apply to enrichment that occurs upon cold start, 
warm-up conditions and rapid-throttle motion conditions (``tip-in'' or 
``tip-out'' conditions).
    (7) The requirement to use a single roll dynamometer (or a 
dynamometer which produces equivalent results), discussed in 
Secs. 86.108-00, 86.118-00, and 86.129-00 of subpart B of this part, 
applies to all SFTP and FTP test elements as set forth in subpart B of 
this part for test groups which are designated as SFTP compliant under 
the implementation schedules in Tables S01-1 and S01-2 in paragraph 
(i)(1) of this section.
    (8) Small volume provisions. (i) Light-duty vehicles and light 
light-duty trucks manufactured by small volume manufacturers, as 
described in Sec. 86.1801-01(d), are exempt from the requirements of 
this paragraph until model year 2002, when 100 percent compliance with 
the provisions of this paragraph (i) and the SFTP standards in 
Sec. 86.1811-01(b) and Sec. 86.1812-01(b) is required. This exemption 
does not apply to small volume test groups as defined in Sec. 86.1838-
01(b)(2).
    (ii) Heavy light-duty trucks manufactured by small volume 
manufacturers, as defined in Sec. 86.1801-01, are exempt from the 
requirements of this paragraph (i) until model year 2004 when 100 
percent compliance with the provisions of this paragraph and the SFTP 
standards in Secs. 86.1814-02(b) and 86.1815-02(b) is required. This 
exemption does not apply to small volume test groups as defined in 
Sec. 86.1838-01(b)(2).
    (9) [Reserved]
    (10) The manufacturer must state at the time of Application for 
Certification, based on projected U.S. sales or projected production for 
U.S. sale, which test groups will be used to attain the required 
implementation schedule sales percentages for certification purposes.
    (11) A manufacturer cannot use one set of test groups to meet its 
intermediate useful life standards and another to meet its full useful 
life standards. The same test groups which are used to meet the 
intermediate useful life standards will be required to meet the 
corresponding full useful life standards.
    (12) Compliance with composite standards shall be demonstrated using 
the calculations set forth in Sec. 86.164-00.
    (13) A/C-on specific calibrations. (i) For Tier 2 and interim non-
Tier 2 vehicles, A/C-on specific calibrations (e.g. air to fuel ratio, 
spark timing, and exhaust gas recirculation), may be used which differ 
from A/C-off calibrations for given engine operating conditions (e.g., 
engine speed, manifold pressure, coolant temperature, air charge 
temperature, and any other parameters).
    (ii) Such calibrations must not unnecessarily reduce the 
NMHC+NO<INF>X</INF> emission control effectiveness during A/C-on 
operation when the vehicle is operated under conditions which may 
reasonably be expected to be encountered during normal operation and 
use.
    (iii) If reductions in control system NMHC+NO<INF>X</INF> 
effectiveness do occur as a result of such calibrations, the 
manufacturer must, in the Application for Certification, specify the 
circumstances under which such reductions do occur, and the reason for 
the use of such calibrations resulting in such reductions in control 
system effectiveness.
    (iv) A/C-on specific ``open-loop'' or ``commanded enrichment'' air-
fuel enrichment strategies (as defined below), which differ from A/C-off 
``open-loop'' or ``commanded enrichment'' air-fuel enrichment 
strategies, may not be used, with the following exceptions: Cold-start 
and warm-up conditions, or, subject to Administrator approval, 
conditions requiring the protection of the vehicle, occupants, engine, 
or emission control hardware. Other than these exceptions, such 
strategies which are invoked based on manifold pressure, engine speed, 
throttle position, or other engine parameters must use the same engine 
parameter criteria for the invoking of this air-fuel enrichment strategy 
and the same degree of enrichment regardless of whether the A/C is

[[Page 460]]

on or off. ``Open-loop'' or ``commanded'' air-fuel enrichment strategy 
is defined as enrichment of the air to fuel ratio beyond stoichiometry 
for the purposes of increasing engine power output and the protection of 
engine or emissions control hardware. However, ``closed-loop biasing,'' 
defined as small changes in the air-fuel ratio for the purposes of 
optimizing vehicle emissions or driveability, must not be considered an 
``open-loop'' or ``commanded'' air-fuel enrichment strategy. In 
addition, ``transient'' air-fuel enrichment strategy (or ``tip-in'' and 
``tip-out'' enrichment), defined as the temporary use of an air-fuel 
ratio rich of stoichiometry at the beginning or duration of rapid 
throttle motion, must not be considered an ``open-loop'' or 
``commanded'' air-fuel enrichment strategy.
    (14) ``Lean-on-cruise'' calibration strategies. (i) For Tier 2 and 
interim non-Tier 2 vehicles, the manufacturer must state in the 
Application for Certification whether any ``lean-on-cruise'' strategies 
are incorporated into the vehicle design. A ``lean-on-cruise'' air-fuel 
calibration strategy is defined as the use of an air-fuel ratio 
significantly greater than stoichiometry, during non-deceleration 
conditions at speeds above 40 mph. ``Lean-on-cruise'' air-fuel 
calibration strategies must not be employed during vehicle operation in 
normal driving conditions, including A/C usage, unless at least one of 
the following conditions is met:
    (A) Such strategies are substantially employed during the FTP or 
SFTP;
    (B) Such strategies are demonstrated not to significantly reduce 
vehicle NMHC+NO<INF>X</INF> emission control effectiveness over the 
operating conditions in which they are employed; or
    (C) Such strategies are demonstrated to be necessary to protect the 
vehicle occupants, engine, or emission control hardware.
    (ii) If the manufacturer proposes to use a ``lean-on-cruise'' 
calibration strategy, the manufacturer must specify the circumstances 
under which such a calibration would be used, and the reason or reasons 
for the proposed use of such a calibration.
    (j) Evaporative emissions general provisions. (1) The evaporative 
standards in Secs. 86.1811-01(d), 86.1811-04(e), 86.1812-01(d), 86.1813-
01(d), 86.1814-01(d), 86.1814-02(d), 86.1815-01(d), 1815-02(d) and 
86.1816-04(d) apply equally to certification and in-use vehicles and 
trucks. The spitback standard also applies to newly assembled vehicles.
    (2) For certification testing only, manufacturers may conduct 
testing to quantify a level of non-fuel background emissions for an 
individual test vehicle. Such a demonstration must include a description 
of the source(s) of emissions and an estimated decay rate. The 
demonstrated level of non-fuel background emissions may be subtracted 
from evaporative emission test results from certification vehicles if 
approved in advance by the Administrator.
    (3) All fuel vapor generated in a gasoline- or methanol-fueled 
light-duty vehicle, light-duty truck, or complete heavy-duty vehicle 
during in-use operation shall be routed exclusively to the evaporative 
control system (e.g., either canister or engine purge.) The only 
exception to this requirement shall be for emergencies.
    (k) Refueling emissions general provisions--(1) Implementation 
schedules. (i) Tables S01-3, S01-4, and S01-5 in this paragraph 
(k)(1)(i) give the minimum percentage of a manufacturer's sales of the 
applicable model year's gasoline- and methanol-fueled Otto-cycle and 
petroleum-fueled and methanol-fueled diesel-cycle light-duty vehicles, 
light-duty trucks and complete heavy-duty vehicles which shall be tested 
under the applicable procedures in subpart B of this part, and shall not 
exceed the standards described in Secs. 86.1811-01(e), 86.1811-04(e)(3), 
86.1812-01(e), 86.1813-01(e), and 86.1816-04(e). Vehicles waived from 
the emission standards under the provisions of paragraphs (m) and (n) of

    (ii) Either manufacturer sales or actual production intended for 
sale in the United States may be used to determine combined volume, at 
the manufacturers option.
    (2) Determining sales percentages. Sales percentages for the 
purposes of determining compliance with the applicable refueling 
emission standards light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, medium-duty 
passenger vehicles, and complete heavy-duty vehicles shall be based on 
total actual U.S. sales of heavy light-duty trucks and complete heavy-
duty vehicles of the applicable model year by a manufacturer to a 
dealer, distributor, fleet operator, broker, or any other entity which 
comprises the point of first sale.
    (3) Refueling receptacle requirements. Refueling receptacles on 
natural gas-fueled vehicles shall comply with the receptacle provisions 
of the ANSI/AGA NGV1-1994 standard (as incorporated by reference in 
Sec. 86.1(b)(3)). This requirement is subject to the phase-in schedules 
in Tables S01-3 and S01-4 of paragraph (k)(1)(i) of this section.
    (l) Fuel dispensing spitback testing waiver. (1) Vehicles certified 
to the refueling emission standards set forth in Secs. 86.1811(e), 
86.1812(e) and 86.1813(e) are not required to demonstrate compliance 
with the fuel dispensing spitback standard contained in that section 
provided that:
    (i) The manufacturer certifies that the vehicle inherently meets the 
fuel dispensing spitback standard as part of compliance with the 
refueling emission standard; and
    (ii) This certification is provided in writing and applies to the 
full useful life of the vehicle.
    (2) EPA retains the authority to require testing to enforce 
compliance and to prevent noncompliance with the fuel dispensing 
spitback standard.
    (i) This provision is only available for petroleum diesel fuel. It 
is only available if the Reid Vapor Pressure of in-use diesel fuel is 
equal to or less than 1 psi (7 kPa) and for diesel vehicles whose fuel 
tank temperatures do not exceed 130 deg.F (54 deg. C); and
    (ii) To certify using this provision the manufacturer must attest to 
the following evaluation: ``Due to the low vapor pressure of diesel fuel 
and the vehicle tank temperatures, hydrocarbon vapor concentrations are 
low and the vehicle meets the 0.20 grams/gallon refueling emission 
standard without a control system.''
    (2) The certification required in paragraph (m)(1)(ii) of this 
section must be provided in writing and must apply for the full useful 
life of the vehicle.
    (3) EPA reserves the authority to require testing to enforce 
compliance and to prevent noncompliance with the refueling emission 
standard.
    (n) Fixed liquid level gauge waiver. Liquefied petroleum gas-fueled 
vehicles which contain fixed liquid level gauges or other gauges or 
valves which can be opened to release fuel or fuel vapor during 
refueling, and which are being tested for refueling emissions, are not 
required to be tested with such gauges or valves open, as outlined in 
Sec. 86.157-98(d)(2), provided the manufacturer can demonstrate, to the 
satisfaction of the Administrator, that such gauges or valves would not 
be opened during refueling in-use due to inaccessibility or other design 
features that would prevent or make it very unlikely that such gauges or 
valves could be opened.
    (o) Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, manufacturers 
must measure NMOG emissions in accordance with the California Non-
Methane Organic Gas Test Procedures. These

[[Page 462]]

procedures are incorporated by reference (see Sec. 86.1).
    (p) For gasoline and diesel-fueled Tier 2 and interim non-Tier 2 
vehicles, manufacturers may measure non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) in 
lieu of NMOG. Manufacturers must multiply NMHC measurements from 
gasoline vehicles by an adjustment factor of 1.04 before comparing with 
the NMOG standard to determine compliance with that standard. 
Manufacturers may use other factors to adjust NMHC results to more 
properly represent NMOG results. Such factors must be based upon 
comparative testing of NMOG and NMHC emissions and be approved in 
advance by the Administrator.

<R05>
Sec. 86.1811-04  Emission standards for light-duty vehicles, light-duty 
trucks and medium-duty passenger vehicles.

    (a) Applicability. (1) This section contains regulations 
implementing emission standards for all LDVs, LDTs and MDPVs. This 
section applies to 2004 and later model year LDVs, LDTs and MDPVs fueled 
by gasoline, diesel, methanol, ethanol, natural gas and liquefied 
petroleum gas fuels, except as noted. Additionally, this section 
contains provisions applicable to hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and 
zero emission vehicles (ZEVs). Multi-fueled vehicles must comply with 
all requirements established for each consumed fuel.
    (2) This section also applies to LDVs, LDTs and MDPVs of model years 
prior to 2004, when manufacturers certify such vehicles to Tier 2 
exhaust emission requirements to utilize alternate phase-in schedules, 
as allowed under paragraph (k)(6) of this section, and/or to earn early 
NO<INF>X</INF> credits for use in complying with the Tier 2 fleet 
average NO<INF>X</INF> standard which takes effect in the 2004 model 
year for LDV/LLDTs and 2008 for HLDT/MDPVs.
    (3) Except where otherwise specified, this section applies instead 
of Secs. 86.1811-01, 86.1812-01, 86.1813-01, 86.1814-01, 86.1814-02, 
86.1815-01, and 86.1815-02.
    (4) Except where otherwise specified, the provisions of this section 
apply equally to LDVs and all categories of LDTs, and to all MDPVs. 
Numerous provisions are applicable equally to HLDTs and MDPVs, as 
reflected by the term HLDT/MDPV. Numerous provisions apply equally to 
LDVs and LLDTs as reflected by the term LDV/LLDT.
    (5) The exhaust emission standards and evaporative emission 
standards of this section apply equally to certification and in-use 
LDVs, LDTs and MDPVs, unless otherwise specified.
    (b) Test weight. (1) Except as required in paragraphs (b)(2) and 
(b)(4) of this section, or permitted under paragraph

[[Page 464]]

(b)(3) of this section, emission testing of all LDVs, LDTs and MDPVs to 
determine compliance with any exhaust or evaporative emission standard 
set forth in this Part must be on a loaded vehicle weight (LVW) basis, 
as that term is defined in this subpart.
    (2) Interim non-Tier 2 HLDTs tested to Tier 1 SFTP standards, must 
be tested on an adjusted loaded vehicle weight (ALVW) basis, as that 
term is defined in this subpart, during the SC03 element of the SFTP.
    (3) Except as required in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(4) of this 
section, interim non-Tier 2 HLDT/MDPVs may be tested on an ALVW basis or 
an LVW basis to demonstrate compliance with any exhaust or evaporative 
emission standard set forth in this Part.
    (4) MDPVs certified to bin 11 standards from Tables S04-1 and -2 
must be tested on an ALVW basis to demonstrate compliance with any 
exhaust emission standard set forth in this part.
    (c) Tier 2 FTP exhaust emission standards. Exhaust emissions from 
Tier 2 vehicles must not exceed the standards in Table S04-1 of this 
section at full useful life when tested over the Federal Test Procedure 
(FTP) described in subpart B of this part. Exhaust emissions from Tier 2 
vehicles must not exceed the standards in Table S04-2 of this section at 
intermediate useful life, if applicable, when tested over the FTP.
    (1) For a given test group a manufacturer desires to certify to 
operate only on one fuel, the manufacturer must select a set of 
standards from the same bin (line or row) in Table S04-1 of this section 
for non-methane organic gases (NMOG), carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of 
nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>), formaldehyde (HCHO) and particulate matter 
(PM). The manufacturer must certify the test group to meet those 
standards, subject to all the applicable provisions of this subpart. The 
manufacturer must also certify the test group to meet the intermediate 
useful life standards (if any) in Table S04-2 of this section having the 
same EPA bin reference number as the chosen full useful life standards.
    (2) For a given test group of flexible-fueled, bi-fuel or dual fuel 
vehicles when operated on the alcohol or gaseous fuel they are designed 
to use, manufacturers must select a bin of standards from Table S04-1 of 
this section and the corresponding bin in Table S04-2, if any. When 
these flexible-fueled, bi-fuel or dual fuel vehicles are certified to 
operate on gasoline or diesel fuel, the manufacturer may choose to 
comply with the next numerically higher applicable NMOG standard, if 
any, above the bin which contains the standards selected for 
certification on the gaseous or alcohol fuel.
    (3)(i) For a given test group of flexible-fueled, bi-fuel or dual 
fuel vehicles certified to bin 10 in Table S04-1, when operated on the 
alcohol or gaseous fuel they are designed to use, manufacturers may 
choose to comply with an NMOG standard of 0.230 for LDV/LLDTs or 0.280 
g/mi for HLDT/MDPVs at full useful life and corresponding intermediate 
life standards of 0.160 g/mi and 0.195 g/mi, respectively, when these 
flexible-fueled, bi-fuel or dual fuel vehicles are certified to operate 
on gasoline or diesel fuel.
    (ii) For a given test group of flexible-fueled, bi-fuel or dual fuel 
vehicles certified to bin 8 in Table S04-1, when operated on the alcohol 
or gaseous fuel they are designed to use, manufacturers may choose to 
comply with a NMOG standard of 0.156 g/mi for LDV/LLDTs and 0.180 for 
HLDT/MDPVs at full useful life and corresponding intermediate life 
standards of 0.125 g/mi and 0.140 g/mi, respectively, when these 
flexible-fueled, bi-fuel or dual fuel vehicles are certified to operate 
on gasoline or diesel fuel.
    (4)(i) For bins where intermediate life standards are applicable, a 
manufacturer may elect not to comply with such standards. Except as 
permitted in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section, the manufacturer must 
certify such vehicles to a useful life of 15 years or 150,000 miles, 
whichever occurs first, for LDV/LLDTs and HLDT/MDPVs.
    (ii) A manufacturer electing not to comply with intermediate life 
standards, as permitted in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, may not 
generate additional NO<INF>X</INF> credits as described under 
Sec. 86.1860-04 (g), except as permitted in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of 
this section.
    (iii) For bins where intermediate life standards are not applicable, 
or are

[[Page 465]]

specified to be optional by paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section, a 
manufacturer may generate additional NO<INF>X</INF> credits subject to 
the provisions in Sec. 86.1860-04 (g).
    (iv) For diesel vehicles certified to bin 9 or bin 10, intermediate 
life standards are optional regardless of whether the manufacturer 
certifies the test group to a full useful life of 120,000 miles or 
150,000 miles.
    (5) In a given model year, an individual vehicle may not be included 
in both the Tier 2 program and an interim program.
    (6) Tables S04-1 and S04-2 follow:

year as specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section, or for the 
alternate phase-in percentage as permitted under paragraph (k)(6) of 
this section.
    (2) For Early Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs. For model years prior to 2004, where 
the manufacturer desires to bank early Tier 2 NO<INF>X</INF> credits as 
permitted under Sec. 86.1861(c), the manufacturer must comply with a 
fleet average standard of 0.07 grams per mile for its Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs. 
Manufacturers must determine compliance with the NO<INF>X</INF> fleet 
average standard according to regulations in Sec. 86.1860-04 of this 
subpart.
    (3) For Early Tier 2 HLDT/MDPVs. For model years prior to 2008, 
where the manufacturer desires to bank early Tier 2 NO<INF>X</INF> 
credits as permitted under Sec. 86.1861(c), the manufacturer must comply 
with a fleet average standard of 0.07 grams per mile for its Tier 2 
HLDT/MDPVs. Manufacturers must determine compliance with the 
NO<INF>X</INF> fleet average standard according to regulations in 
Sec. 86.1860-04.
    (e) Evaporative emission standards. Consistent with the phase-in 
requirements in paragraph (k) of this section, evaporative emissions 
from gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-
fueled, ethanol-fueled and methanol-fueled vehicles must not exceed the 
standards in this paragraph (e). The standards apply equally to 
certification and in-use vehicles.
    (1) Diurnal-plus-hot soak evaporative hydrocarbon standards. 
Hydrocarbons for LDV/LLDTs, HLDTs and MDPVs must not exceed the diurnal 
plus hot soak standards shown in Table S04-3 for the full three diurnal

LDTs and MDPVs: 0.20 grams hydrocarbon per gallon (0.053 grams per 
liter) of fuel dispensed.
    (ii) For liquefied petroleum gas-fueled LDV, LDTs and MDPVs: 0.15 
grams hydrocarbon per gallon (0.04 grams per liter) of fuel dispensed.
    (iii) Refueling standards for HLDTs are subject to the phase-in 
requirements found in Sec. 86.1810-01(k). MDPVs must also comply with 
the phase-in requirement in Sec. 86.1810-01(k) and must be grouped with 
HLDTs to determine phase-in compliance.
    (4) Spitback standards. For gasoline and methanol fueled LDV/Ts and 
MDPVs, hydrocarbons measured on the fuel dispensing spitback test must 
not exceed 1.0 grams hydrocarbon (carbon if methanol-fueled) per test.
    (5) Evaporative emission requirements for interim vehicles. (i) LDV/
Ts not certified to meet the evaporative emission standards in this 
paragraph (e) as permitted under the phase-in schedule of paragraph (k) 
of this section, must meet applicable evaporative emission standards in 
Secs. 86.1811-01, 86.1812-01, 86.1813-01, 86.1814-02 or 86.1815-02 
except that all LDV/Ts must meet the refueling emission standards in 
paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
    (ii) MDPVs not certified to meet the evaporative emission standards 
in this paragraph (e) as permitted under the phase-in schedule of 
paragraph (k) of this section, must meet applicable evaporative emission 
standards for heavy-duty vehicles in Sec. 86.099-10.
    (6) In cases where applicable California emission standards are as 
stringent or more stringent than applicable standards specified under 
this paragraph (e), the Administrator may accept data indicating 
compliance with California standards to demonstrate compliance for 
certification purposes with the standards required under this paragraph 
(e). The Administrator may require manufacturers to provide comparative 
test data to show that a vehicle meeting California standards under

[[Page 467]]

California test conditions and procedures will also meet the standards 
under this paragraph (e) when tested under test conditions and 
procedures in this Part 86.
    (f) Supplemental exhaust emission standards for LDV/Ts. (1) 
Supplemental exhaust emission standards are applicable to gasoline and 
diesel-fueled LDV/Ts but are not applicable to MDPVs, alternative fueled 
LDV/Ts, or flexible fueled LDV/Ts when operated on a fuel other than 
gasoline or diesel. Except as otherwise specified in this paragraph (f), 
manufacturers must comply with 4000 mile and full useful life SFTP 
standards as determined in this paragraph (f). The 4000 mile SFTP 
standards must be taken from Table S04-4 and the full life SFTP 
standards must be calculated using the formula in paragraph (f)(2) of 
this section. Table S04-4 follows:

    (2)(i) Manufacturers must calculate their applicable full useful 
life SFTP standards for NMHC+ NO<INF>X</INF>, PM and for CO, if using 
the weighted CO standard. If not using the weighted CO standard, 
manufacturers may use the full useful life standalone Tier 1 standards 
for US06 and SC03. To calculate the applicable full useful life weighted 
NMHC+ NO<INF>X</INF>, PM and CO standards, manufacturers must use the 
following formula:

SFTP Standard = SFTP Standard<INF>1</INF>-[0.35 x (FTP 
    Standard<INF>1</INF>-Current FTP Standard)]


Where:
SFTP Standard = Applicable full life weighted SFTP standard for NMHC+ 
    NO<INF>X</INF>, PM or CO. The NMHC+ NO<INF>X</INF> and PM standards 
    must be rounded to two decimal places and the CO standard must be 
    rounded to one decimal place.
SFTP Standard<INF>1</INF> = Applicable full life Tier 1 SFTP standard 
    for NMHC+NO<INF>X</INF> or CO from Table S04-5. For PM only, use FTP 
    Standard<INF>1</INF> for SFTP Standard<INF>1</INF>.
FTP Standard<INF>1</INF> = Applicable full life Tier 1 FTP standard from 
    Table S04-6 in this paragraph (f). For the Tier 1 
    NMHC+NO<INF>X</INF> standard, add the applicable NMHC and NOx 
    standards.
Current FTP Standard = Applicable full life FTP standard from Table S04-
    1 in paragraph (c) of this section. For the current 
    NMHC+NO<INF>X</INF> standard, add the NMOG and NO<INF>X</INF> 
    standards from the applicable bin.

<SUP>a</SUP> Intermediate life standards are shown in parentheses for diesel LDV/LLDTs opting to calculate intermediate
  life SFTP standards in lieu of 4,000 mile SFTP standards as permitted under paragraph (f)(6)of this section.

    (ii)(A) Manufacturers must determine compliance with 
NMHC+NO<INF>X</INF>, CO and PM weighted SFTP standards calculated in 
paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section by weighting their emission results 
as follows:

0.35x(FTP)+0.28x(US06)+0.37x(SC03).

    (B) The results of the calculation in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of 
this section must be rounded to one more decimal place than the 
applicable standard calculated in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section 
and then compared with that standard.
    (3) For interim non-Tier 2 gasoline, diesel and flexible-fueled 
LDT3s and LDT4s, manufacturers may, alternatively, meet the gasoline-
fueled vehicle SFTP standards found in Secs. 86.1814-02 and 86.1815-02, 
respectively.
    (4) Interim non-Tier 2 gasoline, diesel and flexible-fueled LDV/
LLDTs certified to bin 10 FTP exhaust emission standards from Table S04-
1 in paragraph (c) of this section may meet the gasoline Tier 1 SFTP 
requirements found at Secs. 86.1811-01(b), 86.1812-01(b), 86.1813-01(b), 
for LDVs, LDT1s, and LDT2s, respectively.
    (5) SFTP standards for PM are not applicable to interim non-Tier 2 
LDV/Ts. For Tier 2 LDV/Ts, the 4000 mile PM standard is equal to the 
full life PM standard calculated under paragraph (f)(2) of this section. 
The requirements of this paragraph (f)(5) also apply to Tier 2 flexible 
fuel vehicles when operated on gasoline or diesel fuel. (See regulations 
in Sec. 86.1829-01(b)(1)(iii)(B) regarding data submittal for PM results 
for gasoline vehicles.)
    (6)(i) In lieu of complying with 4000 mile SFTP standards described 
in this paragraph, diesel LDV/LLDTs through model year 2006, may comply 
instead with intermediate life SFTP standards derived from Tier 1 
intermediate life SFTP standards for gasoline vehicles.
    (ii) To calculate intermediate life SFTP standards, substitute 
intermediate life Tier 1 FTP and SFTP values from Tables S04-5 and S04-6 
in this paragraph (f), as appropriate, for the full life values in the 
equation in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section. Substitute the 
applicable intermediate life standards for the full life current FTP 
standard. If there is no applicable intermediate life standard use the 
full life current FTP standard.
    (iii) A manufacturer of diesel LDV/LLDTs must declare which option 
it will use (4,000 mile or intermediate life standards) in Part I of its 
certification application.
    (7) For diesel vehicles certified to the bin 9 or bin 10 standards 
of paragraph (c) of this section, 4000 mile SFTP and intermediate life 
SFTP standards are optional regardless of whether the manufacturer 
certifies the test group to a full useful life of 120,000 miles or 
150,000 miles.
    (g) Cold temperature exhaust emission standards. These standards are 
applicable only to gasoline fueled LDV/Ts and MDPVs. For cold 
temperature exhaust emission standards, a useful life of 50,000 miles 
applies.
    (1) For LDVs and LDT1s, the standard is 10.0 grams per mile CO.
    (2) For LDT2s, LDT3s and LDT4s, and MDPVs the standard is 12.5 grams 
per mile CO.
    (3) These standards do not apply to interim non-Tier 2 MDPVs.
    (h) Certification short test exhaust emission standards. 
Certification short test emissions from all gasoline-fueled otto cycle 
LDV/Ts and MDPVs must not exceed the following standards:
    (1) Hydrocarbons: 100 ppm as hexane, for certification and SEA 
testing; 220 ppm as hexane, for in-use testing.
    (2) Carbon monoxide: 0.5% for certification and SEA testing; 1.2% 
for in-use testing.

[[Page 469]]

    (3) These standards do not apply to interim non-Tier 2 MDPVs.
    (i) Idle CO standards and references to such standards in this 
subpart, do not apply to any 2004 or later model year LDV, LDT, or MDPV 
or to any LDV, LDT or MDPV certified to Tier 2 standards before model 
year 2004 for purposes of generating early NO<INF>X</INF> credits or 
meeting the requirements of an alternative phase-in schedule that begins 
prior to the 2004 model year.
    (j) Highway NO<INF>X</INF> exhaust emission standard. The maximum 
projected NO<INF>X</INF> emissions measured on the federal Highway Fuel 
Economy Test in 40 CFR part 600, subpart B, must not be greater than 
1.33 times the applicable FTP NO<INF>X</INF> standard to which the 
manufacturer certifies the test group. Both the projected emissions and 
the product of the NO<INF>X</INF> standard and 1.33 must be rounded to 
the nearest 0.01 g/mi before being compared. This standard is not 
applicable to MDPVs.
    (k) Phase-in of the Tier 2 FTP exhaust and evaporative requirements; 
small volume manufacturer flexibilities. (1) Manufacturers must comply 
with the phase-in requirements in Tables S04-7 and S04-8 of this 
paragraph (k) for the Tier 2 FTP exhaust emission requirements specified 
in paragraph (c) of this section. Separate phase-in schedules are 
provided for LDV/LLDTs and for HLDT/MDPVs. These requirements specify 
the minimum percentage of the manufacturer's LDV/LLDT and HLDT/MDPV U.S. 
sales, by model year, that must meet the Tier 2 requirements, including 
the applicable fleet average standard, for their full useful lives. As 
the terms LDV/LLDT and HLDT/MDVP imply, LDVs and LLDTs must be grouped 
together to determine compliance with these phase-in requirements and 
HLDTs and MDPVs must also be grouped together to determine compliance 
with these phase-in requirements. Tables S04-7 and S04-8 follow:

    (2) Manufacturers must also comply with the phase-in requirements in 
Tables S04-7 and S04-8 of this paragraph (k) for the evaporative 
emission requirements contained in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (3) Manufacturers may opt to use different LDV/LLDTs and HLDT/MDPVs 
to meet the phase-in requirements for evaporative emissions and FTP 
exhaust emissions, provided that the manufacturer meets the minimum 
applicable phase-in requirements in Table S04-7 and Table S04-8 of this 
paragraph (k) for both FTP exhaust and evaporative emissions. A LDV, LDT 
or MDPV counted toward compliance with any phase-in requirement for FTP 
exhaust or evaporative standards, must comply with all applicable Tier 2 
exhaust requirements or all applicable evaporative requirements, 
respectively, described in this section.
    (4) LDVs, LDTs and MDPVs not certified to meet the Tier 2 FTP 
exhaust requirements during model years 2004-2008, as allowed under this 
subpart, are subject to the provisions of paragraph (l) of this section.
    (5) Provisions for small volume manufacturers (i) Small volume 
manufacturers, as defined in this part, are exempt from the Tier 2 LDV/
LLDT exhaust and evaporative emissions phase-in requirements for model 
years 2004, 2005 and 2006 in Table S04-7 of this paragraph (k), but must 
comply with the 100% requirement for the 2007 and later model

[[Page 470]]

years for exhaust and evaporative emissions. If not complying with Tier 
2 requirements during 2004, 2005 and 2006, small volume manufacturers 
must comply with the requirements for interim non-Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs.
    (ii) Small volume manufacturers, as defined in this part, are exempt 
from the HLDT/MDPV exhaust and evaporative phase-in requirement for 
model year 2008 in Table S04-8 of this section but must comply with the 
100% requirement for the 2009 model year. Small volume manufacturers are 
also exempt from the HLDT/MDPV interim fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> 
standard (0.20 g/mi) and its phase-in for the 2004, 2005 and 2006 model 
years.
    (iii) Small volume manufacturers must comply with the FTP exhaust 
emission standards from Tables S04-1 and 2 of paragraph (c) of this 
section for all HLDT/MDPVs of model years 2004 and later, except that 
2004 model year HLDTs may comply with Tier 1 exhaust emission standards 
subject to the provisions of paragraph (l)(2)(vii) of this section, and 
2004 model year MDPVs may comply with heavy-duty vehicle standards 
subject to the provisions of paragraph (l)(2)(viii) of this section. 
Small volume manufacturers must also comply with the 0.20 g/mi fleet 
average NO<INF>X</INF> standard for 2007 and 2008 model year HLDT/MDPVs; 
the Tier 2 0.07 g/mi fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> standard for the 2009 
and later model year HLDT/MDPVs; and the evaporative emission standards 
in Table S04-3 of this section for the 2009 and later model years.
    (6)(i) A manufacturer may elect an alternate phase-in schedule that 
results in 100% phase-in for LDV/LLDTs by 2007. Alternate phase-in 
schedules must produce a sum of at least 250% when the percentages of 
LDV/LLDTs certified to Tier 2 requirements for each model year from 2001 
through 2007 are summed. As an example, a 10/25/50/65/100 percent phase-
in that began in 2003 would have a sum of 250 percent and would be 
acceptable. However, a 10/25/40/70/100 percent phase-in that began the 
same year would have a sum of 245 percent and would not be acceptable.
    (ii) A manufacturer electing this option for LDV/LLDTs may calculate 
its compliance with the evaporative standards in paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section separately from its compliance with Tier 2 exhaust 
standards, provided that the phase-in schedules for each separately 
produce a sum of at least 250 percent when calculated as described in 
paragraph (k)(6)(i) of this section. A vehicle counted towards 
compliance with any phase-in requirement for the Tier 2 exhaust 
standards or the evaporative standards in paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section, must comply with all applicable Tier 2 exhaust standards or all 
evaporative standards, as applicable, described in this section.
    (iii) In addition to the requirements of paragraphs (k)(6)(i) and 
(ii) of this section, except as permitted in paragraph (k)(6)(vii) of 
this section, a manufacturer of LDV/LLDTs electing to use an alternate 
phase-in schedule for compliance with the Tier 2 exhaust standards or 
the evaporative standards in paragraph (e)(1) of this section must 
ensure that the sum of the percentages of vehicles from model years 2001 
through 2004, meeting such exhaust or evaporative standards, as 
applicable, is at least 25%.
    (iv) A manufacturer may elect an alternate phase-in schedule that 
results in 100% phase-in for HLDT/MDPVs by 2009. The requirements of 
paragraphs (k)(6)(i) through (k)(6)(ii) of this section apply, except 
that for HLDT/MDPVs, the calculation described in paragraphs (k)(6)(i) 
and (k)(6)(ii) of this section may cover model years 2001 through 2009 
and must produce a sum of at least 150%.
    (v) A manufacturer electing to use any alternate phase-in schedule 
permitted under this section must provide in its Application for 
Certification for the first year in which it intends to use such a 
schedule, and in each succeeding year during the phase-in, the intended 
phase-in percentages for that model year and the remaining phase-in 
years along with the intended final sum of those percentages as 
described in this paragraph (k)(6). This information may be included 
with the information required under Sec. 86.1844-01(d)(13). In its year 
end annual reports, as required under Sec. 86.1844-01(e)(4) the 
manufacturer must include sufficient information so that the 
Administrator can verify compliance with the alternative

[[Page 471]]

phase-in schedule established under paragraph (k)(6) of this section.
    (vi) Under an alternate phase-in schedule, the projected phase-in 
percentage is not binding for a given model year, provided the sums of 
the actual phase-in percentages that occur meet the appropriate total 
sums as required in paragraph (k)(6) of this section, and provided that 
100% actual compliance is reached for the appropriate model year, either 
2007 or 2009, as described in paragraph (k)(6) of this section.
    (vii) A manufacturer unable to meet the 25% requirement in paragraph 
(k)(6)(iii) of this section, must:
    (A) Ensure that the sum of the percentages of vehicles for model 
years 2001 through 2004, meeting such exhaust or evaporative standards, 
as applicable, is at least 20%.
    (B) Subtract that sum of percentages for model years 2001 through 
2004 from 25%, and multiply the unrounded result by 2.
    (C) Round the product from paragraph (k)(6)(vii)(B) of this section 
to the nearest 0.1% and add that to 50%. That sum becomes the required 
phase-in percentage for the 2005 model year.
    (D) Comply with the phase-in percentage for the 2005 model year 
determined in paragraph (k)(6)(vii)(C) of this section.
    (E) Comply with a minimum phase-in percentage for the 2006 model 
year determined by the following equation:

minimum phase-in percentage for 2006 = [75% - (2005<INF>api</INF> - 
2005<INF>rpi</INF>)]


Where:

2005<INF>rpi</INF> = the required phase-in for the 2005 model year as 
determined in paragraph (k)(6)(vii)(C) of this section; and
2005<INF>api</INF> = the manufacturer's actual phase-in quantity for the 
2005 model year.

    (7)(i) Sales percentages for the purpose of determining compliance 
with the phase-in of the Tier 2 requirements and the phase-in of the 
evaporative standards in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, must be based 
upon projected U.S. sales of LDV/LLDTs and HLDT/MDPVs of the applicable 
model year by the manufacturer to the point of first sale. Such sales 
percentages must be rounded to the nearest one tenth of a percent, and 
must not include vehicles and trucks projected to be sold to points of 
first sale in California or a state that has adopted California 
requirements for that model year as permitted under section 177 of the 
Act.
    (ii) Alternatively, the manufacturer may petition the Administrator 
to allow actual volume produced for U.S. sales to be used in lieu of 
projected U.S. sales for purposes of determining compliance with the 
phase-in percentage requirements under this section. The manufacturer 
must submit its petition within 30 days of the end of the model year to 
the Vehicle Programs and Compliance Division. For EPA to approve the use 
of actual volume produced for U.S. sales, the manufacturer must 
establish to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that actual 
production volume is functionally equivalent to actual sales volume of 
LDV/LLDTs and HLDT/MDPVs sold in states other than California and states 
that have adopted California standards.
    (iii) Manufacturers must submit information showing compliance with 
all phase-in requirements of this section with its Part I application as 
required by Sec. 86.1844(d)(13).
    (l) FTP exhaust standards for interim non-Tier 2 vehicles.--(1) FTP 
exhaust emission standards for interim non-Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs. (i) LDV/
LLDTs that are not used to meet the Tier 2 phase-in requirements 
including the Tier 2 fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> requirement during the 
Tier 2 phase-in period (model years 2004-2006) must comply with the full 
useful life FTP exhaust emission standards listed in Table S04-1 of 
paragraph (c) of this section and the corresponding intermediate useful 
life standards, if any, in Table S04-2 of paragraph (c) of this section. 
Manufacturers may choose the bin of full useful life standards to which 
they certify a test group of vehicles, subject to the requirements in 
paragraph (l)(3)(i) of this section. In a given model year, an 
individual vehicle may not be used to comply with both the Tier 2 fleet 
average NO<INF>X</INF> standard and the applicable interim fleet average 
NO<INF>X</INF> standard although vehicles from the same test

[[Page 472]]

group may be separated and the vehicles counted toward compliance with 
either program.
    (ii) The provisions of paragraphs (c) (1), (2) and (3) of this 
section apply to flexible-fueled, dual fuel and multi-fuel interim non-
Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs.
    (iii) Only manufacturers that comply with the applicable FTP 
standards in Tables S04-1 and 2 of paragraph (c) of this section for all 
of their 2004 model year HLDTs and declare their intention to comply 
with the 2004 model year 25% phase-in requirement to the 0.20 g/mi 
interim fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> standard for HLDTs (or HLDT/MDPVs) 
described in this paragraph (l) may use the optional higher NMOG values 
for interim LDT2s certified to bin 9 standards that are shown in Tables 
S04-1 and 2. Manufacturers must declare their intention to comply with 
the full 2004 model year 25% phase-in requirement in Part I of their 
HLDT or their HLDT/MDPV, as applicable, certification applications.
    (iv) The provisions of paragraph (c)(4) of this section apply to 
interim non-Tier 2 vehicles.
    (2) FTP exhaust emission standards for interim non-Tier 2 HLDTs and 
interim non-Tier 2 MDPVs. (i) Except as permitted under paragraphs 
(l)(2) (vii) and (viii) of this section, HLDTs and MDPVs of model years 
2004-2008 that are not used to meet the Tier 2 FTP phase-in requirements 
including the Tier 2 fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> requirement must 
comply with the full useful life FTP exhaust emission standards listed 
in Table S04-1 of paragraph (c) of this section and, the corresponding 
intermediate useful life standards, if any, in Table S04-2 of paragraph 
(c) of this section. Manufacturers may choose the bin of full useful 
life standards to which they certify a test group of vehicles, subject 
to the requirements in paragraph (l)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) Except as permitted under paragraphs (l)(2) (vii) and (viii) of 
this section, HLDTs and MDPVs of model years 2004-2008 that are not used 
to meet the Tier 2 FTP phase-in requirements including the Tier 2 fleet 
average NO<INF>X</INF> requirement must comply with the fleet average 
NO<INF>X</INF> standard described in paragraph (l)(3)(ii) of this 
section subject to the phase-in schedule in paragraph (l)(2)(iv) of this 
section, i.e. 25 percent of the HLDT and MDPVs must meet the fleet 
average standard of 0.20 g/mi in 2004, 50 percent in 2005, and so on.
    (iii) Manufacturers may choose the bin of full useful life standards 
and corresponding intermediate life standards to which they certify test 
groups of HLDTs and MDPVs, subject to the requirements in paragraph 
(l)(3)(ii) of this section. Manufacturers may include HLDT/MDPVs in the 
interim program that are not used to meet the Tier 2 fleet average 
NO<INF>X</INF> standard or the phase-in percentage requirements in the 
Tier 2 program or to generate Tier 2 NO<INF>X</INF> credits. In a given 
model year, an individual vehicle may not be used to comply with both 
the Tier 2 fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> standard and the applicable 
interim fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> standard although vehicles from the 
same test group may be separated and the vehicles counted toward 
compliance with either program.
    (iv) Phase-in schedule for interim non-Tier 2 HLDT/MDPVs. Table S04-
9 of this paragraph (l) specifies the minimum percentage of the 
manufacturer's interim non-Tier 2 HLDT/MDPV U.S. sales, by model year, 
that must comply with the fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> standard 
described in paragraph (l)(3)(ii) of this section. Table S04-9 follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (v)(A) A manufacturer may elect an alternate phase-in schedule, 
beginning as early as the 2001 model year, that results in 100% 
compliance by 2007 with the fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> standard for 
interim non-Tier 2 HLDT/MDPVs described in paragraph (l)(3)(ii) of this 
section. The requirements of paragraph

[[Page 473]]

(k)(6) of this section apply to the selection of an alternate phase-in 
schedule.
    (B) If a manufacturer elects not to bring all of its HLDT/MDPVs into 
compliance with the interim requirements in 2004 as permitted under 
paragraphs (l)(2)(vii) and
    (viii) of this section, it may still use an alternate phase-in 
schedule to attain 100% compliance with the interim fleet average 
NO<INF>X</INF> standard for HLDT/MDPVs, but the sum of phase-in 
percentages it must meet will be 225% rather than 250%. If the 
manufacturer commences its 2004 model year on or after December 21, 
2003, for any HLDT/MDPVs, the manufacturer must increase the 225% by the 
fraction of its 2004 model year HLDT/MDPVs whose model year commenced on 
or after that date and which were brought into compliance with the 0.20 
g/mi corporate average NO<INF>X</INF> standard as required under 
paragraph (l)(2)(ix) of this section. The manufacturer must ensure that 
the sum of the percentages of vehicles up through model year 2005 
complying with the interim fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> standard is at 
least 50%.
    (vi) The provisions of paragraphs (c) (1), (2) and (3) of this 
section apply to flexible-fueled, dual fuel and multi-fuel interim non-
Tier 2 HLDT/MDPVs.
    (vii) For 2004 model year HLDT test groups whose model year 
commences before December 21, 2003, the manufacturer may exempt such 
HLDTs from compliance with any requirements applicable to interim non-
Tier 2 HLDTs, and such HLDTs must be produced in accordance with 
standards and requirements in Secs. 86.1814-02 and Secs. 86.1815-02. 
Such HLDTs must also meet the refueling emission standards contained in 
paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
    (viii) For 2004 model year heavy-duty vehicles whose model year 
commences before December 21, 2003, the manufacturer may exempt such 
vehicles from compliance with any requirements applicable to interim 
non-Tier 2 MDPVs. Exempted vehicles will not be considered MDPVs and 
must be produced in accordance with standards and requirements in 
Sec. 86.099-10. Exempted vehicles are also exempted from refueling 
emission standards.
    (ix) For 2004 model year HLDT and MDPV test groups whose model year 
commences on or after December 21, 2003, the manufacturer must comply 
with all interim non-Tier 2 requirements in this section.
    (A) All such vehicles, but not more than 25% of the manufacturer's 
total sales of 2004 model year HLDT/MDPVs must meet the interim non-Tier 
2 fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> standard as described in paragraph 
(l)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (B) All such vehicles but not more than 40% of the manufacturer's 
2004 model year HLDT/MDPVs must comply with the refueling requirements 
in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
    (x) Only those manufacturers that comply with the interim non-Tier 2 
FTP standards for all of their 2004 model year HLDTs and declare their 
intention to comply with the 2004 model year 25% phase-in requirement to 
the fleet average interim NO<INF>X</INF> standard for HLDTs or HLDT/
MDPVs of 0.20 g/mi described in paragraph (l) of this section may use 
the optional higher NMOG values for interim LDT4s certified to bin 10 
standards that are shown in Tables S04-1 and 2 of paragraph (c) of this 
section. Manufacturers must declare their intention to comply with the 
2004 model year 25% phase-in requirement in Part I of their HLDT 
certification applications.
    (xi) Only those manufacturers that comply with the interim non-Tier 
2 FTP standards for all of their 2004 model year MDPVs, and declare 
their intention to comply with the 2004 model year 25% phase-in 
requirement to the fleet average interim NO<INF>X</INF> standard for 
MDPVs or HLDT/MDPVs of 0.20 g/mi described in paragraph (l) of this 
section may:
    (A) Use the exhaust emission standards of bin 11 in Tables S04-1 and 
S04-2 of paragraph (c) in this section for MDPVs through model year 
2008;
    (B) For diesel-fueled vehicles, certify the engines in such 
vehicles, through model year 2007, to provisions in this part 86 
applicable to diesel-fueled heavy-duty engines of the appropriate model 
year. Such diesel fueled vehicles must not be included in any count or 
determination of compliance with the phase-in requirements applicable to 
interim non-Tier 2 MDPVs; and
    (C) Use the optional higher NMOG values for interim LDT4s certified 
to

[[Page 474]]

bin 10 standards that are shown in Tables S04-1 and 2.
    (xii) Manufacturers electing to comply with the provisions of 
paragraph (l)(2)(xi) of this section must declare their intention to 
comply with the 2004 model year 25% phase-in requirement to the fleet 
average interim NO<INF>X</INF> standard for MDPVs or HLDT/MDPVs of 0.20 
g/mi in Part I of their MDPV certification applications.
    (xiii) Where diesel-fueled heavy-duty engines are used as permitted 
under paragraph (l)(2)(xi)(B) of this section, such engines must be 
treated as a separate averaging set--MDPV HDDEs-- under the averaging, 
banking and trading provisions applicable to heavy-duty diesel engines. 
Only NO<INF>X</INF> credits generated by engine-certified diesel engines 
that are used in other MDPVs can be applied to these engines. 
Manufacturers wishing to average, bank or trade credits for MDPV HDDEs 
must comply with the requirements in this paragraph and with all 
requirements applicable to heavy-duty engine averaging, banking and 
trading in this part.
    (3) Fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> standards for interim non-Tier 2 
LDV/Ts and MDPVs. (i) Manufacturers must comply with a fleet average 
full useful life NO<INF>X</INF> standard for their interim non-Tier 2 
LDV/LLDTs, on an annual basis, of 0.30 grams per mile.
    (ii) Manufacturers must comply with a fleet average full useful life 
NO<INF>X</INF> standard for their interim non-Tier 2 HLDT/MDPVs, 
excluding those HLDTs and MDPVs not yet covered by the phase-in 
requirement described in paragraph (l)(2)(ii) of this section, on an 
annual basis, of 0.20 grams per mile.
    (iii) Manufacturers must determine their compliance with these 
interim fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> standards for each model year by 
separately computing the sales weighted average NO<INF>X</INF> level of 
all interim non-Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs and all interim non-Tier 2 HLDT/MDPVs 
(excluding those not yet phased in as described in paragraph (l)(2)(ii) 
of this section), using the methodology in Sec. 86.1860.
    (iv) Manufacturers may generate, bank, average, trade and use 
interim non-Tier 2 NO<INF>X</INF> credits based on their NO<INF>X</INF> 
fleet average as determined under paragraph (l)(3)(iii) of this section. 
Unless waived or modified by the Administrator, the provisions of 
Sec. 86.1861 of this part apply to the generation, banking, averaging, 
trading and use of credits generated by interim non-Tier 2 vehicles. 
NO<INF>X</INF> credits generated by interim non-Tier 2 vehicles are not 
subject to any discount except as required by Sec. 86.1861-04(e).
    (m) NMOG standards for diesel, flexible fueled and dual-fueled LDV/
Ts and MDPVs. (1) For diesel fueled LDV/Ts and MDPVs, the term ``NMOG'' 
in both the Tier 2 and interim non-Tier 2 standards means non-methane 
hydrocarbons.
    (2) Flexible-fueled and dual-fuel Tier 2 and interim non-Tier 2 
vehicles must be certified to NMOG exhaust emission standards both for 
operation on gasoline and on any alternate fuel they are designed to 
use. Manufacturers may measure NMHC in lieu of NMOG when flexible-fueled 
and dual-fuel vehicles are operated on gasoline, subject to the 
requirements of Sec. 86.1810(p).
    (n) Hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) and Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) 
requirements. For FTP and SFTP exhaust emissions, and unless otherwise 
approved by the Administrator, manufacturers must measure emissions from 
all HEVs and ZEVs according to the requirements and test procedures 
found in the document entitled California Exhaust Emission Standards and 
Test Procedures for 2003 and Subsequent Model Zero-Emission Vehicles and 
2001 and Subsequent Model Hybrid Electric Vehicles, in the Passenger 
Car, Light-duty Truck and Medium-duty Vehicle Classes. This document is 
incorporated by reference (see Sec. 86.1) . Requirements and procedures 
in this document that are relevant only to complying with the California 
ZEV mandate, computing partial and full ZEV allowance credits, or 
generating and using ZEV credits, are not relevant to the federal 
program and may be disregarded. Discussion in that document relevant to 
fleet average NMOG standards and NMOG credits may also be disregarded.
    (o) NMOG measurement. (1) Manufacturers must measure NMOG emissions 
in accordance with Part G of the California Non-Methane Organic Gas Test

[[Page 475]]

Procedures. These requirements are incorporated by reference (see 
Sec. 86.1).
    (2) Manufacturers must not apply reactivity adjustment factors 
(RAFs) to NMOG measurements. See Sec. 86.1841.
    (p) In-use standards. (1) Table S04-10 of this paragraph (p) 
contains in-use emission standards applicable only to vehicles certified 
to the bins shown in the table. These standards apply to in-use testing 
performed by the manufacturer pursuant to regulations at Secs. 86.1845-
01, 86.1845-04 and 86.1846-01 and to in-use testing performed by EPA. 
These standards do not apply to certification or Selective Enforcement 
Auditing.
    (2) These standards apply only to LDV/LLDTs produced up through the 
2008 model year, and HLDT/MDPVs produced up through the 2010 model year. 
These standards are subject to other limitations described in paragraph 
(p)(3) of this section.
    (3) For the first model year and also for the next model year after 
that, in which a test group of vehicles is certified to a bin of 
standards to which it has not previously been certified, the standards 
in Table S04-10 of this paragraph (p) apply for purposes of in-use 
testing only. The standards apply equally to all LDV/Ts and MDPVs 
subject to the model year limitation in paragraph (p)(2) of this 
section. Table S04-10 follows:

                                                    Table S04-10--In-use Compliance Standards (g/mi)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (4) For diesel vehicles certified to bin 10, separate in-use 
standards apply for NO<INF>X</INF> and PM emissions. These standards are 
determined by multiplying the applicable NO<INF>X</INF> and PM 
certification standards by factors of 1.2 and 1.35, respectively, and 
then rounding the result to one more decimal place than contained in the 
certification standard. The resultant standards do not apply for 
certification or selective enforcement auditing.
    (q) Hardship provision for small volume manufacturers. (1) A small 
volume manufacturer may apply for relief from any applicable final 
phase-in model year contained in this section. Relief will only be 
available to defer required compliance with a completely new set of 
standards, a fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> standard, and/or evaporative 
emission standard for 100% of affected vehicles for one model year. 
Thus, a small volume manufacturer that obtains relief may:
    (i) Defer 100% compliance with the fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> 
standard for interim LDV/LLDTs (0.30 g/mi) until 2005;
    (ii) Defer 100% compliance with the evaporative emission standards 
and/or fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> standard for Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs (0.07 
g/mi) until 2008;
    (iii) Defer 100% compliance with the requirements that interim HLDTs 
and MDPVs comply with applicable emission standards shown in Tables S04-
1 and S04-2, until 2005;
    (iv) Defer 100% compliance with the fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> 
standard for interim HLDT/MDPVs (0.20 g/mi) until 2008; and
    (v) Defer 100% compliance with the the evaporative emission 
standards and/or fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> standard for Tier 2 HLDT/
MDPVs (0.07 g/mi) until 2010.
    (2) Applications for relief must be in writing and must:
    (i) Be submitted before the earliest date of noncompliance;
    (ii) Include evidence that the manufacturer will incur severe 
economic hardship if relief is not granted;
    (iii) Include evidence that the noncompliance will occur despite the 
best efforts of the manufacturer to comply; and

[[Page 476]]

    (iv) Include evidence that the manufacturer has made every 
reasonable effort to purchase credits to address the noncompliance, 
where applicable.
    (r) NMOG standard adjustment for direct ozone reducing devices. (1) 
A manufacturer may obtain NMOG credit for use in certifying to the 
exhaust NMOG standards listed in paragraph (c) of this section and for 
use in complying with the in-use standards of paragraph (p) of this 
section, where applicable. This credit effectively allows the 
manufacturer to increase the exhaust NMOG emission standards listed in 
these paragraphs by the amount of the applicable credit. For example, if 
the applicable NMOG credit was 0.01 g/mi, and the vehicle was being 
certified in Bin 5, as described in Table S04-1 of paragraph (c) of this 
section, exhaust NMOG emissions must be no greater than 0.10 g/mi, as 
opposed to the normal NMOG certification standard of 0.09 g/mi in Bin 5.
    (2) The NMOG credit must be determined through a two-step process.
    (i) The first step must determine the ozone reduction potential of 
the direct ozone reducing device, the ozone reduction potential of 
exhaust NMOG reductions beyond Bin 5 of the Tier 2 standards, and the 
ratio of the two methods of reducing ambient ozone levels. The 
requirements for this step are described in paragraph (r)(3) of this 
section.
    (ii) The second step must demonstrate and certify the relevant 
performance characteristics of the specific ozone reducing device. The 
requirements for this step are described in paragraph (r)(4) of this 
section.
    (3) The ozone reduction potential of the direct ozone reducing 
device and the ozone reduction potential of exhaust NMOG reductions 
beyond Bin 5 of the Tier 2 standards must be estimated using procedures 
which are approved by the Administrator in advance. At a minimum:
    (i) The modeling must utilize an urban airshed model using up-to-
date chemical and meteorological simulation techniques;
    (ii) Four local areas must be modeled: New York City, Chicago, 
Atlanta and Houston;
    (iii) The ozone episodes to be modeled must meet the selection 
criteria established by EPA for State ozone SIPs;
    (iv) Photochemical and dispersion modeling must follow that used by 
EPA to project the ozone impacts of this rule, or its equivalent;
    (v) Emission projections must be made for calendar year 2007 and be 
consistent with those used by EPA in support of this final rule, or 
reflect updates approved by EPA;
    (vi) Baseline emissions (emissions prior to use of the direct ozone 
reducing device or the VOC emission reductions) must include the 
benefits of the Tier 2 emission and sulfur standards; as well as all 
other emission controls assumed in EPA's ozone modeling of the benefits 
of the Tier 2 and sulfur standards, as described in the Final Regulatory 
Impact Analysis to the Tier 2 and Sulfur Rule;
    (vii) The ozone benefit of the direct ozone reducing device must 
assume a radiator area of 0.29 square meters, an air flow velocity 
through the radiator of 40% of vehicle speed, and an ozone reduction 
efficiency of 80%, or other values as approved by the Administrator;
    (viii) The ozone level of the air entering the direct ozone reducing 
device must be assumed to be 40% less than that existing in the grid 
cell where the vehicle is located;
    (ix) The ozone benefit of VOC emission reductions must be modeled by 
assuming that all Tier 2 LDVs, LDTs and MDPVs meet an exhaust NMOG 
standard of 0.055 g/mi or lower instead of a 0.09 g/mi NMOG standard;
    (x) The ozone reducing device must be assumed to be present on all 
of the Tier 2 LDVs, LDTs and MDPVs modeled as meeting the more stringent 
NMOG standard described in paragraph (r)(3)(ix) of this section;
    (xi) The relationship between changes in exhaust NMOG emission 
standards and in-use VOC emissions must be determined sufficiently far 
in the future to ensure that the change in ozone being modeled is 
sufficiently large to allow comparison with the impact of the ozone 
reducing device;
    (xii) LDV, LDT and MDPV emissions must be modeled using the updated 
Tier 2 emission model developed by

[[Page 477]]

EPA as part of the Tier 2 rulemaking (available from EPA upon request) 
or MOBILE6, once this model is available;
    (xiii) The ozone benefit of the direct ozone reducing device must be 
the reduction in the peak one-hour ozone level anywhere in the modeled 
region on the day when ozone is at its highest;
    (xiv) The NMOG credit in each local area must be the reduction in 
peak one hour ozone associated with use of the direct ozone reducing 
device divided by the reduction in peak one hour ozone associated with 
the more stringent exhaust NMOG emission standard multiplied by the 
reduction the exhaust NMOG standard (in g/mi) modeled in paragraph 
(r)(3)(ix) of this section; and
    (xv) The NMOG credit applicable to the generic direct ozone reducing 
device modeled in paragraph (r)(3)(vii) of this section must be 
determined by arithmetically averaging the NMOG credit determined in 
paragraph (r)(3)(xiv) of this section for each of the four local areas.
    (4) The manufacturer must submit data, using procedures which have 
been approved by the Administrator in advance, that demonstrate the 
following aspects of the device being certified:
    (i) The air flowrate through the device as a function of vehicle 
speed;
    (ii) The ozone reduction efficiency of the device over the useful 
life of the vehicle for a range of vehicle speeds and ozone levels;
    (iii) The method through which the onboard diagnostic system will 
detect improper performance.
    (5) The NMOG credit for the specific application of this technology 
tested under the provisions of paragraph (r)(4) of this section is the 
four-area NMOG credit determined in paragraph (r)(3)(xv) of this section 
scaled based on the performance of the specific application tested under 
the provisions of paragraph (r)(4) of this section relative to those 
assumed in paragraph (r)(3)(vii) of this section. This scaling must 
assume a linear relationship between the NMOG credit and three aspects 
of the direct ozone reducing device: radiator area, average air flow 
through the radiator relative to vehicle speed, and ozone reduction 
efficiency and the NMOG credit. The NMOG credit must be rounded to the 
nearest 0.001 g/mi. For example, if the NMOG credit determined in 
paragraph (r)(3)(xv) of this section was 0.01 g/mi and the specific 
direct ozone reducing device being certified had an area of 0.20 square 
meters, an air flow velocity of 30% of vehicle speed and an ozone 
reducing efficiency of 70%, and the generic ozone reducing device 
simulated in the ozone model under paragraph (r)(3)(vii) of this section 
had an area of 0.29 square meters, an air flow velocity of 40% of 
vehicle speed and an ozone reducing efficiency of 80%, the NMOG credit 
applicable to the specific device being certified would be:

0.01 g/mi * (0.20/0.29) * (30%/40%) * 70%/80%) = 0.005
    (s) Manufacturers may request to group heavy-duty vehicles into the 
same test group as other vehicles subject to more stringent standards, 
so long as all vehicles in the test group meet the most stringent 
standards applicable to any vehicle within that test group, as provided 
at Sec. 86.1827-1(a)(5) and (d)(4).

engines under Sec. 86.1816-05, in lieu of the evaporative standards 
specified in this section. These vehicles must comply with all other 
requirements applicable to model year 2008 vehicles, except as allowed 
by paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section. The combined number of vehicles 
in the test groups certified to the 2007 standards may not exceed 50 
percent of the manufacturer's U.S. heavy-duty vehicle sales of complete 
heavy-duty Otto-cycle motor vehicles for model year 2008.
    (2)(i) Manufacturers certifying vehicles to all of the applicable 
standards listed in paragraph (a) of this section prior to model year 
2008 (without using credits) may reduce the number of vehicles that are 
required to meet the standards listed in paragraph (a) of this section 
in model year 2008 and/or 2009, taking into account the phase-in option 
provided in paragraph (i)(1) of this section. For every vehicle that is 
certified early, the manufacturer may reduce the number of vehicles that 
are required by paragraph (i)(1) of this section to meet the standards 
listed in paragraph (a) of this section by one vehicle. For example, if 
a manufacturer produces 100 heavy-duty Otto-cycle vehicles in 2007 that 
meet all of the applicable the standards listed in paragraph (a) of this 
section, and it produced 10,000 heavy-duty Otto-cycle vehicles in 2009, 
then only 9,900 of the vehicles would need to comply with the standards 
listed in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (ii) Manufacturers certifying vehicles to all of the applicable 
evaporative standards listed in paragraph (d) of this section prior to 
model year 2008 may reduce the number of vehicles that are required to 
meet the standards listed in paragraph (d) of this section in model year 
2008 and/or 2009, taking into account the phase-in option provided in 
paragraph (i)(1) of this section. For every vehicle that is certified 
early, the manufacturer may reduce the number of vehicles that are 
required by paragraph (i)(1) of this section to meet the evaporative 
standards listed in paragraph (d) of this section by one vehicle.
    (3) Manufacturers certifying vehicles to all of the applicable 
standards listed in paragraph (i)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section (without 
using credits) and the evaporative standards listed in paragraph (d) of 
this section prior to model year 2008 may reduce the number of vehicles 
that are required to meet the standards listed in paragraph (a) of this 
section in model year 2008 and/or 2009, taking into account the phase-in 
option provided in paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section. For every such 
vehicle that is certified early with sufficiently low emissions, the 
manufacturer may reduce the number of vehicles that are required by 
paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section to meet the standards listed in 
paragraph (a) of this section by two vehicles. The applicable standards 
are:

[[Page 489]]

    (i) For complete heavy-duty vehicles at and above 8,500 pounds Gross 
Vehicle Weight Rating but equal to or less than 10,000 Gross Vehicle 
Weight Rating: 0.100 g/mile NMHC, 0.10 g/mile NO<INF>X</INF>, 3.2 g/mile 
CO, 0.008 g/mile formaldehyde, and 0.02 g/mile PM.
    (ii) For complete heavy-duty vehicles at or above 10,000 pounds 
Gross Vehicle Weight Rating but equal to or less than 14,000 Gross 
Vehicle Weight Rating: 0.117 g/mile NMHC, 0.20 g/mile NO<INF>X</INF>, 
3.7 g/mile CO, 0.010 g/mile formaldehyde, and 0.02 g/mile PM.
    (j) (1) For model years prior to 2012, for purposes of determining 
compliance after title or custody has transferred to the ultimate 
purchaser, for vehicles meeting the applicable emission standards of 
this section, the applicable compliance limits shall be determined by 
adding the applicable adjustment from paragraph (j)(2) of this section 
to the otherwise applicable standard or FEL.
    (2) The in-use adjustments are:
    (i) 0.1 g/bhp-hr for NO<INF>X</INF>.
    (ii) 0.100 g/bhp-hr NMHC.
    (iii) 0.01 g/bhp-hr for PM.

<R05>
Sec. 86.1817-05  Complete heavy-duty vehicle averaging, trading, and banking 
program.

    (a) General. (1) Complete heavy-duty vehicles eligible for the 
NO<INF>X</INF> averaging, trading and banking program are described in 
the applicable emission standards section of this subpart. All heavy-
duty vehicles which include an engine labeled for use in clean-fuel 
vehicles as specified in 40 CFR part 88 are not eligible for this 
program. Participation in this averaging, trading, and banking program 
is voluntary.
    (2)(i) Test groups with a family emission limit (FEL) as defined in 
Sec. 86.1803-01 exceeding the applicable standard shall obtain emission 
credits as defined in Sec. 86.1803-01 in a mass amount sufficient to 
address the shortfall. Credits may be obtained from averaging, trading, 
or banking, as defined in Sec. 86.1803-01 within the averaging set 
restrictions described in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (ii) Test groups with an FEL below the applicable standard will have 
emission credits available to average, trade, bank or a combination 
thereof. Credits may not be used for averaging or trading to offset 
emissions that exceed an FEL. Credits may not be used to remedy an in-
use nonconformity determined by a Selective Enforcement Audit or by 
recall testing. However, credits may be used to allow subsequent 
production of vehicles for the test group in question if the 
manufacturer elects to recertify to a higher FEL.
    (b) Participation. Participation in the NO<INF>X</INF> averaging, 
trading, and banking program shall be done as follows:
    (1) During certification, the manufacturer shall:
    (i) Declare its intent to include specific test groups in the 
averaging, trading and banking program.
    (ii) Declare an FEL for each test group participating in the 
program.
    (A) The FEL must be to the same level of significant digits as the 
emission standard (one-hundredth of a gram per mile for NO<INF>X</INF> 
emissions).
    (B) In no case may the FEL exceed the upper limit prescribed in the 
section concerning the applicable complete heavy-duty vehicle chassis-
based NO<INF>X</INF> emission standard.
    (iii) Calculate the projected NO<INF>X</INF> emission credits 
(positive or negative) as defined in Sec. 86.1803-01 based on quarterly 
production projections for each participating test group, using the 
applicable equation in paragraph (c) of this section and the applicable 
factors for the specific test group.
    (iv)(A) Determine and state the source of the needed credits 
according to quarterly projected production for test groups requiring 
credits for certification.
    (B) State where the quarterly projected credits will be applied for 
test groups generating credits.
    (C) Emission credits as defined in Sec. 86.1803-01 may be obtained 
from or applied to only test groups within the same averaging set as 
defined in Sec. 86.1803-01. Emission credits available for averaging, 
trading, or banking, may be applied exclusively to a given test group, 
or designated as reserved credits as defined in Sec. 86.1803-01.
    (2) Based on this information, each manufacturer's certification 
application must demonstrate:

[[Page 490]]

    (i) That at the end of model year production, each test group has a 
net emissions credit balance of zero or more using the methodology in 
paragraph (c) of this section with any credits obtained from averaging, 
trading or banking.
    (ii) The source of the credits to be used to comply with the 
emission standard if the FEL exceeds the standard, or where credits will 
be applied if the FEL is less than the emission standard. In cases where 
credits are being obtained, each test group involved must state 
specifically the source (manufacturer/test group) of the credits being 
used. In cases where credits are being generated/supplied, each test 
group involved must state specifically the designated use (manufacturer/
test group or reserved) of the credits involved. All such reports shall 
include all credits involved in averaging, trading or banking.
    (3) During the model year, manufacturers must:
    (i) Monitor projected versus actual production to be certain that 
compliance with the emission standards is achieved at the end of the 
model year.
    (ii) Provide the end-of-year reports required under paragraph (i) of 
this section.
    (iii) For manufacturers participating in emission credit trading, 
maintain the quarterly records required under paragraph (l) of this 
section.
    (4) Projected credits based on information supplied in the 
certification application may be used to obtain a certificate of 
conformity. However, any such credits may be revoked based on review of 
end-of-model year reports, follow-up audits, and any other compliance 
measures deemed appropriate by the Administrator.
    (5) Compliance under averaging, banking, and trading will be 
determined at the end of the model year. Test groups without an adequate 
amount of NO<INF>X</INF> emission credits will violate the conditions of 
the certificate of conformity. The certificates of conformity may be 
voided ab initio for test groups exceeding the emission standard.
    (6) If EPA or the manufacturer determines that a reporting error 
occurred on an end-of-year report previously submitted to EPA under this 
section, the manufacturer's credits and credit calculations will be 
recalculated. Erroneous positive credits will be void. Erroneous 
negative balances may be adjusted by EPA for retroactive use.
    (i) If EPA review of a manufacturer's end-of-year report indicates a 
credit shortfall, the manufacturer will be permitted to purchase the 
necessary credits to bring the credit balance for that test group to 
zero, at the ratio of 1.2 credits purchased for every credit needed to 
bring the balance to zero. If sufficient credits are not available to 
bring the credit balance for the test group in question to zero, EPA may 
void the certificate for that test group ab initio.
    (ii) If within 180 days of receipt of the manufacturer's end-of-year 
report, EPA review determines a reporting error in the manufacturer's 
favor (i.e. resulting in a positive credit balance) or if the 
manufacturer discovers such an error within 180 days of EPA receipt of 
the end-of-year report, the credits will be restored for use by the 
manufacturer.
    (c) Calculations. For each participating test group, NO<INF>X</INF> 
emission credits (positive or negative) are to be calculated according 
to one of the following equations and rounded, in accordance with ASTM 
E29-93a (incorporated by reference at Sec. 86.1), to the nearest one-
tenth of a Megagram (MG). Consistent units are to be used throughout the 
equation.
    (1) For determining credit need for all test groups and credit 
availability for test groups generating credits for averaging only:

Emission credits=(Std-FEL) x (UL) x (Production) x (10<SUP>-6</SUP>)

    (2) For determining credit availability for test groups generating 
credits for trading or banking:

Emission credits=(Std-FEL) x (UL) x (Production) x (10<SUP>-6</SUP>) 
    (Discount)

    (3) For purposes of the equations in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of 
this section:

Std = the current and applicable complete heavy-duty vehicle 
NO<INF>X</INF> emission standard in grams per mile or grams per 
kilometer.
Std = 0.9 grams per mile for heavy-duty vehicles at and above 8,500 
pounds Gross Vehicle Weight Rating but equal to or less than

[[Page 491]]

10,000 Gross Vehicle Weight Rating pounds and 1.0 grams per mile for 
heavy-duty vehicles above 10,000 pounds Gross Vehicle Weight Rating but 
less than 14,000 pounds Gross Vehicle Weight Rating for cases where 
certification to chassis-based standards is optional for purposes of 
early credit banking.
FEL = the NO<INF>X</INF> family emission limit for the test group in 
grams per mile or grams per kilometer.
UL = the useful life, or alternative life as described in paragraph (c) 
of Sec. 86.1805-01, for the given test group in miles or kilometers.
Production = the number of vehicles produced for U.S. sales within the 
given test group during the model year. Quarterly production projections 
are used for initial certification. Actual production is used for end-
of-year compliance determination.
Discount = a one-time discount applied to all credits to be banked or 
traded within the model year generated. Except as otherwise allowed in 
paragraph (m) of this section, the discount applied here is 0.9. Banked 
credits traded in a subsequent model year will not be subject to an 
additional discount. Banked credits used in a subsequent model year's 
averaging program will not have the discount restored.

    (d) Averaging sets. The averaging and trading of NO<INF>X</INF> 
emission credits will be allowed between all test groups of heavy-duty 
vehicles subject to chassis-based standards excluding those vehicles 
produced for sale in California. Averaging, banking, and trading are not 
applicable to vehicles sold in California.
    (e) Banking of NO<INF>X</INF> emission credits--(1) Credit deposits. 
(i) NO<INF>X</INF> emission credits may be banked from test groups 
produced in 2000 and later model years. Early banking is described in 
paragraph (n) of this section.
    (ii) Manufacturers may bank credits only after the end of the model 
year and after actual credits have been reported to EPA in the end-of-
year report. During the model year and before submittal of the end-of-
year report, credits originally designated in the certification process 
for banking will be considered reserved and may be redesignated for 
trading or averaging.
    (2) Credit withdrawals. (i) NO<INF>X</INF> credits do not expire, 
except as provided in paragraph (o)(2) of this section.
    (ii) Manufacturers withdrawing banked emission credits shall 
indicate so during certification and in their credit reports, as 
described in paragraph (i) of this section.
    (3) Use of banked emission credits. The use of banked credits shall 
be within the averaging set and geographic restrictions described in 
paragraph (d) of this section, and only for the following purposes:
    (i) Banked credits may be used in averaging, or in trading, or in 
any combination thereof, during the certification period. Credits 
declared for banking from the previous model year but not reported to 
EPA may also be used. However, if EPA finds that the reported credits 
cannot be proven, they will be revoked and unavailable for use.
    (ii) Banked credits may not be used for averaging and trading to 
offset emissions that exceed an FEL. Banked credits may not be used to 
remedy an in-use nonconformity determined by a Selective Enforcement 
Audit or by recall testing. However, banked credits may be used for 
subsequent production of the test group if the manufacturer elects to 
recertify to a higher FEL.
    (f) Negative credit balance. In the event of a negative credit 
balance in a trading situation, both the buyer and the seller would be 
liable.
    (g) Fuel. Certification fuel used for credit generation must be of a 
type that is both available in use and expected to be used by the 
vehicle purchaser. Therefore, upon request by the Administrator, the 
vehicle manufacturer must provide information acceptable to the 
Administrator that the designated fuel is readily available commercially 
and would be used in customer service.
    (h) Credit apportionment. At the manufacturers option, credits 
generated from complete heavy-duty vehicles under the provisions 
described in this section may be sold to or otherwise provided to 
another party for use in programs other than the averaging, trading and 
banking program described in this section.
    (1) The manufacturer shall pre-identify two emission levels per test 
group for the purposes of credit apportionment. One emission level shall 
be the FEL and the other shall be the level of the standard that the 
test group is required to certify under Sec. 86.1816-04. For

[[Page 492]]

each test group, the manufacturer may report vehicle sales in two 
categories, ``ABT-only credits'' and ``nonmanufacturer-owned credits''.
    (i) For vehicle sales reported as ``ABT-only credits'', the credits 
generated must be used solely in the averaging, trading and banking 
program described in this section.
    (ii) The vehicle manufacturer may declare a portion of vehicle sales 
``nonmanufacturer-owned credits'' and this portion of the credits 
generated between the standard and the FEL, based on the calculation in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, would belong to the vehicle purchaser. 
The manufacturer may not generate any credits for the vehicle sales 
reported as ``nonmanufacturer-owned credits'' for this averaging, 
trading and banking program. Vehicles reported as ``nonmanufacturer-
owned credits'' shall comply with the FEL and the requirements of this 
averaging, trading and banking program in all other respects.
    (2) Only manufacturer-owned credits reported as ``ABT-only credits'' 
shall be used in the averaging, trading, and banking provisions 
described in this section.
    (3) Credits shall not be double-counted. Credits used in this 
averaging, trading and banking program may not be provided to a vehicle 
purchaser for use in another program.
    (4) Manufacturers shall determine and state the number of vehicles 
sold as ``ABT-only credits'' and ``nonmanufacturer-owned credits'' in 
the end-of-model year reports required under paragraph (i) of this 
section.
    (i) Application for certification and end-of-year reports. 
Manufacturers participating in the emissions averaging, trading and 
banking program, shall submit for each participating test group the 
items listed in paragraphs (i)(1) through (3) of this section.
    (1) Application for certification. (i) The application for 
certification will include a statement that the vehicles for which 
certification is requested will not, to the best of the manufacturer's 
belief, when included in the averaging, trading and banking program, 
cause the applicable NO<INF>X</INF> emissions standard to be exceeded.
    (ii) The application for certification will also include 
identification of the section of this subpart under which the test group 
is participating in the averaging, trading and banking program (e.g., 
Sec. 86.1817-05), the type (NO<INF>X</INF>), and the projected number of 
credits generated/needed for this test group, the applicable averaging 
set, the projected U.S. production volumes (excluding vehicles produced 
for sale in California), by quarter, and the values required to 
calculate credits as given in the applicable averaging, trading and 
banking section. Manufacturers shall also submit how and where credit 
surpluses are to be dispersed and how and through what means credit 
deficits are to be met, as explained in the applicable averaging, 
trading and banking section. The application must project that each test 
group will be in compliance with the applicable emission standards based 
on the vehicle mass emissions and credits from averaging, trading and 
banking.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (3) End-of-year report. The manufacturer shall submit end-of-year 
reports for each test group participating in the averaging, trading and 
banking program, as described in paragraphs (i)(3)(i) through (iv) of 
this section.
    (i) These reports shall be submitted within 90 days of the end of 
the model year to: Director, Engine Programs and Compliance Division 
(6405J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW, 
Washington, DC 20460.
    (ii) These reports shall indicate the test group, the averaging set, 
the actual U.S. production volume (excluding vehicles produced for sale 
in California), the values required to calculate credits as given in the 
applicable averaging, trading and banking section, and the resulting 
type and number of credits generated/required. Manufacturers shall also 
submit how and where credit surpluses were dispersed (or are to be 
banked) and how and through what means credit deficits were met. Copies 
of contracts related to credit trading must also be included or supplied 
by the broker if applicable. The report shall also include a calculation 
of credit balances to show that net mass emissions balances are within

[[Page 493]]

those allowed by the emission standards (equal to or greater than a zero 
credit balance). Any credit discount factor described in the applicable 
averaging, trading and banking section must be included as required.
    (iii) The production counts for end-of-year reports shall be based 
on the location of the first point of retail sale (e.g., customer, 
dealer, secondary manufacturer) by the manufacturer.
    (iv) Errors discovered by EPA or the manufacturer in the end-of-year 
report, including changes in the production counts, may be corrected up 
to 180 days subsequent to submission of the end-of-year report. Errors 
discovered by EPA after 180 days shall be corrected if credits are 
reduced. Errors in the manufacturer's favor will not be corrected if 
discovered after the 180 day correction period allowed.
    (j) Failure to submit quarterly or end-of-year reports. Failure by a 
manufacturer participating in the averaging, trading and banking program 
to submit any quarterly or end-of-year report (as applicable) in the 
specified time for all vehicles that are part of an averaging set is a 
violation of section 203(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 
7522(a)(1)) for such vehicles.
    (k) Failure to submit end-of-year reports for banked credits. 
Failure by a manufacturer generating credits for deposit only in the 
complete heavy-duty vehicle banking program to submit their end-of-year 
reports in the applicable specified time period (i.e., 90 days after the 
end of the model year) shall result in the credits not being available 
for use until such reports are received and reviewed by EPA. Use of 
projected credits pending EPA review will not be permitted in these 
circumstances.
    (l) Quarterly records. Any manufacturer producing a test group 
participating in trading using reserved credits, shall maintain the 
following records on a quarterly basis for each test group in the 
trading subclass:
    (1) The test group;
    (2) The averaging set;
    (3) The actual quarterly and cumulative U.S. production volumes 
excluding vehicles produced for sale in California;
    (4) The values required to calculate credits as given in paragraph 
(c) of this section;
    (5) The resulting type and number of credits generated/required;
    (6) How and where credit surpluses are dispersed; and
    (7) How and through what means credit deficits are met.
    (m) Additional flexibility for complete heavy-duty vehicles. If a 
complete heavy-duty vehicle has a NO<INF>X</INF> FEL of 0.6 grams per 
mile or lower, a discount of 1.0 may be used in the trading and banking 
credits calculation for NO<INF>X</INF> described in paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section.
    (n) Early banking for complete heavy-duty vehicles. Provisions set 
forth in paragraphs (a) through (m) of this section apply except as 
specifically stated otherwise in this paragraph (n).
    (1) Early banking eligibility. To be eligible for the early banking 
program described in this paragraph, the following must apply:
    (i) Credits are generated from complete heavy-duty vehicles.
    (ii) During certification, the manufacturer shall declare its intent 
to include specific test groups in the early banking program described 
in this paragraph (n).
    (2) Credit generation and use. (i) Early credits may be generated by 
test groups starting in model year 2000.
    (ii) Credits may only be used for complete heavy-duty vehicles 
subject to chassis-based standards, except as provided by paragraph (o) 
in this section, and all credits shall be subject to discounting and all 
other provisions contained in paragraphs (a) through (m) of this 
section.
    (o) Credit transfers. A manufacturer that elects to comply with 
Option 1 or 2 contained in Sec. 86.005-10(f) may transfer credits 
between its complete vehicle averaging set and its heavy-duty Otto-cycle 
engine averaging set as follows:
    (1) Credits earned in model years 2004 (2003 for Option 1) through 
2007 are eligible to be transferred.
    (2) Transferred credits may not be banked for use in model years 
2008 and later. Credits that are transferred but not used prior to model 
year 2008 must be forfeited.

[[Page 494]]

    (3) Prior to transferring credits, a manufacturer must develop a 
methodology to transfer the credits including a conversion factor that 
may be used to convert between chassis-based credits (derived on a grams 
per mile basis) and equivalent engine-based credits (derived on a grams 
per brake horsepower-hour basis). The methodology must be approved by 
EPA prior to the start of the model year in which the credits are to be 
transferred. The conversion factor must provide reasonable certainty 
that the credits are equivalent for the specific vehicle test group(s) 
and engine family(s) involved in the generation and use of the credits.

<R05>
Sec. 86.1817-08  Complete heavy-duty vehicle averaging, trading, and 
banking program.

    Section 86.1817-08 includes text that specifies requirements that 
differ from Sec. 86.1817-05. Where a paragraph in Sec. 86.1817-05 is 
identical and applicable to Sec. 86.1817-08, this may be indicated by 
specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved]. 
For guidance see Sec. 86.1817-05.''
    (a) through (o) [Reserved]. For guidance see Sec. 86.1817-05.
    (p) The following provisions apply for model year 2008 and later 
engines. These provisions apply instead of the provisions of paragraphs 
Sec. 86.1817-05 (a) through (o) to the extent that they are in conflict.
    (1) Manufacturers of Otto-cycle vehicles may participate in an NMHC 
averaging, banking and trading program to show compliance with the 
standards specified in Sec. 86.1806-08. The generation and use of NMHC 
credits are subject to the same provisions in paragraphs Sec. 86.1817-05 
(a) through (o) that apply for NO<INF>X</INF> credits, except as 
otherwise specified in this section.
    (2) NO<INF>X</INF> or NMHC (or NO<INF>X</INF> plus NMHC) credits may 
be exchanged between heavy-duty Otto-cycle test groups certified to the 
engine standards of subpart A of this part and heavy-duty Otto-cycle 
test groups certified to the chassis standards of this subpart, subject 
to an 0.8 discount factor (e.g., 100 grams of NO<INF>X</INF> credits 
generated from vehicles would be equivalent to 80 grams of 
NO<INF>X</INF> credits if they are used in the engine program of subpart 
A of this part, and vice versa). Credits that were previously discounted 
when they were banked according to Sec. 86.1817-05(c), are subject to an 
additional discount factor of 0.888 instead of the 0.8 discount factor 
otherwise required by this paragraph (p)(2). This results in a total 
discount of 0.8 (0.9 x 0.888 = 0.8).
    (3) Credits are to be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a 
Megagram.
    (4) To calculate credits relative to the NO<INF>X</INF> standards 
listed in Sec. 86.1816-08 (a)(1)(iv)(A) or (a)(2)(iv)(A) (0.2 or 0.4 
grams per mile, respectively) express the standard and FEL to the 
nearest one-hundredth of a gram per mile prior to calculating the 
credits. Thus, either 0.20 or 0.40 should be used as the value for 
``Std''.
    (5) Credits generated for 2008 and later model year test groups are 
not discounted (except as specified in Sec. 86.1817-05(c) and paragraph 
(p)(2) of this section), and do not expire.
    (6) For the purpose of using or generating credits during a phase-in 
of new standards, a manufacturer may elect to split an test group into 
two subgroups: one which uses credits and one which generates credits. 
The manufacturer must indicate in the application for certification that 
the test group is to be split, and may assign the numbers and 
configurations of vehicles within the respective subfamilies at any time 
prior to the submission of the end-of-year report described in 
Sec. 86.1817-05 (i)(3). Manufacturers certifying a split test group may 
label all of the vehicles within that test group with the same FELs: 
either with a NO<INF>X</INF> FEL and an NMHC FEL, or with a single 
NO<INF>X</INF>+NMHC FEL. The FEL(s) on the label will apply for all SEA 
or other compliance testing.
    (7) Vehicles meeting all of the applicable standards of 
Sec. 86.1816-08 prior to model year 2008 may generate NMHC credits for 
use by 2008 or later test groups. Credits are calculated according to 
Sec. 86.1817-05(c), except that the applicable FEL cap listed in

Secs. 86.1818-86.1819  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 86.1820-01  Durability group determination.

    This section applies to the grouping of vehicles into durability 
groups. Manufacturers shall divide their product line into durability 
groups based on the following criteria:
    (a) The vehicles covered by a certification application shall be 
divided into groups of vehicles which are expected to have similar 
emission deterioration and emission component durability characteristics 
throughout their useful life. Manufacturers shall use good engineering 
judgment in dividing their vehicles into durability groups. Such groups 
of vehicles are defined as durability groups.
    (b) To be included in the same durability group, vehicles must be 
identical in all the respects listed in paragraphs (b) (1) through (7) 
of this section:
    (1) Combustion cycle (e.g., two stroke, four stroke, Otto cycle, 
diesel cycle).
    (2) Engine type (e.g., piston, rotary, turbine, air cooled versus 
water cooled).
    (3) Fuel used (e.g., gasoline, diesel, methanol, ethanol, CNG, LPG, 
flexible fuels).
    (4) Basic fuel metering system (e.g., throttle body injection, port 
injection (including central port injection), carburetor, CNG mixer 
unit).
    (5) Catalyst construction (for example, beads or monolith).
    (6) Precious metal composition of the catalyst by the type of 
principal active material(s) used (e.g., platinum based oxidation 
catalyst, palladium based oxidation catalyst, platinum and rhodium 
three-way catalyst, palladium and rhodium three way catalyst, platinum 
and palladium and rhodium three way catalyst).
    (7) The manufacturer must choose one of the following two criteria:
    (i) Grouping statistic:
    (A) Vehicles are grouped based upon the value of the grouping 
statistic determined using the following equation:

GS = [(Cat Vol)/(Disp)] x Loading Rate

Where:

GS = Grouping Statistic used to evaluate the range of precious metal 
loading rates and relative sizing of the catalysts compared to the 
engine displacement that are allowable within a durability group. The 
grouping statistic shall be rounded to a tenth of a gram/liter, in 
accordance with the Rounding-Off Method specified in ASTM E29-93a, 
Standard Practice for Using Significant Digits in Test Data to Determine 
Conformance with Specifications (incorporated by reference, see 
Sec. 86.1).
Cat Vol = Total volume of the catalyst(s) in liters.
Disp = Displacement of the engine in liters.
Loading rate = The mass of total precious metal(s) in the catalyst (or 
the total mass of all precious metal(s) of all the catalysts if the 
vehicle is equipped with multiple catalysts) in grams divided by the 
total volume of the catalyst(s) in liters.

    (B) Engine-emission control system combinations which have a 
grouping statistic which is either less than 25 percent of the largest 
grouping statistic value, or less than 0.2 g/liter (whichever allows the 
greater coverage of the durability group) shall be grouped into the same 
durability group.
    (ii) The manufacturer may elect to use another procedure which 
results in at least as many durability groups as required using criteria 
in paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section providing that only vehicles with 
similar emission deterioration or durability are combined into a single 
durability group.
    (c) Where vehicles are of a type which cannot be divided into 
durability groups based on the criteria listed above (such as non-
catalyst control system approaches), the Administrator will establish 
durability groups for those vehicles based upon the features most 
related to their exhaust emission deterioration characteristics.
    (d) Manufacturers may further divide groups determined under 
paragraph (b) of this section provided the Administrator is notified of 
any such changes prior to or concurrently with the submission of the 
application for certification (preferably at an annual preview meeting 
scheduled before the manufacturer begins certification activities for 
the model year).
    (e) Manufacturers may request the Administrator's approval to 
combine vehicles into a single durability group which would normally not 
be eligible to be in a single durability group. The petition should 
provide:

[[Page 496]]

    (1) Substantial evidence that all the vehicles in the larger 
grouping will have the same degree of emission deterioration;
    (2) Evidence of equivalent component durability over the vehicle's 
useful life; and
    (3) Evidence that the groups will result in sufficient In-Use 
Verification Program data, appropriate tracking in use, and clear 
liability for the Agency's recall program.


<R05>
Sec. 86.1821-01  Evaporative/refueling family determination.

    (a) The gasoline-, methanol-, liquefied petroleum gas-, and natural 
gas-fueled light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks described in a 
certification application will be divided into groupings which are 
expected to have similar evaporative and/or refueling emission 
characteristics (as applicable) throughout their useful life. Each group 
of vehicles with similar evaporative and/or refueling emission 
characteristics shall be defined as a separate evaporative/refueling 
family. Manufacturers shall use good engineering judgment to determine 
evaporative/refueling families.
    (b) For gasoline-fueled or methanol-fueled light-duty vehicles and 
light-duty trucks to be classed in the same evaporative/refueling 
family, vehicles must be similar with respect to the items listed in 
paragraphs (b) (1) through (9) of this section.
    (1) Type of vapor storage device (e.g., canister, air cleaner, 
crankcase).
    (2) Basic canister design.
    (i) Working capacity--grams adsorption within a 10 g. range.
    (ii) System configuration--number of canisters and method of 
connection (i.e., series, parallel).
    (iii) Canister geometry, construction and materials.
    (3) Fuel system.
    (4) Type of refueling emission control system--non-integrated or 
integrated with the evaporative control system. Further, if the system 
is non-integrated, whether or not any other evaporative emissions, e.g. 
diurnal or hot soak emissions, are captured in the same storage device 
as the refueling emissions.
    (5) Fillpipe seal mechanism--mechanical, liquid trap, other.
    (6) Vapor control system or method of controlling vapor flow through 
the vapor line to the canister (for example, type of valve, vapor 
control strategy).
    (7) Purge control system (for example, type of valve, purge control 
strategy).
    (8) Vapor hose material.
    (9) Fuel tank material.
    (c) Where vehicles are of a type which cannot be divided into 
evaporative/refueling families based on the criteria listed above (such 
as non-canister control system approaches), the Administrator will 
establish families for those vehicles based upon the features most 
related to their evaporative and/or refueling emission characteristics.
    (d) Manufacturers may further divide families determined under 
paragraph (b) of this section provided the Administrator is notified of 
any such changes prior to or concurrently with the submission of the 
application for certification (preferably at an annual preview meeting 
scheduled before the manufacturer begins certification activities for 
the model year).
    (e) Manufacturers may petition the Administrator to combine vehicles 
into a single evaporative/refueling family which would normally not be 
eligible to be in a single evaporative/refueling family. The petition 
should provide:
    (1) Substantial evidence that all the vehicles in the larger 
grouping will have the same degree of evaporative emission 
deterioration;
    (2) Evidence of equivalent component durability over the vehicle's 
useful life; and
    (3) Evidence that the groups will result in sufficient In-Use 
Verification Program data, appropriate tracking in use, and clear 
liability for the Agency's recall program.


<R05>
Sec. 86.1822-01  Durability data vehicle selection.

    (a) Within each durability group, the vehicle configuration which is 
expected to generate the highest level of exhaust emission deterioration 
on candidate vehicles in use, considering all constituents, shall be 
selected as the durability data vehicle configuration. The

[[Page 497]]

manufacturer will use good engineering judgment in making this 
selection.
    (b) The manufacturer may select, using good engineering judgment, an 
equivalent or worst-case configuration in lieu of testing the vehicle 
selected in paragraph (a) of this section. Carryover data satisfying the 
provisions of Sec. 86.1839-01 may also be used in lieu of testing the 
configuration selected in paragraph (a) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 86.1823-01  Durability demonstration procedures for exhaust emissions.

    This section applies to light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, 
complete heavy-duty vehicles, and heavy-duty vehicles certified under 
the provisions of Sec. 86.1801-01(c). Eligible small volume 
manufacturers or small volume test groups may optionally meet the 
requirements of Secs. 86.1838-01 and 86.1826-01 in lieu of the 
requirements of this section. For model years 2001, 2002, and 2003 all 
manufacturers may elect to meet the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section in lieu of these requirements for light-duty vehicles or 
light-duty trucks.
    (a) The manufacturer shall propose a durability program consisting 
of the elements discussed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this 
section for advance approval by the Administrator. The durability 
process shall be designed to effectively predict the expected 
deterioration of candidate in-use vehicles over their full and 
intermediate useful life and shall be consistent with good engineering 
judgment. The Administrator will approve the program if he/she 
determines that it is reasonably expected to meet these design 
requirements.
    (1) Service accumulation method. (i) Each durability program shall 
include a service accumulation method designed to effectively predict 
the deterioration of emissions in actual use over the full and 
intermediate useful life of candidate in-use vehicles.
    (ii) Manufacturers may propose service accumulation methods based 
upon whole-vehicle full-mileage accumulation, whole vehicle accelerated 
mileage accumulation (e.g., where 40,000 miles on a severe mileage 
accumulation cycle is equivalent to 100,000 miles of normal in-use 
driving), bench aging of individual components or systems, or other 
approaches approved by the Administrator.
    (A) For whole vehicle mileage accumulation programs, all emission 
control components and systems (including both hardware and software) 
must be installed and operating for the entire mileage accumulation 
period.
    (B) Bench procedures shall simulate the aging of components or 
systems over the applicable useful life and shall simulate driving 
patterns and vehicle operational environments found in actual use. For 
this purpose, manufacturers may remove the emission-related components 
(and other components), in whole or in part, from the durability vehicle 
itself and deteriorate them independently. Vehicle testing for the 
purpose of determining deterioration factors may include the testing of 
durability vehicles that incorporate such bench-aged components.
    (2) Vehicle/component selection method. The manufacturer shall 
propose a vehicle/component selection method for advance approval by the 
Administrator. The procedure for selecting durability data vehicles and 
components shall meet the requirements of Sec. 86.1822-01.
    (3) Use of deterioration program to determine compliance with the 
standard. The manufacturer shall propose procedures for the 
determination of compliance with the standards for advance approval by 
the Administrator. The calculation of deterioration factors and/or the 
determination of vehicle compliance shall be according to the procedures 
approved in advance by the Administrator. The Administrator will allow 
two methods for using the results of the deterioration program to 
determine compliance with the standards. Either a deterioration factor 
(DF) is calculated and applied to the emission data vehicle (EDV) 
emission results or aged components are installed on the EDV prior to 
emission testing. Other methods may be approved by the Administrator if 
they result in an effective prediction of intermediate and full useful 
life emission levels on candidate in-use vehicles.
    (i) Use of deterioration factors. (A) Deterioration factors are 
calculated using all FTP emission test data generated

[[Page 498]]

during the durability testing program except as noted:
    (1) Multiple tests at a given mileage point are averaged together 
unless the same number of tests are conducted at each mileage point.
    (2) Before and after maintenance test results are averaged together.
    (3) Zero-mile test results are excluded from the calculation.
    (4) When calculating intermediate and full useful life deterioration 
factors all data points should be included in the calculations, except 
that total hydrocarbon (THC) test points beyond the 50,000-mile (useful 
life) test point shall not be included in the calculations.
    (5) A procedure may be employed to identify and remove from the DF 
calculation those test results determined to be statistical outliers 
providing that the outlier procedure is consistently applied to all 
vehicles and data points and is approved in advance by the 
Administrator.
    (B) The deterioration factor shall be based on a linear regression, 
or an other regression technique approved in advance by the 
Administrator. The deterioration may be a multiplicative or additive 
factor. Separate factors will be calculated for each regulated emission 
constituent and for the full and intermediate useful life periods as 
applicable. Separate DF's are calculated for each durability group 
except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (1) A multiplicative DF will be calculated by taking the ratio of 
the full or intermediate useful life mileage level, as appropriate 
(rounded to four decimal places), divided by the stabilized mileage 
(reference Sec. 86.1831-01(c), e.g., 4000-mile) level (rounded to four 
decimal places) from the regression analysis; the result shall be 
rounded to three-decimal places of accuracy. The rounding required in 
this paragraph shall be conducted in accordance with the Rounding-Off 
Method specified in ASTM E29-93a, Standard Practice for Using 
Significant Digits in Test Data to Determine Conformance with 
Specifications (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 86.1). Calculated DF 
values of less than one shall be changed to one for the purposes of this 
paragraph.
    (2) An additive DF will be calculated to be the difference between 
the full or intermediate useful life mileage level (as appropriate) 
minus the stabilized mileage (reference Sec. 86.1831-01(c), e.g. 4000-
mile) level from the regression analysis. The full useful life regressed 
emission value, the stabilized mileage regressed emission value, and the 
DF result shall be rounded to the same precision and using the same 
procedures as the raw emission results according to the provisions of 
Sec. 86.1837-01. Calculated DF values of less than zero shall be changed 
to zero for the purposes of this paragraph.
    (C) The DF calculated by these procedures will be used for 
determining compliance with FTP exhaust emission standards, SFTP exhaust 
emission standards, and cold CO emission standards. At the 
manufacturer's option and using procedures approved by the 
Administrator, a separate DF may be calculated exclusively using cold CO 
test data to determine compliance with cold CO emission standards. Also 
at the manufacturer's option and using procedures approved by the 
Administrator, a separate DF may be calculated exclusively using US06 
and/or air conditioning (SC03) test data to determine compliance with 
the SFTP emission standards.
    (ii) Installation of aged components on emission data vehicles. For 
full and intermediate useful life compliance determination, the 
manufacturer may elect to install aged components on an EDV rather than 
applying a deterioration factor. Different sets of components may be 
aged for full and intermediate useful life periods. The list of 
components to be installed, the techniques used to select physical parts 
to be aged, and the aging techniques employed to age the components must 
be approved in advance by the Administrator.
    (b) In addition to the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, 
manufacturers shall submit the following information when applying for 
the Administrator's approval of a durability program:
    (1) Analysis and/or data demonstrating the adequacy of the 
manufacturer's durability processes to effectively predict emission 
compliance for

[[Page 499]]

candidate in-use vehicles. All regulated emission constituents and all 
test procedures shall be considered in this analysis. This data and 
discussion shall cover the breadth of the manufacturer's product line 
that will be covered by this durability procedure.
    (2) Discussion of the manufacturer's in-use verification procedures 
including testing performed, vehicle procurement procedures used, and 
vehicles rejection criteria used. Any questionnaires used or inspections 
performed should also be documented in the manufacturer's submission. 
The in-use verification program shall meet the requirements of 
Secs. 86.1845-01, 86.1846-01 and 86.1847-01.
    (c) Carryover and carryacross. (1) Manufacturers may carry over or 
carry across mileage accumulation data, aged hardware, or deterioration 
factors according to the provisions of Sec. 86.1839-01 using good 
engineering judgment.
    (2) For the 2001, 2002, and 2003 model years, for light-duty 
vehicles and light-duty trucks the manufacturer may carry over exhaust 
emission DF's previously generated under the Standard AMA Durability 
Program described in Sec. 86.094-13(c), the Alternate Service 
Accumulation Durability Program described in Sec. 86.094-13(e) or the 
Standard Self-Approval Durability Program for light-duty trucks 
described in Sec. 86.094-13(f) in lieu of complying with the durability 
provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (i) This provision is limited to the use of existing data used for a 
2000 model year or earlier certification. All new exhaust durability 
data must be generated according to the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section.
    (ii) The manufacturer shall exercise good engineering judgment when 
determining the eligibility to use carryover exhaust emission DF's and 
the selection of the vehicle used as the source of carryover.
    (iii) Starting with the 2004 model year, manufacturers must meet the 
provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (d) Data reporting requirements. Data reporting requirements are 
contained in Sec. 86.1844-01.
    (e) Emission component durability. The manufacturer shall use good 
engineering judgment to determine that all emission-related components 
are designed to operate properly for the full useful life of the 
vehicles in actual use.
    (f) In-use verification. The durability program must meet the 
requirements of Sec. 86.1845-01.
    (g) The manufacturer shall apply the approved durability process to 
a durability group, including durability groups in future model years, 
if the durability process will effectively predict (or alternatively, 
overstate) the deterioration of emissions in actual use over the full 
and intermediate useful life of candidate in-use vehicles. The 
manufacturer shall use good engineering judgment in determining the 
applicability of the durability program to a durability group.
    (1) The manufacturer may make modifications to an approved 
durability process using good engineering judgment for the purpose of 
ensuring that the modified process will effectively predict, (or 
alternatively, overstate) the deterioration of emissions in actual use 
over the full and intermediate useful life of candidate in-use vehicles.
    (2) The manufacturer shall notify the Administrator of its 
determination to use an approved (or modified) durability program on 
particular test groups and durability groups prior to emission data 
vehicle testing for the affected test groups (preferably at an annual 
preview meeting scheduled before the manufacturer begins certification 
activities for the model year).
    (3) Prior to certification, the Administrator may reject the 
manufacturer's determination in paragraph (g) of this section if it is 
not made using good engineering judgment or it fails to properly 
consider data collected under the provisions of Secs. 86.1845-01, 
86.1846-01, and 86.1847-01 or other information if the Administrator 
determines that the durability process has not been shown to effectively 
predict emission levels or compliance with the standards in use on 
candidate vehicles for particular test groups which the manufacturers 
plan to cover with the durability process.
    (h) The Administrator may withdraw approval to use a durability 
process or require modifications to a durability

[[Page 500]]

process based on the data collected under Secs. 86.1845-01, 86.1846-01, 
and 86.1847-01 or other information if the Administrator determines that 
the durability processes have not been shown to accurately predict 
emission levels or compliance with the standards (or FEL, as applicable) 
in use on candidate vehicles (provided the inaccuracy could result in a 
lack of compliance with the standards for a test group covered by this 
durability process). Such withdrawals shall apply to future applications 
for certification and to the portion of the manufacturer's product line 
(or the entire product line) that the Administrator determines to be 
affected. Prior to such a withdrawal the Administrator shall give the 
manufacturer a preliminary notice at least 60 days prior to the final 
decision. During this period, the manufacturer may submit technical 
discussion, statistical analyses, additional data, or other information 
which is relevant to the decision. The Administrator will consider all 
information submitted by the deadline before reaching a final decision.
    (i) Any manufacturer may request a hearing on the Administrator's 
withdrawal of approval in paragraph (h) of this section. The request 
shall be in writing and shall include a statement specifying the 
manufacturer's objections to the Administrator's determinations, and 
data in support of such objection. If, after review of the request and 
supporting data, the Administrator finds that the request raises a 
substantial factual issue, she/he shall provide the manufacturer a 
hearing in accordance with Sec. 86.1853-01 with respect to such issue.

Sec. 86.1824-01  Durability demonstration procedures for evaporative 
emissions.

    This section applies to gasoline-, methanol-, liquefied petroleum 
gas-, and natural gas-fueled LDV/Ts, MDPVs, complete heavy-duty 
vehicles, and heavy-duty vehicles certified under the provisions of 
Sec. 86.1801-01(c). The manufacturer shall determine a durability 
process that will predict the expected evaporative emission 
deterioration of candidate in-use vehicles over their full useful life. 
The manufacturer shall use good engineering judgment in determining this 
process.
    (a) Service accumulation method. (1) The manufacturer shall develop 
a service accumulation method designed to effectively predict the 
deterioration of candidate in-use vehicles' evaporative emissions in 
actual use over its full useful life. The manufacturer shall use good 
engineering judgement in developing this method.
    (2) The manufacturers may develop a service accumulation methods 
based upon whole-vehicle full-mileage accumulation, whole vehicle 
accelerated mileage accumulation (e.g., where 40,000 miles on a severe 
mileage accumulation cycle is equivalent to 100,000 miles of normal in-
use driving), bench aging of individual components or systems, or other 
approaches approved by the Administrator.
    (i) For whole vehicle mileage accumulation programs, all emission 
control components and systems (including both hardware and software) 
must be installed and operating for the entire mileage accumulation 
period.
    (ii) Bench procedures shall simulate the aging of components or 
systems over the applicable useful life and shall simulate driving 
patterns and vehicle operational environments found in actual use. For 
this purpose, manufacturers may remove the emission-related components 
(and other components), in whole or in part, from the durability vehicle 
itself and deteriorate them independently. Vehicle testing for the 
purpose of determining deterioration factors may include the testing of 
durability vehicles that incorporate such bench-aged components.
    (iii) For gasoline fueled vehicles certified to meet the evaporative 
emission standards set forth in Sec. 86.1811-04(e)(1), any service 
accumulation method for evaporative emissions must employ gasoline fuel 
for the entire service accumulation period which contains ethanol in, at 
least, the highest concentration permissible in gasoline under federal 
law and that is commercially available in any state in the United 
States. Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, the manufacturer 
must determine the appropriate ethanol concentration by selecting the

[[Page 501]]

highest legal concentration commercially available during the calendar 
year before the one in which the manufacturer begins its service 
accumulation. The manufacturer must also provide information acceptable 
to the Administrator to indicate that the service accumulation method is 
of sufficient design, duration and severity to stabilize the 
permeability of all non-metallic fuel and evaporative system components 
to the service accumulation fuel constituents.
    (iv) For flexible-fueled, dual-fueled, multi-fueled, ethanol-fueled 
and methanol-fueled vehicles certified to meet the evaporative emission 
standards set forth in Sec. 86.1811-04(e)(1), any service accumulation 
method must employ fuel for the entire service accumulation period which 
the vehicle is designed to use and which the Administrator determines 
will have the greatest impact upon the permeability of evaporative and 
fuel system components. The manufacturer must also provide information 
acceptable to the Administrator to indicate that the service 
accumulation method is of sufficient design, duration and severity to 
stabilize the permeability of all non-metallic fuel and evaporative 
system components to service accumulation fuel constituents.
    (v) A manufacturer may use other methods, based upon good 
engineering judgment, to meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2) 
(iii) and (iv) of this section, as applicable. These methods must be 
approved in advance by the Administrator and meet the objectives of 
paragraphs (a)(2) (iii) and (iv) of this section, as applicable: to 
provide assurance that the permeability of all non-metallic fuel and 
evaporative system components will not lead to evaporative emission 
standard exceedance under sustained exposure to commercially available 
alcohol-containing fuels for the useful life of the vehicle.
    (b) Vehicle/component selection method. The manufacturer shall 
determine a vehicle and component selection procedure which results in 
representative test vehicles and reflects good engineering judgment.
    (c) The manufacturer shall calculate a deterioration factor which is 
applied to the evaporative emission results of the emission data 
vehicles. The deterioration factor shall be based on a linear 
regression, or an other regression technique approved in advance by the 
Administrator. The DF will be calculated to be the difference between 
the full life mileage evaporative level minus the stabilized mileage 
(e.g., 4000-mile) evaporative level from the regression analysis. The DF 
and the full and stabilized mileage emission levels shall be rounded to 
two decimal places of accuracy in accordance with the Rounding-Off 
Method specified in ASTM E29-93a, Standard Practice for Using 
Significant Digits in Test Data to Determine Conformance with 
Specifications (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 86.1(b)(1). 
Calculated DF values of less than zero shall be changed to zero for the 
purposes of this paragraph.
    (d) Emission component durability. The manufacturer shall use good 
engineering judgment to determine that all emission-related components 
are designed to operate properly for the full useful life of the 
vehicles in actual use.
    (e) In-use verification. The durability program must meet the 
requirements of Sec. 86.1845-01.
    (f) Information obtained under Secs. 86.1845-01, 86.1846-01, 
86.1847-01 or from other sources shall be used by the manufacturer in 
developing new durability processes and/or updating existing durability 
processes using good engineering judgment.

Sec. 86.1825-01  Durability demonstration procedures for refueling 
emissions.

    This section applies to light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, and 
complete heavy-duty vehicles, and heavy-duty vehicles which are 
certified under light-duty rules as allowed under the provisions of 
Sec. 86.1801-01(c) which are subject to refueling loss emission 
compliance. Refer to the provisions of Secs. 86.1811-01, 86.1811-04, 
86.1812-01, 86.1813-01, and 86.1816-04 to determine applicability of the 
refueling standards to different classes of vehicles for various model 
years. Diesel fuel vehicles may qualify for an exemption to the 
requirements of this section under the provisions of Sec. 86.1810. The 
manufacturer shall determine a durability process that will predict the 
expected refueling emission deterioration of candidate in-use vehicles 
over their full useful life. The manufacturer shall use good engineering 
judgment in determining this process.
    (a) Service accumulation method. (1) The manufacturer shall develop 
a service accumulation method designed to effectively predict the 
deterioration of candidate in-use vehicles' refueling loss emissions in 
actual use over its full useful life. The manufacturer shall use good 
engineering judgement in developing this method.
    (2) The manufacturers may develop a service accumulation methods 
based upon whole-vehicle full-mileage accumulation, whole vehicle 
accelerated mileage accumulation (e.g., where 40,000 miles on a severe 
mileage accumulation cycle is equivalent to 100,000 miles of normal in-
use driving), bench aging of individual components or systems, or other 
approaches approved by the Administrator.
    (i) For whole vehicle mileage accumulation programs, all emission 
control components and systems (including both hardware and software) 
must be installed and operating for the entire mileage accumulation 
period.
    (ii) Bench procedures shall simulate the aging of components or 
systems over the applicable useful life and shall simulate driving 
patterns and vehicle operational environments found in actual use. For 
this purpose, manufacturers may remove the emission-related components 
(and other components), in whole or in part, from the durability vehicle 
itself and deteriorate them independently. Vehicle testing for the 
purpose of determining deterioration factors may include the testing of 
durability vehicles that incorporate such bench-aged components.
    (b) Vehicle/component selection method. The manufacturer shall 
determine a vehicle and component selection procedure which results in 
representative test vehicles and reflects good engineering judgment.
    (c) The manufacturer shall calculate a deterioration factor which is 
applied to the refueling emission results of the emission data vehicles. 
The deterioration factor shall be based on a linear regression, or an 
other regression technique approved in advance by the Administrator. The 
DF will be calculated to be the difference between the full life mileage 
refueling loss emission level minus the stabilized mileage (e.g., 4000-
mile) refueling loss emission level from the regression analysis. The DF 
and the full and stabilized mileage emission levels shall be rounded to 
two decimal places of accuracy in accordance with the Rounding-Off 
Method specified in ASTM E29-93a, Standard Practice for Using 
Significant Digits in Test Data to Determine Conformance with 
Specifications (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 86.1(b)(1). 
Calculated DF values of less than zero shall be changed to zero for the 
purposes of this paragraph.
    (d) The durability process described in paragraph (a) of this 
section must be described in the application for certification under the 
provisions of Sec. 86.1844-01.
    (e) Emission component durability. The manufacturer shall use good 
engineering judgment to determine that all emission-related components 
are designed to operate properly for the full useful life of the 
vehicles in actual use.
    (f) In-use verification. The durability program must meet the 
requirements of Sec. 86.1845-01.
    (g) Information obtained under Secs. 86.1845-01, 86.1846-01, 
86.1847-01 or from other sources shall be used by the

Sec. 86.1826-01  Assigned deterioration factors for small volume 
manufacturers and small volume test groups.

    (a) Applicability. This program is an option available to small 
volume manufacturers certified under the small volume manufacturer 
provisions of Sec. 86.1838-01(b)(1) and small volume test groups 
certified under the small volume test group provisions of Sec. 86.1838-
01(b)(2). Manufacturers may elect to use these procedures in lieu of the 
requirements of Secs. 86.1823-01, 86.1824-01, and 86.1825-01 of this 
subpart.
    (b) Determination of deterioration factors. No service accumulation 
method or vehicle/component selection method is required. Deterioration 
factors for all types of regulated emissions are determined using the 
provisions in this paragraph. A separate assigned deterioration factor 
is required for each durability group. Manufacturers shall use good 
engineering judgment in determining deterioration factors.
    (1) Manufacturers with aggregated sales of less than 301 motor 
vehicles and motor vehicle engines per year (determined under the 
provisions of Sec. 86.1838-01(b)) may use assigned deterioration factors 
that the Administrator determines and prescribes.
    (i) The deterioration factors will be the Administrator's estimate, 
periodically updated and published in a guidance document or advisory 
circular, of the 70th percentile deterioration factors calculated using 
the industry-wide data base of previously completed durability data 
vehicles or engines used for certification.
    (ii) If there is insufficient deterioration information to calculate 
an appropriate industry-wide deterioration factor (for example: a new 
engine technology coupled with a proven emission control system), the 
Administrator may, at his/her discretion, use alternative methods to 
develop a deterioration factor.
    (2) Manufacturers with aggregated sales from and including 301 
through 14,999 motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines per year 
(determined under the provisions of Sec. 86.1838-01(b)) certifying 
vehicles equipped with proven emission control systems shall conform to 
the following provisions:
    (i) Manufacturers shall use assigned deterioration factors that the 
manufacturer determines based on its good engineering judgment.
    (A) The manufacturer may not use deterioration factors less than 
either the average or 70th percentile of all of that manufacturer's 
deterioration factor data, whichever is less. These minimum 
deterioration factors shall be calculated according to procedures in 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii), of this section.
    (B) If the manufacturer does not have at least two data points to 
calculate these manufacturer specific average deterioration factors, 
then the deterioration factors shall be no less than the EPA supplied 
industry-wide deterioration factors.
    (C) If there is insufficient deterioration information to calculate 
an appropriate industry-wide deterioration factor (for example, a new 
engine technology coupled with a proven emission control system), the 
Administrator may, at his/her discretion, use alternative methods to 
develop a deterioration factor.
    (ii) The manufacturer's minimum deterioration factors shall be 
calculated using the deterioration factors from all durability groups, 
within the same vehicle/engine-fuel usage category (e.g., gasoline-
fueled light-duty vehicle, etc.) previously certified to the same 
emission standards.
    (A) The manufacturer shall use only deterioration factors from 
durability groups whose test groups were previously certified by the 
manufacturer and the deterioration factors shall not be included in the 
calculation more than once.
    (B) The deterioration factors for each pollutant shall be calculated 
separately.
    (C) The manufacturer may, at its option, limit the deterioration 
factors used in the calculation of the manufacturer's minimum 
deterioration factors

[[Page 504]]

to those from all similar emission control systems to the system being 
certified if sufficient data (i.e., from at least two certified systems) 
exists.
    (D) All data eligible to be grouped as similar emission control 
system data shall be used in calculating similar system deterioration 
factors.
    (E) Any deterioration factors used in calculating similar system 
deterioration factors shall not be included in calculating the 
manufacturer's minimum deterioration factors used to certify any of the 
manufacturer's remaining vehicle systems.
    (3) Manufacturers with aggregated sales from 301 through 14,999 
motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines per year (determined under the 
provisions of Sec. 86.1838-01(b)) certifying vehicles equipped with 
unproven emission control systems shall conform to the following 
provisions:
    (i) The manufacturer shall use deterioration factors that the 
manufacturer determines from official certification durability data 
generated by vehicles from durability groups representing a minimum of 
25 percent of the manufacturer's sales equipped with unproven emission 
control systems.
    (ii) The sales projections are to be based on total sales projected 
for each test group.
    (iii) The durability data vehicle mileage accumulation and emission 
tests are to be conducted in accordance with Sec. 86.1831-01.
    (iv) The manufacturer must develop either deterioration factors or 
aged components to use on EDV testing by generating durability data in 
accordance with Sec. 86.1823-01, 86.1824-01, and/or 86.1825-01 on a 
minimum of 25 percent of the manufacturer's projected sales (based on 
durability groups) that is equipped with unproven emission control 
systems.
    (v) The manufacturer must complete the 25 percent durability 
requirement before the remainder of the manufacturer's sales equipped 
with unproven emission control systems is certified using manufacturer-
determined assigned deterioration factors.
    (c) Emission component durability. The manufacturer shall use good 
engineering judgment to determine that all emission-related components 
are designed to operate properly for the useful life of the vehicles in 
actual use (or alternative intervals as permitted in Sec. 86.1805-01).

Sec. 86.1827-01  Test group determination.

    This section applies to the grouping of vehicles into test groups 
within a durability group. The vehicles covered by an application within 
a durability group shall be divided into test groups based on the 
following criteria. The manufacturer shall use good engineering judgment 
in grouping vehicles into test groups.
    (a) To be included in the same test group, vehicles must be 
identical in all following respects:
    (1) Durability group;
    (2) Engine displacement (within a total band width of 15 percent of 
the largest displacement or 50 CID, whichever is larger);
    (3) Number of cylinders or combustion chambers;
    (4) Arrangement of cylinders or combustion chambers (e.g. in-line, 
v-shaped);
    (5) Subject to the same emission standards, except that a 
manufacturer may request to group vehicles into the same test group as 
vehicles subject to more stringent standards, so long as all the 
vehicles within the test group are certified to the most stringent 
standards applicable to any vehicle within that test group. Light-duty 
trucks which are subject to the same emission standards as light-duty 
vehicles with the exception of the light-duty truck idle CO standard 
and/or total HC standard may be included in the same test group.
    (b) Where vehicles are of a type which cannot be divided into test 
groups based on the criteria listed above (such as non-cylinder 
engines), the Administrator will establish test groups for those 
vehicles based upon the features most related to their exhaust emission 
characteristics.
    (c) Manufacturers may further divide groups determined under 
paragraph (a) of this section providing the Administrator is notified in 
advance of any such changes in writing.

[[Page 505]]

    (d) Manufacturers may request the Administrator's approval to 
combine vehicles into a single test group which would normally not be 
eligible to be in a single test group. The petition should provide:
    (1) Substantial evidence that all the vehicles in the larger 
grouping will have the similar levels of emissions;
    (2) Evidence of equivalent component durability over the vehicle's 
useful life;
    (3) Evidence that the groups will result in sufficient in-use 
verification program data, appropriate tracking in use, and clear 
liability for the Agency's recall program; and
    (4) A statement that all vehicles within a test group are certified 
to the most stringent standards applicable to any vehicle within that 
test group.
    (e) Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, a manufacturer 
of hybrid electric vehicles must create separate test groups based on 
both the type of battery technology employed by the HEV and upon 
features most related to their exhaust emission characteristics.

    (a) FTP and SFTP testing. Within each test group, the vehicle 
configuration shall be selected which is expected to be worst-case for 
exhaust emission compliance on candidate in-use vehicles, considering 
all exhaust emission constituents, all exhaust test procedures, and the 
potential impact of air conditioning on test results. The selected 
vehicle will include an air conditioning engine code unless the worst-
case vehicle configuration selected is not available with air 
conditioning. This vehicle configuration will be used as the EDV 
calibration.
    (b) Evaporative/Refueling testing. Vehicles of each evaporative/
refueling family will be divided into evaporative/refueling emission 
control systems.
    (1) The vehicle configuration expected to exhibit the highest

be selected for each evaporative/refueling family and evaporative 
refueling emission system combination from among the corresponding 
vehicles selected for FTP and SFTP testing under paragraph (a) of this 
section. Separate vehicles may be selected to be tested for evaporative 
and refueling testing.
    (2) Each test group must be represented by both evaporative and 
refueling testing (provided that the refueling standards are applicable) 
before it may be certified. That required testing may have been 
conducted on a vehicle in another test group provided the tested vehicle 
is a member of the same evaporative/refueling family and evaporative/
refueling emission system combination and it was selected for testing in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (3) For evaporative/refueling emission testing, the vehicle(s) 
selected shall be equipped with the worst-case evaporative/refueling 
emission hardware available on that vehicle considering such items as 
canister size and material, fuel tank size and material, purge strategy 
and flow rates, refueling characteristics, and amount of vapor 
generation.
    (c) Cold CO testing. For cold temperature CO exhaust emission 
compliance for each durability group, the vehicle expected to emit the 
highest CO emissions at 20 degrees F on candidate in-use vehicles shall 
be selected from the test vehicles selected in accordance with paragraph 
(a) of this section.
    (d) Certification Short Test testing. For CST exhaust emission 
compliance for each durability group, the vehicle expected to emit the 
highest CST emissions on candidate in-use vehicles shall be selected 
from the vehicles selected in accordance with paragraph (a) of this 
section. The manufacturer may elect to submit a compliance statement in 
lieu of test data under the provisions of Sec. 86.1829-01.
    (e) The manufacturer may select, using good engineering judgement, 
an equivalent or worst-case configuration in lieu of testing the vehicle 
selected in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. Carryover data 
satisfying the provisions of Sec. 86.1839-01 may also be used in lieu of 
testing the configuration selected in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this 
section.

[[Page 509]]

upper limit if there are logistical reasons for the deviation and the 
manufacturer determines that the deviation will not affect the 
representativeness of the durability demonstration.
    (2) For DDV's, except as allowed under the bench testing provisions 
of Sec. 86.1823-01, all emission-related hardware and software must be 
installed and operational during all mileage accumulation after the 
5000-mile test point.
    (3) DDV's may be reconfigured before the 5000-mile test point 
providing that the representativeness of the emission results will not 
be affected. Manufacturers shall use good engineering judgment in making 
such determinations.
    (c) Special provisions for emission data vehicles. (1) All EDV's 
shall have at least the minimum number of miles accumulated to achieve 
stabilized emission results according to the provisions of Sec. 86.1831-

emission data vehicle (or other vehicles such as current or previous 
model year emission data vehicles, running change vehicles, fuel economy 
data vehicles, and development vehicles) in lieu of building a new test 
vehicle providing that the modification will not impact the 
representativeness of the vehicle's test results. Manufacturers shall 
use good engineering judgment in making such determinations. Development 
vehicles which were used to develop the calibration selected for 
emission data testing may not be used as the EDV for that configuration. 
Vehicles from outside the durability group may be altered with advance 
approval of the Administrator.
    (3) Components used to reconfigure EDV's under the provisions of 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall be appropriately aged if 
necessary to achieve representative emission results. Manufacturers 
shall determine the need for component aging and the type and amount of 
aging required using good engineering judgment.
    (4) Bench-aged hardware may be installed on an EDV for emission 
testing as a method of determining certification levels (projected 
emission levels at full or intermediate useful life) using bench aging 
procedures approved under the provisions of Sec. 86.1823-01.

shall be conducted within 250 miles of each of the nominal test point 
mileage. This <plus-minus>250 mile test point mileage tolerance may be 
modified with the advance approval of the Administrator if the basis for 
the written request is to prevent an interruption of durability mileage 
accumulation due to test scheduling conflicts for weekends, holidays, or 
other similar circumstances.
    (b) Emission data vehicles and running change vehicles. (1) The 
standard method of service accumulation for emission data vehicles and 
running change vehicles shall be mileage accumulation using the 
Durability Driving Schedule as specified in Appendix IV to this part.
    (2) The manufacturer may use an alternative mileage accumulation 
method providing the form and extent of the service accumulation 
represents normal driving patterns for that vehicle, the method is 
consistent with good engineering judgment, and the method is described 
in the application for certification.
    (3) Except with the advance approval of the Administrator, all 
vehicles will accumulate mileage at a measured curb weight which is 
within 100 pounds of the estimated curb weight. If the loaded vehicle 
weight is within 100 pounds of being included in the next higher inertia 
weight class as specified in Sec. 86.129, the manufacturer may elect to 
conduct the respective emission tests at higher loaded vehicle weight.
    (c) The manufacturer shall determine the mileage at which the 
emission control system and engine combination is stabilized for 
emission-data testing. The manufacturer shall provide to the 
Administrator if requested, a record of the analysis used in making this 
determination. The manufacturer may elect

[[Page 510]]

to accumulate 2,000 miles (3,219 kilometers) or more on each test 
vehicle without making a determination. The manufacturer must accumulate 
a minimum of 1,000 miles (1,608 kilometers) on each emission data 
vehicle.
    (d) All test vehicle mileage must be accurately determined, 
recorded, and reported to the Administrator upon request.

Sec. 86.1832-01  Optional equipment and air conditioning for test vehicles.

    For test vehicles selected under Secs. 86.1822-01 and 86.1828-01:
    (a)(1) Where it is expected that more than 33 percent of a car line, 
within a test group, will be equipped with an item (whether that item is 
standard equipment or an option), the full estimated weight of that item 
must be included in the curb weight computation for each vehicle 
available with that item in that car line, within that test group.
    (2) Where it is expected that 33 percent or less of the car line, 
within a test group, will be equipped with an item (whether that item is 
standard equipment or an option), no weight for that item will be added 
in computing the curb weight for any vehicle in that car line, within 
that test group, unless that item is standard equipment on the vehicle.
    (3) In the case of mutually exclusive options, only the weight of 
the heavier option will be added in computing the curb weight.
    (4) Optional equipment weighing less than three pounds per item need 
not be considered.
    (b)(1) Where it is expected that more than 33 percent of a car line, 
within a test group, will be equipped with an item (whether that item is 
standard equipment or an option) that can reasonably be expected to 
influence emissions, then such items must actually be installed (unless 
excluded under paragraph (b)(2) of this section) on all emission data 
and durability data vehicles of that car line, within that test group, 
on which the items are intended to be offered in production. Items that 
can reasonably be expected to influence emissions include, but are not 
limited to: air conditioning, power steering, and power brakes.
    (2) If the manufacturer determines by test data or engineering 
evaluation that the actual installation of the optional equipment 
required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not affect the 
emissions or fuel economy values, the optional equipment need not be 
installed on the test vehicle.
    (3) The weight of the options must be included in the design curb 
weight and must also be represented in the weight of the test vehicles.
    (4) The engineering evaluation, including any test data, used to 
support the deletion of optional equipment from test vehicles, shall be 
maintained by the manufacturer and be made available to the Agency upon 
request by the Administrator within 15 business days.
    (c) Except for air conditioning, where it is expected that 33 
percent or less of a car line, within a test group, will be equipped 
with an item (whether that item is standard equipment or an option) that 
can reasonably be expected to influence emissions, that item may not be 
installed on any emission data vehicle or durability data vehicle of 
that car line within that test group, unless that item is standard 
equipment on that vehicle or specifically required by the Administrator.
    (d) Air conditioning must be installed and operational on any 
emission data vehicle of any vehicle configuration that is projected to 
be available with air conditioning regardless of the rate of 
installation of air conditioning within the car line. Paragraphs (a) 
through (c) of this section will be used to determine whether the weight 
of the air conditioner will be included in the equivalent test weight 
calculations for emission testing.


<R05>
Sec. 86.1833-01  Adjustable parameters.

    (a) At the time that emission data vehicles are selected for the 
test fleet, a determination shall be made of those vehicle or engine 
parameters which will be subject to adjustment for certification, 
Selective Enforcement Audit and Production Compliance Audit testing, the 
adequacy of the limits, stops, seals, or other means used to inhibit 
adjustment, and the resulting physically adjustable ranges for each such 
parameter. The manufacturer

[[Page 511]]

shall use good engineering judgment in making such determinations and 
shall notify the Administrator of its determinations prior to emission 
data vehicle testing for the affected test groups (preferably at an 
annual preview meeting scheduled before the manufacturer begins 
certification activities for the model year).
    (1) Determining parameters subject to adjustment. (i) The following 
parameters may be subject to adjustment: the idle fuel-air mixture 
parameter on Otto-cycle vehicles; the choke valve action parameter(s) on 
carbureted, Otto-cycle vehicles (or engines); or any parameter on any 
vehicle (Otto-cycle or diesel) which is physically capable of being 
adjusted, may significantly affect emissions, and was not present on the 
manufacturer's vehicles (or engines) in the previous model year in the 
same form and function.
    (ii) Any other parameters on any vehicle or engine which are 
physically capable of being adjusted and which may significantly affect 
emissions may be determined to be subject to adjustment. However, the 
Administrator may do so only if he/she has previously notified the 
manufacturer that he/she might do so and has found, at the time he/she 
gave this notice, that the intervening period would be adequate to 
permit the development and application of the requisite technology, 
giving appropriate consideration to the cost of compliance within such 
period. In no event will this notification be given later than September 
1 of the calendar year two years prior to the model year.
    (iii) In determining the parameters subject to adjustment, the 
following shall be taken into consideration: the likelihood that, for 
each of the parameters listed in paragraphs (e)(1) (i) and (ii) of this 
section, settings other than the manufacturer's recommended setting will 
occur on in-use vehicles (or engines). In determining likelihood, such 
factors may be considered as information contained in the preliminary 
application, surveillance information from similar in-use vehicles, the 
difficulty and cost of gaining access to an adjustment, damage to the 
vehicle if an attempt is made to gain such access and the need to 
replace parts following such attempt, and the effect of settings other 
than the manufacturer's recommended setting on vehicle performance 
characteristics including emission characteristics.
    (2)(i) A parameter may be determined to be adequately inaccessible 
or sealed if:
    (A) In the case of an idle mixture screw, the screw is recessed 
within the carburetor casting and sealed with lead, thermosetting 
plastic, or an inverted elliptical spacer or sheared off after 
adjustment at the factory, and the inaccessibility is such that the 
screw cannot be accessed and/or adjusted with simple tools in one-half 
hour or for $20 (1978 dollars) or less;
    (B) In the case of a choke bimetal spring, the plate covering the 
bimetal spring is riveted or welded in place, or held in place with 
nonreversible screws;
    (C) In the case of a parameter which may be adjusted by elongating 
or bending adjustable members (e.g., the choke vacuum break), the 
elongation of the adjustable member is limited by design or, in the case 
of a bendable member, the member is constructed of a material which when 
bent would return to its original shape after the force is removed 
(plastic or spring steel materials);
    (D) In the case of any parameter, the manufacturer demonstrates that 
adjusting the parameter to settings other than the manufacturer's 
recommended setting takes more than one-half hour or costs more than $20 
(1978 dollars).
    (ii) A physical limit or stop shall be determined to be an adequate 
restraint on adjustability if:
    (A) In the case of a threaded adjustment, the threads are 
terminated, pinned, or crimped so as to prevent additional travel 
without breakage or need for repairs which take more than one-half hour 
or cost more than $20 (1978 dollars);
    (B) The adjustment is ineffective at the end of the limits of travel 
regardless of additional forces or torques applied to the adjustment;
    (C) The manufacturer demonstrates that travel or rotation limits 
cannot be exceeded with the use of simple and inexpensive tools 
(screwdriver, pliers, open-end or box wrenches, etc.) without incurring 
significant and costly

[[Page 512]]

damage to the vehicle or control system or without taking more than one-
half hour or costing more than $20 (1978 dollars).
    (iii) If manufacturer service manuals or bulletins describe routine 
procedures for gaining access to a parameter or for removing or 
exceeding a physical limit, stop, seal or other means used to inhibit 
adjustment, or if surveillance data indicate that gaining access, 
removing, or exceeding is likely, paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this 
section shall not apply for that parameter.
    (iv) In determining the adequacy of a physical limit, stop, seal, or 
other means used to inhibit adjustment of a parameter not covered by 
paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, the following shall be 
considered: the likelihood that it will be circumvented, removed, or 
exceeded on in-use vehicles. In determining likelihood, such factors may 
be considered as, but not limited to, information contained in the 
preliminary application; surveillance information from similar in-use 
vehicles; the difficulty and cost of circumventing, removing, or 
exceeding the limit, stop, seal, or other means; damage to the vehicle 
if an attempt is made to circumvent, remove, or exceed it and the need 
to replace parts following such attempt; and the effect of settings 
beyond the limit, stop, seal, or other means on vehicle performance 
characteristics other than emission characteristics.
    (v) In the case of electronic components on circuit boards (such as 
onboard computers) the board is covered with a epoxy resin which 
inhibits the access to components on the board (commonly referred to as 
potting).
    (3) Two physically adjustable ranges shall be determined for each 
parameter subject to adjustment:
    (i)(A) In the case of a parameter determined to be adequately 
inaccessible or sealed, the following may be included within the 
physically adjustable range applicable to testing under this subpart: 
all settings within the production tolerance associated with the nominal 
setting for that parameter, as specified by the manufacturer in the 
application for certification or other information; or
    (B) In the case of other parameters, all settings within physical 
limits or stops determined to be adequate restraints on adjustability 
shall be included within this range. The production tolerances on the 
location of these limits or stops may be included when determining the 
physically adjustable range.
    (ii)(A) In the case of a parameter determined to be adequately 
inaccessible or sealed, only the actual settings to which the parameter 
is adjusted during production shall be included within the physically 
adjustable range applicable to testing under subparts G or K (Selective 
Enforcement Audit and Production Compliance Audit) of this part; or
    (B) In the case of other parameters, all settings within physical 
limits or stops determined to be adequate restraints on adjustability, 
as they are actually located on the test vehicle, shall be included 
within the range.
    (b) In lieu of making the determinations required in paragraph (a) 
of this section, the manufacturer may request a determination be made by 
the Administrator prior to emission testing. In that case, all the 
information discussed in paragraph (a) of this section shall be provided 
to the Administrator. The Administrator will respond within 90 days 
(excluding the elapsed time during which additional information 
requested by the Administrator is being gathered by the manufacturer) 
following the receipt of the request for determination.
    (c) If the Administrator determines that the decisions made by the 
manufacturer under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section were 
not made using good engineering judgment, the Administrator will 
overrule the manufacturers' decisions and conduct testing for 
Certification, Selective Enforcement Audit and/or Production Compliance 
Audit purposes by adjusting parameters according to his/her 
determination of those vehicle or engine parameters subject to 
adjustment, the adequacy of the limits, stops, seals, or other means 
used to inhibit adjustment, and the resulting physically adjustable 
ranges for each such parameter. Furthermore, the Administrator may 
reject testing performed by the

[[Page 513]]

manufacturer which failed to follow his/her determinations.
    (d) Within 30 days following receipt of notification of the 
Administrator's determinations made under paragraph (b) or (c) of this 
section, the manufacturer may request a hearing on the Administrator's 
determinations. The request shall be in writing, signed by an authorized 
representative of the manufacturer, and shall include a statement 
specifying the manufacturer's objections to the Administrator's 
determinations, and data in support of such objections. If, after review 
of the request and supporting data, the Administrator finds that the 
request raises a substantial factual issue, he shall provide the 
manufacturer a hearing in accordance with Sec. 86.1853-01 with respect 
to such issue.


<R05>
Sec. 86.1834-01  Allowable maintenance.

    (a) Maintenance performed on vehicles, engines, subsystems, or 
components used to determine exhaust, evaporative or refueling emission 
deterioration factors, as appropriate, is classified as either emission-
related or non-emission-related and each of these can be classified as 
either scheduled or unscheduled. Further, some emission-related 
maintenance is also classified as critical emission-related maintenance.
    (b) This section specifies emission-related scheduled maintenance 
for purposes of obtaining durability data and for inclusion in 
maintenance instructions furnished to purchasers of new motor vehicles 
and under Sec. 86.1808-01.
    (1) All emission-related scheduled maintenance for purposes of 
obtaining durability data must occur at the same mileage intervals (or 
equivalent intervals if engines, subsystems, or components are used) 
that will be specified in the manufacturer's maintenance instructions 
furnished to the ultimate purchaser of the motor vehicle or engine under 
Sec. 86.1808-01. This maintenance schedule may be updated as necessary 
throughout the testing of the vehicle/engine, provided that no 
maintenance operation is deleted from the maintenance schedule after the 
operation has been performed on the test vehicle or engine.
    (2) Any emission-related maintenance which is performed on vehicles, 
engines, subsystems, or components must be technologically necessary to 
assure in-use compliance with the emission standards. Manufacturers 
shall determine the technological need for maintenance using good 
engineering judgment. The Administrator has determined that emission-
related maintenance at shorter intervals than those outlined in 
paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section is not technologically 
necessary to ensure in-use compliance. However, the Administrator may 
determine that maintenance even more restrictive (e.g., longer 
intervals) than that listed in paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section 
is also not technologically necessary.
    (3) Emission-related maintenance in addition to, or at shorter 
intervals than, that listed in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (vi) of this 
section will not be accepted as technologically necessary, except as 
provided in paragraph (b)(7) of this section.
    (i)(A) The cleaning or replacement of light-duty vehicle or light-
duty truck spark plugs shall occur at 30,000 miles of use and at 30,000-
mile intervals thereafter.
    (B) The cleaning or replacement of complete heavy-duty vehicle spark 
plugs shall occur at 25,000 miles (or 750 hours) of use and at 30,000-
mile (or 750 hour) intervals thereafter, for vehicles certified for use 
with unleaded fuel only.
    (ii) For light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, the adjustment, 
cleaning, repair, or replacement of the following items shall occur at 
50,000 miles of use and at 50,000-mile intervals thereafter:
    (A) Positive crankcase ventilation valve.
    (B) Emission-related hoses and tubes.
    (C) Ignition wires.
    (D) Idle mixture.
    (iii) For complete heavy-duty vehicles, the adjustment, cleaning, 
repair, or replacement of the following items shall occur at 50,000 
miles (or 1,500 hours) of use and at 50,000-mile (1,500 hour) intervals 
thereafter:
    (A) Positive crankcase ventilation valve.
    (B) Emission-related hoses and tubes.
    (C) Ignition wires.
    (D) Idle mixture.

[[Page 514]]

    (E) Exhaust gas recirculation system related filters and coolers.
    (iv) For light-duty trucks, light-duty vehicles, and complete heavy-
duty vehicles, the adjustment, cleaning, repair, or replacement of the 
oxygen sensor shall occur at 80,000 miles (or 2,400 hours) of use and at 
80,000-mile (or 2,400-hour) intervals thereafter.
    (v) For light-duty trucks and light-duty vehicles, the adjustment, 
cleaning, repair, or replacement of the following items shall occur at 
100,000 miles of use and at 100,000-mile intervals thereafter:
    (A) Catalytic converter.
    (B) Air injection system components.
    (C) Fuel injectors.
    (D) Electronic engine control unit and its associated sensors 
(except oxygen sensor) and actuators.
    (E) Evaporative and/or refueling emission canister(s).
    (F) Turbochargers.
    (G) Carburetors.
    (H) Superchargers.
    (I) Exhaust gas recirculation system including all related filters 
and control valves.
    (J) Mechanical fillpipe seals.
    (vi) For complete heavy-duty vehicles, the adjustment, cleaning, 
repair, or replacement of the following items shall occur at 100,000 
miles (or 3,000 hours) of use and at 100,000-mile (or 3,000 hour) 
intervals thereafter:
    (A) Catalytic converter.
    (B) Air injection system components.
    (C) Fuel injectors.
    (D) Electronic engine control unit and its associated sensors 
(except oxygen sensor) and actuators.
    (E) Evaporative and/or refueling emission canister(s).
    (F) Turbochargers.
    (G) Carburetors.
    (H) Exhaust gas recirculation system (including all related control 
valves and tubing) except as otherwise provided in paragraph 
(b)(3)(iii)(E) of this section.
    (I) Mechanical fillpipe seals.
    (4) For diesel-cycle light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, 
emission-related maintenance in addition to, or at shorter intervals 
than the following will not be accepted as technologically necessary, 
except as provided in paragraph (b)(6) of this section:
    (i) The adjustment, cleaning, repair, or replacement of the positive 
crankcase ventilation valve shall occur at 50,000 miles of use and at 
50,000-mile intervals thereafter.
    (ii) The adjustment, cleaning, repair, or replacement shall occur at 
100,000 miles of use and at 100,000-mile intervals thereafter of the 
following items:
    (A) Fuel injectors.
    (B) Turbocharger.
    (C) Electronic engine control unit and its associated sensors and 
actuators.
    (D) Particulate trap or trap-oxidizer system (including related 
components).
    (E) Exhaust gas recirculation system including all related filters 
and control valves.
    (F) Catalytic converter.
    (G) Superchargers.
    (5) [Reserved]
    (6) Critical emission-related components. (i) The following 
components are defined as critical emission-related components:
    (A) Catalytic converter.
    (B) Air injection system components.
    (C) Electronic engine control unit and its associated sensors 
(including oxygen sensor if installed) and actuators.
    (D) Exhaust gas recirculation system (including all related filters 
and control valves).
    (E) Positive crankcase ventilation valve.
    (F) Evaporative and refueling emission control system components 
(excluding canister air filter).
    (G) Particulate trap or trap-oxidizer system.
    (H) Any other add-on emissions-related component (i.e., a component 
whose sole or primary purpose is to reduce emissions or whose failure 
will significantly degrade emissions control and whose function is not 
integral to the design and performance of the engine.)
    (ii) All critical emission-related scheduled maintenance must have a 
reasonable likelihood of being performed in use. The manufacturer shall 
be required to show the reasonable likelihood of such maintenance being 
performed in use, and such showing shall be made prior to the 
performance of the maintenance on the durability

[[Page 515]]

data vehicle. Critical emission-related scheduled maintenance items 
which satisfy one of the conditions defined in paragraphs (b)(5)(ii) (A) 
through (F) of this section will be accepted as having a reasonable 
likelihood of the maintenance item being performed in use.
    (A) Data are presented which establish for the Administrator a 
connection between emissions and vehicle performance such that as 
emissions increase due to lack of maintenance, vehicle performance will 
simultaneously deteriorate to a point unacceptable for typical driving.
    (B) Survey data are submitted which adequately demonstrate to the 
Administrator that, at an 80 percent confidence level, 80 percent of 
such engines already have this critical maintenance item performed in 
use at the recommended interval(s).
    (C) A clearly displayed visible signal system approved by the 
Administrator is installed to alert the vehicle driver that maintenance 
is due. A signal bearing the message ``maintenance needed'' or ``check 
engine,'' or a similar message approved by the Administrator, shall be 
actuated at the appropriate mileage point or by component failure. This 
signal must be continuous while the engine is in operation and not be 
easily eliminated without performance of the required maintenance. 
Resetting the signal shall be a required step in the maintenance 
operation. The method for resetting the signal system shall be approved 
by the Administrator.
    (D) A manufacturer may desire to demonstrate through a survey that a 
critical maintenance item is likely to be performed without a visible 
signal on a maintenance item for which there is no prior in-use 
experience without the signal. To that end, the manufacturer may in a 
given model year market up to 200 randomly selected vehicles per 
critical emission-related maintenance item without such visible signals, 
and monitor the performance of the critical maintenance item by the 
owners to show compliance with paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B) of this section. 
This option is restricted to two consecutive model years and may not be 
repeated until any previous survey has been completed. If the critical 
maintenance involves more than one test group, the sample will be sales 
weighted to ensure that it is representative of all the groups in 
question.
    (E) The manufacturer provides the maintenance free of charge, and 
clearly informs the customer that the maintenance is free in the 
instructions provided under Sec. 86.1808-01.
    (F) Any other method which the Administrator approves as 
establishing a reasonable likelihood that the critical maintenance will 
be performed in use.
    (iii) Visible signal systems used under paragraph (b)(6)(ii)(C) of 
this section are considered an element of design of the emission control 
system. Therefore, disabling, resetting, or otherwise rendering such 
signals inoperative without also performing the indicated maintenance 
procedure is a prohibited act under section 203(a)(3) of the Clean Air 
Act (42 U.S.C. 7522(a)(3)).
    (7) Changes to scheduled maintenance. (i) For maintenance practices 
that existed prior to the 1980 model year, only the maintenance items 
listed in paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section are currently 
considered by EPA to be emission-related. The Administrator may, 
however, determine additional scheduled maintenance items that existed 
prior to the 1980 model year to be emission-related by announcement in a 
Federal Register Notice. In no event may this notification occur later 
than September 1 of the calendar year two years prior to the affected 
model year.
    (ii) In the case of any new scheduled maintenance, the manufacturer 
must submit a request for approval to the Administrator for any 
maintenance that it wishes to recommend to purchasers and perform during 
durability determination. New scheduled maintenance is that maintenance 
which did not exist prior to the 1980 model year, including that which 
is a direct result of the implementation of new technology not found in 
production prior to the 1980 model year. The manufacturer must also 
include its recommendations as to the category (i.e., emission-related 
or non-emission-related, critical or non-critical) of the subject 
maintenance and, for suggested emission-related maintenance, the maximum 
feasible maintenance interval. Such requests must include detailed 
evidence

[[Page 516]]

supporting the need for the maintenance requested, and supporting data 
or other substantiation for the recommended maintenance category and for 
the interval suggested for emission-related maintenance. Requests for 
new scheduled maintenance must be approved prior to the introduction of 
the new maintenance. The Administrator will then designate the 
maintenance as emission-related or non-emission-related. For maintenance 
items established as emission-related, the Administrator will further 
designate the maintenance as critical if the component which receives 
the maintenance is a critical component under paragraph (b)(6) of this 
section. For each maintenance item designated as emission-related, the 
Administrator will also establish a technologically necessary 
maintenance interval, based on industry data and any other information 
available to EPA. Designations of emission-related maintenance items, 
along with their identification as critical or non-critical, and 
establishment of technologically necessary maintenance intervals, will 
be announced in the Federal Register.
    (iii) Any manufacturer may request a hearing on the Administrator's 
determinations in this paragraph (b)(7). The request shall be in writing 
and shall include a statement specifying the manufacturer's objections 
to the Administrator's determinations, and data in support of such 
objections. If, after review of the request and supporting data, the 
Administrator finds that the request raises a substantial factual issue, 
he shall provide the manufacturer a hearing in accordance with 
Sec. 86.1853-01 with respect to such issue.
    (c) Non-emission-related scheduled maintenance which is reasonable 
and technologically necessary (e.g., oil change, oil filter change, fuel 
filter change, air filter change, cooling system maintenance, adjustment 
of idle speed, governor, engine bolt torque, valve lash, injector lash, 
timing, adjustment of air pump drive belt tension, lubrication of the 
exhaust manifold heat control valve, lubrication of carburetor choke 
linkage, re-torquing carburetor mounting bolts, etc.) may be performed 
on durability data vehicles at the least frequent intervals recommended 
by the manufacturer to the ultimate purchaser, (e.g., not at the 
intervals recommended for severe service).
    (d) Unscheduled maintenance on durability data vehicles. (1) 
Unscheduled maintenance may be performed during the testing used to 
determine deterioration factors, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) 
and (3) of this section, only under the following provisions defined in 
paragraphs (d)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section:
    (i) A fuel injector or spark plug may be changed if a persistent 
misfire is detected.
    (ii) Readjustment of an Otto-cycle vehicle cold-start enrichment 
system may be performed if there is a problem of stalling.
    (iii) Readjustment of the engine idle speed (curb idle and fast 
idle) may be performed in addition to that performed as scheduled 
maintenance under paragraph (c) of this section if the idle speed 
exceeds the manufacturer's recommended idle speed by 300 rpm or more, or 
if there is a problem of stalling.
    (2) Any other unscheduled vehicle, emission control system, or fuel 
system adjustment, repair, removal, disassembly, cleaning, or 
replacement during testing to determine deterioration factors shall be 
performed (using good engineering judgment) only in the following 
circumstances:
    (i) The part failure or system malfunction, or the repair of such 
failure or malfunction, does not render the vehicle or engine 
unrepresentative of vehicles or engines in use and does not require 
direct access to the combustion chamber, except for spark plug, fuel 
injection component, or removable prechamber removal or replacement.
    (ii) The need for maintenance or repairs is indicated by an overt 
indication of malfunction such as persistent misfiring, engine stalling, 
overheating, fluid leakage, loss of oil pressure, excessive fuel 
consumption, or excessive power loss. The Administrator shall be given 
the opportunity to verify the existence of an overt indication of part 
failure and/or vehicle/engine malfunction (e.g., misfiring, stalling, 
black smoke), or an activation of an audible

[[Page 517]]

and/or visible signal, prior to the performance of any maintenance to 
which such overt indication or signal is relevant under the provisions 
of this section.
    (iii) The OBD system of a durability data vehicle representing an 
test group certifying fully to the Federal OBD requirements as specified 
in Sec. 86.1806-01(a) through (h) has specifically detected the problem 
and has illuminated the malfunction indicator light.
    (3) Emission measurement may not be used as a means of determining 
the need for unscheduled maintenance under paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section, except under the following conditions:
    (i) The Administrator may approve unscheduled maintenance on 
durability data vehicles based upon a significant change in emission 
levels that indicates a vehicle or engine malfunction. In these cases 
the Administrator may first approve specific diagnostic procedures to 
identify the source of the problem. The Administrator may further 
approve of specific corrections to the problem after the problem has 
been identified. The Administrator may only approve the corrective 
action after it is determined that:
    (A) The malfunction was caused by nonproduction build practices or 
by a previously undetected design problem;
    (B) The malfunction will not occur in production vehicles or engines 
in use; and
    (C) The deterioration factor generated by the durability data 
vehicle or engine will remain unaffected by the malfunction or by the 
corrective action (e.g., the malfunction was present for only a short 
period of time before detection, replacement parts are functionally 
representative of the proper mileage or hours, etc.).
    (ii) Following any unscheduled maintenance approved under paragraph 
(d)(3)(i) of this section, the manufacturer shall perform an after-
maintenance emission test. If the Administrator determines that the 
after-maintenance emission levels for any pollutant indicates that the 
deterioration factor is no longer representative of production, the 
Administrator may disqualify the durability data vehicle or engine.
    (4) If a part failure or system malfunction occurrence and/or repair 
has rendered the vehicle/engine unrepresentative of vehicles in use, the 
vehicle/engine shall not be used for determining deterioration factors.
    (5) Repairs to vehicle components of a durability data vehicle other 
than the engine, emission control system, or fuel system, shall be 
performed only as a result of part failure, vehicle system malfunction, 
or with the advance approval of the Administrator.
    (e) Maintenance on emission data vehicles and engines. (1) 
Adjustment of engine idle speed on emission data vehicles may be 
performed once before the low-mileage/low-hour emission test point. Any 
other engine, emission control system, or fuel system adjustment, 
repair, removal, disassembly, cleaning, or replacement on emission data 
vehicles shall be performed only with the advance approval of the 
Administrator.
    (2) Repairs to vehicle components of an emission data vehicle other 
than the engine, emission control system, or fuel system, shall be 
performed only as a result of part failure, vehicle system malfunction, 
or with the advance approval of the Administrator.
    (f) Equipment, instruments, or tools may not be used to identify 
malfunctioning, maladjusted, or defective engine components unless the 
same or equivalent equipment, instruments, or tools will be available to 
dealerships and other service outlets and:
    (1) Are used in conjunction with scheduled maintenance on such 
components; or
    (2) Are used subsequent to the identification of a vehicle or engine 
malfunction, as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section for 
durability data vehicles or in paragraph (e)(1) of this section for 
emission data vehicles; or
    (3) Unless specifically authorized by the Administrator.
    (g) Complete emission tests (see Secs. 86.106-96 through 86.145-82) 
are required, unless waived by the Administrator, before and after 
scheduled maintenance approved for durability data vehicles. The 
manufacturer may perform emission tests before unscheduled maintenance. 
Complete emission tests are required after unscheduled maintenance which 
may reasonably be

[[Page 518]]

expected to affect emissions. The Administrator may waive the 
requirement to test after unscheduled maintenance. These test data may 
be submitted weekly to the Administrator, but shall be air posted or 
delivered within 7 days after completion of the tests, along with a 
complete record of all pertinent maintenance, including a preliminary 
engineering report of any malfunction diagnosis and the corrective 
action taken. A complete engineering report shall be delivered to the 
Administrator concurrently with the manufacturer's application for 
certification.
    (h) When air conditioning SFTP exhaust emission tests are required, 
the manufacturer must document that the vehicle's air conditioning 
system is operating properly and in a representative condition. Required 
air conditioning system maintenance is performed as unscheduled 
maintenance and does not require the Administrator's approval.

Sec. 86.1835-01  Confirmatory certification testing.

    (a) Testing by the Administrator. (1) The Administrator may require 
that any one or more of the test vehicles be submitted to the Agency, at 
such place or places as the Agency may designate, for the purposes of 
conducting emissions tests. The Administrator may specify that such 
testing be conducted at the manufacturer's facility, in which case 
instrumentation and equipment specified by the Administrator shall be 
made available by the manufacturer for test operations. Any testing 
conducted at a manufacturer's facility pursuant to this paragraph shall 
be scheduled by the manufacturer as promptly as possible.
    (i) The Administrator may adjust or cause to be adjusted any 
adjustable parameter of an emission-data vehicle which the Administrator 
has determined to be subject to adjustment for certification testing in 
accordance with Sec. 86.1833-01(a)(1), to any setting within the 
physically adjustable range of that parameter, as determined by the 
Administrator in accordance with Sec. 86.1833-01(a)(3), prior to the 
performance of any tests to determine whether such vehicle or engine 
conforms to applicable emission standards, including tests performed by 
the manufacturer under Sec. 86.1829-01(b). However, if the idle speed 
parameter is one which the Administrator has determined to be subject to 
adjustment, the Administrator shall not adjust it to a setting which 
causes a higher engine idle speed than would have been possible within 
the physically adjustable range of the idle speed parameter on the 
engine before it accumulated any dynamometer service, all other 
parameters being identically adjusted for the purpose of the comparison. 
The Administrator, in making or specifying such adjustments, will 
consider the effect of the deviation from the manufacturer's recommended 
setting on emissions performance characteristics as well as the 
likelihood that similar settings will occur on in-use light-duty 
vehicles, light-duty trucks, or complete heavy-duty vehicles. In 
determining likelihood, the Administrator will consider factors such as, 
but not limited to, the effect of the adjustment on vehicle performance 
characteristics and surveillance information from similar in-use 
vehicles.
    (ii) For those vehicles parameters which the Administrator has not 
determined to be subject to adjustment during testing in accordance with 
Sec. 86.1833-01(a)(1), the vehicle presented to the Administrator for 
testing shall be calibrated within the production tolerances applicable 
to the manufacturer's specifications to be shown on the vehicle label 
(see Sec. 86.1807-01) as specified in the application for certification. 
If the Administrator determines that a vehicle is not within such 
tolerances, the vehicle will be adjusted, at the facility designated by 
the Administrator, prior to the test and an engineering report shall be 
submitted to the Administrator describing the corrective action taken. 
Based on the engineering report, the Administrator will determine if the 
vehicle will be used as an emission data vehicle.
    (2) If the Administrator determines that the test data developed on 
an emission data vehicle under paragraph (a)(1) of this section would 
cause that vehicle to fail under the provisions of

[[Page 519]]

Sec. 86.1841-01, then the following procedure shall be observed:
    (i) The manufacturer may request a retest. Before the retest, those 
vehicle or engine parameters which the Administrator has not determined 
to be subject to adjustment for certification testing in accordance with 
Sec. 86.1833-01(a)(1) may be readjusted to manufacturer's specification, 
if these adjustments were made incorrectly prior to the first test. The 
Administrator may adjust or cause to be adjusted any parameter which the 
Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment to any setting 
within the physically adjustable range of that parameter, as determined 
by the Administrator in accordance with Sec. 86.1833-01(a)(3). Other 
maintenance or repairs may be performed in accordance with Sec. 86.1834-
01. All work on the vehicle shall be done at such location and under 
such conditions as the Administrator may prescribe.
    (ii) The vehicle will be retested by the Administrator and the 
results of this test shall comprise the official data for the emission-
data vehicle.
    (3) If sufficient durability data are not available at the time of 
any emission test conducted under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to 
enable the Administrator to determine whether an emission-data vehicle 
would fail, the manufacturer may request a retest in accordance with the 
provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section. If the manufacturer does 
not promptly make such request, he shall be deemed to have waived the 
right to a retest. A request for retest must be made before the 
manufacturer removes the vehicle from the test premises.
    (4) Retesting for fuel economy reasons may be conducted under the 
provisions of 40 CFR 600.008-01.
    (b) Manufacturer-conducted confirmatory testing. (1) If the 
Administrator determines not to conduct a confirmatory test under the 
provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, light-duty vehicle and 
light-duty truck manufacturers will conduct a confirmatory test at their 
facility after submitting the original test data to the Administrator 
whenever any of the conditions listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through 
(v) of this section exist, and complete heavy-duty vehicles 
manufacturers will conduct a confirmatory test at their facility after 
submitting the original test data to the Administrator whenever the 
conditions listed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section 
exist, as follows:
    (i) The vehicle configuration has previously failed an emission 
standard;
    (ii) The test exhibits high emission levels determined by exceeding 
a percentage of the standards specified by the Administrator for that 
model year;
    (iii) The fuel economy value of the test as measured in accordance 
with the procedures in 40 CFR Part 600 is higher than expected based on 
procedures approved by the Administrator;
    (iv) The fuel economy value as measured in accordance with the 
procedures in Part 600 of this title, is close to a Gas Guzzler Tax 
threshold value based on tolerances established by the Administrator for 
that model year; or
    (v) The fuel economy value as measured in accordance with the 
procedures in Part 600 of this title, is a potential fuel economy leader 
for a class of vehicles based on Administrator provided cut points for 
that model year.
    (2) If the Administrator selects the vehicle for confirmatory 
testing based on the manufacturer's original test results, the testing 
shall be conducted as ordered by the Administrator. In this case, the 
manufacturer-conducted confirmatory testing specified under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section would not be required.
    (3) For light-duty vehicles, and light-duty trucks, the manufacturer 
shall conduct a retest of the FTP or highway test if the difference 
between the fuel economy of the confirmatory test and the original 
manufacturer's test equals or exceeds three percent (or such lower 
percentage to be applied consistently to all manufacturer conducted 
confirmatory testing as requested by the manufacturer and approved by 
the Administrator).
    (i) For use in the fuel economy program described in 40 CFR part 
600, the manufacturer may, in lieu of conducting a retest, accept as 
official the lower of the original and confirmatory test fuel economy 
results.
    (ii) The manufacturer shall conduct a second retest of the FTP or 
highway

[[Page 520]]

test if the fuel economy difference between the second confirmatory test 
and the original manufacturer test equals or exceeds three percent (or 
such lower percentage as requested by the manufacturer and approved by 
the Administrator) and the fuel economy difference between the second 
confirmatory test and the first confirmatory test equals or exceeds 
three percent (or such lower percentage as requested by the manufacturer 
and approved by the Administrator). In lieu of conducting a second 
retest, the manufacturer may accept as official (for use in the fuel 
economy program) the lowest of the original test, the first confirmatory 
test, and the second confirmatory test fuel economy results.
    (c) Official test determination. (1) Whenever the Administrator or 
the manufacturer conducts a confirmatory test segment on a test vehicle, 
the results of that test segment, unless subsequently invalidated by the 
Administrator, shall comprise the official data for that test segment 
for the vehicle at the prescribed test point and the manufacturer's 
original test data for that test segment for that prescribed test point 
shall not be used in determining compliance with emission standards.
    (i) If the Administrator or the manufacturer conducts more than one 
passing, valid, confirmatory test, the results from the first passing, 
valid confirmatory test shall be considered official and used in 
determining compliance with emission standards.
    (ii) Official test results for fuel economy purposes are determined 
in accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR 600.008-01.
    (iii) The Administrator may stop a test after any evaporative test 
segment and use as official data any valid results obtained up to that 
point in the test, as described in subpart B of this part.
    (2) Whenever the Administrator or the manufacturer does not conduct 
a confirmatory test on a test vehicle at a test point, the 
manufacturer's original test data will be accepted as the official data 
for that point.
    (i) If the Administrator makes a determination based on testing 
under paragraph (a) of this section (or other appropriate correlation 
test data), that there is a lack of correlation between the 
manufacturer's test equipment or procedures and the test equipment or 
procedures used by the Administrator, no manufacturer's test data will 
be accepted for purposes of certification until the reasons for the lack 
of correlation are determined and the validity of the data is 
established by the manufacturer.
    (ii) If the Administrator has reasonable basis to believe that any 
test data submitted by the manufacturer is not accurate or has been 
obtained in violation of any provisions of this subpart, the 
Administrator may refuse to accept that data as the official data 
pending retesting or submission of further information.
    (iii) If the manufacturer conducts more than one test on an emission 
data vehicle in the same configuration (excluding confirmatory tests run 
under paragraph (b) of this section), the data from the last test in 
that series of tests on that vehicle, will constitute the official data.
    (d) Upon request of the manufacturer, the Administrator may issue a 
conditional certificate of conformity for a test group which has not 
completed the Administrator testing required under paragraph (a) of this 
section. Such a certificate will be issued based upon the condition that 
the confirmatory testing be completed in an expedited manner and that 
the results of the testing be in compliance with all standards and 
procedures.
    (1) If, based on this testing or any other information, the 
Administrator later determines that the vehicles included in this test 
group do not meet the applicable standards, the Administrator will 
notify the manufacturer that the certificate is suspended. The 
certificate may be suspended in whole or in part as determined by the 
Administrator. Upon such a notification, the manufacturer must 
immediately cease the introduction of the affected vehicles into 
commerce. The manufacturer may request a hearing to appeal the 
Administrators decision using the provisions of Sec. 86.1853-01.
    (2) Production of vehicles by a manufacturer under the terms of this 
paragraph (d) will be deemed to be a consent to recall all vehicles in 
the test

[[Page 521]]

group which the Administrator determines do not meet applicable 
standards, and to cause such nonconformity to be remedied at no expense 
to the owner.

Sec. 86.1836-01  Manufacturer-supplied production vehicles for testing.

    Any manufacturer obtaining certification under this subpart shall 
supply to the Administrator, upon request, a reasonable number of 
production vehicles selected by the Administrator which are 
representative of the engines, emission control systems, fuel systems, 
and transmission offered and typical of production models available for 
sale under the certificate. These vehicles shall be supplied for testing 
at such time and place and for such reasonable periods as the 
Administrator may require.

Sec. 86.1837-01  Rounding of emission measurements.

    (a) Unless otherwise specified, the results of all emission tests 
shall be rounded to the number of places to the right of the decimal 
point indicated by expressing the applicable emission standard of this 
subpart to one additional significant figure, in accordance with the 
Rounding-Off Method specified in ASTM E29-93a, Standard Practice for 
Using Significant Digits in Test Data to Determine Conformance with 
Specifications (incorporated by reference; see Sec. 86.1).
    (b) Fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> value calculations, where 
applicable, must be rounded before comparing with the applicable fleet 
average standard and calculating credits generated or needed as follows: 
manufacturers must round to the same number of significant figures that 
are contained in the quantity of vehicles in the denominator of the 
equation used to compute the fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> emissions, but 
to no less than one more decimal place than that of the applicable fleet 
average standard.

Sec. 86.1838-01  Small volume manufacturer certification procedures.

    (a) The small-volume manufacturers certification procedures 
described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are optional. Small-
volume manufacturers may use these optional procedures to demonstrate 
compliance with the general standards and specific emission requirements 
contained in this subpart.
    (b) Eligibility requirements--(1) Small volume manufacturers. (i) 
The optional small-volume manufacturers certification procedures apply 
to LDV/Ts and MDPVs produced by manufacturers with sales in all states 
and territories of the United States, including all vehicles and engines 
imported under provisions of 40 CFR 85.1505 and 85.1509 (for the model 
year in which certification is sought) of fewer than 15,000 units (LDV/
Ts, MDPVs, heavy-duty vehicles and heavy-duty engines combined).
    (ii) If the aggregated sales in all states and territories of the 
United States of the manufacturer, as determined in paragraph (b)(3) of 
this section are fewer than 15,000 units, the manufacturer (or each 
manufacturer in the case of manufacturers in an aggregated relationship) 
may certify under the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) Small volume test groups.
    (i) If the aggregated sales in all states and territories of the 
United States, as determined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section are 
equal to or greater than 15,000 units, then the manufacturer (or each 
manufacturer in the case of manufacturers in an aggregated relationship) 
will be allowed to certify a number of units under the small volume test 
group certification procedures in accordance with the criteria 
identified in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this section.
    (ii) If there are no additional manufacturers in an aggregated 
relationship meeting the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, 
then the manufacturer may certify whole test groups whose total 
aggregated sales (including heavy-duty engines) are less than 15,000 
units using the small volume provisions of paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (iii) If there is an aggregated relationship with another 
manufacturer

[[Page 522]]

which satisfies the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, then 
the following provisions shall apply:
    (A) If none of the manufacturers own 50 percent or more of another 
manufacturer in the aggregated relationship, then each manufacturer may 
certify whole test groups whose total aggregated sales (including heavy-
duty engines) are less than 15,000 units using the small volume 
provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.
    (B) If any of the manufacturers own 50 percent or more of another 
manufacturer in the aggregated relationship, then the limit of 14,999 
units must be shared among the manufacturers in such a relationship. In 
total for all the manufacturers involved in such a relationship, 
aggregated sales (including heavy-duty engines) of up to 14,999 units 
may be certified using the small volume provisions of paragraph (c) of 
this section. Only whole test groups shall be eligible for small volume 
status under paragraph (c) of this section.
    (iv) In the case of a joint venture arrangement (50/50 ownership) 
between two manufacturers, each manufacturer retains its eligibility for 
14,999 units under the small-volume test group certification procedures, 
but the joint venture must draw its maximum 14,999 units from the units 
allocated to its parent manufacturers. Only whole test groups shall be 
eligible for small volume status under paragraph (c) of this section.
    (3) Sales aggregation for related manufacturers. The projected or 
actual sales from different firms shall be aggregated in the following 
situations:
    (i) Vehicles and/or engines produced by two or more firms, one of 
which is 10 percent or greater part owned by another;
    (ii) Vehicles and/or engines produced by any two or more firms if a 
third party has equity ownership of 10 percent or more in each of the 
firms;
    (iii) Vehicles and/or engines produced by two or more firms having a 
common corporate officer(s) who is (are) responsible for the overall 
direction of the companies;
    (iv) Vehicles and/or engines imported or distributed by all firms 
where the vehicles and/or engines are manufactured by the same entity 
and the importer or distributor is an authorized agent of the entity.
    (c) Small-volume manufacturers and/or small volume test groups shall 
demonstrate compliance with the all applicable sections of this subpart 
except as provided in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section. Small 
volume manufacturers and/or test groups may optionally meet the 
following requirements:
    (1) Durability demonstration. Use the provisions of Sec. 86.1826-01 
rather than the requirements of Secs. 86.1823-01, 86.1824-01, and/or 
86.1825-01.
    (2) In-use verification testing. See Sec. 86.1845-01 for 
applicability of in-use verification testing to small volume 
manufacturers and small volume test groups except as noted in this 
paragraph (c)(2).
    (i) Small volume in-use verification test vehicles may be procured 
from customers or may be owned by, or under the control of the 
manufacturer, provided that the vehicle has accumulated mileage in 
typical operation on public streets and has received typical 
maintenance.
    (ii) In lieu of procuring small volume in-use verification test 
vehicles that have a minimum odometer reading of 50,000 miles, a 
manufacturer may demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Agency that, 
based on owner survey data, the average mileage accumulated after 4 
years for a given test group is less than 50,000 miles. The Agency may 
approve a lower minimum odometer reading based on such data.
    (iii) The provisions of Sec. 86.1845-01(c)(2) and Sec. 86.1845-
04(c)(2) that require one vehicle of each test group during high mileage 
in-use verification testing to have a minimum odometer mileage of 75 
percent of the full useful life mileage for Tier 1 and NLEV LDV/Ts, or 
90,000 (or 105,000) miles for Tier 2 and interim non-Tier 2 vehicles, do 
not apply.
    (iv) Manufacturers intending to use the provisions of paragraphs 
(c)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section shall submit to the Agency, prior to 
the certification of the subject vehicles, a plan detailing how these 
provisions will be met.

Sec. 86.1839-01  Carryover of certification data.

    (a) In lieu of testing an emission-data or durability vehicle 
selected under Sec. 86.1822-01, Sec. 86.1828-01, or Sec. 86.1829-01, and 
submitting data therefrom, a manufacturer may submit exhaust emission 
data, evaporative emission data and/or refueling emission data, as 
applicable, on a similar vehicle for which certification has been 
obtained or for which all applicable data required under Sec. 86.1845-01 
has previously been submitted. To be eligible for this provision, the 
manufacturer must use good engineering judgment and meet the following 
criteria:
    (1) In the case of durability data, the manufacturer must determine 
that the previously generated durability data represent a worst case or 
equivalent rate of deterioration for all applicable emission 
constituents compared to the configuration selected for durability 
demonstration.
    (i) Prior to certification, the Administrator may require the 
manufacturer to provide data showing that the distribution of catalyst 
temperatures of the selected durability configuration is effectively 
equivalent or lower than the distribution of catalyst temperatures of 
the vehicle configuration which is the source of the previously 
generated data.
    (ii) For the 2001, 2002, and 2003 model years only, paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section does not apply to the use of exhaust emission 
deterioration factors meeting the requirements of Sec. 86.1823-01(c)(2).
    (2) In the case of emission data, the manufacturer must determine 
that the previously generated emissions data represent a worst case or 
equivalent level of emissions for all applicable emission constituents 
compared to the configuration selected for emission compliance 
demonstration.
    (b) In lieu of using newly aged hardware on an EDV as allowed under 
the provisions of Sec. 86.1823-01(a)(3)(ii), a manufacturer may use 
similar hardware aged for an EDV previously submitted, provided that the 
manufacturer determines that the previously aged hardware represents a 
worst case or equivalent rate of deterioration for all applicable 
emission constituents for durability demonstration.


<R05>
Sec. 86.1840-01  Special test procedures.

    (a) The Administrator may, on the basis of written application by a 
manufacturer, prescribe test procedures, other than those set forth in 
this part, for any light-duty vehicle, light-duty truck, or complete 
heavy-duty vehicle which the Administrator determines is not susceptible 
to satisfactory testing by the procedures set forth in this part.
    (b) If the manufacturer does not submit a written application for 
use of special test procedures but the Administrator determines that a 
light-duty vehicle, light-duty truck, or complete heavy-duty vehicle is 
not susceptible to satisfactory testing by the procedures set forth in 
this part, the Administrator shall notify the manufacturer in writing 
and set forth the reasons for such rejection in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 86.1848(a)(2).

<R05>
Sec. 86.1841-01  Compliance with emission standards for the purpose of 
certification.

    (a) Certification levels of a test vehicle will be calculated for 
each emission constituent applicable to the test group for both full and 
intermediate useful life as appropriate.
    (1) If the durability demonstration procedure approved by the 
Administrator under the provisions of Secs. 86.1823-01, 86.1824-01, or 
86.1825-01 requires a DF to be calculated, the DF shall be applied to 
the official test results determined in Sec. 86.1835-01(c) for each 
regulated emission constituent and for full and intermediate useful 
life, as appropriate, using the following procedures:
    (i) For additive DF's, the DF will be added to the emission result. 
The sum will be rounded to the same level of precision as the standard 
for the constituent at full and/or intermediate useful life, as 
appropriate. This rounded sum is the certification level for that 
emission constituent and for that useful life mileage.
    (ii) For multiplicative DFs, the DF will be multiplied by the 
emission result for each regulated constituent. The product will be 
rounded to the same level of precision as the standard

[[Page 524]]

for the constituent at full and intermediate useful life, as 
appropriate. This rounded product is the certification level for that 
emission constituent and for that useful life mileage.
    (iii) For the SFTP composite standard of NMHC+NO<INF>X</INF>, the 
measured results of NMHC and NO<INF>X</INF> must each be adjusted by 
their corresponding deterioration factors before the composite 
NMHC+NO<INF>X</INF> certification level is calculated. Where the 
applicable FTP exhaust hydrocarbon emission standard is an NMOG 
standard, the applicable NMOG deterioration factor must be used in place 
of the NMHC deterioration factor, unless otherwise approved by the 
Administrator.
    (2) If the durability demonstration procedure approved by the 
Administrator under the provisions of Sec. 86.1823-01, Sec. 86.1824-01, 
or Sec. 86.1825-01, as applicable, requires testing of the EDV with aged 
emission components, the official results of that testing determined 
under the provisions of Sec. 86.1835-01(c) shall be rounded to the same 
level of precision as the standard for each regulated constituent at 
full and intermediate useful life, as appropriate. This rounded emission 
value is the certification level for that emission constituent at that 
useful life mileage.
    (3) If the durability demonstration procedure approved by the 
Administrator under the provisions of Sec. 86.1823-01 requires neither a 
DF calculation nor EDV testing with aged hardware, the certification 
levels shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions approved 
under Sec. 86.1823-01(a)(3).
    (4) The rounding required in paragraph (a) of this section shall be 
conducted in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 86.1837-01.
    (b) To be considered in compliance with the standards for the 
purposes of certification, the certification levels for the test vehicle

Sec. 86.1842-01  Addition of a vehicle after certification; and changes to 
a vehicle covered by certification.

    (a) Addition of a car line after certification. (1) If a 
manufacturer proposes to add to its product line a new car line of the 
same test group as vehicles previously certified but which was not 
described in the application for certification when the test vehicle(s) 
representing other vehicles of that combination was certified, it shall 
notify the Administrator. This notification shall include a full 
description of the vehicle to be added.
    (2) The manufacturer shall perform such tests on the test vehicle(s) 
representing the vehicle to be added which would have been required if 
the vehicle had been included in the original application for 
certification.
    (3) If, after a review of the test reports and data submitted by the 
manufacturer, and data derived from any testing conducted under 
Sec. 86.1835-01, the Administrator determines that the test vehicle(s) 
or test engine(s) meets all applicable standards, the appropriate 
certificate will be amended accordingly. If the Administrator determines 
that the test vehicle(s) does not meet applicable standards, she/he will 
proceed under Sec. 86.1850-01.
    (b) Changes to the configuration of vehicles covered by a 
Certificate of Conformity. (1) A manufacturer will notify the 
Administrator concurrently with

[[Page 525]]

(or in advance of) any change or addition in production vehicles which 
creates a new vehicle configuration within the car lines covered in a 
certified test group, giving a full description of the change. Such a 
change is referred to as a running change. Upon notification, the 
manufacturer may begin production of the running change if the 
manufacturer determines that following the change all affected vehicles 
will still meet the applicable emission standards.
    (i) Such notification shall include a full description of the 
addition or change and any supporting documentation the manufacturer may 
desire to include to support the manufacturer's determination in 
accordance with Sec. 86.1844-01.
    (ii) The manufacturer's determination that the addition or change 
does not cause noncompliance shall be based on an engineering evaluation 
of the addition or change and/or testing.
    (2) The Administrator may require that additional emission testing 
be performed to support the manufacturer's determination submitted in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If additional testing is required the 
Administrator shall proceed in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section. Additional test data, if requested, must be provided within 30 
days of the request or the manufacturer must rescind the addition or 
change immediately. The Administrator may grant additional time to 
complete testing. If based on this additional testing or any other 
information, the Administrator determines that the vehicles affected by 
the addition or change do not meet the applicable standards the 
Administrator will notify the manufacturer to rescind the addition or 
change immediately upon receipt of the notification.
    (c) Election to produce vehicles under this section will be deemed 
to be a consent to recall all vehicles which the Administrator 
determines under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section do not meet 
applicable standards, and to cause such nonconformity to be remedied at 
no expense to the owner.

the standards that are applicable to it, by matching readily observable 
vehicle characteristics and information given in the emission control 
information label (and other permanently attached labels) to indicators 
in the Part 1 Application. In addition, the description must be 
sufficient to determine for each vehicle covered by the certificate, all 
appropriate test parameters and any special test procedures necessary to 
conduct an official certification exhaust or evaporative emission test 
as was required by this subpart to demonstrate compliance with 
applicable emission standards. The description shall include, but is not 
limited to, information such as model name, vehicle classification 
(light-duty vehicle, light-duty truck, or complete heavy-duty vehicle),

Sec. 86.1845-01  Manufacturer in-use verification testing requirements.

    (a) General requirements. A manufacturer light-duty vehicles, light-
duty trucks, and complete heavy-duty vehicles shall test, or cause to 
have tested a specified number of light-duty vehicles, light-duty 
trucks, and complete heavy-duty vehicles. Such testing shall be 
conducted in accordance with the provisions of this section. For 
purposes of this section, the term vehicle shall include light-duty 
vehicles, light-duty trucks, and complete heavy-duty vehicles.
    (b) Low mileage testing. [Reserved]
    (c) High-mileage testing--(1) Test groups. Testing must be conducted 
for each test group.
    (2) Vehicle mileage. All test vehicles must have a minimum odometer 
mileage of 50,000 miles. At least one vehicle of each test group must 
have a minimum odometer mileage of 75% of useful life. See Sec. 86.1838-
01(c)(2) for small volume manufacturer mileage requirements.
    (3) Number of test vehicles. For each test group, the minimum number 
of vehicles that must be tested is specified in Table S01-06 and Table 
S01-07 of this paragraph (c)(3). After testing the minimum number of 
vehicles of a specific test group as specified in Table S01-06 and Table 
S01-07 of this paragraph (c)(3), a manufacturer may test additional 
vehicles upon request and approval by the Agency prior to the initiation 
of the additional testing. Any additional testing must be completed 
within the testing completion requirements shown in Sec. 86.1845-
01(c)(4). The request and Agency approval (if any) shall apply to test 
groups on a case by case basis and apply only to testing under this 
paragraph. In addition to the testing specified in Table S01-06 and 
Table S02-07 of this paragraph (c)(3), a manufacturer shall test one 
vehicle from each evaporative/refueling family for evaporative/refueling 
emissions. If a manufacturer believes it is unable to procure the test 
vehicles necessary to test the required number of vehicles in a test 
group as specified in Table S01-06 or Table S01-07 of this paragraph 
(c)(3), the manufacturer may request, subject to Administrator approval, 
a decreased sample size for that test group. The request shall include a 
description of the methods the manufacturer has used to procure the 
required number of vehicles. The approval of any such request, and the 
substitution of an alternative sample size requirement for the test 
group, will be based on a review of the procurement efforts made by the 
manufacturer to determine if all reasonable steps have been taken to 
procure the required test group size. Tables S01-06 and S01-07 follow:

Sec. 86.1845-04  Manufacturer in-use verification testing requirements.

    (a) General requirements. (1) A manufacturer of LDVs, LDTs, MDPVs 
and/or complete HDVs must test, or cause to have tested, a specified 
number of LDVs, LDTs, MDPVs and complete HDVs. Such testing must be 
conducted in accordance with the provisions of this section. For 
purposes of this section, the term vehicle includes light-duty vehicles, 
light-duty trucks and medium-duty vehicles.
    (2) Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, no emission 
measurements made under the requirements of this section may be adjusted 
by Reactivity Adjustment Factors (RAFs).
    (3) Upon a manufacturer's written request, prior to in-use testing, 
that presents information to EPA regarding pre-conditioning procedures 
designed solely to remove the effects of high sulfur in gasoline from 
vehicles produced through the 2007 model year, EPA will consider 
allowing such procedures on a case-by-case basis. EPA's decision will 
apply to manufacturer in-use testing conducted under this section and to 
any in-use testing conducted by EPA. Such procedures are not available 
for complete HDVs.
    (b) Low-mileage testing--(1) Test groups. Testing must be conducted 
for each test group.
    (2) Vehicle mileage. All test vehicles must have a minimum odometer 
mileage of 10,000 miles.
    (3) Number of test vehicles. For each test group, the minimum number 
of vehicles that must be tested is specified in Table S04-06 and Table 
S04-07 of this paragraph (b)(3). After testing the minimum number of 
vehicles of a specific test group as specified in Table S04-06 or S04-07 
of this paragraph (b)(3), a manufacturer may test additional vehicles 
upon request and approval by the Agency prior to the initiation of the 
additional testing. Any additional testing must be completed within the 
testing completion requirements shown in Sec. 86.1845-04(b)(4). The 
request and Agency approval (if any) shall apply to test groups on a 
case by case basis and apply only to testing under this paragraph. 
Separate approval will be required to test additional vehicles under 
paragraph (c) of this section. In addition to the testing specified in 
Table S04-06 and Table S04-07 of this paragraph (b)(3), a manufacturer 
shall test one vehicle from each evaporative/refueling family for 
evaporative/refueling emissions. If a manufacturer believes it is unable 
to procure the test vehicles necessary to test the required number

[[Page 534]]

of vehicles in a test group, the manufacturer may request, subject to 
Administrator approval, a decreased sample size for that test group. The 
request shall include a description of the methods the manufacturer has 
used to procure the required number of vehicles. The approval of any 
such request, and the substitution of an alternative sample size 
requirement for the test group, will be based on a review of the 
procurement efforts made by the manufacturer to determine if all 
reasonable steps have been taken to procure the required test group 
size. Tables S04-06 and S04-07 follow:

The approval of any such request, and the substitution of an alternative 
sample size requirement for the test group, will be based on a review of 
the procurement efforts made by the manufacturer to determine if all 
reasonable steps have been taken to procure the required test group 
size.
    (4) Initiation and completion of testing. Testing of a test group 
(or evaporative refueling family) must commence within 4 years of the 
end of production of the test group (or evaporative/refueling family) 
and be completed within 5 years of the end of production of the test 
group (or evaporative/refueling family).
    (5) Emission testing. (i) Each test vehicle shall be tested in 
accordance with the Federal Test Procedure and the US06 portion of the 
Supplemental Federal Test Procedure as described in subpart B of this 
part, when such test vehicle is tested for compliance with applicable 
exhaust emission standards under this subpart. The US06 portion of the 
SFTP is not required to be performed on vehicles certified in accordance 
with the National LEV provisions of subpart R of this part. One test 
vehicle from each test group shall receive a Federal Test Procedure at 
high altitude. The test vehicle tested at high altitude is not required 
to be one of the same test vehicles tested at low altitude. The test 
vehicle tested at high altitude is counted when determining the 
compliance with the requirements shown in Table S04-06 and Table S04-07 
in paragraph (b)(3) of this section or the expanded sample size as 
provided for in this paragraph (c).
    (ii) One test vehicle of each evaporative/refueling family shall be 
tested in accordance with the evaporative emission and refueling 
emission test procedures described in subpart B of this part, when such 
test vehicle is tested for compliance with applicable evaporative 
emission and refueling emission standards under this subpart. The test 
vehicles tested to fulfill the evaporative/refueling testing requirement 
of this paragraph (b)(5)(ii) will be counted when determining compliance 
with the minimum number of vehicles as specified in Table S04-06 and 
table S04-07 in paragraph (b)(3) of this section for testing under 
paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section only if the vehicle is also tested 
for exhaust emissions under the requirements of paragraph (b)(5)(i) of 
this section.
    (6) Each test vehicle not rejected based on the criteria specified

Vehicles shall be procured from the group of persons who

[[Page 536]]

own or lease vehicles registered in the procurement area.
    (2) Vehicles shall be procured from persons which own or lease the 
vehicle, excluding commercial owners/lessees which are owned or 
controlled by the vehicle manufacturer, using the procedures described 
in Appendix I to this subpart. See Sec. 86.1838(c)(2)(i) for small 
volume manufacturer requirements.
    (3) Geographical limitations. (i) Test groups certified to 50-state 
standards: For low altitude testing no more than fifty percent of the 
test vehicles may be procured from California. The test vehicles 
procured from the 49 state area must be procured from a location with a 
heating degree day 30 year annual average equal to or greater than 4000.
    (ii) Test groups certified to 49 state standards: The test vehicles 
procured from the 49 state area must be procured from a location with a 
heating degree day 30 year annual average equal to or greater than 4000.
    (iii) Vehicles procured for high altitude testing may be procured 
from any area located above 4000 feet.
    (4) Vehicles may be rejected for procurement or testing under this 
section if they meet one or more of the rejection criteria in Appendix 
II to this subpart. Vehicles may also be rejected after testing under 
this section if they meet one or more of the rejection criteria in 
Appendix II to this subpart. Any vehicle rejected after testing must be 
replaced in order that the number of test vehicles in the sample comply 
with the sample size requirements of this section. Any post-test vehicle 
rejection and replacement procurement and testing must take place within 
the testing completion requirements of this section.
    (e) Testing facilities, procedures, quality assurance and quality 
control--(1) Lab equipment and procedural requirements. The manufacturer 
shall utilize a test laboratory that is in accordance with the equipment 
and procedural requirements of subpart B of this part to conduct the 
testing required by this section.
    (2) The manufacturer shall notify the Agency of the name and 
location of the testing laboratory(s) to be used to conduct testing of 
vehicles of each model year conducted pursuant to this section. Such 
notification shall occur at least thirty working days prior to the 
initiation of testing of the vehicles of that model year.
    (3) Correlation. The manufacturer shall document correlation 
traceable to the Environmental Protection Agency's National Vehicle and 
Fuel Emission Laboratory for its test laboratory utilized to conduct the 
testing required by this section.
    (f)(1) A manufacturer may conduct in-use testing on a test group by 
measuring NMHC exhaust emissions rather than NMOG exhaust emissions. The 
measured NMHC exhaust emissions must be multiplied by the adjustment 
factor used for certification of the test group, or another adjustment 
factor acceptable to the Administrator, to determine the equivalent NMOG 
exhaust emission values for the test vehicle. The equivalent NMOG 
exhaust emission value must be used in place of the measured NMHC 
exhaust emission value in determining the exhaust NMOG results. The 
equivalent NMOG exhaust emission values must be compared to the NMOG 
exhaust emission standard from the emission bin to which the test group 
was certified.
    (2) For flexible-fueled LDVs, LDTs and MDPVs certified to NMOG 
standards, the manufacturer may request from the Administrator the use 
of a methanol (M85) or ethanol (E85) NMOG exhaust emission to gasoline 
NMHC exhaust emission ratio which must be established during 
certification for each emission data vehicle for the applicable test 
group. The results must be submitted to the Administrator in the Part II 
application for certification. After approval by the Administrator, the 
measured gasoline NMHC exhaust emissions must be multiplied by the M85 
or E85 NMOG to gasoline NMHC ratio submitted in the application for 
certification for the test group to determine the equivalent NMOG 
exhaust emission values for the test vehicle. The equivalent NMOG 
exhaust emission value must be used in place of the measured NMOG 
exhaust emission value in determining the exhaust NMOG results. The 
equivalent NMOG exhaust emission values must be compared to the NMOG 
exhaust emission

[[Page 537]]

standard from the vehicle emission standard bin to which the test group 
was certified.
    (3) If the manufacturer measures NMOG it must also measure and 
report HCHO emissions. As an alternative to measuring the HCHO content, 
if the manufacturer measures NMHC as permitted in paragraph (f)(1) of 
this section, the Administrator may approve, upon submission of 
supporting data by a manufacturer, the use of HCHO to NMHC ratios. To 
request the use of HCHO to NMHC ratios, the manufacturer must establish 
during certification testing the ratio of measured HCHO exhaust 
emissions to measured NMHC exhaust emissions for each emission data 
vehicle for the applicable test group. The results must be submitted to 
the Administrator with the Part II application for certification. 
Following approval of the application for certification, the 
manufacturer may conduct in-use testing on the test group by measuring 
NMHC exhaust emissions rather than HCHO exhaust emissions. The measured 
NMHC exhaust emissions must be multiplied by the HCHO to NMHC ratio 
submitted in the application for certification for the test group to 
determine the equivalent HCHO exhaust emission values for the test 
vehicle. The equivalent HCHO exhaust emission values must be compared to 
the HCHO exhaust emission standard applicable to the test group.

Sec. 86.1846-01  Manufacturer in-use confirmatory testing requirements.

    (a) General requirements. (1) A manufacturer of LDVs, LDTs and/or 
MDPVs must test, or cause testing to be conducted, under this section 
when the emission levels shown by a test group sample from testing under 
Secs. 86.1845-01 or 86.1845-04, as applicable, exceeds the criteria 
specified in paragraph (b) of this section. The testing required under 
this section applies separately to each test group and at each test 
point (low and high mileage) that meets the specified criteria. The 
testing requirements apply separately for each model year starting with 
model year 2001. These provisions do not apply to heavy-duty vehicles or 
engines prior to the 2007 model year.
    (2) Except for vehicles certified under the NLEV provisions of 
subpart R of this part or unless otherwise approved by the 
Administrator, no emission measurements made under the requirements of 
this section may be adjusted by Reactivity Adjustment Factors (RAFs).
    (3) For purposes of this section, the term vehicle includes light-
duty vehicles, light-duty trucks and medium-duty passenger vehicles.
    (4) Upon a manufacturer's written request, prior to in-use testing, 
that presents information to EPA regarding pre-conditioning procedures 
designed solely to remove the effects of high sulfur in gasoline from 
vehicles produced through the 2007 model year, EPA will consider 
allowing such procedures on a case-by-case basis. EPA's decision will 
apply to manufacturer in-use testing conducted under this section and to 
any in-use testing conducted by EPA. This provision does not apply to 
heavy-duty vehicles and engines.
    (b) Criteria for additional testing. A manufacturer shall test a 
test group or a subset of a test group as described in paragraph (j) of 
this section when the results from testing conducted under 
Secs. 86.1845-01 and 86.1845-04, as applicable, show mean emissions for 
that test group of any pollutant(s) to be equal to or greater than 1.30 
times the applicable in-use standard and a failure rate, among the test 
group vehicles, for the corresponding pollutant(s) of fifty percent or 
greater.
    (1) This requirement does not apply to Supplemental FTP testing 
conducted under Sec. 86.1845-04(b)(5)(i) or evaporative/refueling 
testing conducted under Sec. 86.1845-01 or Sec. 86.1845-04. Testing 
conducted at high altitude under the requirements of Secs. 86.1845-01 
and 86.1845-04 will be included in determining if a test group meets the 
criteria triggering testing required under this section.
    (2) The vehicle tested under the requirements of Sec. 86.1845-
01(c)(2) or Sec. 86.1845-04(c)(2) with a minimum odometer miles of 75% 
of useful life will not be included in determining if a test group meets 
the triggering criteria.

[[Page 538]]

    (3) The SFTP composite emission levels shall include the IUVP FTP 
emissions, the IUVP US06 emissions, and the values from the SC03 Air 
Conditioning EDV certification test (without DFs applied). The 
calculations shall be made using the equations prescribed in 
Sec. 86.164-01. If more than one set of certification SC03 data exists 
(due to running change testing or other reasons), the manufacturer shall 
choose the SC03 result to use in the calculation from among those data 
sets using good engineering judgment.
    (c) Useful life. Vehicles tested under the provisions of this 
section must be within the useful life specified for the emission 
standards which were exceeded in the testing under Sec. 86.1845-01 or 
Sec. 86.1845-04, as applicable. Testing should be within the useful life 
specified, subject to sections 207(c)(5) and (c)(6) of the Clean Air Act 
where applicable.
    (d) Number of test vehicles. A manufacturer must test a minimum of 
ten vehicles of the test group or Agency-designated subset. A 
manufacturer may, at the manufacturer's discretion, test more than ten 
vehicles under this paragraph for a specific test group or Agency-
designated subset. If a manufacturer chooses to test more than the 
required ten vehicles, all testing must be completed within the time 
designated in the testing completion requirements of Sec. 86.1846-01(g). 
Any vehicles which are eliminated from the sample either prior to or 
subsequent to testing, or any vehicles for which test results are 
determined to be void, must be replaced in order that the final sample 
of vehicles for which test results acceptable to the Agency are 
available equals a minimum of ten vehicles. A manufacturer may cease 
testing with a sample of five vehicles if the results of the first five 
vehicles tested show mean emissions for each pollutant to be less than 
75.0 percent of the applicable standard, with no vehicles exceeding the 
applicable standard for any pollutant.
    (e) Emission testing. Each test vehicle of a test group or Agency-
designated subset shall be tested in accordance with the Federal Test 
Procedure and/or the Supplemental Federal Test Procedure (whichever of 
these tests performed under Sec. 86.1845-01 produces emission levels 
requiring testing under this section) as described in subpart B of this 
part, when such test vehicle is tested for compliance with applicable 
exhaust emission standards under this subpart.
    (f) Geographical limitations. (1) Test groups or Agency-designated 
subsets certified to 50-state standards: For low altitude testing no 
more than 50 percent of the test vehicles may be procured from 
California. The test vehicles procured from the 49 state area must be 
procured from a location with a heating degree day 30 year annual 
average equal to or greater than 4000.
    (2) Test groups or Agency-designated subsets certified to 49 state 
standards: For low-altitude testing all vehicles shall be procured from 
a location with a heating degree day 30 year annual average equal to or 
greater than 4000.
    (3) Vehicles procured for high altitude testing may be procured from 
any area provided that the vehicle's primary area of operation was above 
4000 feet.
    (g) Testing. Testing required under this section must commence 
within three months of completion of the testing under Sec. 86.1845-01 
or Sec. 86.1845-04 which triggered the confirmatory testing and must be 
completed within seven months of the completion of the testing which 
triggered the confirmatory testing. Any industry review of the results 
obtained under Sec. 86.1845-01 or Sec. 86.1845-04 and any additional 
vehicle procurement and/or testing which takes place under the 
provisions of Sec. 86.1845-01 or Sec. 86.1845-04 which the industry 
believes may affect the triggering of required confirmatory testing must 
take place within the three month period. The data and the manufacturers 
reasoning for reconsideration of the data must be provided to the Agency 
within the three month period.
    (h) Limit on manufacturer conducted testing. For each manufacturer, 
the maximum number of test group(s) (or Agency-designated subset(s)) of 
each model year for which testing under this section shall be required 
is limited to 50 percent of the total number of test groups of each 
model year required to be tested by each manufacturer as prescribed in 
Sec. 86.1845-01 or Sec. 86.1845-04

[[Page 539]]

rounded to the next highest whole number where appropriate. For each 
manufacturer with only one test group under Sec. 86.1845-01 or 
Sec. 86.1845-04, as applicable, such manufacturer shall have a maximum 
potential testing requirement under this section of one test group (or 
Agency-designated subset) per model year.
    (i) Prior to beginning in-use confirmatory testing the manufacturer 
must, after consultation with the Agency, submit a written plan 
describing the details of the vehicle procurement, maintenance, and 
testing procedures (not otherwise specified by regulation) it intends to 
use.
    (j) Testing a subset. EPA may designate a subset of the test group 
based on transmission type for testing under this section in lieu of 
testing the entire test group when the results for the entire test group 
from testing conducted under Sec. 86.1845-01 or Sec. 86.1845-04 show 
mean emissions and a failure rate which meet these criteria for 
additional testing.

Sec. 86.1848-01  Certification.

    (a)(1) If, after a review of the manufacturer's submitted Part I 
application, information obtained from any inspection, such other 
information as the Administrator may require, and any other pertinent 
data or information, the Administrator determines that the application 
is complete and that all vehicles within a test group as described in 
the application meet the requirements of this Part and the Clean Air 
Act, the Administrator shall issue a certificate of conformity.
    (2) If, after review of the manufacturer's application, request for 
certification, information obtained from any inspection, such other 
information as the Administrator may require, and any other pertinent 
data or information, the Administrator determines that the application 
is not complete or the vehicles within a test group as described in the 
application, do not meet applicable requirements or standards of the Act 
or of this part, the Administrator may deny the issuance of, suspend, or 
revoke a previously issued certificate of conformity. The Administrator 
will notify the manufacturer in writing, setting forth the basis for the 
determination. The manufacturer may request a hearing on the 
Administrator's determination.
    (b) A certificate of conformity will be issued by the Administrator 
for a period not to exceed one model year and upon such terms as deemed 
necessary or appropriate to assure that any new motor vehicle covered by 
the certificate will meet the requirements of the Act and of this part.
    (c) All certificates are conditional upon the following conditions 
being met:

[[Page 541]]

    (1) The manufacturer must supply all required information according 
to the provisions of Secs. 86.1843-01 and 86.1844-01.

emission standards contained in subparts S and H of this part both 
during and after model year production.
    (3) The manufacturer must comply with all implementation schedules 
sales percentages as required in Sec. 86.1810 or elsewhere in this part. 
Failure to meet a required implementation schedule sales percentage will 
be considered to be a failure to satisfy a condition upon which the 
certificate was issued and any vehicles or trucks sold in violation of 
the implementation schedule shall not be covered by the certificate.
    (4) For incomplete light-duty trucks and incomplete heavy-duty 
vehicles, a certificate covers only those new motor vehicles which, when 
completed by having the primary load-carrying device or container 
attached, conform to the maximum curb weight and frontal area 
limitations described in the application for certification as required 
in Sec. 86.1844-01.
    (5) The manufacturer must meet the in-use testing and reporting 
requirements contained in Secs. 86.1845-01, 86.1846-01, and 86.1847-01, 
as applicable. Failure to meet the in-use testing or reporting 
requirements shall be considered a failure to satisfy a condition upon 
which the certificate was issued. A vehicle or truck will be considered 
to be covered by the certificate only if the manufacturer fulfills this 
condition upon which the certificate was issued.
    (6) Vehicles are covered by a certificate of conformity only if they 
are in all material respects as described in the manufacturer's 
application for certification (Part I and Part II).
    (7) For Tier 2 and interim non-Tier 2 vehicles, all certificates of 
conformity issued are conditional upon compliance with all provisions of 
Secs. 86.1811-04, 86.1860-04, 86.1861-04 and 86.1862-04 both during and 
after model year production.
    (i) Failure to meet the fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> requirements of 
0.07g/mi, 0.30 g/mi or 0.20 g/mi, as applicable, will be considered to 
be a failure to satisfy the terms and conditions upon which the 
certificate(s) was (were) issued and the vehicles sold in violation of 
the fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> standard will not be covered by the 
certificate(s).
    (ii) Failure to comply fully with the prohibition against selling 
credits that it has not generated or that are not available, as 
specified in Sec. 86.1861-04, will be considered to be a failure to 
satisfy the terms and conditions upon which the certificate(s) was 
(were) issued and the vehicles sold in violation of this prohibition 
will not be covered by the certificate(s).
    (iii) Failure to comply fully with the phase-in requirements of 
Sec. 86.1811-04, will be considered to be a failure to satisfy the terms 
and conditions upon which the certificate(s) was (were) issued and the 
vehicles sold which do not comply with Tier 2 or interim non-Tier 2 
requirements, up to the number needed to comply, will not be covered by 
the certificate(s).
    (iv) For paragraphs (c)(7)(i) through (iii) of this section:
    (A) The manufacturer must bear the burden of establishing to the 
satisfaction of the Administrator that the terms and conditions upon 
which the certificate(s) was (were) issued were satisfied.
    (B) For recall and warranty purposes, vehicles not covered by a 
certificate of conformity will continue to be held to the standards 
stated or referenced in the certificate that otherwise would have 
applied to the vehicles.
    (d) One certificate will be issued for each test group and 
evaporative/refueling family combination. For diesel fueled vehicles, 
one certificate will be issued for each test group. A certificate of 
conformity is deemed to cover the vehicles named in such certificate and 
produced during the model year.
    (e) A manufacturer of new light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, 
and complete heavy-duty vehicles must obtain a certificate of conformity 
covering such vehicles from the Administrator prior to selling, offering 
for sale, introducing into commerce, delivering for introduction into 
commerce, or importing into the United States the new vehicle. Vehicles 
produced prior to the effective date of a certificate of conformity may 
also be covered by the

[[Page 542]]

certificate, once it is effective, if the following conditions are met:
    (1) The vehicles conform in all respects to the vehicles described 
in the application for the certificate of conformity.
    (2) The vehicles are not sold, offered for sale, introduced into 
commerce, or delivered for introduction into commerce prior to the 
effective date of the certificate of conformity.
    (3) EPA is notified prior to the beginning of production when such 
production will start, and EPA is provided a full opportunity to inspect 
and/or test the vehicles during and after their production. EPA must 
have the opportunity to conduct SEA production line testing as if the 
vehicles had been produced after the effective date of the certificate.
    (f) Vehicles imported by an original equipment manufacturer after 
December 31 of the calendar year for which the model year is named are 
still covered by the certificate of conformity as long as the production 
of the vehicle was completed before December 31 of that year.
    (g) For test groups required to have an emission control diagnostic 
system, certification will not be granted if, for any emission data 
vehicle or other test vehicle approved by the Administrator in 
consultation with the manufacturer, the malfunction indicator light does 
not illuminate under any of the circumstances described in Sec. 86.1806-
01(k)(1) through (6).
    (h) Vehicles equipped with aftertreatment technologies such as 
catalysts, otherwise covered by a certificate, which are driven outside 
the United States, Canada, and Mexico will be presumed to have been 
operated on leaded gasoline resulting in deactivation of such components 
as catalysts and oxygen sensors. If these vehicles are imported or 
offered for importation without retrofit of the catalyst or other 
aftertreatment technology, they will be considered not to be within the 
coverage of the certificate unless included in a catalyst or other 
aftertreatment technology control program operated by a manufacturer or 
a United States Government agency and approved by the Administrator.
    (i) For all light-duty vehicles and light light-duty trucks 
certified to NLEV standards under Secs. 86.1710 through 86.1712, the 
following provisions apply:
    (1) All certificates issued are conditional upon manufacturer 
compliance with all provisions of Secs. 86.1710 through 86.1712 both 
during and after model year production.
    (2) Failure to meet the requirements of Sec. 86.1710(a) through (d) 
will be considered to be a failure to satisfy the conditions upon which 
the certificate(s) was issued and the vehicles sold in violation of the 
fleet average NMOG standard shall not be covered by the certificate.
    (3) Failure to comply fully with the prohibition against a 
manufacturer selling credits that it has not generated or are not 
available, as specified in Sec. 86.1710(e), will be considered to be a 
failure to satisfy the conditions upon which the certificate(s) was 
issued and the vehicles sold in violation of this prohibition shall not 
be covered by the certificate.
    (4) Failure to comply fully with the prohibition against offering 
for sale Tier 1 vehicles and TLEVs in the Northeast Trading Region, as 
defined in Sec. 86.1702, after model year 2000 if vehicles with the same 
test groups are not certified and offered for sale in California in the 
same model year, as specified in Sec. 86.1711(a), will be considered to 
be a failure to satisfy the conditions upon which the certificate(s) was 
issued and the vehicles sold in violation of this prohibition shall not 
be covered by the certificate.
    (5)(i) The Administrator will issue a National LEV certificate of 
conformity for 2000 model year vehicles or engines certified to comply 
with the California TLEV emission standards.
    (ii) This certificate of conformity shall be granted after the 
Administrator has received and reviewed the California Executive Order a 
manufacturer has received for the same vehicles or engines.
    (iii) Vehicles or engines receiving a certificate of conformity 
under the provisions in this paragraph can only be sold in the states 
included in the NTR, as defined in Sec. 86.1702, and those

[[Page 543]]

states where the sale of California-certified vehicles is otherwise 
authorized.
    (6) The manufacturer shall bear the burden of establishing to the 
satisfaction of the Administrator that the conditions upon which the 
certificate was issued were satisfied.
    (7) For recall and warranty purposes, vehicles not covered by a 
certificate because of a violation of these conditions of the 
certificate will continue to be held to the standards stated in the 
certificate that would have otherwise applied to the vehicles.

Sec. 86.1849-01  Right of entry.

    (a) Any manufacturer who has applied for certification of a new 
motor vehicle subject to testing under this subpart, or any manufacturer 
or entity who conducts or causes to be conducted in-use verification or 
in-use confirmatory testing under this subpart, shall admit or cause to 
be admitted any EPA Enforcement Officer or any EPA authorized 
representative during operating hours on presentation of credentials to 
any of the following:
    (1) Any facility where any such certification or in-use verification 
or in-use confirmatory testing or any procedures or activities connected 
with such testing are or were performed.
    (2) Any facility where any new motor vehicle or test vehicle used 
for certification, in-use verification or in-use confirmatory testing 
which is being, was, or is to be tested is present.
    (3) Any facility where any construction process or assembly process 
used in the modification or build up of such a vehicle into a 
certification vehicle is taking place or has taken place.
    (4) Any facility where any record or other document relating to 
Sec. 86.1849-01(a) (1), (2), and/or (3) is located.
    (b) Upon admission to any facility referred to in paragraph (a) of 
this section, any EPA official or EPA authorized representative shall be 
allowed:
    (1) To inspect and monitor any part or aspect of such procedures, 
activities, and testing facilities, including, but not limited to, 
monitoring vehicle preconditioning, emissions tests and mileage (or 
service) accumulation, bench aging, maintenance, and vehicle soak and 
storage procedures, and to verify correlation or calibration of test 
equipment.
    (2) To inspect and make copies of any such records, designs, or 
other documents, including those records specified in Secs. 86.1843-01, 
86.1844-01, and 86.1847-01.
    (c) In order to allow the Administrator to determine whether or not 
production motor vehicles conform to the conditions upon which a 
certificate of conformity has been issued, or conform in all material 
respects to the design specifications which applied to those vehicles 
described in the certification application for which a certificate of 
conformity has been issued to standards prescribed under section 202 of 
the Act, any manufacturer shall admit any EPA Enforcement Officer or EPA 
authorized representative on presentation of credentials to:
    (1) Any facility where any document, design, or procedure relating 
to the translation of the design and construction of engines and 
emission-related components described in the compliance application or 
used for certification testing into production vehicles is located or 
carried on; and
    (2) Any facility where any motor vehicles to be introduced into 
commerce are manufactured or assembled.
    (d) Upon admission to any facility referred to in paragraph (c) of 
this section, any EPA Enforcement Officer or EPA authorized 
representative shall be allowed:
    (1) To inspect and monitor any aspects of such manufacture or 
assembly and other procedures;
    (2) To inspect and make copies of any such records, documents or 
designs; and
    (3) To inspect and photograph any part or aspect of any such new 
motor vehicles and any component used in the assembly thereof that are 
reasonably related to the purpose of the entry.
    (e) Any EPA official or EPA authorized representative shall be 
furnished by those in charge of a facility being inspected with such 
reasonable assistance as he may request to help him discharge any 
function set forth in this

[[Page 544]]

paragraph. Each applicant for or recipient of certification is required 
to cause those in charge of a facility operated for its benefit to 
furnish such reasonable assistance without charge to EPA whether or not 
the applicant controls the facility.
    (f) The duty to admit or cause to be admitted any EPA Enforcement 
Officer or EPA authorized representative applies whether or not the 
applicant owns or controls the facility in question and applies both to 
domestic and to foreign manufacturers and facilities. EPA will not 
attempt to make any inspections which it has been informed that local 
law forbids. However, if local law makes it impossible to what is 
necessary to insure the accuracy of data generated at a facility, no 
informed judgment that a vehicle is certifiable or is covered by a 
certificate can properly be based on those data. It is the 
responsibility of the manufacturer to locate its testing and 
manufacturing facilities in jurisdictions where this situation will not 
arise.
    (g) For purposes of this section:
    (1) ``Presentation of credentials'' shall mean display of the 
document designating a person as an EPA Enforcement Officer or EPA 
authorized representative.
    (2) Where vehicle, component, or engine storage areas or facilities 
are concerned, ``operating hours'' shall mean all times during which 
personnel other than custodial personnel are at work in the vicinity of 
the area or facility and have access to it.
    (3) Where facilities or areas other than those covered by paragraph 
(g)(2) of this section are concerned, ``operating hours'' shall mean all 
times during which an assembly line is in operation or all times during 
which testing, maintenance, mileage (or service) accumulation, 
production or compilation of records, or any other procedure or activity 
related to certification testing, to translation of designs from the 
test stage to the production stage, or to vehicle (or engine) 
manufacture or assembly is being carried out in a facility.
    (4) Reasonable assistance includes, but is not limited to, clerical, 
copying, interpretation and translation services, the making available 
upon request of personnel of the facility being inspected during their 
working hours to inform the EPA Enforcement Officer or EPA authorized 
representative of how the facility operates and to answer his questions, 
and the performance on request of emissions tests on any vehicle which 
is being, has been, or will be used for certification or in-use 
verification or confirmatory testing. Such tests shall be 
nondestructive, but may require appropriate mileage (or service) 
accumulation. A manufacturer may be compelled to cause the personal 
appearance of any employee at such a facility before an EPA Enforcement 
Officer or EPA authorized representative by written request for his 
appearance, signed by the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation 
or the Assistant Administrator for Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, 
served on the manufacturer. Any such employee who has been instructed by 
the manufacturer to appear will be entitled to be accompanied, 
represented, and advised by counsel.


<R05>
Sec. 86.1850-01  Denial, suspension or revocation of certificate of 
conformity.

    (a) If, after review of the manufacturer's application, request for 
certification, information obtained from any inspection, such other 
information as the Administrator may require, and any other pertinent 
data or information, the Administrator determines that one or more test 
vehicles do not meet applicable requirements or standards of the Act or 
of this Part, the Administrator will notify the manufacturer in writing, 
setting forth the basis for the determination. The manufacturer may 
request a hearing on the Administrator's determination.
    (b) Notwithstanding the fact that the vehicles described in the 
application may comply with all other requirements of this subpart, the 
Administrator may deny issuance of, suspend, or revoke a previously 
issued certificate of conformity if the Administrator finds any one of 
the following infractions to be substantial:
    (1) The manufacturer submits false or incomplete information.
    (2) The manufacturer denies an EPA enforcement officer or EPA 
authorized

[[Page 545]]

representative the opportunity to conduct authorized inspections as 
required under Sec. 86.1849-01.
    (3) The manufacturer renders inaccurate any test data which it 
submits, or fails to make a good engineering judgment in accordance with 
Sec. 86.1851-01(c)(1).
    (4) The manufacturer denies an EPA enforcement officer or EPA 
authorized representative reasonable assistance as required in 
Sec. 86.1849-01.
    (5) The manufacturer fails to provide the records required in 
Sec. 86.1844-01 to the Administrator within the deadline set forth in 
the request for such information.
    (6) The manufacturer fails to comply with all conditions under which 
the certificate of conformity was granted as specified in 86.1848-01.
    (7) The manufacturer otherwise circumvents the intent of the Act or 
of this Part.
    (c) The manufacturer shall bear the burden of establishing to the 
satisfaction of the Administrator that the conditions upon which the 
certificate was issued were satisfied, or that any failure to satisfy a 
condition is not substantial.
    (d) If a manufacturer knowingly commits an infraction specified in 
paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(7) of this section, knowingly commits any 
fraudulent act which results in the issuance of a certificate of 
conformity, or fails to comply with the conditions specified in 
Sec. 86.1843-01, the Administrator may deem such certificate void ab 
initio.
    (e) When the Administrator denies, suspends, revokes, or voids ab 
initio a certificate, EPA will provide the manufacturer a written 
determination. The manufacturer may request a hearing under 
Sec. 86.1853-01 on the Administrator's decision.
    (f) Any suspension or revocation of a certificate of conformity 
shall extend no further than to forbid the introduction into commerce of 
vehicles previously covered by the certificate which are still in the 
possession of the manufacturer, except in cases of such fraud or other 
misconduct that makes the certification void ab initio.


<R05>
Sec. 86.1851-01  Application of good engineering judgment to manufacturers' 
decisions.

    (a) The manufacturer shall exercise good engineering judgment in 
making all decisions called for under this subpart, including but not 
limited to selections, categorizations, determinations, and applications 
of the requirements of the subpart.
    (b) Upon written request by the Administrator, the manufacturer 
shall provide within 15 working days (or such longer period as may be 
allowed by the Administrator) a written description of the engineering 
judgment in question.
    (c) The Administrator may reject any such decision by a manufacturer 
if it is not based on good engineering judgment, or is otherwise 
inconsistent with the requirements of this subpart.
    (d) If the Administrator rejects a decision by a manufacturer with 
respect to the exercise of good engineering judgment, the following 
provisions shall apply:
    (1) If the Administrator determines that incorrect information was 
deliberately used in the decision process, that important information 
was deliberately overlooked, that the decision was not made in good 
faith, or that the decision was not made with a rational basis, the 
Administrator may suspend or void ab initio a certificate of conformity.
    (2) If the Administrator determines that the manufacturer's decision 
does not meet the provisions of paragraph(d)(1) of this section, but 
that a different decision would reflect a better exercise of good 
engineering judgment, then the Administrator will notify the 
manufacturer of this concern and the basis thereof.
    (i) The manufacturer shall have at least 30 days to respond to this 
notice. The Administrator may extend this response period upon request 
from the manufacturer if it is necessary to generate additional data for 
the manufacturer's response.
    (ii) The Administrator shall make the final ruling after considering 
the information provided by the manufacturer during the response period. 
If the Administrator determines that the manufacturer's decision was not 
made

[[Page 546]]

using good engineering judgment, he/she may reject that decision and 
apply the new ruling to future corresponding decisions as soon as 
practicable.
    (e) The Administrator shall notify the manufacturer in writing 
regarding any decision reached under paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this 
section. The Administrator shall include in this notification the basis 
for reaching the determination.
    (f) Within 30 working days following receipt of notification of the 
Administrator's determinations made under paragraph (d) of this section, 
the manufacturer may request a hearing on those determinations. The 
request shall be in writing, signed by an authorized representative of 
the manufacturer, and shall include a statement specifying the 
manufacturer's objections to the Administrator's determinations, and 
data or other analysis in support of such objections. If, after review 
of the request and supporting data or analysis, the Administrator finds 
that the request raises a substantial factual issue, he/she shall 
provide the manufacturer a hearing in accordance with Sec. 86.1853-01 
with respect to such issue.


<R05>
Sec. 86.1852-01  Waivers for good in-use emission performance.

    (a) The Administrator may waive requirements of this subpart 
relating to development of emission-related information or test data if 
the Administrator determines with confidence that the in-use emission 
test verification data required in Sec. 86.1845-01 are below the 
applicable emission standards for an appropriate period of time, and 
that such performance is likely to continue in subsequent model years.
    (b) Any waiver granted under paragraph (a) of this section will be 
granted only if the Administrator determines that the waived requirement 
is not needed to assure continued emission compliance and the 
Administrator will have sufficient testing and other information in 
order to make certification decisions.
    (c) Any waiver granted under paragraph (a) of this section would be 
limited in duration to a period of one model year, unless extended by 
the Administrator as a result of continued demonstrations of good in-use 
emission performance.
    (d) The Administrator reserves the right to deny or revoke a waiver 
which may have been granted if he/she determines that the manufacturer 
no longer qualifies for the waiver.


<R05>
Sec. 86.1853-01  Certification hearings.

    (a)(1) After granting a request for a hearing under this subpart, 
the Administrator shall designate a Presiding Officer for the hearing.

01(e), the Administrator may in his discretion direct that all argument 
and presentation of evidence be concluded within such fixed period not 
less than 30 days as he may establish from the date that the first 
written offer of a hearing is made to the manufacturer. To expedite 
proceedings, the Administrator may direct that the decision of the 
Presiding Officer (who may, but need not be the Administrator) shall be 
the final EPA decision.
    (b)(1) Upon appointment pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, 
the Presiding Officer will establish a hearing file. The file shall 
consist of the notice issued by the Administrator together with any 
accompanying material, the request for a hearing and the supporting data 
submitted therewith, and all documents relating to the request for 
certification and all documents submitted therewith, and correspondence 
and other data material to the hearing.
    (2) The hearing file will be available for inspection by the 
applicant at the office of the Presiding Officer.
    (c) An applicant may appear in person, or may be represented by 
counsel or by any other duly authorized representative.
    (d)(1) The Presiding Officer upon the request of any party, or in 
his discretion, may arrange for a prehearing conference at a time and 
place specified by him to consider the following:
    (i) Simplification of the issues;

informal but orderly and expeditious manner. The parties may offer oral 
or written evidence, subject to the exclusion by the Presiding Officer 
of irrelevant, immaterial and repetitious evidence.
    (2) Witnesses will not be required to testify under oath. However, 
the Presiding Officer shall call to the attention of witnesses that 
their statements may be subject to the provisions of title 18 U.S.C. 
1001 which imposes penalties for knowingly making false statements or 
representations, or using false documents in any matter within the 
jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States.
    (3) Any witness may be examined or cross-examined by the Presiding 
Officer, the parties, or their representatives.
    (4) Hearings shall be reported verbatim. Copies of transcripts of 
proceedings may be purchased by the applicant from the reporter.
    (5) All written statements, charts, tabulations, and similar data

further proceedings unless there is an appeal to the Administrator or 
motion for review by the Administrator within 20 days of the date the 
initial decision was filed.
    (2) On appeal from or review of the initial decision the 
Administrator shall have all the powers which he would have in making 
the initial decision including the discretion to require or allow 
briefs, oral argument, the taking of additional evidence or the 
remanding to the Presiding Officer for additional proceedings. The 
decision by the Administrator shall include written findings and 
conclusions and the reasons or basis therefor on all the material issues 
of fact, law, or discretion presented on the appeal or considered in the 
review.

Secs. 86.1854-86.1859  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 86.1860-04  How to comply with the Tier 2 and interim non-Tier 2 fleet 
average NO<INF>X</INF> standards.

    (a) The fleet average standards referred to in this section are the 
corporate fleet average standards for FTP exhaust NO<INF>X</INF> 
emissions set forth in: Sec. 86.1811-04(d) for Tier 2 LDV/Ts and MDPVs 
(0.07 g/mi); Sec. 86.1811-04(l)(3) for interim non-Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs 
(0.30 g/mi); and, Sec. 86.1811-04(l)(3) for interim non-Tier 2 HLDT/
MDPVs (0.20 g/mi). Unless otherwise indicated in this section, the 
provisions of this section apply to all three corporate fleet average 
standards, except that the interim non-Tier 2 fleet average 
NO<INF>X</INF> standards do not apply to a manufacturer whose U.S. LDV/T 
and MDPV sales are 100% Tier 2 LDV/Ts and MDPVs.
    (b)(1) Each manufacturer must comply with the applicable fleet 
average NO<INF>X</INF> standard, or standards, on a sales weighted 
average basis, at the end of each model year, using the procedure 
described in this section.
    (2) During a phase-in year, the manufacturer must comply with the 
applicable fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> standard for the required phase-
in percentage for that year as specified in Sec. 86.1811-04(k)(1), or 
for the alternate phase-in percentage as permitted under Sec. 86.1811-
04(k)(6).

[[Page 548]]

    (c)(1)(i) Each manufacturer must separately compute the sales 
weighted averages of the individual NO<INF>X</INF> emission standards to 
which it certified all its Tier 2 vehicles, interim non-Tier 2 LDV/
LLDTs, and interim non-Tier 2 HLDT/MDPVs of a given model year as 
described in Sec. 86.1804(l)(2).
    (ii) For model years up to and including 2008, manufacturers must 
compute separate NO<INF>X</INF> fleet averages for Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs and 
Tier 2 HLDT/MDPVs.
    (2)(i) For model years up to and including 2008, if a manufacturer 
certifies its entire U.S. sales of Tier 2 or interim non-Tier 2 LDV/
LLDTs or interim non-Tier 2 HLDT/MDPVs, to full useful life bins having 
NO<INF>X</INF> standards at or below the applicable fleet average 
NO<INF>X</INF> standard, that manufacturer may elect not to compute a 
fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> level for that category of vehicles. A 
manufacturer making such an election must not generate NO<INF>X</INF> 
credits for that category of vehicles for that model year.
    (ii) For model years after 2008, if a manufacturer certifies its 
entire U.S. sales of Tier 2 vehicles to full useful life bins having 
NO<INF>X</INF> standards at or below 0.07 gpm, that manufacturer may 
elect not to compute a fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> level for its Tier 2 
vehicles. A manufacturer making such an election must not generate 
NO<INF>X</INF> credits for that model year.
    (d) The sales weighted NO<INF>X</INF> fleet averages determined 
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section must be compared with the 
applicable fleet average standard; 0.07 g/mi for NO<INF>X</INF> for Tier 
2 LDV/Ts and MDPVs, 0.30 g/mi for NO<INF>X</INF> for interim non-Tier 2 
LDV/LLDTs, and 0.20 g/mi for NOx for interim non-Tier 2 HLDT/MDPVs. Each 
manufacturer must comply on an annual basis with the fleet average 
standards by:
    (1) Showing that its sales weighted average NO<INF>X</INF> emissions 
of its LDV/LLDTs, HLDT/MDPVs or LDV/Ts, as applicable, are at or below 
the applicable fleet average standard; or
    (2) If the sales weighted average is not at or below the applicable 
fleet average standard, by obtaining and applying sufficient Tier 2 
NO<INF>X</INF> credits, interim non-Tier 2 LDV/LLDT NO<INF>X</INF> 
credits or interim non-Tier 2 HLDT/MDPV NO<INF>X</INF> credits, as 
appropriate, and as permitted under Sec. 86.1861-04.
    (i) Manufacturers may not use NMOG credits generated under the NLEV 
program in subpart R of this part to meet any Tier 2 or interim non-Tier 
2 NO<INF>X</INF> fleet average standard.
    (ii) Tier 2 NO<INF>X</INF> credits may not be used to meet any fleet 
average interim non-Tier 2 NO<INF>X</INF> standard except as permitted 
by Sec. 86.1860-04(e)(1).
    (iii) Interim non-Tier 2 NO<INF>X</INF> credits may not be used to 
meet the Tier 2 fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> standard.
    (iv) Interim non-Tier 2 NO<INF>X</INF> credits from HLDT/MDPVs may 
not be used to meet the fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> standard for 
interim non-Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs, and interim non-Tier 2 credits from LDV/
LLDTs may not be used to meet the fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> standard 
for interim non-Tier 2 HLDT/MDPVs.
    (e) (1) Manufacturers that cannot meet the requirements of paragraph 
(d) of this section, may carry forward a credit deficit for three model 
years, but must not carry such deficit into the fourth year. When 
applying credits to reduce or eliminate a deficit under the fleet 
average standard for interim LDV/LLDTs or interim HLDT/MDPVs, that has 
been carried forward into a year subsequent to its generation, a 
manufacturer may apply credits from Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs or Tier 2 HLDT/
MDPVs, respectively, as well as from the appropriate group of interim 
vehicles. A manufacturer must not use interim credits to reduce or 
eliminate any NO<INF>X</INF> credit deficit under the Tier 2 fleet 
average standard.
    (2) A manufacturer carrying a credit deficit into the third year 
must generate or obtain credits to offset that deficit and apply them to 
the deficit at a rate of 1.2:1, (i.e. deficits carried into the third 
model year must be repaid with credits equal to 120 percent of the 
deficit).
    (3) A manufacturer must not bank credits for future model years or 
trade credits to another manufacturer during a model year into which it 
has carried a deficit.
    (f) Computing fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> emissions. (1) 
Manufacturers must separately compute these fleet NO<INF>X</INF> 
averages using the equation contained in paragraph (f)(2) of this 
section:

[[Page 549]]

    (i) Their Tier 2 LDV/LLDT and Tier 2 HLDT/MDPV fleet average 
NO<INF>X</INF> emissions for each model year through 2008;
    (ii) Their combined Tier 2 LDV/T and MDPV fleet average 
NO<INF>X</INF> emissions for each model year after 2008;
    (iii) Their interim non-Tier 2 LDV/LLDT fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> 
emissions for each model year through 2006; and
    (iv) Their interim non-Tier 2 HLDT/MDPV fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> 
emissions for each model year through 2008.
    (2) The equation for computing fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> 
emissions is as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR10FE00.012


Where:
N = The number of vehicles sold in the applicable category that were 
certified for each corresponding NO<INF>X</INF> emission bin. N must be 
based on vehicles counted to the point of first sale.
Emission standard = The individual full useful life NO<INF>X</INF> 
emission standard for each bin for which the manufacturer had sales.

    (3) The results of the calculation in paragraph (f)(2) of this 
section must be rounded as required by Sec. 86.1837-01.
    (4) When approved in advance by the Administrator, the numerator in 
the equation in paragraph (f)(2) of this section may be adjusted 
downward by the product of the number of HEVs from each NO<INF>X</INF> 
emission bin times a HEV NO<INF>X</INF> contribution factor determined 
through mathematical estimation of the reduction in NO<INF>X</INF> 
emissions over the test procedure used to certify the HEVs. The 
reduction in NO<INF>X</INF> emissions must be determined using good 
engineering judgement and reflect the relation in actual full useful 
life NO<INF>X</INF> emissions to the full useful life NO<INF>X</INF> 
standards for the certification bin applicable to the vehicles. The 
Administrator may require that calculation of the HEV NO<INF>X</INF> 
contribution factor include vehicle parameters such as vehicle weight, 
portion of time during the test procedure that the HEV operates with 
zero exhaust emissions, zero emission range, NO<INF>X</INF> emissions 
from fuel-fired heaters and NO<INF>X</INF> emissions from electricity 
production and storage.
    (g) Additional credits for vehicles certified to 150,000 mile useful 
lives. (1) A manufacturer may certify any test group to an optional 
useful life of 15 years or 150,000 miles, whichever occurs first.
    (2)(i) For any test group certified to the optional 15 year/150,000 
mile useful life, the manufacturer may generate additional 
NO<INF>X</INF> credits, except as prohibited in paragraph (g)(3) of this 
section.
    (ii) The manufacturer must calculate these extra NO<INF>X</INF> 
credits, where permitted, by substituting an adjusted NO<INF>X</INF> 
standard for the applicable NO<INF>X</INF> standard from the full useful 
life certification bin when it calculates the applicable fleet average 
NO<INF>X</INF> emissions by the procedure in paragraph (f) of this 
section. The adjusted standard must be equal to the applicable full 
useful life NO<INF>X</INF> standard multiplied by 0.85 and rounded to 
one more decimal place than the number of decimal places as the 
applicable full useful life NO<INF>X</INF> standard.
    (3) A manufacturer electing not to comply with applicable 
intermediate life standards as permitted under Sec. 86.1811-04(c)(4) may 
not generate additional credits from vehicles certified to a useful life 
of 15 years/150,000 miles; except that, for bins where such intermediate 
life standards do not exist or are specifically deemed to be optional in 
Sec. 86.1811-04(c)(4), the manufacturer may generate additional 
NO<INF>X</INF> credits from vehicles certified to a useful life of 15 
years/150,000 miles.

[[Page 550]]

    (h) Additional credits for vehicles certified to low bins. A 
manufacturer may obtain additional NO<INF>X</INF> credits by certifying 
vehicles to bins 1 and/or 2 in model years from 2001 through 2005 
subject to the following requirements:
    (1) When computing the fleet average Tier 2 NO<INF>X</INF> emissions 
using the formula in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the manufacturer 
may multiply the number of vehicles certified to bins 1 and 2 by the 
applicable multiplier shown in Table S04-11 when computing the 
denominator in the formula. These multipliers may not be used after 
model year 2005. The table follows:

  Table S04-11--Multipliers for Additional Tier 2 NO<INF>X</INF> Credits for Bin 1
                              and 2 LDV/Ts
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Optionally, instead of the process described in paragraph (h)(1) 
of this section, when computing Tier 2 NO<INF>X</INF> credits using the 
formula in Sec. 86.1861-04(b)(1), the manufacturer may multiply the 
number of vehicles certified to bin 1 and bin 2 by the applicable 
multiplier shown in Table S04-11 in paragraph (h)(1) of this section 
when computing the ``Total number of Tier 2 Vehicles Sold, Including 
ZEVs and HEVs''. These multipliers may not be used after model year 
2005.

[65 FR 6866, Feb. 10, 2000, as amended at 66 FR 19310, Apr. 13, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 86.1861-04  How do the Tier 2 and interim non-Tier 2 NO<INF>X</INF> 
averaging, banking and trading programs work?

    (a) General provisions for Tier 2 credits and debits. (1) A 
manufacturer whose Tier 2 fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> emissions exceeds 
the 0.07 g/mile standard must complete the calculation at paragraph (b) 
of this section to determine the size of its NO<INF>X</INF> credit 
deficit. A manufacturer whose Tier 2 fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> 
emissions is less than or equal to the 0.07 g/mile standard must 
complete the calculation in paragraph (b) of this section if it desires 
to generate NO<INF>X</INF> credits. In either case, the number of 
credits or debits determined in the calculation at paragraph (b) of this 
section must be rounded to the nearest whole number.
    (2) Credits generated according to the calculation in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section may be banked for future use or traded to another 
manufacturer.
    (3) NO<INF>X</INF> credits are not subject to any discount or 
expiration date except as required under the deficit carryforward 
provisions of Sec. 86.1860-04(e)(2).
    (4) If a manufacturer calculates that it has negative credits 
(debits or a credit deficit) for a given model year, it must obtain 
sufficient credits, as required under Sec. 86.1860-04(e)(2), from 
vehicles produced by itself or another manufacturer in a model year no 
later than the third model year following the model year for which it 
calculated the credit deficit. (Example: if a manufacturer calculates 
that it has a NO<INF>X</INF> credit deficit for the 2008 model year, it 
must obtain sufficient NO<INF>X</INF> credits to offset that deficit 
from its own production or that of other manufacturers' 2011 or earlier 
model year vehicles.)
    (6)(i) Manufacturers may not use NO<INF>X</INF> credits to comply 
with the NLEV requirements of subpart R of this part.
    (ii) Manufacturers may not use NMOG credits generated by vehicles 
certified to the NLEV requirements of subpart R of this part to comply 
with any NO<INF>X</INF> requirements of this subpart.
    (iii) Manufacturers may not use NO<INF>X</INF> credits generated by 
interim non-Tier 2 vehicles to comply with the fleet average 
NO<INF>X</INF> standard for Tier 2 vehicles.
    (iv) Manufacturers may not use NO<INF>X</INF> credits generated by 
Tier 2 vehicles to comply with any fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> standard 
for interim non-Tier 2 vehicles, except as permitted under Sec. 86.1860-
04(e).
    (v) Manufacturers may not use NO<INF>X</INF> credits generated by 
interim non-Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs to comply with the fleet average 
NO<INF>X</INF> standard for interim non-Tier 2 HLDT/MDPVs.
    (vi) Manufacturers may not use NO<INF>X</INF> credits generated by 
interim non-Tier 2 HLDT/MDPVs to comply with the fleet average 
NO<INF>X</INF> standard for interim non-Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs.
    (vii) Manufacturers may not use NO<INF>X</INF> credits generated by 
Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs to comply with the Tier 2 NO<INF>X</INF> average 
standard for HLDT/MDPVs before the 2009 model year.

[[Page 551]]

    (viii) Manufacturers may not use NO<INF>X</INF> credits generated by 
Tier 2 HLDT/MDPVs to comply with the Tier 2 NO<INF>X</INF> average 
standard for LDV/LLDTs before the 2009 model year.
    (7) Manufacturers may bank Tier 2 NO<INF>X</INF> credits for later 
use to meet the Tier 2 fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> standard or trade 
them to another manufacturer. Credits are earned on the last day of the 
model year. Before trading or carrying over credits to the next model 
year, a manufacturer must apply available credits to offset any credit 
deficit, where the deadline to offset that credit deficit has not yet 
passed.
    (8) There are no property rights associated with NO<INF>X</INF> 
credits generated under this subpart. Credits are a limited 
authorization to emit the designated amount of emissions. Nothing in 
this Part or any other provision of law should be construed to limit 
EPA's authority to terminate or limit this authorization through a 
rulemaking.
    (b) Calculating Tier 2 credits and debits. (1) Manufacturers that 
achieve fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> values from the calculation in 
Sec. 86.1860-04(f), lower than the applicable fleet average 
NO<INF>X</INF> standard, may generate credits for a given model year, in 
units of vehicle-g/mi NO<INF>X</INF>, determined in this equation:
[(Fleet Average NO<INF>X</INF> Standard)-(Manufacturer's Fleet Average 
    NO<INF>X</INF> Value)] x (Total Number of Tier 2 Vehicles Sold, 
    Including ZEVs and HEVs).

Where: The number of Tier 2 vehicles sold is based on the point of first 
sale and does not include vehicles sold in California or a state that 
adopts, and has in effect for that model year, California emission 
requirements.
    (2) Where the result of the calculation in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section is a negative number, the manufacturer must generate negative 
NO<INF>X</INF> credits (debits).
    (c) Early banking. (1)(i) Manufacturers may certify LDV/LLDTs to the 
Tier 2 FTP exhaust standards in Sec. 86.1811-04 for model years 2001-
2003 in order to bank credits for use in the 2004 and later model years. 
Such vehicles must also meet SFTP exhaust emission standards specified 
in Sec. 86.1811-04.
    (ii) Manufacturers may certify HLDT/MDPVs to the Tier 2 FTP exhaust 
standards in Sec. 86.1811-04 for model years 2001-2007 in order to bank 
credits for use in the 2008 and later model years. Such vehicles must 
also meet applicable SFTP exhaust emission standards specified in 
Sec. 86.1811-04.
    (iii) This process is referred to as ``early banking'' and the 
resultant credits are referred to as ''early credits''. In order to bank 
early credits, a manufacturer must comply with all exhaust emission 
standards and requirements applicable to Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs and/or HLDT/
MDPVs, as applicable, except as allowed under paragraph (c)(4) of this 
section.
    (2) To generate early credits, a manufacturer must separately 
compute the sales weighted NO<INF>X</INF> average of the LDV/LLDTs and 
HLDT/MDPVs it certifies to the Tier 2 exhaust requirements and 
separately compute credits using the calculations in this section and in 
Sec. 86.1860-04.
    (3) Early HLDT/MDPV credits may not be applied to LDV/LLDTs before 
the 2009 model year. Early LDV/LLDT credits may not be applied to HLDT/
MDPVs before the 2009 model year.
    (4) Manufacturers may generate early Tier 2 credits from LDVs, LDT1s 
and LDT2s that are certified to a full useful life of 100,000 miles, 
provided that the credits are prorated by a multiplicative factor of 
0.833 (the quotient of 100,000/120,000). Where a manufacturer has both 
100,000 and 120,000 mile full useful life vehicles for which it desires 
to bank early credits, it must compute the credits from each group of 
vehicles separately and then add them together.
    (5) Manufacturers may bank early credits for later use to meet the 
Tier 2 fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> standard or trade them to another 
manufacturer subject to the restriction in paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section.
    (6) Early credits must not be used to comply with the fleet average 
NO<INF>X</INF> standards for interim non-Tier 2 vehicles.
    (7) Nothing in this section prevents the use of the NMOG values of 
2003 and earlier model year LDV/LLDTs from being used in calculations of 
the NMOG fleet average and subsequent NMOG credit generation, under 
subpart R of this part.

[[Page 552]]

    (d) Reporting and recordkeeping for Tier 2 NO<INF>X</INF> credits 
including early credits. Each manufacturer must comply with the 
reporting and recordkeeping requirements of Sec. 86.1862-04.
    (e) Fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> debits. (1) Manufacturers must 
offset any debits for a given model year by the fleet average 
NO<INF>X</INF> reporting deadline for the third model year following the 
model year in which the debits were generated as required in 
Sec. 86.1860.04(e)(2). Manufacturers may offset debits by generating 
credits or acquiring credits generated by another manufacturer.
    (2)(i) Failure to meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) through 
(d) of this section and of this paragraph (e), within the required 
timeframe for offsetting debits will be considered to be a failure to 
satisfy the conditions upon which the certificate(s) was issued and the 
individual noncomplying vehicles not covered by the certificate must be 
determined according to this section.
    (ii) If debits are not offset within the specified time period, the 
number of vehicles not meeting the fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> 
standards and not covered by the certificate must be calculated by 
dividing the total amount of debits for the model year by the fleet 
average NO<INF>X</INF> standard applicable for the model year in which 
the debits were first incurred.
    (iii) EPA will determine the vehicles for which the condition on the 
certificate was not satisfied by designating vehicles in those test 
groups with the highest certification NO<INF>X</INF> emission values 
first and continuing until a number of vehicles equal to the calculated 
number of noncomplying vehicles as determined above is reached. If this 
calculation determines that only a portion of vehicles in a test group 
contribute to the debit situation, then EPA will designate actual 
vehicles in that test group as not covered by the certificate, starting 
with the last vehicle produced and counting backwards.
    (3) If a manufacturer ceases production of LDV/Ts and MDPVs or is 
purchased by, merges with or otherwise combines with another 
manufacturer, the manufacturer continues to be responsible for 
offsetting any debits outstanding within the required time period. Any 
failure to offset the debits will be considered to be a violation of 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section and may subject the manufacturer to an 
enforcement action for sale of vehicles not covered by a certificate, 
pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (4) For purposes of calculating the statute of limitations, a 
violation of the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, a 
failure to satisfy the conditions upon which a certificate(s) was issued 
and hence a sale of vehicles not covered by the certificate, all occur 
upon the expiration of the deadline for offsetting debits specified in 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (f) NO<INF>X</INF> credit transfers. (1) EPA may reject 
NO<INF>X</INF> credit transfers if the involved manufacturers fail to 
submit the credit transfer notification in the annual report.
    (2) A manufacturer may not sell credits that are not available for 
sale pursuant to the provisions in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(7) of this 
section.
    (3) In the event of a negative credit balance resulting from a 
transaction, both the buyer and seller are liable, except in cases 
involving fraud. EPA may void ab initio the certificates of conformity 
of all engine families participating in such a trade.
    (4)(i) If a manufacturer transfers a credit that it has not 
generated pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section or acquired from 
another party, the manufacturer will be considered to have generated a 
debit in the model year that the manufacturer transferred the credit. 
The manufacturer must offset such debits by the deadline for the annual 
report for that same model year.
    (ii) Failure to offset the debits within the required time period 
will be considered a failure to satisfy the conditions upon which the 
certificate(s) was issued and will be addressed pursuant to paragraph 
(e) of this section.
    (g) Interim non-Tier 2 NO<INF>X</INF> credits and debits; Interim 
non-Tier 2 averaging, banking and trading. Interim non-Tier 2 
NO<INF>X</INF> credits must be generated, calculated, tracked, averaged, 
banked, traded, accounted for and reported upon separately from Tier 2 
credits. The provisions of this section applicable to Tier 2 
NO<INF>X</INF> credits and debits and Tier 2 averaging banking and 
trading are applicable to interim non-Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs and interim non-
Tier 2

[[Page 553]]

HLDT/MDPVs with the following exceptions:
    (1) Provisions for early banking under paragraph (c) of this section 
do not apply.
    (2) The fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> standard used for calculating 
credits is 0.30 grams per mile for interim non-Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs and 0.20 
g/mi for interim non-Tier 2 HLDT/MDPVs. (The interim non-Tier 2 
NO<INF>X</INF> standard of 0.30 (or 0.20) g/mi replaces 0.07 in the text 
and calculation in this section.)
    (3) Interim non-Tier 2 NO<INF>X</INF> credit deficits may be carried 
forward for three years subject to the requirements of Sec. 86.1860-
04(e).

Sec. 86.1862-04  Maintenance of records and submittal of information relevant 
to compliance with fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> standards.

    (a) Maintenance of records. (1) The manufacturer producing any 
light-duty vehicles and/or light-duty trucks subject to the provisions 
in this subpart must establish, maintain, and retain the following 
information in adequately organized and indexed records for each model 
year:
    (i) Model year;
    (ii) Applicable fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> standard: 0.07g/mi for 
Tier 2 LDV/Ts; 0.30 g/mi for interim non-Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs; or 0.20 g/mi 
for interim non-Tier 2 HLDT/MDPVs;
    (iii) Fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> value achieved; and
    (iv) All values used in calculating the fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> 
value achieved.
    (2) The manufacturer producing any LDV/Ts or MDPVs subject to the 
provisions in this subpart must establish, maintain, and retain the 
following information in adequately organized and indexed records for 
each LDV/T or MDPV subject to this subpart:
    (i) Model year;
    (ii) Applicable fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> standard;
    (iii) EPA test group;
    (iv) Assembly plant;
    (v) Vehicle identification number;
    (vi) NO<INF>X</INF> standard to which the LDV/T or MDPV is 
certified; and
    (vii) Information on the point of first sale, including the 
purchaser, city, and state.
    (3) The manufacturer must retain all records required to be 
maintained under this section for a period of eight years from the due 
date for the annual report. Records may be retained as hard copy or 
reduced to microfilm, ADP diskettes, and so forth, depending on the 
manufacturer's record retention procedure; provided, that in every case 
all information contained in the hard copy is retained.
    (4) Nothing in this section limits the Administrator's discretion to 
require the manufacturer to retain additional records or submit 
information not specifically required by this section.
    (5) Pursuant to a request made by the Administrator, the 
manufacturer must submit to the Administrator the information that the 
manufacturer is required to retain.
    (6) EPA may void ab initio a certificate of conformity for a vehicle 
certified to emission standards as set forth or otherwise referenced in 
this subpart for which the manufacturer fails to retain the records 
required in this section or to provide such information to the 
Administrator upon request.
    (b) Reporting. (1) Each covered manufacturer must submit an annual 
report. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the 
annual report must contain, for each applicable fleet average 
NO<INF>X</INF> standard, the fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> value 
achieved, all values required to calculate the NO<INF>X</INF> value, the 
number of credits generated or debits incurred, and all the values 
required to calculate the credits or debits. The annual report must 
contain the resulting balance of credits or debits.
    (2) When a manufacturer calculates compliance with the fleet average 
NO<INF>X</INF> standard using the provisions in Sec. 86.1860-04(c)(2), 
then the annual report must state that the manufacturer has elected to 
use such provision and must contain the fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> 
standard as the fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> value for that model year.
    (3) For each applicable fleet average NO<INF>X</INF> standard, the 
annual report must also include documentation on all credit transactions 
the manufacturer has

[[Page 554]]

engaged in since those included in the last report. Information for each 
transaction must include:
    (i) Name of credit provider;
    (ii) Name of credit recipient;
    (iii) Date the transfer occurred;
    (iv) Quantity of credits transferred; and
    (v) Model year in which the credits were earned.
    (4) Unless a manufacturer reports the data required by this section 
in the annual production report required under Sec. 86.1844-01(e) and 
subsequent model year provisions, a manufacturer must submit an annual 
report for each model year after production ends for all affected 
vehicles and trucks produced by the manufacturer subject to the 
provisions of this subpart and no later than May 1 of the calendar year 
following the given model year. Annual reports must be submitted to: 
Director, Vehicle Programs and Compliance Division, U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency, 2000 Traverwood, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105.
    (5) Failure by a manufacturer to submit the annual report in the 
specified time period for all vehicles and trucks subject to the 
provisions in this section is a violation of section 203(a)(1) of the 
Clean Air Act for each subject vehicle and truck produced by that 
manufacturer.
    (6) If EPA or the manufacturer determines that a reporting error 
occurred on an annual report previously submitted to EPA, the 
manufacturer's credit or debit calculations will be recalculated. EPA 
may void erroneous credits, unless transferred, and must adjust 
erroneous debits. In the case of transferred erroneous credits, EPA must 
adjust the selling manufacturer's credit or debit balance to reflect the 
sale of such credits and any resulting generation of debits.
    (c) Notice of opportunity for hearing. Any voiding of the 
certificate under paragraph (a)(6) of this section will be made only 
after EPA has offered the manufacturer concerned an opportunity for a 
hearing conducted in accordance with Sec. 86.614 for light-duty vehicles 
or Sec. 86.1014 for light-duty trucks and, if a manufacturer requests 
such a hearing, will be made only after an initial decision by the 
Presiding Officer.

    Appendix III to Part 86--Constant Volume Sampler Flow Calibration

    The following calibration procedure outlines the equipment, the test 
setup configuration, and the various parameters which must be measured 
to establish the flow rate of the constant volume sampler pump. All the 
parameters related to the pump are simultaneously measured with the 
parameters related to a flowmeter which is connected in series with the 
pump. The calculated flow rate (ft \3\/rev@ pump inlet absolute pressure 
and temperature) can then be plotted versus a correlation function which 
is the value of a specific combination of pump parameters. The linear 
equation which relates the pump flow and the correlation function is 
then determined. In the event that a CVS has a multiple speed drive, a 
calibration for each range should be performed.
    This calibration procedure is based on the measurement of the 
absolute values of the pump and flowmeter parameters that relate the 
flow rate at each point. Three conditions must be maintained to assure 
the accuracy and integrity of the calibration curve. First, the pump 
pressures should be measured at taps on the pump rather than at the 
external piping on the pump inlet and outlet. Pressure taps that are 
mounted at the top and bottom center of the pump drive headplate are 
exposed to the actual pump cavity pressures, and therefore reflect the 
absolute pressure differentials. Secondly, temperature stability must be 
maintained during the calibration. The laminar flowmeter is sensitive to 
inlet temperature oscillations which cause the data points to be 
scattered. Gradual changes (<plus-minus> 2  deg.F) in temperature are 
acceptable as long as they occur over a period of several minutes. 
Finally, all connections between the flowmeter and the CVS pump must be 
absolutely void of any leakage.
    During a CVS emissions test the measurement of these same pump 
parameters enables the user to calculate the flow rate from the 
calibration equation.
    After the calibration curve has been obtained, a verification test 
of the entire system can be performed by injecting a known mass of gas 
into the system and comparing the mass indicated by the system to the 
true mass injected. An indicated error does not necessarily mean that 
the calibration is wrong, since other factors can influence the accuracy 
of the system.

Equipment:

    The following list of equipment will be needed to perform this 
calibration procedure. Figure 1 illustrates a typical equipment 
arrangement used for calibration. All of the equipment involved should 
conform to the range and accuracy as specified in Figure 1.

Equipment List:

    1. LFE--Laminar Flowmeter
    2. Micromanometer
    3. Thermometer
    4. Timer
    5. U-Tube Manometers
    6. Temperature Indicator with type J Thermocouples
    7. A variable flow restrictor with appropriate piping to connect the 
CVS pump and LFE.
    After the system has been connected as shown in Figure 1, set the 
variable restrictor in the wide open position and run the CVS pump for 
twenty minutes. Record the calibration data.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: The fluid level in the manometer tube should stabilize before the reading is made and the elapsed time for
  revolution counting should be greater than 120 seconds.

    Reset the restrictor valve to a more restricted condition in an 
increment of pump inlet depression (about 4[dprime] H<INF>2</INF>O) that 
will yield a minimum of six data points for the total calibration.
    Allow the system to stabilize for 3 minutes and repeat the data 
acquisition.


[[Page 626]]


Data Analysis:

    The data recorded during the calibration are to be used in the 
following calculations.
    1. The air flow rate at each test point is calculated in standard 
cubic feet per minute (Qs) from the flowmeter data using the 
manufacturer's prescribed method.
    2. The air flow rate is then converted to pump flow, Vo, in cubic 
feet per revolution at absolute pump inlet temperature and pressure.

     V<INF>o</INF> = Qs/n x T<INF>p</INF>/530 x 29.92/P<INF>p</INF>

where:
Qs=Meter air flow rate in standard cubic feet per minute (flowmeter 
standard conditions are 70  deg.F, 29.92 ``Hg).
n=Pump speed in revolutions per minute.
P<INF>p</INF>=Absolute pump inlet pressure, in (``Hg).
P<INF>p</INF>=P<INF>B</INF>-PPI (SP.GR./13.57), T<INF>p</INF> = PTI + 
460.

    3. The correlation function at each test point is then calculated 
from the calibration data, as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.139

[Delta]P<INF>p</INF> = The pressure differential from pump inlet to pump 
outlet in (``Hg).

           [Delta]P<INF>p</INF> = P<INF>e</INF>-P<INF>p</INF>

P<INF>e</INF>=Absolute pump outlet pressure, in (``Hg).

           P<INF>p</INF> = P<INF>B</INF> + PPO (Sp. Gr./13.57)

    See Sec. 86.177-22 for other definitions.
    4. A linear least squares fit is performed to generate the 
calibration equations which have the forms

             V<INF>o</INF> = D<INF>o</INF>-M(X<INF>o</INF>)

                         n = A-B( P<INF>p</INF>)

    Do, M, A, and B are the slope-intercept constants describing the 
lines.
    A CVS system that has multiple speeds should be calibrated on each 
speed used. The calibration curves generated for the ranges will be 
approximately parallel and the intercept values, D<INF>o</INF>, will 
increase as the pump flow range decreases.

[[Page 627]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06OC93.196

    If the calibration has been performed carefully, the calculated 
V<INF>o</INF> values from the equation will be within <plus-minus>.50% 
of the measured value of V<INF>o</INF>. Values of M will vary from one 
pump to another, but values of D<INF>o</INF> for pumps of the same make, 
model, and range should agree within <plus-minus>3 percent of each 
other. Particulate influx from use will cause the pump slip to decrease 
as reflected by lower values for M. Calibrations should be performed at 
0, 30, 100, 200, 400, etc. hours of pump operation to assure the 
stability of the pump slip rate. Analysis of mass injection data will 
also reflect pump slip stability.

CVS System Verification:

    The following technique can be used to verify that the CVS and 
analytical instruments can accurately measure a mass of gas that has 
been injected into the system.
    1. Obtain a small cylinder that has been charged with pure propane 
or carbon monoxide gas (caution--carbon monoxide is poisonous!). 
Critical flow orifice devices can also be used for constant flow 
metering.
    2. Determine a reference cylinder weight to the nearest 0.01 gram.
    3. Operate the CVS in the normal manner and release a quantity of 
pure propane or

[[Page 628]]

carbon monoxide into the system during the sampling period.
    4. The calculations of Sec. 86.177-22 are performed in a normal way 
except, in the case of propane, the density of propane (17.30 grams/cu./
ft./carbon atom) is used in place of the density of exhaust 
hydrocarbons. In the case of carbon monoxide, the density of 32.97 
grams/cu. ft. is used.
    5. The gravimetric mass is subtracted from the CVS measured mass and 
then divided by the gravimetric mass to determine the percent accuracy 
of the system.
    6. The cause for any discrepancy greater than <plus-minus>2 percent 
should be found and corrected. The following list of parametric errors 
may assist the operator in locating the cause of large errors.
    Positive Error (Indication is higher than true value):
    1. Calculated V<INF>o</INF> is greater than actual V<INF>o</INF>.
    a. Original calibration in error.
    2. Pump inlet temperature recorder is reading low. A 6  deg.F. 
discrepancy will give a 1 percent error.
    3. Pump inlet pressure indicator is reading high. A 3.5 in. 
H<INF>2</INF>O high reading will give 1 percent error.
    4. Background concentration reading is too low. Check analyzer zero. 
Check leakage at floor inlet.
    5. Analyzer is reading high. Check span.
    6. Barometer reading is in error (too high). Barometric pressure 
reading should be gravity and temperature corrected.
    7. Revolution counter is reading high (Check pump speed and 
counters.)
    8. Mixture is stratified causing the sample to be higher than the 
average concentration in the mixture. Negative Error (Indication is 
lower than true value):
    1. Calculated V<INF>o</INF> is less than actual V<INF>o</INF>.
    a. Original calibration in error.
    b. Pump clearances decreased due to influx of some surface adherent 
material. Recalibration may be needed.
    2. Pump inlet temperature recorder is reading high.
    3. Pump inlet pressure indicator is reading low.
    4. Background concentration reading is too high.
    5. Analyzer is reading low.
    6. Barometer reading is in error (too low).
    7. Revolution counter is reading low.
    8. There is a leak into the sampling system. Pressure check the 
lines and fittings on the intake side of sample transfer pumps on both 
the CVS and analyzer console.

  Appendix XIV to Part 86--Determination of Acceptable Durability Test 
Schedule for Light-Duty Vehicles and Light Light-Duty Trucks Certifying 
                 to the Provisions of Part 86, Subpart R

    A manufacturer may determine mileage test intervals for durability-
data vehicles subject to the conditions specified in Sec. 86.1726. The 
following procedure shall be used to determine if the schedule is 
acceptable to the Administrator:
    1. Select exhaust system mileage test points and maintenance mileage 
test points for proposed (prop) schedule.
    2. Calculate the sums of the squares corrected to the mean of the 
system mileages at the proposed test points:

A<INF>prop</INF> = [[sum3](X<INF>p</INF>)<SUP>2</SUP> - 
(([sum3]X<INF>p</INF>)<SUP>2</SUP> / N<INF>p</INF>))<INF>prop</INF>

Where:

X<INF>p</INF> = Individual mileages at which the vehicle will be tested.
N<INF>p</INF> = Total number of tests (including before and after 
maintenance tests).

(Subscript ``p'' refers to proposed test schedule).

    3. Determine exhaust system mileage test points and maintenance 
mileage test points based on testing at five thousand mile intervals 
from 5,000 miles through the final testing point and maintenance mileage 
test points selected for the proposed schedule in step 1 of this 
appendix. This schedule will be designated as the standard (std) test 
schedule.
    4. Calculate the sums of squares corrected to the mean of the 
standard schedule:

B<INF>std</INF>=[[sum3](X<INF>s</INF>)<SUP>2</SUP>-
(([sum3]X<INF>s</INF>)<SUP>2</SUP>/N<INF>s</INF>))<INF>std</INF>

Where:
X<INF>s</INF> = Individual mileages at which the vehicle will be tested.
N<INF>s</INF> = Total number of tests (including before and after 
maintenance).

(Subscript ``s'' refers to standard test schedule).
    5. Refer to table I and determine t<INF>p</INF> at (N<INF>p</INF> - 
2)<INF>prop</INF> degrees of freedom and t<INF>s</INF> at (N<INF>s</INF> 
- 2)<INF>std</INF>.
    6. If (A<INF>prop</INF>)<SUP>\1/2\</SUP>[ge]t<INF>p</INF>/
t<INF>s</INF>x(B<INF>std</INF>)<SUP>\1/2\</SUP> the proposed plan is 
acceptable.

Appendix XVI to Part 86--Pollutant Mass Emissions Calculation Procedure 
for Gaseous-Fueled Vehicles and for Vehicles Equipped With Periodically 
Regenerating Trap Oxidizer Systems Certifying to the Provisions of Part 
                              86, Subpart R

    (a) Gaseous-Fueled Vehicle Pollutant Mass Emission Calculation 
Procedure.
    (1) For all TLEVs, LEVs, and ULEVs, the calculation procedures 
specified in Chapter 5 of the California Regulatory Requirements 
Applicable to the National Low Emission Vehicle Program (October, 1996) 
shall apply. These procedures are incorporated by reference (see 
Sec. 86.1).
    (b) Pollutant Mass Emissions Calculation Procedure for Vehicles 
Equipped with Periodically Regenerating Trap Oxidizer Systems.
    (1) Exhaust Emissions. (i) The provisions of Sec. 86.1777 apply to 
vehicles equipped with periodically regenerating trap oxidizer systems, 
except that the following shall apply instead of the requirements in 
Sec. 86.144-94(a):
    (ii) The final reported test results shall be computed by the use of 
the following formula:
    (iii) For light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks:

Y<INF>wm</INF> = 0.43 ((Yct + Ys) / (Dct + Ds)) + 0.57 ((Yht + Ys) / 
(Dht + Ds)).

    (iv) For purposes of adjusting emissions for regeneration:

Re = ((Yr1 - Yct) + (Yr2 - Ys) + (Yr3 - Yht)) / (Dct + Ds + Dht).
Yr = Ywm + Re.

Where:

Ywm = Weighted mass emissions of each pollutant, i.e., HC, CO, 
NO<INF>X</INF> or CO , in grams per vehicle mile.
Yct = Mass emissions as calculated from the ``transient'' phase of the 
cold start test, in grams per test phase.
Yht = Mass emissions as calculated from the ``transient'' phase of the 
hot start test in grams per test phase.
Ys = Mass emissions as calculated from the ``stabilized'' phase of the 
cold start test, in grams per test phase.
Dct = The measured driving distance from the ``transient'' phase of the 
cold start test, in miles.
Dht = The measured distance from the ``transient'' phase of the hot 
start test, in miles.
Ds = The measured driving distance from the ``stabilized'' phase of the 
cold start test, in miles.
Yr = Regeneration emission test.
Re = Mass emissions of each pollutant attributable to regeneration in 
grams per mile.
Yr1 = Mass emissions, during a regeneration emission test, as calculated 
from the ``transient'' phase of the cold start test, in grams per test 
phase.
Yr2 = Mass emissions, during a regeneration emission test, as calculated 
from the ``stabilized'' phase of the cold start test, in grams per test 
phase.
Yr3 = Mass emissions, during a regeneration emission test, as calculated 
from the ``transient'' phase of the hot start test in grams per test 
phase.
    (2) Particulate Emissions. (i) The provisions of Sec. 86.1778 apply 
to vehicles equipped with periodically regenerating trap oxidizer 
systems, except that the following shall apply instead of the 
requirements Sec. 86.145-82(a):
    (ii) The final reported test results for the mass particulate (Mp) 
in grams/mile shall be computed as follows.
    (iii) For purposes of adjusting emissions for regeneration:

Mp = 0.43(Mp1 + Mp2) / (Dct + Ds) + 0.57 (Mp3 + Mp2) / (Dht + Ds)
Re = ((Mpr1 - Mp1) + (Mpr2 - Mp2) + (Mpr3 - Mp3) / (Dct + Ds + Dht)
Mpr = Mp + Re

Where:
(1) Mp1 = Mass of particulate determined from the ``transient'' phase of 
the cold start test, in grams per test phase. (See Sec. 86.110-94(d)(1) 
for determination.)
(2) Mp2 = Mass of particulate determined from the ``stabilized'' phase 
of the cold start test, in grams per test phase. (See Sec. 86.110-
94(d)(1) for determination.)
(3) Mp3 = Mass of particulate determined from the ``transient'' phase of 
the hot start test, in grams per test phase. (See Sec. 86.110-94(d)(1) 
for determination.)
(4) Dct = The measured driving distance from the ``transient'' phase of 
the cold start test, in miles.

[[Page 638]]

(5) Ds = The measured driving distance from the ``stabilized'' phase of 
the cold start test, in miles.
(6) Dht = The measured driving distance from the ``transient'' phase of 
the hot start test, in miles.
(7) Mpr = Regeneration emission test
(8) Re = Mass of particulate attributable to regeneration in grams/mile.
(9) Mpr1 = Mass of particulate determined, during a regeneration 
emission test, from the ``transient'' phase of the cold start test in 
grams per test phase. (See Sec. 86.110-94(d)(1) for determination.)
(10) Mpr2 = Mass of particulate determined, during a regeneration 
emission test, from ``stabilized'' phase of the cold start test, in 
grams per test phase. (See Sec. 86.110-94(d)(1) for determination.)
(11) Mpr3 = Mass of particulate determined, during a regeneration 
emission test, from the ``transient'' phase of the hot start test, in 
grams per test phase. (See Sec. 86.110-94(d)(1) for determination.)

    (c) Fuel Economy Calculations for Gaseous Fuels Based on the Cold 
Start CVS-1975 Federal Test Procedure.
    (1) Assume the fuel meets HD-5 specifications (95% 
C<INF>3</INF>H<INF>8</INF>, 5% nC<INF>4</INF>H<INF>10</INF>, by volume).

  Appendix XVII to Part 86--Procedure for Determining Vehicle Emission 
   Control Technology Category/Fuel Reactivity Adjustment Factors for 
   Light-Duty Vehicles and Light Light-Duty Trucks Certifying to the 
                    Provisions of Part 86, Subpart R

    The following procedure shall be used by the Administrator to 
establish the reactivity adjustment factor for exhaust emissions of non-
methane organic gases (NMOG) and establish the ``methane reactivity 
adjustment factor'' for exhaust methane emissions from natural gas 
vehicles, for the purpose of certifying a vehicle of specific emission 
control technology category and fuel for the National LEV program 
provisions of subpart R of this part.
    (a) The Administrator shall determine representative speciated NMOG 
exhaust emission profiles for light-duty conventional gasoline-fueled 
TLEVs, LEVs, and ULEVs according to the following conditions:
    (1) All testing will be conducted using a specified gasoline blend 
representative of

[[Page 639]]

commercial gasoline and having the specifications listed in 
Sec. 86.1771.
    (2) Speciated NMOG profiles shall be obtained from a statistically 
valid number of TLEVs, LEVs, and ULEVs.
    (3) The speciated NMOG profiles shall identify and quantify, in 
units of g/mile or mg/mile, as many constituents as possible in 
accordance with the procedures specified in Chapter 5 of the California 
Regulatory Requirements Applicable to the National Low Emission Vehicle 
Program (October, 1996). These procedures are incorporated by reference 
(see Sec. 86.1).
    (b) The ``g ozone potential per mile'' of each NMOG identified in 
the speciated profile shall be determined by multiplying the ``g/mile 
NMOG'' emission value of the constituent NMOG by its maximum incremental 
reactivity in paragraph (j) of this appendix.
    (c) The ``total g ozone potential per mile'' of NMOG exhaust 
emissions from the vehicle/fuel system shall be the sum of all the 
constituent NMOG ``g ozone potential per mile'' values calculated in 
paragraph (b) of this appendix.
    (d) The ``g ozone potential per g NMOG'' for the vehicle/fuel system 
shall be determined by dividing the ``total g ozone potential per mile'' 
value calculated in paragraph (c) of this appendix by the ``total g/mile 
of NMOG emissions''.
    (e) For light-duty candidate vehicle/fuel systems not powered by 
conventional gasoline, the Administrator shall establish ``reactivity 
adjustment factors'' calculated from exhaust emission profiles derived 
according to the same conditions specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and 
(a)(2) of this appendix.
    (f) The ``g ozone potential per g NMOG'' for candidate vehicle/fuel 
systems not powered by conventional gasoline shall be determined 
according to paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this appendix.
    (g)(1) The candidate vehicle/fuel ``reactivity adjustment factor'' 
shall be determined by dividing the ``g ozone potential per g NMOG'' 
calculated in paragraph (f) of this appendix by the ``g ozone potential 
per g NMOG'' value for the vehicle in the same emission control 
technology category operated on conventional gasoline. The ``g ozone 
potential per g NMOG'' values for conventional gasoline vehicles are 
listed in Sec. 86.1777(b)(5) or shall be established by the 
Administrator pursuant to this appendix. For candidate vehicle/fuel 
systems powered by methanol or liquefied petroleum gas, the quotient 
calculated above shall be multiplied by 1.1. The resulting value shall 
constitute the ``reactivity adjustment factor'' for the methanol or 
liquefied petroleum gas-powered vehicle/fuel system.
    (2) For candidate vehicle/fuel systems operating on natural gas, a 
``methane reactivity adjustment factor'' shall be calculated by dividing 
the maximum incremental reactivity value for methane given in paragraph 
(j) of this appendix by the ``g ozone potential per g NMOG'' value for 
the vehicle in the same emission control technology category operated on 
conventional gasoline as listed in Sec. 86.1777(b)(5) or established by 
the Administrator pursuant to this appendix.
    (h) The Administrator shall assign a reactivity adjustment factor 
unique to a specific engine family at the request of a vehicle 
manufacturer provided that each of the following occurs:
    (1)(i) The manufacturer submits speciated NMOG exhaust emission 
profiles to the Administrator obtained from emission testing a minimum 
of four different vehicles representative of vehicles that will be 
certified in the engine family. The test vehicles shall include the 
official emission-data vehicle(s) for the engine family, and the mileage 
accumulation of each vehicle shall be at or greater than 4000 miles. One 
speciated profile shall be submitted for each test vehicle. Emission 
levels of each constituent NMOG shall be measured according to Chapter 5 
of the California Regulatory Requirements Applicable to the National Low 
Emission Vehicle Program (October, 1996). These procedures are 
incorporated by reference (see Sec. 86.1). For the emission-data 
vehicle(s), the speciated profile(s) shall be obtained from the same 
test used to obtain the official exhaust emission test results for the 
emission-data vehicle at the 4,000 mile test point. The manufacturer 
shall calculate ``g ozone potential per g NMOG'' values for each 
speciated NMOG exhaust emission profile in accordance with the 
procedures specified in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this appendix. 
By using these ``g ozone potential per g NMOG'' values, the manufacturer 
shall calculate a ``reactivity adjustment factor'' for each test vehicle 
in accordance with the procedure specified in paragraph (g) of this 
appendix. A ``reactivity adjustment factor'' for the engine family shall 
be calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of the ``reactivity 
adjustment factor'' obtained for each test vehicle. The 95 percent upper 
confidence bound (95% UCB) shall be calculated according to the 
equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06JN97.003

Where:

RAF<INF>m</INF> = mean ``reactivity adjustment factor'' calculated for 
the engine family.
RAF<INF>i</INF> = ``reactivity adjustment factor'' calculated for the 
i'th test vehicle.
n = number of test vehicles.

    (ii) The 95 percent upper confidence bound of the ``reactivity 
adjustment factor'' for the engine family shall be less than or equal to

[[Page 640]]

115 percent of the engine family ``reactivity adjustment factor.''
    (2) The manufacturer submits an ``ozone deterioration factor'' for 
the engine family. To determine the ``ozone deterioration factor,'' the 
manufacturer shall perform two tests at each mileage interval for one or 
more durability vehicle(s) tested in accordance with the procedures and 
conditions specified in subpart R of this part for calculating mass 
deterioration factors. The Administrator shall approve the use of other 
mileage intervals and procedures if the manufacturer can demonstrate 
that equivalently representative ``ozone deterioration factors'' are 
obtained. One speciated profile shall be submitted for each test. 
Emission levels of each constituent NMOG shall be measured according to 
Chapter 5 of the California Regulatory Requirements Applicable to the 
National Low Emission Vehicle Program (October, 1996). These procedures 
are incorporated by reference (see Sec. 86.1). A mean g/mi NMOG mass 
value and a mean ``g ozone per g NMOG'' value shall be calculated by 
taking the arithmetic mean of each measurement from the speciated 
profiles. These results shall be multiplied together to obtain a mean 
``total g ozone potential per mile'' value at each mileage interval. A 
mean ``ozone deterioration factor'' shall be calculated in accordance 
with the procedures in Sec. 86.1777 and this appendix except that the 
mean total ``g ozone potential per mile'' value determined at each 
mileage interval shall be used in place of measured mass emissions. If 
the ``ozone deterioration factor'' is determined to be less than 1.00, 
the ``ozone deterioration factor'' shall be assigned a value of 1.00. 
The ``ozone deterioration factor'' shall be multiplied by the product of 
the official exhaust NMOG mass emission results at the 4000 mile test 
point and the mean ``reactivity adjustment factor'' for the engine 
family to obtain the NMOG certification levels used to determine 
compliance with the NMOG emission standards.
    (3) The speciated profiles, mean ``reactivity adjustment factor'' 
for the engine family, and ``ozone deterioration factor'' are provided 
to the Administrator with the certification application for the engine 
family.
    (i) Gasoline meeting the specifications listed in the following 
tables shall be used to determine the ``g ozone potential per g NMOG'' 
of conventional gasoline (the test methods used for each fuel property 
shall be the same as the test method for the identical fuel property 
listed in Sec. 86.1771):

Appendix XVIII to Part 86--Statistical Outlier Identification Procedure 
 for Light-Duty Vehicles and Light Light-Duty Trucks Certifying to the 
                    Provisions of Part 86, Subpart R

    Residual normal deviates to indicate outliers are used routinely and 
usefully in analyzing regression data, but suffer theoretical 
deficiencies if statistical significance tests are required. 
Consequently, the procedure for testing for outliers outlined by 
Snedecor and Cochran, 6th ed., Statistical Methods, PP. 157-158, will be 
used. The method will be described generally, then by appropriate 
formulae, and finally a numerical example will be given.
    (a) Linearity is assumed (as in the rest of the deterioration factor 
calculation procedure), and each contaminant is treated separately. The 
procedure is as follows:
    (1) Calculate the deterioration factor regression as usual, and 
determine the largest residual in absolute value. Then recalculate the 
regression with the suspected outlier omitted. From the new regression 
line calculate the residual at the deleted point, denoted as 
(y<INF>i</INF> - y<INF>i</INF>'). Obtain a statistic by dividing 
(y<INF>i</INF> - y<INF>i</INF>') by the square root of the estimated 
variance of (y<INF>i</INF> - y<INF>i</INF>'). Find the tailed 
probability, p, from the t-distribution corresponding to the quotient 
(double-tailed), with n-3 degrees of freedom, with n the original sample 
size.
    (2) This probability, p, assumes the suspected outlier is randomly 
selected, which is not true. Therefore, the outlier will be rejected 
only if 1 - (1-p)<SUP>n</SUP> < 0.05.
    (3) The procedure will be repeated for each contaminant individually 
until the above procedure indicates no outliers are present.
    (4) When an outlier is found, the vehicle test-log will be examined. 
If an unusual vehicle malfunction is indicated, data for all 
contaminants at that test-point will be rejected; otherwise, only the 
identified outlier will be omitted in calculating the deterioration 
factor.
    (b) Procedure for the calculation of the t-Statistic for 
Deterioration Data Outlier Test.
    (1) Given a set of n points, (x<INF>1</INF>, y<INF>1</INF>), 
(x<INF>2</INF>, y<INF>2</INF>) * * * (x<INF>n</INF>, y<INF>n</INF>).

Where:

x<INF>i</INF> is the mileage of the i<SUP>th</SUP> data point.
y<INF>i</INF> is the emission of the i<SUP>th</SUP> data point.
Assume model:

y = a + [beta](x - x) + [isin]

    (2)(i) Calculate the regression line.

y = a + b(x - x)

    (ii) Suppose the absolute value of the i<SUP>th</SUP> residual

(y<INF>i</INF> - y<INF>i</INF>) is the largest.

    (3)(i) Calculate the regression line with the i<SUP>th</SUP> point 
deleted.

y' = a' + b'(x - x)
    (ii)
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06JN97.004
    
Where:

y<INF>1</INF> is the observed suspected outlier.
y'<INF>i</INF> is the predicted value with the suspected outlier 
deleted.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06JN97.005

(x is calculated without the suspected outlier)
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06JN97.006

    (iii) Find p from the t-statistic table

Where:

p = prob ([verbar]t(n-3) [verbar] [ge] t)
t(n-3) is a t-distributed variable with n-3 degrees of freedom.

    (iv) y<INF>i</INF> is an outlier if 1-(1-p)<SUP>n</SUP> < .05
