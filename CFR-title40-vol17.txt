              the Federal Register (44 U.S.C. 1510).

          It is prohibited to use NARA's official seal and the stylized Code 
              of Federal Regulations logo on any republication of this 
              material without the express, written permission of the 
              Archivist of the United States or the Archivist's designee. 
              Any person using NARA's official seals and logos in a manner 
              inconsistent with the provisions of 36 CFR part 1200 is

                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2009), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

<R05>
Sec. 81.300  Scope.

    (a) Attainment status designations as approved or designated by the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to section 107 of the CAA 
are listed in this subpart. Area designations are subject to revision 
whenever sufficient data becomes available to warrant a redesignation. 
Both the State and EPA can initiate changes to these designations, but 
any State redesignation must be submitted to EPA for concurrence. The 
EPA has replaced the national ambient air quality standards for 
particulate matter measured as total suspended particulate with 
standards measured as particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter 
less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM-10). Accordingly, 
area designations for PM-10 are included in the lists in subpart C of 
this part. However, the TSP area designations will also remain in effect 
until the Administrator determines that the designations are no longer 
necessary for implementing the maximum allowable increases in 
concentrations of particulate matter pursuant to section 163(b) of the 
CAA, as explained in paragraph (b) of this section. The EPA has also 
added national ambient air quality standards for fine particulate matter 
measured as particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or 
equal to a nominal 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5). Accordingly, area 
designations for PM2.5 are included in the lists in subpart C of this 
part.
    (b) Designated areas which are listed below as attainment (``Better 
than national standards'') or unclassifiable (``Cannot be classified'') 
for total suspended particulate (TSP), sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>), 
and nitrogen dioxide (NO<INF>2</INF>), represent potential baseline 
areas or portions of baseline areas which are used in determining 
compliance with maximum allowable increases (increments) in 
concentrations of the respective pollutants for the prevention of 
significant deterioration of air quality (PSD). With respect to areas 
identified as ``Rest of State'' it should be assumed that such reference 
comprises a single area designation for PSD baseline area purposes. 
However, for PM-10, the use of the term ``Rest of State'' is an interim 
measure to designate as unclassifiable all locations not originally 
designated nonattainment for PM-10 in accordance with section 
107(d)(4)(B) of the Act.
    (c) For PM-10 areas designated nonattainment, pursuant to section 
107(d)(4)(b) by operation of law upon enactment of the 1990 Amendments 
to the Act, the boundaries are more fully described as follows:
    (1) For cities and towns, the boundary of the nonattainment area is 
defined by the municipal boundary limits as of November 15, 1990, the 
date the 1990 Amendments were signed into law, except for areas which 
were formerly categorized as ``Group I areas'', in which case the 
nonattainment area is defined by the municipal boundary limits as of 
October 31, 1990.
    (2) Similarly, for planning areas, air quality maintenance areas, 
air basins, and urban growth boundaries the nonattainment area is 
defined by the entire planning area, air quality maintenance area, air 
basin, or urban growth boundary as of November 15, 1990, except for 
areas which were formerly ``Group I'', in which case the boundary is 
defined by the entire planning area, air quality maintenance area, air 
basin, or urban growth boundary as of October 31, 1990. The foregoing is 
true except to the extent the planning area, air quality maintenance 
area, air basin, or urban growth boundary is further defined, e.g., by 
township, range and/or section. Such geographical descriptors remain a 
fixed part of the nonattainment boundaries irrespective of whether they 
are included in the planning area, air quality maintenance area, air 
basin, or urban growth boundary.
    (3) The boundaries of PM-10 areas subsequently redesignated pursuant 
to section 107(d)(3) of the Act will be defined by the city, town, 
planning area, air quality maintenance area, air basin, or urban growth 
boundary in effect the date the designation is promulgated.
    (d) For ozone and carbon monoxide (CO) areas the effective date(s) 
of air quality area designations and classifications are described as 
follows:
    (1) For the portions of ozone and CO nonattainment areas that were 
designated nonattainment prior to the

[[Page 61]]

date of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 
(preenactment), the effective date is November 15, 1990.
    (2) For the portions of nonattainment areas that were designated 
attainment prior to November 15, 1990, and included as part of an area 
designated nonattainment prior to November 15, 1990, the effective date 
of the designation to nonattainment is November 15, 1990 for:
    (i) Purposes of determining whether the portion of the nonattainment 
area is eligible for the 5-percent classification adjustment under 
section 181(a)(4) (ozone) or section 186(a)(3) (CO);
    (ii) Triggering the process for determining the C/MSA boundary 
adjustment under section 107(d)(4)(A)(iv)-(v);
    (iii) Determining the scope of a ``covered area'' under section 211 
(k)(10)(D) and opt-in under section 211 (k)(6) for the reformulated 
gasoline requirement and for purposes of determining the baseline of the 
reductions needed to meet the requirement to reduce volatile organic 
compounds by 15 percent under section 181 (b)(1). For all other purposes 
the effective designation date is January 6, 1992 (except for the Towns 
of Blooming Grove, Chester, Highlands, Monroe, Tuxedo, Warwick, and 
Woodbury in Orange County, NY, and for Putnam County, NY, for which the 
effective date is January 15, 1992, and for the remainder of Orange 
County, NY, for which the effective date is April 21, 1994).
    (3) For nonattainment areas designated attainment preenactment, and 
not included as part of any nonattainment area that was designated 
nonattainment preenactment, the effective date for all purposes is the 
date of the designation.
    (e) Provisions for Early Action Compact Areas with Deferred 
Effective Date of Nonattainment Designation.
    (1) Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of 
this subpart. Any term not defined herein shall have the meaning as

notwithstanding clauses (i) through (iv) of section 107(d)(1)(B) of the 
Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7407(d)(1)(B)), the Administrator shall defer 
until April 15, 2008 the effective date of a nonattainment designation 
of any area subject to a compact that does not meet (or that contributes 
to ambient air quality in a nearby area that does not meet) the 8-hour 
ozone national ambient air quality standard if the Administrator 
determines that the area subject to a compact has met the requirements 
in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section. The Administrator

    (B) Prior to expiration of the deferred effective date on April 15, 
2008, if the Administrator determines that an area or the State subject 
to a compact has not met either requirement in paragraphs (e)(2)(iv) and 
(v) of this section, the nonattainment designation shall become 
effective as of the deferred effective date, unless EPA takes 
affirmative rulemaking action to further extend the deadline.
    (C) If the Administrator determines that an area subject to a 
compact and/or State has not met any requirement in paragraphs 
(e)(2)(iv) through (vi) of this section, the nonattainment designation 
shall become effective as of the deferred effective date, unless EPA 
takes affirmative rulemaking action to further extend the deadline.
    (D) Not later than 1 year after the effective date of the 
nonattainment designation, the State shall submit to the Administrator a 
revised attainment demonstration SIP.
    (iii) All Requirements Met. If the Administrator determines that an 
area subject to a compact has met all of the requirements under 
subparagraph (e)(2) of this section--
    (A) The Administrator shall designate the area as attainment under 
section 107(d)(1)(B) of the Clean Air Act; and
    (B) The designation shall become effective no later than April 15, 
2008.
    (4) What Action Shall the Administrator Take To Approve or

[[Page 136]]

 
           The Telluride attainment/
         maintenance area begins at the
         intersection of Colorado State
          Highway 145 and the Telluride
          service area boundary, as it
          existed in 1991. The western
         edge of the nonattainment area
         until it meets Remine Creek is
         defined as follows: A tract of
          land located in a portion of
          the west one-half of Section
           28 and the east one-half of
         Section 29, Township 43 North,
           Range 9 west, of New Mexico
          Principal Meridian, County of
         San Miguel, State of Colorado,
              described as follows:
           Beginning at the southwest
         corner of the said Section 28;
         Thence N 89 deg.36[min]00[sec]

          deg.56[min]00[sec] E. 1318.68
           Feet; to the true point of
           beginning containing 11249
            acres as described above.
           Then, at Remine Creek, the
             attainment/maintenance
          boundary follows the service
          area boundary for 9.65 miles
            to the 9,200 foot contour
             line. The boundary then
           intersects Bear Creek. Here
           the attainment/maintenance
           boundary diverges from the
          service area boundary (9,200
             foot contour line). The
             attainment/maintenance
          boundary continues in a west,
          southwest direction for 0.92
         miles from the intersection of
           the 9,200 foot contour line
          and Bear Creek to the top of
            ski lift number 9 in the
            Telluride Ski Area at an
            elevation of about 11,900
         feet. The boundary then shifts
          and runs in a north-westerly
          direction for 0.83 miles from
          the top of lift 9 to the top
         of lift 7, which is located at
          an elevation of 10,490 feet.
           From the top of lift 7, the
             attainment/maintenance
         boundary continues in a north-
           westerly direction for 0.5
          miles to the intersection of
           lift 3 with the 10,000 foot
          control line. The attainment/
          maintenance boundary follows
          the 10,000 foot contour line
             in a south, south-west
         direction for 3.2 miles, until
           it intersects Skunk Creek.
           Here the boundary diverges
          from the 10,000 foot contour
          line and follows Skunk Creek
          in a northerly direction for
               2.25 miles. At the
           intersection of Skunk Creek
           and Colorado State Highway
              145, the attainment/
           maintenance boundary leaves
          the creek and follows Highway
          145 in a northerly direction
           until it meets the service
           area boundary as it existed
           prior to changes adopted in
                      1991.

the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer and 
sections 602, 603, 604, 605, 606, 607, 614 and 616 of the Clean Air Act 
Amendments of 1990, Public Law 101-549. The Protocol and section 604 
impose limits on the production and consumption (defined as production 
plus imports minus exports, excluding transhipments and used controlled 
substances) of certain ozone-depleting substances, according to 
specified schedules. The Protocol also requires each nation that becomes 
a Party to the agreement to impose certain restrictions on trade in 
ozone-depleting substances with non-Parties.
    (b) This subpart applies to any person that produces, transforms, 
destroys, imports or exports a controlled substance or imports or

product other than a container used for the transportation or storage of 
the substance or mixture. Thus, any amount of a listed substance in 
appendix A or appendix B to this subpart that is not part of a use 
system containing the substance is a controlled substance. If a listed 
substance or mixture must first be transferred from a bulk container to 
another container, vessel, or piece of equipment in order to realize its 
intended use, the listed substance or mixture is a ``controlled 
substance.'' The inadvertent or coincidental creation of insignificant

heels), at any time in any control period, (except for controlled 
substances that are transformed or destroyed) in excess of the amount of 
unexpended essential use allowances or exemptions, or in excess of 
unexpended critical use allowances, for that substance held by that 
person under the authority of this subpart at that time for that control

period. Every kilogram of excess importation (other than transhipments 
or heels) constitutes a separate violation of this subpart. It is a 
violation of this subpart to obtain unused class I controlled substances 
under the general laboratory exemption in excess of actual need and to 
recycle that material for sale into other markets.
    (e) Effective January 1, 1996, no person may place an order by 
conferring essential-use allowances for the production of the class I 
controlled substance, at any time in any control period, in excess of 
the amount of unexpended essential-use allowances, held by that person 
under the authority of this subpart at that time for that control 
period. Effective January 1, 1996, no person may import a class I 
controlled substance with essential-use allowances, at any time in any 
control period, in excess of the amount of unexpended essential-use 
allowances, held by that person under the authority of this subpart at 
that time for that control period. No person may import or place an 
order for the production of a class I controlled substance with 
essential-use allowances, at any time in any control period, other than 
for the class I controlled substance(s) for which they received 
essential-use allowances under paragraph (u) of this section. Every 
kilogram of excess production ordered in excess of the unexpended 
essential-use allowances conferred to the producer constitutes a 
separate violation of this subpart. Every kilogram of excess import in 
excess of the unexpended essential-use allowances held at that time 
constitutes a separate violation of this subpart.
    (f) Effective January 1, 1996, no person may place an order by 
conferring transformation and destruction credits for the production of 
the class I controlled substance, at any time in any control period, in 
excess of the amount of transformation and destruction credits, held by 
that person under the authority of this subpart at that time for that 
control period. Effective January 1, 1996, no person may import class I 
controlled substance, at any time in any control period, in excess of 
the amount of transformation and destruction credits, held by that 
person under the authority of this subpart at that time for that control 
period. No person may import or place an order for the production of a 
class I controlled substance with transformation and destruction 
credits, at any time in any control period, other than for the class I 
controlled substance(s) for which they received transformation and 
destruction credits as under Sec. 82.9(f). Every kilogram of excess 
production ordered in excess of the unexpended transformation and 
destruction credits conferred to the producer constitutes a separate 
violation of this subpart. Every kilogram of excess import in excess of 
the unexpended transformation and destruction credits held at that time 
constitutes a separate violation of this subpart.
    (g) Effective January 1, 1996, the U.S. total production and 
importation of a class I controlled substance (except Group VI) as 
allocated under this section for essential-use allowances and 
exemptions, and as obtained under Sec. 82.9 for destruction and 
transformation credits, may not, at any time, in any control period 
until January 1, 2000, exceed the percent limitation of baseline 
production in appendix H of this subpart, as set forth in the Clean Air 
Act Amendments of 1990. No person shall cause or contribute to the U.S. 
exceedance of the national limit for that control period.
    (h) No person may sell in the U.S. any Class I controlled substance 
produced explicitly for export to an Article 5 country.
    (i) Effective January 1, 1995, no person may import, at any time in 
any control period, a heel of any class I controlled substance that is 
greater than 10 percent of the volume of the container in excess of the 
amount of unexpended consumption allowances, or unexpended destruction 
and transformation credits held by that person under the authority of 
this subpart at that time for that control period. Every kilogram of 
excess importation constitutes a separate violation of this subpart.
    (j) Effective January 1, 1995, no person may import, at any time in 
any control period, a used class I controlled substance, except for 
Group II used

[[Page 460]]

controlled substances shipped in aircraft halon bottles for hydrostatic 
testing, without having received a non-objection notice from the 
Administrator in accordance with Sec. 82.13(g)(2) and (3). A person who 
receives a non-objection notice for the import of an individual shipment 
of used controlled substances may not transfer or confer the right to 
import, and may not import any more than the exact quantity, in 
kilograms, of the used controlled substance cited in the non-objection 
notice. Every kilogram of importation of used controlled substance in 
excess of the quantity cited in the non-objection notice issued by the 
Administrator in accordance with Sec. 82.13(g)(2) and (3) constitutes a 
separate violation.
    (k)(1) Prior to January 1, 1996, for all Groups of class I 
controlled substances, and prior to January 1, 2005, for class I, Group 
VI controlled substances, a person may not use production allowances to 
produce a quantity of a class I controlled substance unless that person 
holds under the authority of this subpart at the same time consumption 
allowances sufficient to cover that quantity of class I controlled 
substances nor may a person use consumption allowances to produce a 
quantity of class I controlled substances unless the person holds under 
authority of this subpart at the same time production allowances 
sufficient to cover that quantity of class I controlled substances. 
However, prior to January 1, 1996, for all class I controlled 
substances, and prior to January 1, 2005, for class I, Group VI 
controlled substances, only consumption allowances are required to 
import, with the exception of transhipments, heels, and used controlled 
substances. Effective January 1, 1996, for all Groups of class I 
controlled substances, except Group VI, only essential use allowances or 
exemptions are required to import class I controlled substances, with 
the exception of transhipments, heels, used controlled substances, and 
essential use CFCs.
    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (k)(1) of this section, effective 
January 1, 2003, for class I, Group VI controlled substances, 
consumption allowances are not required to import quantities solely for 
quarantine or preshipment applications as defined in this subpart.
    (l) Every kilogram of a controlled substance, and every controlled 
product, imported or exported in contravention of this subpart 
constitutes a separate violation of this subpart, thus no person may:
    (1) Import or export any quantity of a controlled substance listed 
in Class I, Group I or Group II, in appendix A to this subpart from or 
to any foreign state not listed as a Party to the 1987 Montreal Protocol 
unless that foreign state is complying with the 1987 Montreal Protocol 
(See appendix C, annex 2 of this subpart);
    (2) Import or export any quantity of a controlled substance listed 
in Class I, Group III, Group IV or Group V, in appendix A to this 
subpart, from or to any foreign state not Party to the London Amendments 
(as noted in appendix C, annex l, to this subpart), unless that foreign 
state is complying with the London Amendments (as noted in appendix C, 
annex 2, to this subpart); or
    (3) Import a controlled product, as noted in appendix D, annex 1 to 
this subpart, from any foreign state not Party to the 1987 Montreal 
Protocol (as noted in appendix C, annex 1, to this subpart), unless that 
foreign state is complying with the Protocol (as noted in appendix C, 
annex 2, to this subpart).
    (4) Import or export any quantity of a controlled substance listed 
in Class I, Group VII, in appendix A to this subpart, from or to any 
foreign state not Party to the Copenhagen Amendments (as noted in 
appendix C, annex l, to this subpart), unless that foreign state is 
complying with the Copenhagen Amendments (as noted in appendix C, annex 
2, to this subpart.
    (5) Import or export any quantity of a controlled substance listed 
in Class I, Group VI, in appendix A to this subpart, from or to any 
foreign state not Party to the Copenhagen Amendments (as noted in 
appendix C, annex l, to this subpart), unless that foreign state is 
complying with the Copenhagen Amendments (as noted in appendix C, annex 
2, to this subpart).
    (6) Import or export any quantity of a controlled substance listed 
in Class I, Group VIII, in appendix A to this subpart, from or to any 
foreign state not Party to the Beijing Amendments (as

[[Page 461]]

noted in appendix C, annex 1, to this subpart), unless that foreign 
state is complying with the Beijing Amendments (as noted in appendix C, 
annex 2, to this subpart).
    (m) Effective October 5, 1998, no person may export a controlled 
product to a Party listed in appendix J of this subpart in any control 
period after the control period in which EPA publishes a notice in the 
Federal Register listing that Party in appendix J of this subpart. EPA 
will publish a notice in the Federal Register that lists a Party in 
appendix J if the Party formally presents to the U.S. a government 
document through its embassy in the United States stating that it has 
established a ban on the import of controlled products and a ban on the 
manufacture of those same controlled products.
    (n) No person may use class I controlled substances produced or 
imported under the essential use exemption for any purpose other than 
those set forth in this paragraph. Effective January 1, 1996, essential-
use allowances are apportioned to a person under Sec. 82.8(a) and (b) 
for the exempted production or importation of specified class I 
controlled substances solely for the purposes listed in paragraphs 
(n)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.
    (1) Essential-uses for the production or importation of controlled 
substances as agreed to by the Parties to the Protocol and subject to 
the periodic revision of the Parties are:
    (i) Metered dose inhalers (MDIs) for the treatment of asthma and 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that were approved by the Food and 
Drug Administration before December 31, 2000.
    (ii) Space Shuttle--solvents.
    (iii) Essential laboratory and analytical uses (defined in appendix 
G of this subpart).
    (2) Any person acquiring unused class I controlled substances 
produced or imported under the authority of essential-use allowances or 
the essential-use exemption granted in Sec. 82.8 to this subpart for 
use in anything other than an essential-use (i.e., for uses other than 
those specifically listed in paragraph (n)(1) of this section) is in 
violation of this subpart. Each kilogram of unused class I controlled 
substance produced or imported under the authority of essential-use 
allowances or the essential-use exemption and used for a non-essential 
use is a separate violation of this subpart. Any person selling unused 
class I controlled substances produced or imported under authority of 
essential-use allowances or the essential-use exemption for uses other 
than an essential-use is in violation of this subpart. Each kilogram of 
unused class I controlled substances produced or imported under 
authority of essential-use allowances or the essential-use exemption and 
sold for a use other than an essential-use is a separate violation of 
this subpart. It is a violation of this subpart to obtain unused class I 
controlled substances under the exemption for laboratory and analytical 
uses in excess of actual need and to recycle that material for sale into 
other markets.
    (o) [Reserved]
    (p) Critical Use Exemption: With respect to class I, Group VI 
substances (methyl bromide):
    (1) For critical use allowance holders and critical stock allowance 
holders:
    (i) No person shall sell critical use methyl bromide without first 
receiving a certification from the purchaser that the quantity purchased 
will be sold or used solely for an approved critical use. Every kilogram 
of critical use methyl bromide sold without first obtaining such 
certification constitutes a separate violation of this subpart.
    (ii) No person shall sell a portion of inventory produced or 
imported prior to the January 1, 2005 phaseout date as critical use 
methyl bromide in excess of the number of unexpended critical stock 
allowances held by that person.
    (iii) A person who sells methyl bromide produced or imported before 
the phaseout date of January 1, 2005 for a use identified by the user as 
a critical use must hold sufficient critical stock allowances (CSA) for 
the transaction and shall expend one allowance for each kilogram of 
methyl bromide sold. Every kilogram of critical use methyl bromide 
produced or imported before the phaseout date of January 1, 2005 that is 
sold without expending an allowance constitutes a separate violation of 
this subpart.

[[Page 462]]

    (2) For approved critical users, each action associated with each 
200 kilograms of critical use methyl bromide for the following 
subparagraphs constitutes a separate violation of this subpart.
    (i) No person shall take possession of quantities of critical use 
methyl bromide or acquire fumigation services using quantities of 
critical use methyl bromide without first completing the appropriate 
certification in accordance with the requirements in Sec. 82.13.
    (ii) No person who purchases critical use methyl bromide may use 
such quantities for a use other than the specified critical use listed 
in Column A and the specified location of use in Column B of Appendix L 
to this subpart.
    (iii) No person who purchases critical use methyl bromide produced 
or imported with expended critical use allowances for pre-plant uses, 
may use such quantities for other than the pre-plant uses as specified 
in column A and column B of appendix L to this subpart.
    (iv) No person who purchases critical use methyl bromide produced or 
imported with expended critical use allowances for post-harvest uses, 
may use such quantities for other than the post-harvest uses as 
specified in column A and column B of appendix L to this subpart.
    (v) No person who uses critical use methyl bromide on a specific 
field or structure may concurrently or subsequently use non-critical use 
methyl bromide on the same field or structure for the same use (as 
defined in column A and column B of appendix L) in the same control 
period, excepting methyl bromide used under the quarantine and pre-
shipment exemption.
    (vi) No person who purchases critical use methyl bromide during the 
control period shall use that methyl bromide on a field or structure for 
which that person has used non-critical use methyl bromide for the same 
use (as defined in columns A and B of appendix L) in the same control 
period, excepting methyl bromide used under the quarantine and pre-
shipment exemption, unless, subsequent to that person's use of the non-
critical use methyl bromide, that person becomes subject to a 
prohibition on the use of methyl bromide alternatives due to the 
reaching of a local township limit described in appendix L of this part, 
or becomes an approved critical user as a result of rulemaking.
    (q) Emergency use exemption. [Reserved]

Sec. 82.9  Availability of production allowances in addition to baseline
production allowances for class I controlled substances.

    (a) Every person apportioned baseline production allowances for 
class I controlled substances under Sec. 82.5 (a) through (f) of this 
subpart is also granted Article 5 allowances equal to:
    (1) 10 percent of their baseline production allowances listed for 
class I, Group I, Group III, Group IV, and Group V controlled substances 
listed under Sec. 82.5 of this subpart for each control period ending 
before January 1, 1996;
    (2) 15 percent of their baseline production allowances for class I, 
Group VI controlled substances listed under Sec. 82.5 of this subpart 
for each control period ending before January 1, 2005;
    (3) 15 percent of their baseline production allowances for class I, 
Group II controlled substances listed under Sec. 82.5 of this subpart 
for each control period beginning January 1, 1994, until January 1, 
2003;
    (4) 15 percent of their baseline production allowances for Class I, 
Group IV and Group V controlled substances listed under Sec. 82.5 of 
this subpart for each control period beginning January 1, 1996 until 
January 1, 2010;
    (b) Effective January 1, 1995, a person allocated Article 5 
allowances may produce class I controlled substances for export to 
Article 5 countries as under Sec. 82.11 and transfer Article 5 
allowances as under Sec. 82.12.
    (c) A company may increase or decrease its production allowances, 
its Article 5 allowances by trading with another Party to the Protocol 
according to the provision under this paragraph (c). A company may 
increase or decrease its essential-use allowances for CFCs for use in 
essential MDIs according to the provisions under this paragraph (c). A 
nation listed in appendix C to this subpart (Parties to the Montreal 
Protocol) must agree either to transfer to the person for the current 
control period some amount of production or import that the nation is 
permitted under the Montreal Protocol or to receive from the person for 
the current control period some amount of production or import that the 
person is permitted under this subpart. If the controlled substance is 
produced under the authority of production allowances and is to be 
returned to the Party from whom production allowances are received, the 
request for production allowances shall also be considered a request for 
consumption allowances under Sec. 82.10(c). If the controlled substance 
is produced under the authority of production allowances and is to be 
sold in the United States or to another Party (not the Party from whom 
the allowances are received), the U.S. company must expend its 
consumption allowances allocated under Sec. 82.6 and Sec. 82.7 in 
order to produce with the additional production allowances.
    (1) For trades from a Party, the person must obtain from the 
principal diplomatic representative in that nation's embassy in the 
United States a signed document stating that the appropriate authority 
within that nation has established or revised production limits or 
essential-use allowance limits for the nation to equal the lesser of the 
maximum production that the nation is allowed under the Protocol minus 
the amount transferred, the maximum production or essential-use 
allowances

[[Page 468]]

that are allowed under the nation's applicable domestic law minus the 
amount transferred, or the average of the nation's actual national 
production level for the three years prior to the transfer minus the 
production transferred. The person must submit to the Administrator a 
transfer request that includes a true copy of this document and that 
sets forth the following:
    (i) The identity and address of the person;
    (ii) The identity of the Party;
    (iii) The names and telephone numbers of contact persons for the 
person and for the Party;
    (iv) The chemical type, type of allowance being transferred, and the 
level of allowances being transferred;
    (v) The control period(s) to which the transfer applies; and
    (vi) For increased production intended for export to the Party from 
whom the allowances would be received, a signed statement of intent to 
export to the Party.
    (vii) In the case of transferring essential-use allowances, the 
transferor must include a signed document from the transferee 
identifying the CFC MDI products that will be produced using the 
essential-use allowances.
    (2) For trades to a Party, a person must submit a transfer request 
that sets forth the following:
    (i) The identity and address of the person;
    (ii) The identity of the Party;
    (iii) The names and telephone numbers of contact persons for the 
person and for the Party;
    (iv) The chemical type, type of allowance being transferred, and the 
level of allowances being transferred; and
    (v) The control period(s) to which the transfer applies.
    (3) After receiving a transfer request that meets the requirements 
of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the Administrator may, at his 
discretion, consider the following factors in deciding whether to 
approve such a transfer:
    (i) Possible creation of economic hardship;
    (ii) Possible effects on trade;
    (iii) Potential environmental implications; and
    (iv) The total amount of unexpended production or essential-use 
allowances held by a U.S. entity.
    (v) In the case of transfer of essential-use allowances the 
Administrator may consider whether the CFCs will be used for production 
of essential MDIs.
    (4) The Administrator will issue the person a notice either granting 
or deducting production allowances, Article 5 allowances, or essential-
use allowances, and specifying the control period to which the transfer 
applies, provided that the request meets the requirement of paragraph 
(c)(1) of this sections for trades from Parties and paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section for trades to Parties, unless the Administrator has decided 
to disapprove the trade under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. For a 
trade from a Party, the Administrator will issue a notice that revises 
the allowances held by the person to equal the unexpended production, 
Article 5, or essential-use allowances held by the person under this 
subpart plus the level of allowable production transferred from the 
Party. For a trade to a Party, the Administrator will issue a notice 
that revises the production limit for the person to equal the lesser of:
    (i) The unexpended production allowances, essential-use allowances, 
or Article 5 allowances held by the person under this subpart minus the 
amount transferred; or
    (ii) The unexpended production allowances, essential-use allowances, 
or Article 5 allowances held by the person under this subpart minus the 
amount by which the United States average annual production of the 
controlled substance being traded for the three years prior to the 
transfer is less than the total production allowable for that substance 
under this subpart minus the amount transferred. The change in 
allowances will be effective on the date that the notice is issued.
    (5) If after one person obtains approval for a trade of allowable 
production of a controlled substance to a Party, one or more other 
persons obtain approval for trades involving the same controlled 
substance and the same control period, the Administrator

[[Page 469]]

will issue notices revising the production limits for each of the other 
persons trading that controlled substance in that control period to 
equal the lesser of:
    (i) The unexpended production allowances or Article 5 allowances 
held by the person under this subpart minus the amount transferred; or
    (ii) The unexpended production allowances or Article 5 allowances 
held by the person under this subpart minus the amount by which the 
United States average annual production of the controlled substance 
being traded for the three years prior to the transfer is less than the 
total allowable production for that substance under this subpart 
multiplied by the amount transferred divided by the total amount 
transferred by all the other persons trading the same controlled 
substance in the same control period minus the amount transferred by 
that person.
    (iii) The Administrator will also issue a notice revising the 
production limit for each person who previously obtained approval of a 
trade of that substance in that control period to equal the unexpended 
production allowances or unexpended Article 5 allowances held by the 
person under this subpart plus the amount by which the United States 
average annual production of the controlled substance being traded for 
the three years prior to the transfer is less than the total allowable 
production under this subpart multiplied by the amount transferred by 
that person divided by the amount transferred by all of the persons who 
have traded that controlled substance in that control period. The change 
in production allowances or Article 5 allowances will be effective on 
the date that the notice is issued.
    (d) Effective January 1, 1996, there will be no trade in production 
or consumption allowances with other Parties to the Protocol for class I 
controlled substances, except for class I, Group VI, methyl bromide.
    (e) Until January 1, 1996 for all class I controlled substances, 
except Group VI, and until January 1, 2005 for class I, Group VI, a 
person may obtain production allowances for that controlled substance 
equal to the amount of that controlled substance produced in the United 
States that was transformed or destroyed within the United States, or 
transformed or destroyed by a person of another Party, in the cases 
where production allowances were expended to produce such substance in 
the U.S. in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. A request 
for production allowances under this section will be considered a 
request for consumption allowances under Sec. 82.10(b).
    (1) Until January 1, 1996, for all class I controlled substances, 
except Group VI, and until January 1, 2005, for class I, Group VI, a 
person must submit a request for production allowances that includes the 
following:
    (i) The name, address, and telephone number of the person requesting 
the allowances, and the Employer Identification Number if the controlled 
substance is being exported;
    (ii) The name, quantity, and level of controlled substance 
transformed or the name, quantity and volume destroyed, and the 
commodity code if the substance was exported;
    (iii) A copy of the invoice or receipt documenting the sale of the 
controlled substance, including the name, address, contact person and 
telephone number of the transformer or destroyer;
    (iv) A certification that production allowances were expended for 
the production of the controlled substance, and the date of purchase, if 
applicable;
    (v) If the controlled substance is transformed, the name, quantity, 
and verification of the commercial use of the resulting chemical and a 
copy of the IRS certificate of intent to use the controlled substance as 
a feedstock; and,
    (vi) If the controlled substance is destroyed, the verification of 
the destruction efficiency.
    (2) Until January 1, 1996 for all class I controlled substances, 
except Group VI, and until January 1, 2005, for class I, Group VI, the 
Administrator will review the information and documentation submitted 
under paragraph (e)(1) of this section and will assess the quantity of 
class I controlled substance that the documentation and information 
verifies was transformed or destroyed. The Administrator will issue the 
person production allowances equivalent to the controlled substances 
that the

[[Page 470]]

Administrator determines were transformed or destroyed. For controlled 
substances completely destroyed under this rule, the Agency will grant 
allowances equal to 100 percent of volume intended for destruction. For 
those controlled substances destroyed at less than a 98 percent 
destruction efficiency, the Agency will grant allowances commensurate 
with that percentage of destruction efficiency that is actually 
achieved. The grant of allowances will be effective on the date that the 
notice is issued.
    (3) Until January 1, 1996 for all class I controlled substances, 
except Group VI, and until January 1, 2005, for class I, Group VI, if 
the Administrator determines that the request for production allowances 
does not satisfactorily substantiate that the person transformed or 
destroyed controlled substances as claimed, or that modified allowances 
were not expended, the Administrator will issue a notice disallowing the 
request for additional production allowances. Within ten working days 
after receipt of notification, the person may file a notice of appeal, 
with supporting reasons, with the Administrator. The Administrator may 
affirm the disallowance or grant an allowance, as she/he finds 
appropriate in light of the available evidence. If no appeal is taken by 
the tenth day after notification, the disallowance will be final on that 
day.
    (f) Effective January 1, 1996, and until January 1, 2000, a person 
who was nominated by the United States to the Secretariat of the 
Montreal Protocol for an essential use exemption may obtain destruction 
and transformation credits for a class I controlled substance (except 
class I, Group VI) equal to the amount of that controlled substance 
produced in the United States that was destroyed or transformed within 
the United States in cases where the controlled substance was produced 
for other than destruction or transformation in accordance with the 
provisions of this subpart, subtracting an offset of 15 percent.
    (1) Effective January 1, 1996, and until January 1, 2000, a person 
must submit a request for destruction and transformation credits that 
includes the following:
    (i) The identity and address of the person and the essential-use 
exemption and years for which the person was nominated to the 
Secretariat of the Montreal Protocol;
    (ii) The name, quantity and volume of controlled substance destroyed 
or transformed;
    (iii) A copy of the invoice or receipt documenting the sale or 
transfer of the controlled substance to the person;
    (iv) A certification of the previous use of the controlled 
substance;
    (v) For destruction credits, a certification that the controlled 
substance was destroyed and a certification of the efficiency of the 
destruction process; and
    (vi) For transformation credits, an IRS certificate of feedstock use 
or transformation of the controlled substance.
    (2) Effective January 1, 1996, and until January 1, 2000, the 
Administrator will issue the person destruction and transformation 
credits equivalent to the class I controlled substance (except class I, 
Group VI) recovered from a use system in the United States, that the 
Administrator determines were destroyed or transformed, subtracting the 
offset of 15 percent. For controlled substances completely destroyed 
under this rule, the Agency will grant destruction credits equal to 100 
percent of volume destroyed minus the offset. For those controlled 
substances destroyed at less than a 98 percent destruction efficiency, 
the Agency will grant destruction credits commensurate with that 
percentage of destruction efficiency that is actually achieved minus the 
offset. The grant of credits will be effective on the date that the 
notice is issued.
    (3) Effective January 1, 1996, and until January 1, 2000, if the 
Administrator determines that the request for destruction and 
transformation credits does not satisfactorily substantiate that the 
person was nominated for an essential-use exemption by the United States 
to the Secretariat for the Montreal Protocol for the control period, or 
that the person destroyed or transformed a class I controlled substance 
as claimed, or that the controlled substance was not recovered from a 
U.S. use system the Administrator will

[[Page 471]]

issue a notice disallowing the request for additional destruction and 
transformation credits. Within ten working days after receipt of 
notification, the person may file a notice of appeal, with supporting 
reasons, with the Administrator. The Administrator may affirm the 
disallowance or grant an allowance, as she/he finds appropriate in light 
of the available evidence. If no appeal is taken by the tenth day after 
notification, the disallowance will be final on that day.
    (g) International transfer of essential-use CFCs. (1) For trades of 
essential-use CFCs where the transferee or the transferor is a person in 
another nation (Party), the persons involved in the transfer must submit 
the information requested in Sec. 82.12(d)(2) and (d)(3), along with a 
signed document from the principal diplomatic representative in the 
Party's embassy in the United States stating that the appropriate 
authority within that nation has approved the transfer of the essential-
use CFCs.
    (2) If the transfer claim is complete, and EPA does not object to 
the transfer, then EPA will issue letters to the transferor and the 
transferee indicating that the transfer may proceed. EPA reserves the 
right to disallow a transfer if the transfer request is incomplete, or 
if it has reason to believe that the transferee plans to produce MDIs 
that are not essential MDIs. If EPA objects to the transfer, EPA will 
issue letters to the transferor and transferee stating the basis for 
disallowing the transfer. The burden of proof is placed on the 
transferee to retain sufficient records to prove that the transferred 
essential-use CFCs are used only for production of essential MDIs. If 
EPA ultimately finds that the transferee did not use the essential-use 
CFCs for production of essential MDIs then the transferee is in 
violation of this subpart.

Sec. 82.10  Availability of consumption allowances in addition to 
baseline consumption allowances for class I controlled substances.

    (a) Until January 1, 1996 for all class I controlled substances, 
except Group VI, and until January 1, 2005, for class I, Group VI, any 
person may obtain, in accordance with the provisions of this subsection, 
consumption allowances equivalent to the level of class I controlled 
substances (other than used controlled substances or transhipments) that 
the person has exported from the United States and its territories to a 
Party (as listed in appendix C to this subpart).
    (1) Until January 1, 1996 for all class I controlled substances, 
except Group VI, and until January 1, 2005, for class I, Group VI, to 
receive consumption allowances in addition to baseline consumption 
allowances, the exporter of the class I controlled substances must 
submit to the Administrator a request for consumption allowances setting 
forth the following:
    (i) The identities and addresses of the exporter and the recipient 
of the exports;
    (ii) The exporter's Employer Identification Number;
    (iii) The names and telephone numbers of contact persons for the 
exporter and the recipient;
    (iv) The quantity and type of controlled substances exported;
    (v) The source of the controlled substance and the date purchased;
    (vi) The date on which, and the port from which, the controlled 
substances were exported from the United States or its territories;
    (vii) The country to which the controlled substances were exported;
    (viii) A copy of the bill of lading and the invoice indicating the 
net quantity of controlled substances shipped and documenting the sale 
of the controlled substances to the purchaser.
    (ix) The commodity code of the controlled substance exported; and
    (x) Written statement from the producer that the controlled 
substance was produced with expended allowances.
    (2) The Administrator will review the information and documentation 
submitted under paragraph (a)(1) of this

[[Page 472]]

section and will assess the quantity of controlled substances that the 
documentation verifies was exported. The Administrator will issue the 
exporter consumption allowances equivalent to the level of controlled 
substances that the Administrator determined were exported. The grant of 
the consumption allowances will be effective on the date the notice is 
issued. If the Administrator determines that the information and 
documentation does not satisfactorily substantiate that the person 
exported controlled substances as claimed the Administrator will issue a 
notice that the consumption allowances are not granted.
    (b) Until January 1, 1996, a person may obtain consumption 
allowances for a class I controlled substance (and until January 1, 2005 
for class I, Group VI) equal to the amount of a controlled substance 
either produced in, or imported into, the United States that was 
transformed or destroyed in the case where consumption allowances were 
expended to produce or import such substance in accordance with the 
provisions of this paragraph. However, a person producing or importing a 
controlled substance (except class I, Group VI) that was transformed or 
destroyed must submit to the Administrator the information described 
under Sec. 82.13 (f)(3) (i) and (ii).
    (c) A company may also increase its consumption allowances by 
receiving production from another Party to the Protocol for class I, 
Group I through Group V and Group VII controlled substances until 
January 1, 1996 and for class I, Group VI controlled substances until 
January 1, 2005. A nation listed in appendix C to this subpart (Parties 
to the Montreal Protocol) must agree to transfer to the person for the 
current control period some amount of production that the nation is 
permitted under the Montreal Protocol. If the controlled substance is to 
be returned to the Party from whom allowances are received, the request 
for consumption allowances shall also be considered a request for 
production allowances under Sec. 82.9(c). For trades from a Party, the 
person must obtain from the principal diplomatic representative in that 
nation's embassy in the United States a signed document stating that the 
appropriate authority within that nation has established or revised 
production limits for the nation to equal the lesser of the maximum 
production that the nation is allowed under the Protocol minus the 
amount transferred, the maximum production that is allowed under the 
nation's applicable domestic law minus the amount transferred, or the 
average of the nation's actual national production level for the three 
years prior to the transfer minus the production allowances transferred. 
The person must submit to the Administrator a transfer request that 
includes a true copy of this document and that sets forth the following:
    (1) The identity and address of the person;
    (2) The identity of the Party;
    (3) The names and telephone numbers of contact persons for the 
person and for the Party;
    (4) The chemical type and level of production being transferred;
    (5) The control period(s) to which the transfer applies; and
    (6) For increased production intended for export to the Party from 
whom allowances would be received, a signed statement of intent to 
export to this Party.
    (d) On the first day of each control period, until January 1, 1996, 
the Agency will grant consumption allowances to any person that produced 
and exported a Group IV controlled substance in the baseline year and 
that was not granted baseline consumption allowances under Sec. 82.5.
    (1) The number of consumption allowances any such person will be 
granted for each control period will be equal to the number of 
production allowances granted to that person under Sec. 82.7 for that 
control period.
    (2) Any person granted allowances under this paragraph must hold the 
same number of unexpended consumption allowances for the control period 
for which the allowances were granted by February 15 of the following 
control period. Every kilogram by which the person's unexpended 
consumption allowances fall short of the amount the person was granted 
under this paragraph constitutes a separate violation.

Sec. 82.11  Exports of class I controlled substances to Article 5 Parties.

    (a) If apportioned Article 5 allowances under Sec. 82.9(a) or Sec. 
82.11(a)(2), a person may produce Class I controlled substances, in 
accordance with the prohibitions in Sec. 82.4 and the reduction

Sec. 82.12  Transfers of allowances for class I controlled substances.

    (a) Inter-company transfers. (1) Until January 1, 1996, for all 
class I controlled substances, except for Group VI, and until January 1, 
2005, for Group VI, any person (``transferor'') may

[[Page 474]]

transfer to any other person (``transferee'') any amount of the 
transferor's consumption allowances or production allowances, and 
effective January 1, 1995, for all class I controlled substances any 
person (``transferor'') may transfer to any other person 
(``transferee'') any amount of the transferor's Article 5 allowances. 
After January 1, 2002, any essential-use allowance holder (including 
those persons that hold essential-use allowances issued by a Party other 
than the United States) (``transferor'') may transfer essential-use 
allowances for CFCs to a metered dose inhaler company solely for the 
manufacture of essential MDIs. After January 1, 2005, any critical use 
allowance holder (``transferor'') may transfer critical use allowances 
to any other person (``transferee''). After January 1, 2005, any 
critical stock allowance holder (``transferor'') may transfer critical 
stock allowances to any critical stock allowance holder or any methyl 
bromide producer, importer, distributer or third party applicator 
(``transferee'').
    (i) The transferor must submit to the Administrator a transfer claim 
setting forth the following:
    (A) The identities and addresses of the transferor and the 
transferee;
    (B) The name and telephone numbers of contact persons for the 
transferor and the transferee;
    (C) The type of allowances being transferred, including the names of 
the controlled substances for which allowances are to be transferred;
    (D) The group of controlled substances to which the allowances being 
transferred pertains;
    (E) The amount of allowances being transferred;
    (F) The control period(s) for which the allowances are being 
transferred;
    (G) The amount of unexpended allowances of the type and for the 
control period being transferred that the transferor holds under 
authority of this subpart as of the date the claim is submitted to EPA; 
and
    (H) The one percent offset applied to the unweighted amount traded 
will be deducted from the transferor's production or consumption 
allowance balance (except for trades from transformers and destroyers to 
producers or importers for the purpose of allowance reimbursement). In 
the case of transferring essential use allowances, the amount of one 
tenth of one percent of the amount traded will be deducted from the 
transferor's allowance balance. In the case of transferring critical use 
allowances, the amount of one tenth of one percent of the amount traded 
will be deducted from the transferor's critical use allowance balance.
    (I) The transferor must include a signed document from the 
transferee identifying the CFC MDI products that will be produced using 
the essential-use allowances.
    (ii) The Administrator will determine whether the records maintained 
by EPA, taking into account any previous transfers and any production, 
allowable imports and exports of controlled substances reported by the 
transferor, indicate that the transferor possesses, as of the date the 
transfer claim is processed, unexpended allowances sufficient to cover 
the transfer claim (i.e., the amount to be transferred plus, in the case 
of transferors of essential use allowances and critical use allowances, 
one tenth of one percent of the transferred amount). Within three 
working days of receiving a complete transfer claim, the Administrator 
will take action to notify the transferor and transferee as follows:
    (A) If EPA's records show that the transferor has sufficient 
unexpended allowances to cover the transfer claim, the Administrator 
will issue a notice indicating that EPA does not object to the transfer 
and will reduce the transferor's balance of unexpended allowances by the 
amount to be transferred plus, in the case of transfers of production or 
consumption allowances, one percent of that amount, or in the case of 
transfers of essential use allowances, one tenth of one percent of that 
amount. When EPA issues a no objection notice, the transferor and the 
transferee may proceed with the transfer. However, if EPA ultimately 
finds that the transferor did not have sufficient unexpended allowances 
to cover the claim, the transferor and transferee will be held liable 
for any violations of the regulations of this subpart that occur as a 
result of, or in conjunction with, the improper transfer.

[[Page 475]]

    (B) If EPA's records show that the transferor has insufficient 
unexpended allowances to cover the transfer claim, or that the 
transferor has failed to respond to one or more Agency requests to 
supply information needed to make a determination, the Administrator 
will issue a notice disallowing the transfer. Within 10 working days 
after receipt of notification, either party may file a notice of appeal, 
with supporting reasons, with the Administrator. The Administrator may 
affirm or vacate the disallowance. If no appeal is taken by the tenth 
working day after notification, the disallowance shall be final on that 
day.
    (iii) In the event that the Administrator does not respond to a 
transfer claim within the three working days specified in paragraph 
(a)(1)(ii) of this section the transferor and transferee may proceed 
with the transfer. EPA will reduce the transferor's balance of 
unexpended allowances by the amount to be transferred plus, in the case 
of transfers of production or consumption allowances, one percent of 
that amount, and in the case of essential use allowances and critical 
use allowances, one tenth of one percent of that amount. However if EPA 
ultimately finds that the transferor did not have sufficient unexpended 
allowances to cover the claim, the transferor and transferee will be 
held liable for any violations of the regulations of this subpart that 
occur as a result of, or in conjunction with, the improper transfer.
    (2) Effective January 1, 1996, any person (``transferor'') may 
transfer to an eligible person (``transferee'') as defined in Sec. 82.9 
any amount of the transferor's destruction and transformation credits. 
The transfer proceeds as follows:
    (i) The transferor must submit to the Administrator a transfer claim 
setting forth the following:
    (A) The identities and addresses of the transferor and the 
transferee;
    (B) The name and telephone numbers of contact persons for the 
transferor and the transferee;
    (C) The type of credits being transferred, including the names of 
the controlled substances for which credits are to be transferred;
    (D) The group of controlled substances to which the credits being 
transferred pertains;
    (E) The amount of destruction and transformation credits being 
transferred;
    (F) The control period(s) for which the destruction and 
transformation credits are being transferred;
    (G) The amount of unexpended destruction and transformation credits 
for the control period being transferred that the transferor holds under 
authority of this subpart as of the date the claim is submitted to EPA; 
and
    (H) The amount of the one-percent offset applied to the unweighted 
amount traded that will be deducted from the transferor's balance.
    (ii) The Administrator will determine whether the records maintained 
by EPA, taking into account any previous transfers and any production of 
controlled substances reported by the transferor, indicate that the 
transferor possesses, as of the date the transfer claim is processed, 
unexpended destruction and transformation credits sufficient to cover 
the transfer claim (i.e., the amount to be transferred plus one percent 
of that amount). Within three working days of receiving a complete 
transfer claim, the Administrator will take action to notify the 
transferor and transferee as follows:
    (A) If EPA's records show that the transferor has sufficient 
unexpended destruction and transformation credits to cover the transfer 
claim, the Administrator will issue a notice indicating that EPA does 
not object to the transfer and will reduce the transferor's balance of 
unexpended or credits by the amount to be transferred plus one percent 
of that amount. When EPA issues a no objection notice, the transferor 
and the transferee may proceed with the transfer. However, if EPA 
ultimately finds that the transferor did not have sufficient unexpended 
credits to cover the claim, the transferor and transferee will be held 
liable for any violations of the regulations of this subpart that occur 
as a result of, or in conjunction with, the improper transfer.
    (B) If EPA's records show that the transferor has insufficient 
unexpended destruction and transformation credits

[[Page 476]]

to cover the transfer claim, or that the transferor has failed to 
respond to one or more Agency requests to supply information needed to 
make a determination, the Administrator will issue a notice disallowing 
the transfer. Within 10 working days after receipt of notification, 
either party may file a notice of appeal, with supporting reasons, with 
the Administrator. The Administrator may affirm or vacate the 
disallowance. If no appeal is taken by the tenth working day after 
notification, the disallowance shall be final on that day.
    (iii) In the event that the Administrator does not respond to a 
transfer claim within the three working days specified in paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii) of this section, the transferor and transferee may proceed 
with the transfer. EPA will reduce the transferor's balance of 
unexpended destruction and transformation credits by the amount to be 
transferred plus one percent of that amount. However, if EPA ultimately 
finds that the transferor did not have sufficient unexpended credits to 
cover the claim, the transferor and transferee will be held liable for 
any violations of the regulations of this subpart that occur as a result 
of, or in conjunction with, the improper transfer.
    (b) Inter-pollutant conversions.
    (1) Until January 1, 1996, for all class I controlled substances, 
except Group VI, and until January 1, 2005 for Group VI, any person 
(``convertor'') may convert consumption allowances or production 
allowances for one class I controlled substance to the same type of 
allowance for another class I controlled substance within the same Group 
as the first as listed in appendix A of this subpart, following the 
procedures described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (2) Effective January 1, 1995, any person (``convertor'') may 
convert Article 5 allowances for one class I controlled substance to the 
same type of allowance for another class I controlled substance within 
the same Group of controlled substances as the first as listed in 
appendix A of this subpart, following the procedures described in 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (3) Effective January 1, 1996, any person (``convertor'') may 
convert destruction and/or transformation credits for one class I 
controlled substance to the same type of credits for another class I 
controlled substance within the same Group of controlled substances as 
the first as listed in appendix A of this subpart, following the 
procedures in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (4) The convertor must submit to the Administrator a conversion 
claim.
    (i) The conversion claim would include the following:
    (A) The identity and address of the convertor;
    (B) The name and telephone number of a contact person for the 
convertor;
    (C) The type of allowances or credits being converted, including the 
names of the controlled substances for which allowances or credits are 
to be converted;
    (D) The group of controlled substances to which the allowances or 
credits being converted pertains;
    (E) The amount and type of allowances or credits to be converted;
    (F) The amount of allowances or credits to be subtracted from the 
convertor's unexpended allowances or credits for the first controlled 
substance, to be equal to 101 percent of the amount of allowances or 
credits converted;
    (G) The amount of allowances or credits to be added to the 
convertor's unexpended allowances or credits for the second controlled 
substance, to be equal to the amount of allowances or credits for the 
first controlled substance being converted multiplied by the quotient of 
the ozone depletion factor of the first controlled substance divided by 
the ozone depletion factor of the second controlled substance, as listed 
in appendix A to this subpart;
    (H) The control period(s) for which the allowances or credits are 
being converted; and
    (I) The amount of unexpended allowances or credits of the type and 
for the control period being converted that the convertor holds under 
authority of this subpart as of the date the claim is submitted to EPA.
    (ii) The Administrator will determine whether the records maintained 
by EPA, taking into account any previous conversions, any transfers, any 
credits,

[[Page 477]]

and any production, imports (not including transhipments or used 
controlled substances), or exports (not including transhipments or used 
controlled substances) of controlled substances reported by the 
convertor, indicate that the convertor possesses, as of the date the 
conversion claim is processed, unexpended allowances or credits 
sufficient to cover the conversion claim (i.e., the amount to be 
converted plus one percent of that amount). Within three working days of 
receiving a complete conversion claim, the Administrator will take 
action to notify the convertor as follows:
    (A) If EPA's records show that the convertor has sufficient 
unexpended allowances or credits to cover the conversion claim, the 
Administrator will issue a notice indicating that EPA does not object to 
the conversion and will reduce the convertor's balance of unexpended 
allowances or credits by the amount to be converted plus one percent of 
that amount. When EPA issues a no objection notice, the convertor may 
proceed with the conversion. However, if EPA ultimately finds that the 
convertor did not have sufficient unexpended allowances or credits to 
cover the claim, the convertor will be held liable for any violations of 
the regulations of this subpart that occur as a result of, or in 
conjunction with, the improper conversion.
    (B) If EPA's records show that the convertor has insufficient 
unexpended allowances or credits to cover the conversion claim, or that 
the convertor has failed to respond to one or more Agency requests to 
supply information needed to make a determination, the Administrator 
will issue a notice disallowing the conversion. Within 10 working days 
after receipt of notification, the convertor may file a notice of 
appeal, with supporting reasons, with the Administrator. The 
Administrator may affirm or vacate the disallowance. If no appeal is 
taken by the tenth working day after notification, the disallowance 
shall be final on that day.
    (iii) In the event that the Administrator does not respond to a 
conversion claim within the three working days specified in paragraph 
(b)(4)(ii) of this section, the convertor may proceed with the 
conversion. EPA will reduce the convertor's balance of unexpended 
allowances or credits by the amount to be converted plus one percent of 
that amount. However, if EPA ultimately finds that the convertor did not 
have sufficient unexpended allowances or credits to cover the claims, 
the convertor will be held liable for any violations of the regulations 
of this subpart that occur as a result of, or in conjunction with, the 
improper conversion.
    (5) Effective January 1, 1995, and for every control period 
thereafter, inter-pollutant trades will be permitted during the 45 days 
after the end of a control period.
    (c) Inter-company transfers and Inter-pollutant conversions.
    (1) Until January 1, 1996, for production and consumption 
allowances; effective January 1, 1995, for Article 5 allowances; and 
effective January 1, 1996, for destruction and/or transformation 
credits; if a person requests an inter-company transfer and an inter-
pollutant conversion simultaneously, the amount subtracted from the 
convertor-transferor's unexpended allowances or unexpended credits for 
the first controlled substance will be equal to 101 percent of the 
amount of allowances or credits that are being converted and 
transferred.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (d) Transfers of essential-use CFCs. (1) Effective January 1, 2002, 
any metered dose inhaler company (transferor) may transfer essential-use 
CFCs to another metered dose inhaler company (transferee) provided that 
the Administrator approves the transfer.
    (2) The transferee must submit a transfer claim to the Administrator 
for approval before the transfer can take place. The transfer claim must 
set forth the following:
    (i) The identities and addresses of the transferor and the 
transferee; and
    (ii) The name and telephone numbers of contact persons for the 
transferor and the transferee; and
    (iii) The amount of each controlled substance (CFC-11, CFC-12, or 
CFC-114) being transferred; and
    (iv) The specific metered dose inhaler products (i.e. the MDI drug 
product or active moiety) that the transferee plans to produce with the 
transferred CFCs; and

[[Page 478]]

    (v) The country(ies) where the CFC metered dose inhalers produced 
with the transferred essential-use CFCs will be sold if other than in 
the United States; and
    (vi) Certification that the essential-use CFCs will be used in the 
production of essential MDIs. If the MDIs are to be sold in the United 
States, the certification must state that MDIs produced with the 
transferred essential-use CFCs are listed as essential at 21 CFR 2.125, 
and were approved by the Food and Drug Administration before December 
31, 2000. If the MDIs produced with the essential-use CFCs are to be 
sold outside the United States, the transferee must certify that the 
metered dose inhalers produced with the essential-use CFCs are 
considered essential by the importing country.
    (3) The transferor must submit a letter stating that it concurs with 
the terms of the transfer as requested by the transferee.
    (4) Once the transfer claim is complete, and if EPA does not object 
to the transfer, then EPA will issue letters to the transferor and the 
transferee within 10 business days indicating that the transfer may 
proceed. EPA reserves the right to disallow a transfer if the transfer 
request is incomplete, or if it has reason to believe that the 
transferee plans use the essential-use CFCs in anything other than 
essential MDIs. If EPA objects to the transfer, within EPA will issue 
letters to the transferor and transferee stating the basis for 
disallowing the transfer. The burden of proof is placed on the 
transferee to retain sufficient records to prove that the transferred 
essential-use CFCs are used only for production of essential MDIs. If 
EPA ultimately finds that the transferee did not use the essential-use 
CFCs for production of essential MDIs then the transferee is in 
violation of this subpart.
    (e) Exchange of Critical Use Allowances for Critical Stock 
Allowances. (1) Critical use allowance holders may petition the 
Administrator to exchange a quantity of their unexpended critical use 
allowances for an equivalent amount of critical stock allowances. A 
person allocated critical stock allowances may not petition to exchange 
unexpended critical stock allowances for critical use allowances.
    (2) [Reserved]

    (b) Reports and records required by this section may be used for 
purposes of compliance determinations. These requirements are not 
intended as a limitation on the use of other evidence admissible under 
the Federal Rules of Evidence. Failure to provide the reports, petitions 
and records required by this section, and to certify the accuracy of the 
information in the reports, petitions and records required by this 
section, will be considered a violation of this subpart. False 
statements made in reports, petitions and records will be considered 
violations of Section 113 of the Clean Air Act.
    (c) Unless otherwise specified, reports required by this section 
must be mailed to the Administrator within 45 days of the end of the 
applicable reporting period.
    (d) Records and copies of reports required by this section must be 
retained for three years.
    (e) In reports required by this section, quantities of controlled 
substances must be stated in terms of kilograms.
    (f) Every person (``producer'') who produces class I controlled 
substances during a control period must comply with the following 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements:
    (1) Within 120 days of May 10, 1995, or within 120 days of the date 
that a producer first produces a class I controlled

[[Page 479]]

substance, whichever is later, and within 120 days of July 18, 2003 for 
class I, Group VIII controlled substances, every producer who has not 
already done so must submit to the Administrator a report describing:
    (i) The method by which the producer in practice measures daily 
quantities of controlled substances produced;
    (ii) Conversion factors by which the daily records as currently 
maintained can be converted into kilograms of controlled substances 
produced, including any constants or assumptions used in making those 
calculations (e.g., tank specifications, ambient temperature or 
pressure, density of the controlled substance);
    (iii) Internal accounting procedures for determining plant-wide 
production;
    (iv) The quantity of any fugitive losses accounted for in the 
production figures; and
    (v) The estimated percent efficiency of the production process for 
the controlled substance. Within 60 days of any change in the 
measurement procedures or the information specified in the above report, 
the producer must submit a report specifying the revised data or 
procedures to the Administrator.
    (2) Every producer of a class I controlled substance during a 
control period must maintain the following records:
    (i) Dated records of the quantity of each controlled substance 
produced at each facility;

U.S. Customs, the petition and the non-objection notice issued by EPA 
must accompany the shipment through U.S. Customs.
    (vi) If for some reason, following EPA's issuance of a non-objection 
notice, new information is brought to EPA's attention which shows that 
the non-objection notice was issued based on false information, then EPA 
has the right to:
    (A) Revoke the non-objection notice;
    (B) Pursue all means to ensure that the controlled substance is not 
imported into the United States; and
    (C) Take appropriate enforcement actions.
    (vii) Once the Administrator issues a non-objection notice, the 
person receiving the non-objection notice is required to import the 
individual shipment of used class I controlled substance within the same 
control period as the date stamped on the non-objection notice.
    (viii) A person receiving a non-objection notice from the 
Administrator for a petition to import used class I controlled 
substances must maintain the following records:
    (A) a copy of the petition;

Sec. 82.15  Prohibitions for class II controlled substances.

    (a) Production. (1) Effective January 21, 2003, no person may 
produce class II controlled substances for which EPA has apportioned 
baseline production and consumption allowances, in excess of the 
quantity of unexpended production allowances, unexpended Article 5 
allowances, unexpended export production allowances, or conferred 
unexpended HCFC-141b exemption allowances held by that person for that 
substance under the authority of this subpart at that time in that 
control period, unless the substances are transformed or destroyed 
domestically or by a person of another Party, or unless they are 
produced using an exemption granted in paragraph (f) of this section. 
Every kilogram of excess production constitutes a separate violation of 
this subpart.

[[Page 492]]

    (2) Effective January 21, 2003, no person may use production 
allowances to produce a quantity of class II controlled substance unless 
that person holds under the authority of this subpart at the same time 
consumption allowances sufficient to cover that quantity of class II 
controlled substances. No person may use consumption allowances to 
produce a quantity of class II controlled substances unless the person 
holds under authority of this subpart at the same time production 
allowances sufficient to cover that quantity of class II controlled 
substances.
    (b) Import. (1) Effective January 21, 2003, no person may import 
class II controlled substances (other than transhipments, heels or used 
class II controlled substances) for which EPA has apportioned baseline 
production and consumption allowances , in excess of the quantity of 
unexpended consumption allowances, or conferred unexpended HCFC-141b 
exemption allowances held by that person under the authority of this 
subpart at that time in that control period, unless the substances are 
for use in a process resulting in their transformation or their 
destruction, or unless they are produced using an exemption granted in 
paragraph (f) of this section. Every kilogram of excess import 
constitutes a separate violation of this subpart.
    (2) Effective January 21, 2003, no person may import, at any time in 
any control period, a used class II controlled substance for which EPA 
has apportioned baseline production and consumption allowances, without 
having submitted a petition to the Administrator and received a non-
objection notice in accordance with Sec. 82.24(c)(3) and (4). A person 
issued a non-objection notice for the import of an individual shipment 
of used class II controlled substances may not transfer or confer the 
right to import, and may not import any more than the exact quantity (in 
kilograms) of the used class II controlled substance stated in the non-
objection notice. Every kilogram of import of used class II controlled 
substance in excess of the quantity stated in the non-objection notice 
issued by the Administrator in accordance with Sec. 82.24(c)(3) and (4) 
constitutes a separate violation of this subpart.
    (c) Production with Article 5 allowances. No person may introduce 
into U.S. interstate commerce any class II controlled substance produced 
with Article 5 allowances. Every kilogram of a class II controlled 
substance that was produced with Article 5 allowances that is introduced 
into U.S. interstate commerce constitutes a separate violation under 
this subpart. No person may export any class II controlled substance 
produced with Article 5 allowances to a non-Article 5 Party to the 
Protocol as listed in Appendix E to this subpart. Every kilogram of a 
class II controlled substance that was produced with Article 5 
allowances that is exported to a non-Article 5 Party to the Protocol as 
listed in Appendix E of this subpart constitutes a separate violation 
under this subpart.
    (d) Production with export production allowances. No person may 
introduce into U.S. interstate commerce any class II controlled 
substance produced with export production allowances. Every kilogram of 
a class II controlled substance that was produced with export production 
allowances that is introduced into U.S. interstate commerce constitutes 
a separate violation under this subpart.
    (e) Trade with Parties. No person may import or export any quantity 
of a class II controlled substance listed in Appendix A to this subpart, 
from or to any foreign state that is not either:
    (1) A Party to the Montreal Protocol that has ratified the Beijing 
Amendments. Parties that have ratified the Beijing Amendments as of June 
17, 2004 are listed in Annex 1 to Appendix C of this subpart. Or,

the U.S., or non-governmental space vehicle entity that has petitioned 
for HCFC-141b exemption allowances, based on information received in 
accordance with paragraph (h)(1) of this section, a notice indicating 
one of the following:
    (i) A determination by the Director of EPA's Office of Atmospheric 
Programs to grant a specific quantity of HCFC-141b exemption allowances 
(in kilograms) for the production or import of HCFC-141b in a specified 
control period based on an assessment that HCFC-141b is necessary to 
maintain either safety, or operational or technical viability;
    (ii) A determination by the Director of EPA's Office of Atmospheric 
Programs to request additional information because the information 
received in accordance with paragraph (h)(1) of this section is not 
sufficient to decide whether to grant or deny HCFC-141b exemption 
allowances. The Director of EPA's Office of Atmospheric Programs will 
decide whether to grant or deny HCFC-141b exemption allowances within 30 
days of receipt of the additional information. However, if the 
petitioner fails to submit the additional information within 20 days of 
the request, such failure constitutes a basis for denying the petition 
for HCFC-141b exemption allowances.
    (iii) A determination by the Director of EPA's Office of Atmospheric 
Programs to deny a grant of HCFC-141b exemption allowances due to one or 
more of the following reasons:
    (A) The needs can be met by the use of a substance other than HCFC-
141b;
    (B) The needs can be met by the use of existing supplies of HCFC-
141b;
    (C) There is evidence of fraud or misrepresentation;
    (D) Approval of the HCFC-141b exemption allowances would be 
inconsistent with U.S. obligations under the provisions of the Montreal 
Protocol (including Decisions agreed by the Parties);
    (E) Approval of the HCFC-141b exemption allowances would be 
inconsistent with the Clean Air Act;
    (F) There is an inadequate demonstration of efforts undertaken to 
research and implement alternatives; or
    (G) Granting the HCFC-141b exemption allowances may reasonably be 
expected to endanger human health or the environment.
    (3) Within ten working days after receipt of a notice outlining a 
determination by the Director of EPA's Office of Atmospheric Programs to 
deny a grant of HCFC-141b exemption allowances due to one or more of the 
reasons in paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section, the petitioner may 
file with the Director of EPA's Office of Atmospheric Programs a one-
time appeal with elaborated information. The Director of EPA's Office of 
Atmospheric Programs may affirm the determination to deny a grant of 
HCFC-141b exemption allowances or make a determination to grant HCFC-
141b exemption allowance, in light of the available evidence submitted 
with the appeal. If no appeal is submitted by the tenth day after 
receipt of the notice outlining a determination by the Director of EPA's 
Office of Atmospheric Programs to deny a grant of HCFC-141b exemption 
allowances, the denial will be final on that day.
    (4) Any entity that has previously petitioned for HCFC-141b 
exemption allowances under paragraph (h)(1) of this section may file a 
petition for renewal for a subsequent control period by October 31st of 
the year preceding that control period. The petition for renewal must 
contain the following information:
    (i) Name and address of the HCFC-141b formulator, U.S. government 
entity or non-governmental space vehicle entity;
    (ii) Name of contact person, phone number, fax number and e-mail 
address;
    (iii) Quantity (in kilograms) of HCFC-141b needed for the control 
period;
    (iv) Description of markets and applications being served by the use 
of HCFC-141b;
    (v) A technical description of the process in which HCFC-141b is 
still being used;
    (vi) A technical description of the specific conditions under which 
the product is still being applied;
    (vii) Technical description of why alternatives and substitutes are 
still not

[[Page 496]]

sufficient to eliminate the use of HCFC-141b;
    (viii) Amount of stockpiled HCFC-141b (on-hand, taken title to, or 
available from a supplier) along with a detailed analysis showing why 
stockpiled, recovered or recycled quantities are deemed to be 
technically or economically infeasible for use; and
    (ix) A detailed description of continuing investigations into and 
progress on possible alternatives and substitutes and how this activity 
differs from information given in the previous request.
    (5) A person granted HCFC-141b exemption allowances by the Director 
of EPA's Office of Atmospheric Programs under paragraph (h)(2)(i) or 
(h)(3) of this section may request a quantity of HCFC-141b be produced 
or imported in the specified control period listed in the notice by 
conferring the rights to produce or import to a producer or importer.
    (6) The HCFC-141b exemption allowances held by one entity do not 
automatically transfer to an acquiring entity. Any entity acquiring 
another company holding HCFC-141b exemption allowances must submit a 
renewal application in accordance with paragraph (h)(4) of this section 
at the time of the acquisition in order to qualify for the HCFC-141b 
exemption allowances.
    (7) A formulator for, or an agency, department, or instrumentality 
of the U.S., or a non-governmental space vehicle entity that has 
previously petitioned for and been granted HCFC-141b exemption 
allowances under paragraphs (h)(1) through (4) of this section is 
granted, on January 1 of each control period beginning January 1, 2007, 
HCFC-141b exemption allowances equivalent to 10% more than the highest 
amount previously granted under paragraphs (h)(1) through (4) of this 
section to that petitioner for space vehicle uses or defense 
applications.
    (8) A formulator for, or an agency, department, or instrumentality 
of the U.S.; or a non-governmental space vehicle entity that has 
previously petitioned for and been granted HCFC-141b exemption 
allowances under paragraphs (h)(1) through (4) of this section but now 
seeks to obtain allowances in addition to those granted under paragraph 
(h)(7) of this section must submit a new petition in accordance with 
paragraph (h)(1) of this section.

    (2) [Reserved]
    (c) International trades of production allowances, export production 
allowances and Article 5 allowances. (1) A person may increase or 
decrease its production allowances, export production allowances, or 
Article 5 allowances, for a specified control period through trades with 
another Party to the Protocol as set forth in this paragraph (c). 
Effective January 1, 2004, a nation listed either: in Appendix L of this 
subpart that is also listed in Appendix C, Annex 1 of the Protocol as 
having ratified the Beijing Amendments, or in Appendix C, Annex 1 of the 
Protocol as having ratified the Copenhagen Amendments but not listed in 
Appendix L of this subpart, or in Appendix C, Annex 2 of the Protocol, 
as being a foreign state complying with the Beijing Amendments if the 
foreign state is listed in Appendix L of this subpart, or as being a 
foreign state complying with the Copenhagen Amendments if the foreign 
state is not listed in Appendix L of this subpart must agree either to 
trade to the person for the current control period some quantity of 
production that the nation is permitted under the Montreal Protocol or 
to receive from the person for the current control period some quantity 
of production that the person is permitted under this subpart. The 
person must expend its consumption allowances allocated under Sec. 
82.19, or obtained under Sec. 82.20 in order to produce with the 
additional production allowances.
    (2) Trade from a Party--Information requirements. (i) A person 
requesting a trade from a Party must submit to the Administrator a 
signed document from the principal diplomatic representative in that 
nation's embassy in the U.S. stating that the appropriate authority 
within that nation will establish or revise production limits for the 
nation to equal the lowest of the following three production quantities:
    (A) The maximum production that the nation is allowed under the 
Protocol minus the quantity (in kilograms) to be traded;
    (B) The maximum production that is allowed under the nation's 
applicable domestic law minus the quantity (in kilograms) to be traded; 
or
    (C) The average of the nation's actual national production level for 
the three years prior to the trade minus the production to be traded.
    (ii) A person requesting a trade from a Party must also submit to 
the Administrator a true copy of the document that sets forth the 
following:
    (A) The identity and address of the person;
    (B) The identity of the Party;
    (C) The names and telephone numbers of contact persons for the 
person and for the Party;
    (D) The chemical type and quantity (in kilograms) of production 
being traded;
    (E) Documentation that the Party possesses the necessary quantity of 
unexpended production rights;
    (F) The control period(s) to which the trade applies; and
    (G) For increased production intended for export to the Party from

[[Page 498]]

whom the allowances would be received, a signed statement of intent to 
export to the Party.
    (3) Trade to a Party--Information requirements. A person requesting 
a trade to a Party must submit a request that sets forth the following 
information to the Administrator:
    (i) The identity and address of the person;
    (ii) The identity of the Party;
    (iii) The names and telephone numbers of contact persons for the 
person and for the Party;
    (iv) The chemical type and quantity (in kilograms) of allowable 
production being traded; and
    (v) The control period(s) to which the trade applies.
    (4) Review of international trade request to a Party. After 
receiving a trade request that meets the requirements of paragraph 
(c)(3) of this section, the Administrator may, at his/her discretion, 
consider the following factors by seeking concurrence from the 
Department of Commerce, the United States Trade Representative, and the 
Department of State, where appropriate, in deciding whether to approve 
such a trade:
    (i) Possible creation of domestic economic hardship;
    (ii) Possible effects on trade;
    (iii) Potential environmental implications; and
    (iv) The total quantity of unexpended production allowances held by 
U.S. entities.
    (5) Notice of trade. If the request meets the requirement of 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section for trades from Parties and paragraphs 
(c)(3) and (4) of this section for trades to Parties, the Administrator 
will issue the person a notice. The notice will either grant or deduct 
production allowances or export production allowances or Article 5 
allowances and specify the control period to which the trade applies. 
The Administrator may disapprove the trade request contingent on the 
consideration of factors listed in paragraph (c)(4) of this section for 
trades to Parties.
    (i) For trades from a Party, the Administrator will issue a notice 
revising the allowances held by the recipient of the trade to equal the 
unexpended production allowances, unexpended export production 
allowances, or unexpended Article 5 allowances held by the recipient of 
the trade under this subpart plus the quantity of allowable production 
traded from the Party.
    (ii) For trades to a Party, the Administrator will issue a notice 
revising the production limit for the trader to equal the lesser of:
    (A) The unexpended production allowances, unexpended export 
production allowances or unexpended Article 5 allowances held by the 
trade or minus the quantity traded; or
    (B) The unexpended production allowances held by the trader minus 
the amount by which the U.S. average annual production of the class II 
controlled substance being traded for the three years prior to the trade 
is less than the total allowable production of that class II controlled 
substance under this subpart minus the amount traded; or
    (C) The total U.S. allowable production of the class II controlled 
substance being traded minus the three-year average of the actual annual 
U.S. production of the class II controlled substance prior to the 
control period of the trade.
    (6) Revised notices of production limits for subsequent traders. If 
after one person obtains approval of a trade of allowable production of 
a class II controlled substance to a Party and other persons obtain 
approval for trades of the same class II controlled substance during the 
same control period, the Administrator will issue revised notices. The 
notices will revise the production limits for each of the other persons 
trading to equal the lesser of:
    (i) The unexpended production allowances, unexpended export 
production allowances or unexpended Article 5 allowances held by the 
trader under this subpart minus the quantity traded; or
    (ii) The result of the following set of calculations:
    (A) The total U.S. allowable production of the class II controlled 
substance minus the three-year average of the actual annual U.S. 
production of the class II controlled substance prior to the control 
period of the trade;
    (B) The quantity traded divided by the total quantity traded by all 
the other persons trading the same class II controlled substance in the 
same control period;

[[Page 499]]

    (C) The result of paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(A) of this section multiplied 
by the result of paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(B) of this section;
    (D) The quantity derived in paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section, 
minus the result of paragraph (c)(6)(ii)(C) of this section;
    (7) Production limit for previous traders. The Administrator will 
also issue a notice revising the production limit for each trader who 
previously obtained approval of a trade of the class II controlled 
substance to a Party in the same control period to equal the result of 
the following set of calculations:
    (i) The total U.S. allowable production of the class II controlled 
substance minus the three-year average of the actual annual U.S. 
production of the class II controlled substance prior to the control 
period of the trade;
    (ii) The quantity traded by the person divided by the quantity 
traded by all the persons who have traded that class II controlled 
substance in that control period;
    (iii) The result of paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section multiplied 
by the result of paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section.
    (iv) The unexpended production allowances, unexpended export 
production allowances or unexpended Article 5 allowances held by the 
person plus the result of paragraph (c)(7)(iii) of this section;
    (8) Effective date of revised production limits. The change in 
production allowances, export production allowances or Article 5 
allowances will be effective on the date that the notice is issued.

    (b) International trades of consumption allowances. (1) A person may 
increase its consumption allowances for a specified control period 
through trades with another Party to the Protocol as set forth in this 
paragraph (b). A person may only receive consumption from Poland or 
Norway, or both, and only if the nation agrees to trade to the person 
for the current control period some quantity of consumption that the 
nation is permitted under the Montreal Protocol.
    (2) Trade from a Party--Information requirements. A person must 
submit the following information to the Administrator:
    (i) A signed document from the principal diplomatic representative 
in the Polish or Norwegian embassy in the U.S. stating that the 
appropriate authority within that nation will establish or revise 
consumption limits for

[[Page 501]]

the nation to equal the lowest of the following three consumption 
quantities:
    (A) The maximum consumption that the nation is allowed under the 
Protocol minus the quantity (in kilograms) traded;
    (B) The maximum consumption that is allowed under the nation's 
applicable domestic law minus the quantity (in kilograms) traded; or
    (C) The average of the nation's actual consumption level for the 
three years prior to the trade minus the consumption traded.
    (ii) A person requesting a consumption trade from Poland or Norway 
must also submit to the Administrator a true copy of the document that 
sets forth the following:
    (A) The identity and address of the person;
    (B) The identity of the Party;
    (C) The names and telephone numbers of contact persons for the 
person and for the Party;
    (D) The chemical type and quantity (in kilograms) of consumption 
being traded;
    (E) Documentation that the Party possesses the necessary quantity of 
unexpended consumption rights;
    (F) The control period(s) to which the trade applies; and
    (3) Notice of trade. If the request meets the requirement of 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section for trades from Parties, the 
Administrator will issue the person a notice. The notice will grant 
consumption allowances and specify the control period to which the trade 
applies. The Administrator may disapprove the trade request if it does 
not meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (4) Trade from a Party. The Administrator will issue a notice 
revising the allowances held by the recipient of the trade to equal the 
unexpended consumption allowances held by the recipient of the trade 
under this subpart plus the quantity of allowable consumption traded 
from the Party.
    (5) Effective date of revised consumption limits. The change in 
consumption allowances will be effective on the date that the notice is

Sec. Sec. 82.21-82.22  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 82.23  Transfers of allowances of class II controlled substances.

    (a) Inter-company transfers. Effective January 1, 2003, a person 
(``transferor'') may transfer to any other person (``transferee'') any 
quantity of the transferor's class II consumption allowances, production 
allowances, export production allowances, or Article 5 allowances for 
the same type of allowance as follows:
    (i) The transferor must submit to the Administrator a transfer claim 
setting forth the following:
    (A) The identities and addresses of the transferor and the 
transferee;
    (B) The name and telephone numbers of contact persons for the 
transferor and the transferee;
    (C) The type of allowances being transferred, including the names of 
the class II controlled substances for which allowances are to be 
transferred;
    (D) The quantity (in kilograms) of allowances being transferred;
    (E) The control period(s) for which the allowances are being 
transferred;
    (F) The quantity of unexpended allowances of the type and for the 
control period being transferred that the transferor holds under 
authority of this subpart on the date the claim is submitted to EPA; and
    (G) For trades of consumption allowances, production allowances, 
export production allowances, or Article 5 allowances, the quantity of 
the 0.1 percent offset applied to the unweighted quantity traded that 
will be deducted from the transferor's allowance balance.
    (ii) The Administrator will determine whether the records maintained 
by EPA indicate that the transferor possesses unexpended allowances 
sufficient to cover the transfer claim on the date the transfer claim is 
processed. The transfer claim is the quantity (in kilograms) to be 
transferred plus, in the case of transfers of production or consumption 
allowances, 0.1 percent of that quantity. The Administrator will take 
into account any previous transfers, any production, and allowable 
imports and exports of class II controlled substances reported by the 
transferor. Within three working days of receiving

[[Page 502]]

a complete transfer claim, the Administrator will take action to notify 
the transferor and transferee as follows:
    (A) The Administrator will issue a notice indicating that EPA does 
not object to the transfer if EPA's records show that the transferor has 
sufficient unexpended allowances to cover the transfer claim. In the 
case of transfers of production or consumption allowances, EPA will 
reduce the transferor's balance of unexpended allowances by the quantity 
to be transferred plus 0.1 percent of that quantity. In the case of 
transfers of export production or Article 5 allowances, EPA will reduce 
the transferor's balance of unexpended allowances, respectively, by the 
quantity to be transferred. The transferor and the transferee may 
proceed with the transfer when EPA issues a no objection notice. 
However, if EPA ultimately finds that the transferor did not have 
sufficient unexpended allowances to cover the claim, the transferor and 
transferee, where applicable, will be held liable for any knowing 
violations of the regulations of this subpart that occur as a result of, 
or in conjunction with, the improper transfer.
    (B) The Administrator will issue a notice disallowing the transfer 
if EPA's records show that the transferor has insufficient unexpended 
allowances to cover the transfer claim, or that the transferor has 
failed to respond to one or more Agency requests to supply information 
needed to make a determination. Either party may file a notice of 
appeal, with supporting reasons, with the Administrator within 10 
working days after receipt of notification. The Administrator may affirm 
or vacate the disallowance. If no appeal is taken by the tenth working 
day after notification, the disallowance shall be final on that day.
    (iii) The transferor and transferee may proceed with the transfer if 
the Administrator does not respond to a transfer claim within the three 
working days specified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. In the 
case of transfers of production or consumption allowances, EPA will 
reduce the transferor's balance of unexpended allowances by the quantity 
to be transferred plus 0.1 percent of that quantity. In the case of 
transfers of export production allowances or Article 5 allowances, EPA 
will reduce the transferor's balance of unexpended allowances by the 
quantity to be transferred plus 0.1 percent of that quantity. If EPA 
ultimately finds that the transferor did not have sufficient unexpended 
allowances to cover the claim, the transferor and/or the transferee, 
where applicable, will be held liable for any knowing violations of the 
regulations of this subpart that occur as a result of, or in conjunction 
with, the improper transfer.
    (b) Inter-pollutant transfers. (1) Effective January 1, 2003, a 
person (transferor) may convert consumption allowances or production 
allowances for one class II controlled substance to the same type of 
allowance for another class II controlled substance listed in Appendix B 
of this subpart, following the procedures described in paragraph (b)(3) 
of this section.
    (2) Inter-pollutant transfers will be permitted at any time during 
the control period and during the 30 days after the end of a control 
period.
    (3) The transferor must submit to the Administrator a transfer claim 
that includes the following:
    (i) The identity and address of the transferor;
    (ii) The name and telephone number of a contact person for the 
transferor;
    (iii) The type of allowances being converted, including the names of 
the class II controlled substances for which allowances are to be 
converted;
    (iv) The quantity (in kilograms) and type of allowances to be 
converted;
    (v) The quantity (in kilograms) of allowances to be subtracted from 
the transferor's unexpended allowances for the first class II controlled 
substance, to be equal to 100.1 percent of the quantity of allowances 
converted;
    (vi) The quantity (in kilograms) of allowances to be added to the 
transferee's unexpended allowances for the second class II controlled 
substance, to be equal to the quantity (in kilograms) of allowances for 
the first class II controlled substance being converted multiplied by 
the quotient of the ozone depletion potential of the first class II 
controlled substance divided by the ozone depletion potential of the 
second

[[Page 503]]

class II controlled substance, as listed in Appendix B to this subpart;
    (vii) The control period(s) for which the allowances are being 
converted; and
    (viii) The quantity (in kilograms) of unexpended allowances of the 
type and for the control period being converted that the transferor 
holds under authority of this subpart as of the date the claim is 
submitted to EPA.
    (4) The Administrator will determine whether the records maintained 
by EPA indicate that the convertor possesses unexpended allowances 
sufficient to cover the transfer claim on the date the transfer claim is 
processed (i.e., the quantity (in kilograms) to be converted plus 0.1 
percent of that quantity (in kilograms)). EPA will take into account any 
previous transfers, and any production, imports (not including 
transshipments or used class II controlled substances), or exports (not 
including transhipments or used class II controlled substances) of class 
II controlled substances reported by the convertor. Within three working 
days of receiving a complete transfer claim, the Administrator will take 
action to notify the convertor as follows:
    (i) The Administrator will issue a notice indicating that EPA does 
not object to the transfer if EPA's records show that the convertor has 
sufficient unexpended allowances to cover the transfer claim. EPA will 
reduce the transferor's balance of unexpended allowances by the quantity 
to be converted plus 0.1 percent of that quantity (in kilograms). When 
EPA issues a no objection notice, the transferor may proceed with the 
transfer. However, if EPA ultimately finds that the transferor did not 
have sufficient unexpended allowances to cover the claim, the transferor 
will be held liable for any violations of the regulations of this 
subpart that occur as a result of, or in conjunction with, the improper 
transfer.
    (ii) The Administrator will issue a notice disallowing the transfer 
if EPA's records show that the transferor has insufficient unexpended 
allowances to cover the transfer claim, or that the transferor has 
failed to respond to one or more Agency requests to supply information 
needed to make a determination. The transferor may file a notice of 
appeal, with supporting reasons, with the Administrator within 10 
working days after receipt of notification. The Administrator may affirm 
or vacate the disallowance. If no appeal is taken by the tenth working 
day after notification, the disallowance shall be final on that day.
    (iii) The transferor may proceed with the transfer if the 
Administrator does not respond to a transfer claim within the three 
working days specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. EPA will 
reduce the transferor's balance of unexpended allowances by the quantity 
(in kilograms) to be converted plus 0.1 percent of that quantity (in 
kilograms). The transferor will be held liable for any violations of the 
regulations of this subpart that occur as a result of, or in conjunction 
with, the improper transfer if EPA ultimately finds that the transferor 
did not have sufficient unexpended allowances or credits to cover the 
claim.
    (c) Inter-company transfers and Inter-pollutant transfers. If a 
person requests an inter-company transfer and an inter-pollutant 
transfer simultaneously, the quantity (in kilograms) subtracted from the 
transferor's unexpended production or consumption allowances for the 
first class II controlled substance will be equal to 100.1 percent of 
the quantity (in kilograms) of allowances that are being converted and 
transferred.
    (d) A person receiving a permanent transfer of baseline production 
allowances or baseline consumption allowances (the transferee) for a 
specific class II controlled substance will be the person who has their 
baseline allowances adjusted in accordance with phaseout schedules in 
this section.

specifications; and
    (xiv) A certification of accuracy of the information submitted in 
the petition.
    (4) Review of petition to import used class II controlled substances 
and transhipments--Importers. Starting on the first working day 
following receipt by the Administrator of a petition to import a used 
class II controlled substance, the Administrator will initiate a review 
of the information submitted under paragraph(c)(3) of this section and 
take action within 40 working days to issue either an objection-notice 
or a non-objection notice for the individual shipment to the person who 
submitted the petition to import the used class II controlled substance.
    (i) The Administrator may issue an objection notice to a petition 
for the following reasons:
    (A) If the Administrator determines that the information is 
insufficient, that is, if the petition lacks or appears to lack any of

Vienna Convention on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, the 
Montreal Protocol and Decisions by the Parties, or the non-compliance 
procedures outlined and instituted by the Implementation Committee of 
the Montreal Protocol;
    (D) If the appropriate government agency in the exporting country 
has not agreed to issue an export license for the cited individual 
shipment of used class II controlled substance;
    (E) If reclamation capacity is installed or is being installed for 
that specific class II controlled substance in the country of recovery 
or country of export and the capacity is funded in full or in part 
through the Multilateral Fund.
    (ii) Within ten (10) working days after receipt of the objection 
notice, the importer may re-petition the Administrator, only if the 
Administrator indicated ``insufficient information'' as the basis for 
the objection notice. If no appeal is taken by the tenth working day 
after the date on the objection notice, the objection shall become 
final. Only one re-petition will be accepted for any original petition 
received by EPA.
    (iii) Any information contained in the re-petition which is 
inconsistent with the original petition must be identified and a 
description of the reason for the inconsistency must accompany the re-
petition.
    (iv) In cases where the Administrator does not object to the 
petition based on the criteria listed in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this 
section, the Administrator will issue a non-objection notice.
    (v) To pass the approved used class II controlled substances through

\a\ According to Annex C of the Montreal Protocol, ``Where a range of
  ODPs is indicated, the highest value in that range shall be used for
  the purposes of the Protocol. The ODPs listed as a single value have
  been determined from calculations based on laboratory measurements.
  Those listed as a range are based on estimates and are less certain.
  The range pertains to an isomeric group. The upper value is the
  estimate of the ODP of the isomer with the highest ODP, and the lower
  value is the estimate of the ODP of the isomer with the lowest ODP.''

  Sec. Appendix D to Subpart A of Part 82--Harmonized Tariff Schedule 
   Description of Products That May Contain Controlled Substances in 
                  Appendix A, Class I, Groups I and II

    This Appendix is based on information provided by the Ozone 
Secretariat of the United Nations Ozone Environment Programme.** The 
Appendix lists available U.S. harmonized tariff schedule codes 
identifying headings and subheadings for Annex D products that may 
contain controlled substances.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ** ``A Note Regarding the Harmonized System Code Numbers for the 
Products Listed in Annex D.'' Adopted by Decision IV/15 paragraph 3, of 
the Fourth Meeting of the Parties in Copenhagen, 23-25 November, 1992.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States uses an 
enumeration system to identify products imported and exported to and 
from the U.S. This system relies on a four digit heading, a four digit 
subheading and additional two digit statistical suffix to characterize 
products. The United States uses the suffix for its own statistical 
records and analyses. This Appendix lists only headings and subheadings.
    While some can be readily associated with harmonized system codes, 
many products cannot be tied to HS classifications unless their exact 
composition and the presentation are known. It should be noted that the 
specified HS classifications represent the most likely headings and 
subheadings which may contain substances controlled by the Montreal 
Protocol. The codes given should only be used as a starting point; 
further verfication is needed to ascertain whether or not the products 
actually contain controlled substances.

    Category 1. Automobile and Truck Air Conditioning Units (whether 
                    incorporated in vehicles or not)

    There are no separate code numbers for air conditioning units 
specially used in automobiles and trucks. Although a code has been 
proposed for car air conditioners, it is not yet officially listed in 
the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (see category 2). The following codes 
apply to the vehicles potentially containing air conditioning units.

 
                   Heading/Subheading                                      Article Description

                                                          goods (for example, wreckers, mobile cranes, fire

                        Category 6. Pre-Polymers

    According to the Explanatory Notes to the Harmonized Commodity 
Description and Coding System, ``prepolymers are products which are 
characterized by some repetition of monomer units although they may 
contain unreacted monomers. Prepolymers are not normally used as such 
but are intended to be transformed into higher molecular weight polymers 
by further polymerization. Therefore the term does not cover finished 
products, such as di-isobutylenes or mixed polyethylene glycols with 
very low molecular weight. Examples are epoxides based with 
epichlorohydrin, and polymeric isocyanates.''

   Sec. Appendix G to Subpart A of Part 82--UNEP Recommendations for 
Conditions Applied to Exemption for Essential Laboratory and Analytical 
                                  Uses

    1. Essential laboratory and analytical uses are identified at this 
time to include equipment calibration; use as extraction solvents, 
diluents, or carriers for chemical analysis; biochemical research; inert 
solvents for chemical reactions, as a carrier or laboratory chemical and 
other critical analytical and laboratory purposes. Pursuant to Decision 
XI/15 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol, effective January 1, 2002 
the following uses of class I controlled substances are not considered 
essential under the global laboratory exemption:
    a. Testing of oil and grease and total petroleum hydrocarbons in 
water;
    b. Testing of tar in road-paving materials; and
    c. Forensic finger printing.
    Production for essential laboratory and analytical purposes is 
authorized provided that these laboratory and analytical chemicals shall 
contain only controlled substances manufactured to the following 
purities:

CTC (reagent grade)--99.5
1,1,1,-trichloroethane--99.5
CFC-11--99.5
CFC-13--99.5
CFC-12--99.5
CFC-113--99.5
CFC-114--99.5
Other w/ Boiling P<ls-thn-eq>20 degrees C--99.5
Other w/ Boiling P<20 degrees C--99.0
    d. Testing of organic matter in coal.
    2. These pure, controlled substances can be subsequently mixed by 
manufacturers, agents or distributors with other chemicals controlled or 
not controlled by the Montreal Protocol as is customary for laboratory 
and analytical uses.
    3. These high purity substances and mixtures containing controlled 
substances shall be supplied only in re-closable containers or high 
pressure cylinders smaller than three litres or in 10 millilitre or 
smaller glass ampoules, marked clearly as substances that deplete the 
ozone layer, restricted to laboratory use and analytical purposes and 
specifying that used or surplus substances should be collected and 
recycled, if practical. The material should be destroyed if recycling is 
not practical.
    4. Parties shall annually report for each controlled substance 
produced: the purity; the quantity; the application, specific test 
standard, or procedure requiring its uses; and the status of efforts to 
eliminate its use in each application. Parties shall also submit copies 
of published instructions, standards, specifications, and regulations 
requiring the use of the controlled substance.
    5. Pursuant to Decision XVIII/15 of the Parties to the Montreal 
Protocol, methyl bromide is exempted for the following approved 
essential laboratory and analytical purposes listed in following items 
(a) through (d). Use of methyl bromide for field trials is not an 
approved use under the global laboratory and analytical use exemption. 
The provisions of Appendix G, paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4), 
regarding purity, mixing, container, and reporting requirements for 
other exempt ODSs, also apply to the use of methyl bromide under this 
exemption.
    a. Methyl bromide is exempted as an approved essential laboratory 
and analytical use as a reference or standard to calibrate equipment 
which uses methyl bromide, to monitor methyl bromide emission levels, or 
to determine methyl bromide residue levels in goods, plants and 
commodities;
    b. Methyl bromide is exempted as an approved essential laboratory 
and analytical when used in laboratory toxicological studies;
    c. Methyl bromide is exempted as an approved essential laboratory 
and analytical use to compare the efficacy of methyl bromide and its 
alternatives inside a laboratory; and
    d. Methyl bromide is exempted as an approved essential laboratory 
and analytical use as a laboratory agent which is destroyed in a 
chemical reaction in the manner of feedstock.

          Subpart B_Servicing of Motor Vehicle Air Conditioners

    Source: 57 FR 31261, July 14, 1992, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 82.30  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The purpose of the regulations in this subpart B is to implement 
section 609 of the Clean Air Act, as amended (Act) regarding the 
servicing of motor vehicle air conditioners (MVACs), and to implement 
section 608 of the Act regarding certain servicing, maintenance, repair 
and disposal of air conditioners in MVACs and MVAC-like appliances (as 
that term is defined in 40 CFR 82.152).
    (b) These regulations apply to any person performing service on a 
motor vehicle for consideration when this service involves the 
refrigerant in the motor vehicle air conditioner.

[57 FR 31261, July 14, 1992, as amended at 62 FR 68046, Dec. 30, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 82.32  Definitions.

    (a) Approved independent standards testing organization means any 
organization which has applied for and received approval from the 
Administrator pursuant to Sec. 82.38.
    (b) Approved refrigerant recycling equipment means equipment 
certified by the Administrator or an organization approved under Sec. 
82.38 as meeting either one of the standards in Sec. 82.36. Such 
equipment extracts and recycles refrigerant or extracts refrigerant for 
recycling on-site or reclamation off-site.
    (c) Motor vehicle as used in this subpart means any vehicle which is 
self-propelled and designed for transporting persons or property on a 
street or highway, including but not limited to passenger cars, light 
duty vehicles, and heavy duty vehicles. This definition does not include 
a vehicle where final assembly of the vehicle has not been completed by 
the original equipment manufacturer.
    (d) Motor vehicle air conditioners means mechanical vapor 
compression refrigeration equipment used to cool the driver's or 
passenger's compartment of any motor vehicle. This definition is not 
intended to encompass the hermetically sealed refrigeration systems used 
on motor vehicles for refrigerated cargo and the air conditioning

[[Page 531]]

systems on passenger buses using HCFC-22 refrigerant.
    (e) Properly using. (1) Properly using means using equipment in 
conformity with the regulations set forth in this subpart, including but 
not limited to the prohibitions and required practices set forth in 
Sec. 82.34, and the recommended service procedures and practices for 
the containment of refrigerant set forth in appendices A, B, C, D, E, 
and F of this subpart, as applicable. In addition, this term includes 
operating the equipment in accordance with the manufacturer's guide to 
operation and maintenance and using the equipment only for the 
controlled substance for which the machine is designed. For equipment 
that extracts and recycles refrigerant, properly using also means to 
recycle refrigerant before it is returned to a motor vehicle air 
conditioner or MVAC-like appliance, including to the motor vehicle air 
conditioner or MVAC-like appliance from which the refrigerant was 
extracted. For equipment that only recovers refrigerant, properly using 
includes the requirement to recycle the refrigerant on-site or send the 
refrigerant off-site for reclamation.
    (2) Refrigerant from reclamation facilities that is used for the 
purpose of recharging motor vehicle air conditioners must be at or above 
the standard of purity developed by the Air-conditioning and 
Refrigeration Institute (ARI 700-93) (which is codified at 40 CFR part 
82, subpart F, appendix A, and is available at 4301 North Fairfax Drive, 
Suite 425, Arlington, Virginia 22203). Refrigerant may be recycled off-
site only if the refrigerant is extracted using recover only equipment, 
and is subsequently recycled off-site by equipment owned by the person 
that owns both the recover only equipment and owns or operates the 
establishment at which the refrigerant was extracted. In any event, 
approved equipment must be used to extract refrigerant prior to 
performing any service during which discharge of refrigerant from the 
motor vehicle air conditioner can reasonably be expected. Intentionally 
venting or disposing of refrigerant to the atmosphere is an improper use 
of equipment.
    (3) Notwithstanding any other terms of this paragraph (e), approved 
refrigerant recycling equipment may be transported off-site and used to 
perform service involving refrigerant at other locations where such 
servicing occurs. Any such servicing involving refrigerant must meet all 
of the requirements of this subpart B that would apply if the servicing 
occurred on-site.
    (4) Facilities that charge MVACs or MVAC-like appliances with 
refrigerant but do not perform any other service involving refrigerant 
(i.e., perform ``top-offs'' only) are considered to be engaged in 
``service involving refrigerant'' and are therefore subject to any and 
all requirements of this subsection that apply to facilities that 
perform a wider range of refrigerant servicing. For facilities that 
charge MVACs, this includes the requirement to purchase approved 
refrigerant recycling equipment. For facilities that only charge MVAC-
like appliances, this does not include the requirement to purchase 
approved refrigerant recycling equipment, but does include the 
requirement to be properly trained and certified by a technician 
certification program approved by the Administrator pursuant to either 
Sec. 82.40 or Sec. 82.161(a)(5).
    (5) All persons opening (as that term is defined in Sec. 82.152) 
MVAC-like appliances must have at least one piece of approved recovery 
or recycling equipment available at their place of business.
    (f) Refrigerant means any class I or class II substance used in a 
motor vehicle air conditioner. Class I and class II substances are 
listed in part 82, subpart A, appendix A. Effective November 15, 1995, 
refrigerant shall also include any substitute substance.
    (g) Service for consideration means being paid to perform service, 
whether it is in cash, credit, goods, or services. This includes all 
service except that done for free.
    (h) Service involving refrigerant means any service during which 
discharge or release of refrigerant from the MVAC or MVAC-like appliance 
to the atmosphere can reasonably be expected to occur. Service involving 
refrigerant includes any service in which an MVAC or MVAC-like appliance 
is charged with refrigerant but no other service

[[Page 532]]

involving refrigerant is performed (i.e., a ``top-off'').
    (i) Motor vehicle disposal facility means any commercial facility 
that engages in the disposal (which includes dismantling, crushing or 
recycling) of MVACs or MVAC-like appliances, including but not limited 
to automotive recycling facilities, scrap yards, landfills and salvage 
yards engaged in such operations. Motor vehicle repair and/or servicing 
facilities, including collision repair facilities, are not considered 
motor vehicle disposal facilities.

[57 FR 31261, July 14, 1992, as amended at 60 FR 21687, May 2, 1995; 62 
FR 68046, Dec. 30, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 82.34  Prohibitions and required practices.

    (a) No person repairing or servicing MVACs for consideration, and no 
person repairing or servicing MVAC-like appliances, may perform any 
service involving the refrigerant for such MVAC or MVAC-like appliance:
    (1) Without properly using equipment approved pursuant to Sec. 
82.36;
    (2) Unless any such person repairing or servicing an MVAC has been 
properly trained and certified by a technician certification program 
approved by the Administrator pursuant to Sec. 82.40; and
    (3) Unless any such person repairing or servicing an MVAC-like 
appliance has been properly trained and certified by a technician 
certification program approved by the Administrator pursuant to either 
Sec. 82.40 or Sec. 82.161(a)(5).
    (b) Effective November 15, 1992, no person may sell or distribute, 
or offer for sale or distribution, any class I or class II substance 
that is suitable for use as a refrigerant in motor vehicle air-
conditioner and that is in a container which contains less than 20 
pounds of such refrigerant to any person unless that person is properly 
trained and certified under Sec. 82.40 or intended the containers for 
resale only, and so certifies to the seller under Sec. 82.42(b)(3).
    (c) No technician training programs may issue certificates unless 
the program complies with all of the standards in Sec. 82.40(a).
    (d) Motor vehicle disposal facilities. (1) Any refrigerant that is 
extracted from an MVAC or an MVAC-like appliance (as that term is 
defined in Sec. 82.152) bound for disposal and located at a motor 
vehicle disposal facility may not be subsequently used to charge or 
recharge an MVAC or MVAC-like appliance, unless, prior to such charging 
or recharging, the refrigerant is either:
    (i) Recovered, and reclaimed in accordance with the regulations 
promulgated under Sec. 82.32(e)(2) of this subpart B; or
    (ii) (A) Recovered using approved refrigerant recycling equipment 
dedicated for use with MVACs and MVAC-like appliances, either by a 
technician certified under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or by an 
employee, owner, or operator of, or contractor to, the disposal 
facility; and
    (B) Subsequently recycled by the facility that charges or recharges 
the refrigerant into an MVAC or MVAC-like appliance, properly using 
approved refrigerant recycling equipment in accordance with any 
applicable recommended service procedures set forth in the appendices to 
this subpart B.
    (2) Any refrigerant the sale of which is restricted under subpart F 
that is extracted from an MVAC or an MVAC-like appliance bound for 
disposal and located at a motor vehicle disposal facility but not 
subsequently reclaimed in accordance with the regulations promulgated 
under subpart F, may be sold prior to its subsequent re-use only to a 
technician certified under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Any 
technician certified under paragraph (a)(2) of this section who obtains 
such a refrigerant may subsequently re-use such refrigerant only in an 
MVAC or MVAC-like appliance, and only if it has been reclaimed or 
properly recycled.
    (e) Refrigerant handling equipment manufactured or imported for use 
during the maintenance, service or repair of MVACs for consideration 
cannot be introduced into interstate commerce unless meeting the 
requirements of Sec. 82.36.

      Standard of Purity for Use in Mobile Air-Conditioning Systems

                                Foreword

    Due to the CFC's damaging effect on the ozone layer, recycle of CFC-
12 (R-12) used in mobile air-conditioning systems is required to reduce 
system venting during normal service operations. Establishing recycle 
specifications for R-12 will assure that system operation with recycled 
R-12 will provide the same level of performance as new refrigerant.
    Extensive field testing with the EPA and the auto industry indicate 
that reuse of R-12 removed from mobile air-conditioning systems can be 
considered, if the refrigerant is cleaned to a specific standard. The 
purpose of this standard is to establish the specific minimum levels of 
R-12 purity required for recycled R-12 removed from mobile automotive 
air-conditioning systems.

                                1. Scope

introduction of noncondensable gases into the recovery equipment and the 
release of the refrigerant when being disconnected.
    7.7 The equipment must be able to separate the lubricant from the 
recovered refrigerant and accurately indicate the amount removed during 
the process, in 30 ml units. Refrigerant dissolves in lubricant sample. 
This creates the illusion that more lubricant has been recovered than 
actually has been. The equipment lubricant measuring system must take in 
account such dissolved refrigerant to prevent overcharging the vehicle 
system with lubricant. Note: Use only new lubricant to replace the 
amount removed during the recycle process. Used lubricant should be 
discarded per applicable federal, state, and local requirements.

be shaken for 5 minutes prior to extracting samples for test.
    8.9.3 A weighted sample of 175 to 225 grams of liquid CFC-12 is 
allowed to evaporate at room temperature. The percent oil is to be 
calculated from the weight of the original sample and the residue 
remaining after the evaporation.
    8.10 Noncondensable Gas.
    8.10.1 The amount of noncondensable gas is to be determined by gas 
chromatography. A sample of vaporized refrigerant liquid

[[Page 541]]

shall be separated and analyzed by gas chromatography. A Porapak Q 
column at 130 [deg]C and a hot wire detector may be used for analysis.
    8.10.2 This test shall be conducted on recycled refrigerant (taken 
from the liquid phase) within 30 minutes after the proper venting of 
noncondensable.
    8.10.3 Samples shall be shaken for 8 hours prior to retesting while 
at a temperature of 24 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.8 [deg]C (75 <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>5 [deg]F). Known volumes of refrigerant vapor are to be 
injected for separation and analysis by means of gas chromatography. A 
Porapak Q column at 130 [deg]C (266 [deg]F) and a hot wire detector are 
to be used for the analysis.
    8.10.4 This test shall be conducted at 21 and 49 [deg]C and may be 
performed in conjunction with the testing defined in Section 8.6. The 
equipment shall process at least 13.6 kg of standard contaminated 
refrigerant for this test.
    8.11 Sample Requirements.

        Recommended Service Procedure for the Containment of R-12

                                1. Scope

    During service of mobile air-conditioning systems, containment of 
the refrigerant is important. This procedure provides service guidelines 
for technicians when repairing vehicles and operating equipment defined 
in SAE J1990.

[[Page 543]]

SAE J1990, Extraction and Recycle Equipment for Mobile Automotive Air-
Conditioning Systems

                    3. Refrigerant Recovery Procedure

    3. 1 Connect the recovery unit service hoses, which shall have 
shutoff valves within 12 in (30 cm) of the service ends, to the vehicle 
air-conditioning system service ports.
    3.2 Operate the recovery equipment as covered by the equipment 
manufacturers recommended procedure.
    3.2.1 Start the recovery process and remove the refrigerant from the 
vehicle AC system. Operate the recovery unit until the vehicle system 
has been reduced from a pressure to a vacuum. With the recovery unit 
shut off for at least 5 min, determine that there is no refrigerant 
remaining in the vehicle AC system. If the vehicle system has pressure, 
additional recovery operation is required to remove the remaining 
refrigerant. Repeat the operation until the vehicle AC system vacuum 
level remains stable for 2 min.
    3.3 Close the valves in the service lines and then remove the 
service lines from the vehicle system. Proceed with the repair/service. 
If the recovery equipment has automatic closing valves, be sure they are 
properly operating.

                    4. Service With Manifold Gage Set

    4.1 Service hoses must have shutoff valves in the high, low, and 
center service hoses within 12 in (30 cm) of the service ends. Valves 
must be closed prior to hose removal from the air-conditioning system. 
This will reduce the volume of refrigerant contained in the service hose 
that would otherwise be vented to atmosphere.
    4.2 During all service operations, the valves should be closed until 
connected to the vehicle air-conditioning system or the charging source 
to avoid introduction of air and to contain the refrigerant rather than 
vent open to atmosphere.
    4.3 When the manifold gage set is disconnected from the air-
conditioning system or when the center hose is moved to another device 
which cannot accept refrigerant pressure, the gage set hoses should 
first be attached to the reclaim equipment to recover the refrigerant 
from the hoses.

5. Recycled Refrigerant Checking Procedure for Stored Portable Auxiliary 
                                Container

    5.1 To determine if the recycled refrigerant container has excess 
noncondensable gases (air), the container must be stored at a 
temperature of 65 [deg]F (18.3 [deg]C) or above for a period of time, 12 
h, protected from direct sun.
    5.2 Install a calibrated pressure gage, with 1 psig divisions (0.07 
kg), to the container and determine the container pressure.
    5.3 With a calibrated thermometer, measure the air temperature 
within 4 in (10 cm) of the container surface.
    5.4 Compare the observed container pressure and air temperature to 
determine if the container exceeds the pressure limits found on Table 1, 
e.g., air temperature 70 [deg]F (21 [deg]C) pressure must not exceed 80 
psig (5.62 kg/cm \2\).

    5.5 If the container pressure is less than the Table 1 values and 
has been recycled, limits of noncondensable gases (air) have not been 
exceeded and the refrigerant may be used.
    5.6 If the pressure is greater than the range and the container 
contains recycled material, slowly vent from the top of the container a 
small amount of vapor into the recycle equipment until the pressure is 
less than the pressure shown on Table 1.
    5.7 If the container still exceeds the pressure shown on Table 1, 
the entire contents of the container shall be recycled.

            6. Containers for Storage of Recycled Refrigerant

    6.1 Recycled refrigerant should not be salvaged or stored in 
disposable refrigerant containers. This is the type of container in 
which virgin refrigerant is sold. Use only DOT CFR title 49 or UL 
approved storage containers for recycled refrigerant.
    6.2 Any container of recycled refrigerant that has been stored or 
transferred must be checked prior to use as defined in section 5.

                   7. Transfer of Recycled Refrigerant

    7.1 When external portable containers are used for transfer, the 
container must be evacuated at least 27 in of vacuum (75 mm Hg absolute 
pressure) prior to transfer of the recycled refrigerant. External 
portable containers must meet DOT and UL standards.
    7.2 To prevent on-site overfilling when transferring to external 
containers, the safe filling level must be controlled by weight and must 
not exceed 60% of container gross weight rating.

               8. Disposal of Empty/Near Empty Containers

    8.1 Since all the refrigerant may not be removed from disposable 
refrigerant containers during normal system charging procedures, empty/
near empty container contents should be reclaimed prior to disposal of 
the container.
    8.2 Attach the container to the recovery unit and remove the 
remaining refrigerant. When the container has been reduced from a 
pressure to a vacuum, the container valve can be closed. The container 
should be marked empty and is ready for disposal.

 Sec. Appendix B to Subpart B of Part 82--Standard for Recover Equipment

    SAE J1989, Recommended Service Procedure for the Containment of R-
12, as set forth under Appendix A, also applies to this Appendix B.
    SAE J2209, issued June, 1992.

SAE Recommended Practice: CFC-12 (R-12) Extraction Equipment for Mobile 
                   Automotive Air-Conditioning Systems

                                Foreword

    CFCs deplete the stratospheric ozone layer that protects the earth 
against harmful ultraviolet radiation. To reduce the emissions

[[Page 545]]

of CFCs, the 1990 Clean Air Act requires recycle of CFC-12 (R-12) used 
in mobile air-conditioning systems to eliminate system venting during 
service operations. SAE J1990 establishes equipment specifications for 
on-site recovery and reuse of CFCs in mobile air-conditioning systems. 
Establishing extraction equipment specifications for CFC-12 will provide 
service facilities with equipment to assure that venting of refrigerant 
will not occur.

                                1. Scope

    The purpose of this document is to provide equipment specifications 
for CFC-12 (R-12) recovery for recycling on-site or for transport off-
site to a refrigerant reclamation facility that will process it to ARI 
(Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute) standard 700-93 as a 
minimum. It is not acceptable that the refrigerant removed from a mobile 
air-conditioning system, with this equipment, be directly returned to a 
mobile air-conditioning system.
    This information applies to equipment used to service automobiles, 
light trucks, and other vehicles with similar CFC-12 systems.

explain that the machine is approaching the end of filter life. The 
manufacturer must incorporate a lockout when the end of filter life is 
reached.
    4.1.2 The manufacturer shall use an identification system to ensure 
that a new filter has been installed to reset the machine for operation.

                               4.2 Filter

    The equipment shall incorporate an in-line filter that will trap 
particulates of 15 micron spherical diameter or greater.

                           4.3 Scale (if used)

    The scale must maintain accuracy when moved, as per the test in 
Section 10.

                    4.4 Purging Noncondensable Gases

    4.4.1 The equipment shall automatically purge noncondensables 
(NCGs), which are primarily air, if the acceptable level is exceeded. 
NCG removal must be part of the normal operation of the equipment and 
instructions must be provided to enable the task to be accomplished 
within 30 min (to reach the refrigerant purity level specified in SAE 
J2099).
    4.4.2 Refrigerant loss from noncondensable gas purging during the 
testing described in Section 8 shall be minimized by a method that 
initiates a purge when the machine has not been in use for a period long 
enough for air-refrigerant separation in the tank to have occurred.

           4.5 Recharging and Transfer of Recycled Refrigerant

    Recycled refrigerant for recharging and transfer shall be taken from 
the liquid phase only.

                         5. Safety Requirements

    5.1 The equipment must comply with applicable federal, state, and 
local requirements on equipment related to handling HFC-134a material. 
Safety precautions or notices related to safe operation of the equipment 
shall be prominently displayed on the equipment and should also state 
``CAUTION--SHOULD BE OPERATED BY QUALIFIED PERSONNEL.''
    5.2 Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES should any equipment be pressure tested 
or leak tested with air/HFC-134a mixtures.
    Do not use compressed air (shop air) or leak detection in systems 
containing HFC-134a.

                        6. Operating Instructions

    6.1 The equipment manufacturer shall provide a warning in the 
instruction manual regarding the possibility of refrigerant 
contamination in the mobile A/C system being serviced.
    6.1.1 If recovery/recycle equipment has refrigerant identification 
equipment, the refrigerant identification equipment shall meet the 
requirements of SAE J1771.
    6.1.2 Recovery/recycling equipment not having refrigerant 
identification capability shall have instructions in the equipment 
manual covering possible contamination problems to the equipment and the 
contamination of the existing recycled refrigerant in the container in 
the equipment.
    6.2 The equipment manufacturer must provide operating instructions, 
including proper attainment of vehicle system vacuum (i.e., when to stop 
the extraction process), filter/desiccant replacement, and purging of 
noncondensable gases (air). Also to be included are any other necessary 
maintenance procedures, source information for replacement parts and, 
repair and safety precautions.
    6.2.1 The manual shall identify the proper maintaining of hose and 
seals to prevent the addition of excess air, due to leaks, during the 
recovery process, which would increase the NCG level in the recovered 
refrigerant.
    6.3 The equipment must prominently display the manufacturer's name, 
address, the type of refrigerant it is designed to recycle, a service 
telephone number, and the part number for the replacement filter/drier.

                        7. Functional Description

    The ability of the equipment to meet the refrigerant recovery and 
recharge specifications of this section shall be determined by the test 
procedures of Section 10.
    7.1 The equipment must be capable of continuous operation in ambient 
temperatures of 10 [deg]C (50 [deg]F) to 49 [deg]C (120 [deg]F). 
Continuous is defined as completing recovery/recycle and recharge (if 
applicable) operations with no more than a brief reset period between 
vehicles, and shall not include time delays for allowing a system to 
outgas (which shall be part of the recovery period provided by this 
standard). Continuous may include time out for an air purge if 
necessary, although it is understood that extended equipment-off time is 
preferred to allow NCG and refrigerant separation in the supply tank for 
optimum results.
    7.1.1 The equipment shall be capable of removing a minimum of 95.0% 
of the refrigerant from the test system in 30 minutes or less, without 
external heating, or use of any device (such as shields, reflectors, 
special lights, etc.) which could heat components of the system. The 
recovery procedures shall be based on 21 to 24 [deg]C (70 to 75 [deg]F) 
ambient temperature. The test system for qualifying shall be a 1.4 kg 
(3.0 lbs) capacity orifice tube/accumulator system in a 2005 Chevrolet 
Suburban with front and rear A/C, or the test option described in 10.5, 
and shall be determined by accurately weighing the recovery machine with 
the resolution and accuracy of within 3 g (.006 lb) in the range of the 
machine's weight. The laboratory shall maintain records of the vehicle, 
including its VIN (vehicle identification number).
    7.1.2 However, the preceding shall not preclude a brief period of 
engine operation at fast idle (up to 15 minutes, up to 2000 rpm) to 
circulate refrigerant and oil, and provide some engine and warm-up of A/
C refrigeration components. The laboratory shall monitor coolant 
temperature per the vehicle engine coolant temperature sensor, and 
coolant temperature shall not be allowed to exceed 105 [deg]C (221 
[deg]F). The time required shall not be included in the total time of 30 
minutes set forth in 7.1.1.
    7.1.3 The refrigerant that is recovered, following oil separation, 
shall be measured and the quantity displayed, accurate to

[[Page 549]]

within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>30 g (1.0 oz). The equipment must include a 
provision for checking the accuracy, per the requirements of 9.1.
    7.2 During recovery operation, the equipment shall provide overfill 
protection to assure that the liquid fill of the storage container 
(which may be integral or external) does not exceed 80% of the tank's 
rated volume at 21 [deg]C per Department of Transportation (DOT) 
Standard, CFR Title 49, Section 173.304 and the American Society of 
Mechanical Engineers.
    7.3 Portable refillable tanks or containers used in conjunction with 
this equipment must be labeled ``HFC-134a (R-134a),'' meet applicable 
Department of Transportation (DOT) or Underwriters Laboratories (UL) 
Standards, and shall incorporate fittings per SAE J2197.
    7.3.1 The cylinder valve shall comply with the standard for cylinder 
valves, UL 1769.
    7.3.2 The pressure relief device shall comply with the Pressure 
Relief Device Standard Part 1--Cylinders for Compressed Gases, CGA 
Pamphlet S-1.1.
    7.3.3 The tank assembly shall be marked to indicate the first retest 
date, which shall be 5 years after the date of manufacture. The marking 
shall indicate that retest must be performed every subsequent 5 years. 
SAE J2296 provides an inspection procedure. The marking shall be in 
letters at least 6 mm (\1/4\ in) high.
    7.3.4 ASME tanks as defined in UL-1963 may be used and are exempt 
from the retest requirements.
    7.3.5 If the machine is designed for recharging, and the marketer 
permits use of a non-refillable refrigerant tank, the machine shall 
include a way to ensure refrigerant remaining in the tank (called the 
``heel'') to no more than 2% of tank rated capacity when the tank is 
indicated to be empty. This may be done by the machine marketer as 
follows:
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Specify a non-venting procedure, to minimize the 
amount of unused refrigerant remaining in the tank. The machine shall 
include any devices required for the procedure, other than ordinary 
service shop tools and supplies, and include in the operator's manual, 
any instructions.
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Provide an automatic or (with instructions in the 
operator's manual) semi-automatic non-venting procedure with the 
machine.
    The laboratory shall test for the 2% capability. For testing 
purposes it may use a refillable tank, minimum 15 lb capacity (6.8 kg) 
containing a minimum of 7.5 lbs (3.4 kg) refrigerant. The test is as 
follows:
    a. Weigh the tank at the start of the test, on a scale accurate to 
plus/minus 3 grams, to ensure it contains sufficient refrigerant.
    b. Operate the machine to remove refrigerant from the tank, charging 
into a holding container until the tank is indicated to be empty. 
Continue with the marketer's recommended procedure for the 2% 
capability.
    c. Weigh the tank, on a scale accurate to plus/minus 3 grams.
    d. Using the recovery compressor and/or a vacuum pump, draw the tank 
into a vacuum of 9 to 10 inches Mercury (225 to 250 mm Mercury). The 
tank must hold that vacuum with a decay of less than 10% in 10 minutes. 
If vacuum decays 10% or more, the procedure shall be repeated as 
necessary to ensure the tank is empty.
    e. Weigh the tank on a scale accurate to plus/minus 3 grams. The 
difference in weight from Steps 3 to 5 shall be within 2% of the weight 
of the amount of refrigerant that is the tanks rated capacity.
    f. This test may be performed at the conclusion of testing in 10.4 
or 10.5. If the machine passes or has passed all other testing in this 
standard, the marketer may make modifications in procedure and/or 
machine operation and retest once at a later date, within 90 days. If 
the machine fails the retest, the machine must be completely retested 
per this standard, or may be certified per the following alternative. 
The marketer of the machine may specify use of a non-refillable 
refrigerant tank that provides for recycling and/or disposal of the 
residual refrigerant, in either case in a manner that does not vent. Or 
the marketer may exclude use of a one-way container, in the machine's 
operating instructions.
    7.4 All flexible hoses must comply with SAE J2196.
    7.5 Service hoses must have shutoff devices located at the 
connection point to the system being serviced. Any hoses or lines 
connected to refrigerant containers on or in the machine also shall have 
shutoff devices at the connection points, so that the containers may be 
changed without loss of refrigerant. A tank that is a permanent 
installation is exempt from this requirement.
    7.6 The equipment shall separate oil from the refrigerant, measure 
the amount accurate to 20 ml (0.7 oz.), so the technician has an 
accurate basis for adding oil to the system.
    7.6.1 This statement shall be predominately identified in the 
equipment service manual.

    Note: Use only new lubricant to replace the amount removed during 
the recycling process. Used lubricant should be discarded per applicable 
federal, state and local requirements.

                               8. Testing

    This test procedure and its requirements are to be used to determine 
the ability of the recycling equipment to adequately recycle 
contaminated refrigerant.

[[Page 550]]

    8.1 The equipment shall be able to clean the contaminated 
refrigerant in Sec. 8.3 to the purity level defined in SAE J2099.
    8.2 The equipment shall be operated in accordance with the 
manufacturer's operating instructions.

                8.3 Contaminated HFC-134a (R-134a) Sample

    8.3.1 The standard contaminated refrigerant shall consist of liquid 
HFC-134a with 1300 ppm (by weight) moisture (equivalent to saturation at 
38 [deg]C, 100 [deg]F), 45000 ppm (by weight) HFC-134a compatible 
lubricant, and 1000 ppm (by weight) of noncondensable gases (air).
    8.3.1.1 The HFC-134a compatible lubricant referred to in 8.3.1, 
shall be polyalkylene glycol (PAG), ISO 100 such as UCLN or PAG ISO 46-
55, such as Idemitsu or equivalent, which shall contain no more than 
1000 ppm by weight of moisture.
    8.3.1.2 Although the test lubricant is a PAG, to conform to that 
used in the test vehicle system, the equipment manufacturer also shall 
ensure that it is compatible with polyol ester lubricant, such as ND 11 
as used in electrically driven compressors in some hybrid vehicles.

                             8.4 Test Cycle

    8.4.1 The equipment must be preconditioned by processing 13.6 kg (30 
lb) of the standard contaminated HFC-134a at an ambient of 21 to 24 
[deg]C (70 to 75 [deg]F) before starting the test cycle. 1.13 kg (2.56 
lb) samples are to be processed at 5 min intervals. The test fixture, 
depicted in Figure 1, shall be operated at 21 to 24 [deg]C (70 to 75 
[deg]F).

[[Page 551]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR09NO07.001

    8.4.2 Following the preconditioning procedure per 8.4.1, 18.2 kg (40 
lb) of standard contaminated HFC-134a are to be processed by the 
equipment.

                         8.5 Sample Requirements

    8.5.1 Samples of the standard contaminated refrigerant from 8.3.1 
shall be processed as required in 8.6 and shall be analyzed

[[Page 552]]

after said processing as defined in 8.7, 8.8, and 8.9. Note exception 
for noncondensable gas determination in 8.9.4.

                     8.6 Equipment Operating Ambient

    8.6.1 The HFC-134a is to be cleaned to the purity level, as defined 
in SAE J2099, with the equipment operating in a stable ambient of 10, 
21, and 49 [deg]C (50, 70 and 120 [deg]F) while processing the samples 
as defined in 8.4.

               8.7 Quantitative Determination of Moisture

    8.7.1 The recycled liquid phase sample of HFC-134a shall be analyzed 
for moisture content via Karl Fischer coulometric titration, or an 
equivalent method. The Karl Fischer apparatus is an instrument for 
precise determination of small amounts of water dissolved in liquid and/
or gas samples.
    8.7.2 In conducting this test, a weighed sample of 30 to 130 g is 
vaporized directly into the Karl Fischer anolyte. A coulometric 
titration is conducted and the results are reported as parts per million 
moisture (weight).
    8.8 Determination of Percent Lubricant 8.8.1 The amount of lubricant 
in the recycled HFC-134a sample shall be determined via gravimetric 
analysis. The methodology must account for the hygroscopicity of the 
lubricant.
    8.8.2 Following venting of noncondensable gases in accordance with 
the manufacturer's operating instructions, the refrigerant container 
shall be shaken for 5 min prior to extracting samples for testing.
    8.8.3 A weighed sample of 175 to 225 g of liquid HFC-134a is allowed 
to evaporate at room temperature. The percent lubricant is calculated 
from weights of the original sample and the residue remaining after 
evaporation.

              8.9 Noncondensable Gases--Testing for Amount

    8.9.1 The amount of noncondensable gases shall be determined by gas 
chromatography. A sample of vaporized refrigerant liquid shall be 
separated and analyzed by gas chromatography. A Porapak Q column at 130 
[deg]C (266 [deg]F) and a hot wire detector may be used for the 
analysis.
    8.9.2 This test shall be conducted on liquid phase samples of 
recycled refrigerant taken from a full container as defined in 7.2 
within 30 min following the proper venting of noncondensable gases.
    8.9.3 The liquid phase samples in 8.9.2 shall be vaporized 
completely prior to gas chromatographic analysis.
    8.9.4 This test shall be conducted at 10 and 49 [deg]C (50 and 120 
[deg]F) and may be performed in conjunction with the testing defined in 
8.6. The equipment shall process at least 13.6 kg (30 lb) of standard 
contaminated refrigerant for this test.
    8.9.5 The equipment shall be capable of charging refrigerant into 
systems with various lubrication types and shall deliver less than 1% by 
weight residual oil during system charge if the machine permits oil 
charging with refrigerant (due to residual oil in the service hoses and 
recovery unit refrigerant circuit from prior recovery, diagnostics and 
oil injection. This shall be determined during SAE J2099 testing.)

                        9. Recharging the System

    9.1 It is the responsibility of the equipment manufacturer to ensure 
that the vacuum removal performance leaves the system 98% free of NCGs 
before recharging, following recovery and recycle under the provisions 
of this document.
    The equipment must be capable of both indicating and recharging the 
system to within 15 g (0.50 oz) of vehicle manufacturer's 
specifications. The laboratory shall test for this capability by 
choosing a charge amount that is within the range of the vehicle 
manufacturer's specifications. The equipment must indicate and charge 
the system with that chosen amount, within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>15 g 
(0.5 oz).
    Example: If 500 g is chosen, the actual and indicated charge must be 
485 to 515 g, with any difference between actual and indicated charge 
within the laboratory scale accuracy requirements of this standard. If a 
scale is used in the machine, the equipment manufacturer shall provide a 
method or service for the technician to check scale accuracy, and 
include any necessary accuracy-checking device (such as a calibration 
weight(s)) with the machine. If a mass flow system is used for charge 
determination, it must maintain accuracy equal to the 15 g (0.50 oz) 
specification. The equipment manufacturer shall provide a method for 
checking accuracy and include any necessary accuracy testing device(s) 
with the machine. If the accuracy testing device(s) for a scale or mass 
flow machine includes a consumable, the manufacturer shall include a 
quantity of replacement or refill devices for five years of periodic 
testing as recommended.
    9.2 If any other system is used for charge determination, such as a 
positive displacement pump, the equipment manufacturer shall provide a 
method and any needed device(s) to check accuracy that is/are 
appropriate for its method of operation, including any temperature-
compensating trim if used.

 10. Equipment Test Procedure by Laboratory for Recovery/Recycling and 
                 Recovery/Recycling/Recharging Machines

    10.1 Preliminary: Ambient (in shop) temperature shall be 21 to 24 
[deg]C (70 to 75 [deg]F). Test vehicle shall be ``overnight cold'' (not 
run for at least eight hours).
    10.2 The machine must have a self-contained provision for checking 
accuracy of

[[Page 553]]

the indicated amount of refrigerant recovered in liquid or vapor or 
mixture form(s) from a vehicle system and (if applicable) charged into a 
vehicle, and adjusting if necessary, to meet requirements of 9.1, 9.2. 
Therefore: If the machine uses a scale for that purpose, check the 
accuracy of that scale and make any adjustment if necessary. If an 
alternative method of measuring refrigerant is used, follow the 
equipment manufacturer's procedure for ensuring accuracy. Next, move the 
machine, such as by rolling it, along the floor, a minimum of 20 feet 
(6.1 meters) within 10 seconds. Follow with the test procedure in 10.3, 
then 10.4 or 10.5.

                           10.3 Test Procedure

    If desired, this test procedure may be preceded by engine/system 
operation for up to 15 minutes, up to 2000 rpm.
    1. You must start with an empty system, using this method: (a) 
Operate machine to recover refrigerant, per equipment manufacturer's 
instructions. (b) Deep-vacuum system to a minimum of 710 mm (28 in) of 
mercury. (c) Monitor vacuum for decay, checking every 20 minutes. If 
decay exceeds 75 mm (3 in), deep vacuum the system again. When system 
holds 710 mm (28 in) 75 mm (3 in) of mercury vacuum for three hours, it 
is considered empty.
    2. Place machine on a platform scale with the capacity to weigh the 
recovery/recycle/recharge machine, and with the resolution and accuracy 
of within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3 g (.006 lb) in the range of the 
machine's weight. Weight should include the machine's service hoses 
draped over the machine, and with the machine's oil reservoir removed. 
If necessary to add oil to vehicle system as a result of a system 
operation preparatory to the recovery process, inject the needed 
quantity through the service valve at this time.
    3. Record weight of machine in as weight A.
    4. Reconnect service hoses to the test vehicle.
    5. Follow the equipment manufacturer's specified procedure for 
charging the vehicle manufacturer's recommended amount of refrigerant 
into the system. Note: if this does not apply to the machine under test, 
i.e. a recovery/recycling only machine, the use of charging equipment 
that meets this standard and the platform scale shall be used to verify 
the accuracy of the charge.
    6. Disconnect the service hoses from the test vehicle and drape them 
on the machine. Check and record the weight of the machine. Record this 
weight as weight B. The difference between weight A and weight B should 
be equal to the recommended charge that was installed per the machine's 
display, within 15 g (0.5 oz). If the difference is greater than 15 g 
(<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3 g), the machine fails the charge accuracy test, 
and no other tests shall be performed at that time. The manufacturer 
must document changes made to improve accuracy and furnish them to the 
laboratory prior to a new test. Exception: If the maximum deviation is 
no more than a total of 20 g, the calibration of the scale or other 
measuring system may be rechecked and readjusted once, and the entire 
test repeated just once.

                   10.4 Recovery Test Using a Vehicle

    1. Following a successful system charge, the system and engine shall 
be run for 15 minutes at 2000 rpm to circulate oil and refrigerant, 
following which engine and system shall rest for eight hours. Then the 
laboratory may begin the recovery test. If the machine manufacturer 
specifies, operate the engine/system for up to 15 minutes, at up to 2000 
rpm, then shut off engine/system.
    2. If the machine has an automatic air purge, disable it. Check the 
weight of the machine with the platform scale (service hoses draped over 
machine, oil reservoir removed). Record the number as Weight C. 
Reinstall oil reservoir if it had been removed in the recovery 
procedure.
    3. Start timer. Connect service hoses to system of test vehicle and 
perform recovery per the equipment manufacturer's instructions. The 
vehicle system service valves' cores must remain in the fittings for 
this procedure.
    4. When recovery is completed, including from service hoses if that 
is part of the recommended procedure, disconnect hoses and drape over 
machine. Stop timer. The elapsed time shall be 30.0 minutes or less. If 
it is in excess of this time, the machine fails the test and no retest 
is allowed. The manufacturer must document changes made to the machine 
to improve its performance before a new test is allowed, and furnish 
them to the laboratory.
    5. If the recovery is completed in no more than the 30.0 minutes, 
measure the oil level in the reservoir, remove the reservoir and then 
determine the amount of refrigerant recovered, as detailed in Nos. 6 and 
7: As measured by the machine and also by noting the weight of the 
platform scale, which shall be recorded as Weight D.
    6. The platform scale shall indicate that a minimum of 95% of the 
amount charged into the system has been recovered. If the platform scale 
indicates a lower percentage has been recovered, the machine fails the 
recovery test.
    7. The machine display shall indicate that a minimum of 95.0% of the 
amount charged into the system has been recovered, within a tolerance of 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>30 g (1 oz) when compared with the platform scale 
(Weight D minus Weight C). The 30 g (1 oz) tolerance may produce a 
machine display reading that is below the 95.0% recovery. If a greater 
difference between machine and platform scale occurs, the machine fails 
the recovery test.

[[Page 554]]

                 10.5 Recovery Test Fixture Test Option

    If an equipment manufacturer chooses, as an alternative to the 
actual vehicle, it may certify to SAE J2788 with a laboratory fixture 
that is composed entirely of all the original equipment parts of a 
single model year for the 3.0 lb capacity front/rear A/C system in the 
2005-07 Chevrolet Suburban. All parts must be those OE-specified for one 
model year system and no parts may be eliminated or bypassed from the 
chosen system, or reproduced by a non-OE source. No parts may be added 
and/or relocated from the OE position in the 2005-07 Suburban. No parts 
may be modified in any way that could affect system performance for 
testing under this standard, except adding refrigerant line bends and/or 
loops to make the system more compact. Reducing the total length of the 
lines, however, is not permitted. The fixture system shall be powered by 
an electric motor, run at a speed not to exceed 2000 rpm, and for this 
test option, no system warm-up or equivalent procedure may be used. The 
certifying laboratory shall maintain records of all parts purchased, 
including invoices and payments. The assembly of the parts shall, as an 
outside-the-vehicle package, duplicate the OE system and its routing, 
including bends, except for permitted additions of bends and/or loops in 
refrigerant lines. Aside from the absence of engine operation and the 
limitations posed by the standard and the use of the electric motor, the 
test shall otherwise be the same as the test on the Suburban, including 
test temperature.

Sec. Appendix D to Subpart B of Part 82--SAE J2810 Standard for Recovery 
                 Only Equipment for HFC-134a Refrigerant

                                Foreword

    This Appendix establishes the specific minimum equipment 
requirements for the recovery of HFC-134a that has been directly removed 
from, motor vehicle air-conditioning systems.

                                1. Scope

    The purpose of this SAE Standard is to provide minimum performance 
and operating feature requirements for the recovery of HFC-134a (R-134a) 
refrigerant to be returned to a refrigerant reclamation facility that 
will process it to the appropriate ARI 700 Standard or allow for 
recycling of the recovered refrigerant to SAE J2788 specifications by 
using SAE J2788-certified equipment. It is not acceptable that the 
refrigerant removed from a mobile air-conditioning (A/C) system with 
this equipment be directly returned to a mobile A/C system.
    This information applies to equipment used to service automobiles, 
light trucks, and other vehicles with similar HFC-134a (R-134a) A/C 
systems.
    1.1 Improved refrigerant recovery equipment is required to ensure 
adequate refrigerant recovery to reduce emissions and provide for 
accurate recharging of mobile air conditioning systems. Therefore, 12 
months following the publication date of this standard, it supersedes 
SAE J1732.

                              2. References

                       2.1 Applicable Publications

    The following publications form a part of the specification to the 
extent specified herein. Unless otherwise indicated, the latest revision

                         6. Function Description

    6.1 The equipment must be capable of continuous operation in ambient 
temperatures of 10 [deg]C (50 [deg]F) to 49 [deg]C (120 [deg]F). 
Continuous is defined as completing recovery operation with no more than 
a brief reset between servicing vehicles, and shall not include time 
delays for allowing a system to outgas (which shall be part of the 
recovery period provided by this standard).
    6.1.1 The equipment shall demonstrate ability to recovery a minimum 
of 95.0% of the refrigerant from the test vehicle in 30.0 minutes or 
less, without prior engine operation (for previous eight hours minimum), 
external heating or use of any device (such as shields, reflectors, 
special lights, etc.), which could heat components of the system.

[[Page 556]]

The recovery procedure shall be based on a test at 21 [deg]C to 24 
[deg]C (70 [deg]F to 75 [deg]F) ambient temperature. The test system for 
qualifying shall be a 1.4 kg (3.0 lbs) capacity orifice tube/accumulator 
system in a 2005-07 Chevrolet Suburban with front and rear A/C or the 
test option described in section 9.
    6.1.2 The equipment shall demonstrate ability to recover a minimum 
of 85% of the refrigerant from the test vehicle or system of 6.1.1. in 
30.0 minutes or less, at an ambient temperature of 10 [deg]C to 13 
[deg]C (50 [deg]F to 55 [deg]F), subject to the same restrictions 
regarding engine operation and external heating.
    6.1.3 During recovery operation, the equipment shall provide 
overfill protection so that the liquid fill of the storage container 
does not exceed 80% of the tank's rated volume at 21 [deg]C (70 [deg]F). 
This will ensure that the container meets Department of Transportation 
(DOT) Standard, CFR Title 49, section 173.304 and the American Society 
of Mechanical Engineers.
    6.1.4 Portable refillable tanks or containers used in conjunction 
with this equipment must be labeled ``HFC-134a (R-134a) and meet 
applicable Department of Transportation (DOT) or Underwriters 
Laboratories (UL) Standards, and incorporate fittings per SAE J2197.

Relief Device Standard Part 1--Cylinders for Compressed Gasses CGA 
Pamphlet S-1.1.
    6.1.7 The tank assembly shall be marked to indicate the first retest 
date, which shall be five years from the date of manufacture. The 
marking shall indicate that retest must be performed every subsequent 
five years. SAE J2296 provides an inspection procedure. The marking 
shall be in letters at least 6 mm (0.25 in) high. If ASME tanks, as 
defined in UL-1963, are used, they are exempt from the retest 
requirements.
    6.2 If the marketer permits use of a refillable refrigerant tank, a 
method must be provided (including any necessary fittings) for transfer 
to a system that ensures proper handling (recycling or other, 
environmentally-legal disposal).
    Restricting the equipment to use of non-refillable tanks eliminates 
compliance with this provision.
    6.3 Prior to testing under this standard, the equipment must be 
preconditioned with a minimum of 13.6 kg of the standard contaminated 
HFC-134a (R-134a) at an ambient of 21 [deg]C before starting the test 
cycle. Sample amounts are not to exceed 1.13 kg with sample amounts to 
be repeated every 5 min. The test fixture shown in Figure 1 shall be 
operated at 21 [deg]C. Contaminated HFC-134a (R-134a) samples shall be 
processed at ambient temperatures of 10 [deg]C and 49 [deg]C (50 [deg]F 
to 120 [deg]F), without the equipment shutting down due to any safety 
devices employed in this equipment.
    6.3.1 Contaminated HFC-134a (R-134a) sample shall be standard 
contaminated HFC-134a (R-134a) refrigerant, 13.6 kg sample size, 
consisting of liquid HFC-134a (R-134a) with 1300 ppm (by weight) 
moisture at 21 [deg]C (70 [deg]F) and 45 000 ppm (by weight) of oil 
(polyalkylene glycol oil with 46-160 cst viscosity at 40 [deg]C) and 
1000 ppm by weight of noncondensable gases (air).
    6.3.2 Portable refillable containers used in conjunction with this 
equipment must meet applicable DOT Standards. The color of the container 
must be blue with a yellow top to indicate the container holds used HFC-
134a (R-134a) refrigerant. The container must be permanently marked on 
the outside surface in black print at least 20 mm high, ``CONTAMINATED 
HFC-134a (R-134a)--DO NOT USE, MUST BE REPROCESSED.''

                         Figure 1--Test Fixture

    6.3.3 The portable refillable container shall have a 1/2 in ACME 
thread.
    6.4 Additional Storage Tank Requirements.
    6.4.1 The cylinder valve shall comply with UL 1769.
    6.4.2 The pressure relief device shall comply with CGA Pamphlet S-
1.1.
    6.5 All flexible hoses must meet SAE J2196 for service hoses.
    6.6 Service hoses must have shutoff devices located at the 
connection points to the system being serviced to minimize introduction 
of noncondensable gases into the recovery equipment during connection 
and the release of the refrigerant during disconnection.
    6.7 The equipment must be able to separate the lubricant from 
recovered refrigerant and accurately indicate the amount removed from 
the simulated automotive system during processing in 20 mL (0.7 fl oz) 
units.
    6.7.1 The purpose of indicating the amount of lubricant removed is 
to ensure that a proper amount of new lubricant is returned to the 
mobile A/C system for compressor lubrication, if the system is to be 
charged with equipment meeting SAE J2788.
    6.7.2 Refrigerant dissolved in this lubricant must be accounted for 
to prevent lubricant overcharge of the mobile A/C system.
    6.8 The equipment must be capable of continuous operation in ambient 
temperatures of 10 [deg]C to 49 [deg]C (50 [deg]F to120 [deg]F) and 
comply with 6.1 to 6.4 of this standard.
    6.9 For test validation, the equipment is to be operated according 
to the manufacturer's instructions.
    7. Test Procedure A at 21 [deg]C to 24 [deg]C (70 [deg]F to 75 
[deg]F).

system--1.4 kg/ 3.0 lb) or laboratory fixture per section 10.5 of SAE

[[Page 557]]

J2788, shall be prepared as for SAE J2788, section 10.3, following Steps 
1, 2, 3, 4, and then the following:
    7.1 Using a machine certified to SAE J2788 and with the machine on a 
platform scale with accuracy to within plus/minus 3.0 grams at the 
weight of the machine, charge the system to the vehicle manufacturer's 
recommended amount of refrigerant (1.4 kg-3.0 lb). The actual charge 
amount per the reading on the platform scale shall be used as the basis 
for the recovery efficiency of the recovery-only machine being tested to 
this standard. Run the engine (or operate test fixture with electric 
motor) for up to 15 minutes at up to 2000 rpm to circulate oil and 
refrigerant. The system then must rest for eight hours.
    7.2 Place the recovery machine on the platform scale and record the 
weight with the hoses draped over the machine. Ambient temperature shall 
be within the range of 21 [deg]C to 24 [deg]C (70 [deg]F to 75 [deg]F) 
for this test, which shall be performed without the immediately prior 
engine operation permitted by SAE J2788, Section 10.3, Step No.1. The 
only permitted engine operation is as specified in 7.1.
    7.3 Start the timer. Connect the service hoses to the system of the 
test vehicle and perform the recovery per the equipment manufacturer's 
instructions. The vehicle system's service valve cores must remain in 
the fittings for this procedure.
    7.4 When recovery is completed, including from the service hoses if 
that is part of the recommended procedure, disconnect the hoses and 
drape over the machine. Stop the timer. The elapsed time shall be no 
more than 30 minutes.
    7.5 Remove the oil reservoir, empty and reinstall. The platform 
scale shall indicate that a minimum of 95.0% of the refrigerant has been 
recovered, based on the charge amount indicated by the platform scale. 
If the machine has recovered the minimum of 95.0% within the 30.0 
minutes, the next test shall be performed. If it fails this test, the 
marketer of the equipment must document changes to the equipment to 
upgrade performance before a retest is allowed. If it passes, the 
laboratory can proceed to Test Procedure B-10 [deg]C to 13 [deg]C (50 
[deg]F to 55 [deg]F).
    8. Test Procedure B at 10 [deg]C to 13 [deg]C (50 [deg]F to 55 
[deg]F).
    The test vehicle (2005-2007 Chevrolet Suburban front/rear A/C system 
(1.4 kg/3.0 lb) or test fixture per section 10.5 of SAE J2788, shall be 
prepared as per 7.0 and 7.1 of this standard, and then the following:
    8.1 Place the recovery machine on the platform scale and record the 
weight with the hoses draped over the machine.
    Ambient temperature at this time shall be no higher than 10 [deg]C 
to13 [deg]C (50 [deg]F to 55 [deg]F).
    8.2 Start the timer. Connect the service hoses to the system of the 
test vehicle and perform the recovery per the equipment manufacturer's 
instructions. This also shall be performed without the immediately prior 
engine operation permitted by SAE J2788, section 10.4, Step No. 1. The 
vehicle system's service valve cores must remain in the fittings for 
this procedure.
    8.3 When recovery is completed, including from the service hoses if 
that is part of the recommended procedure, disconnect the hoses and 
drape over the machine. Stop the timer. The elapsed time shall be no 
more than 30 minutes.
    8.4 Remove the oil reservoir, empty and reinstall. The platform 
scale shall indicate that a minimum of 85.0% of the refrigerant has been 
recovered, based on the charge amount indicated by the platform scale. 
If the machine has recovered the minimum of 85.0% within the 30 minutes, 
it has passed the test procedure and if it meets all other requirements 
of this standard, it is certified.

                             9. Test Option

    As in SAE J2788, Section 10.5, as an alternative to a 2005-2007 
Chevrolet Suburban with rear A/C (1.4 kg-3.0 lb) system, a laboratory 
test fixture may be used to certify to SAE J2810 the fixture must be 
composed entirely of all the original equipment parts of a single model 
year for the 1.4 kg (3.0 lb) capacity system. All parts must be those 
OE-specified for one model year system and no parts may be eliminated or 
bypassed from the chosen system or reproduced from a non-OE source. No 
parts may be added and/or relocated from the OE position in the 2005-07 
Suburban. No parts may be modified in any way that could affect system 
performance for testing under this standard, except adding refrigerant 
line bends and/or loops to make the system more compact. Reducing the 
total length of the lines, however, is not permitted.
    The fixture systems for this standard shall not be powered by an 
electric motor during recovery, although a motor can be used, run at a 
speed not to exceed 2000 rpm, as part of the preparatory process, 
including installation of the charge.

                        7. Functional Description

    7.1 General
    7.1.1 The equipment must be capable of ensuring recovery of the CFC-
12 and HFC-134a from the system being serviced, by reducing the system 
to a minimum of 102 mm of mercury below atmospheric pressure (i.e., 
vacuum).
    7.1.2 The equipment must be compatible with leak detection material 
that may be present in the mobile A/C system.
    7.2 Shut Off Device
    7.2.1 To prevent overcharge, the equipment must be equipped to 
protect the tank used to store the recycled refrigerant with a shutoff 
device and a mechanical pressure relief valve.
    7.3 Storage Tanks
    7.3.1 Portable refillable tanks or containers shall be supplied with 
this equipment and must be labeled ``HFC-134a'' or ``CFC-12'' as 
appropriate, meet applicable Department of Transportation (DOT) or 
NRTL's Standards and be adaptable to existing refrigerant service and 
charging equipment.
    7.3.2 The cylinder valve shall comply with the Standard for Cylinder 
Valves, UL 1769.
    7.3.3 The pressure relief device shall comply with the Pressure 
Relief Device Standard Part 1--Cylinders for Compressed Gases, CGA 
Pamphlet S-1.1.
    7.3.4 The tank assembly shall be marked to indicate the first retest 
date, which shall be 5 years after the date of manufacture. The marking 
shall indicate that retest must be performed every subsequent 5 years. 
The marking shall be in letters at least 6 mm high.
    7.4 Overfill Protection
    7.4.1 During operation, the equipment must provide overfill 
protection to assure that during filling or transfer, the tank or

Society of Mechanical Engineers.

[[Page 560]]

    7.5 Hoses and Connections
    7.5.1 Separate inlet and outlet hoses with fittings and separate 
connections shall be provided for each refrigerant circuit.
    7.5.2 All flexible hoses and fittings must meet SAE J2196 (for CFC-
12) and SAE J2197 (for HFC-134a).
    7.5.3 Service hoses must have shutoff devices located within 30 cm 
of the connection point to the system being serviced.
    7.6 Lubricant Separation
    7.6.1 The equipment must be able to separate the lubricant from the 
removed refrigerant and accurately indicate the amount of lubricant 
removed during the process, in 30 mL (1 fl oz) units. Refrigerant 
dissolves in lubricant and, as a result, increases the volume of the 
recovered lubricant sample. This creates the illusion that more 
lubricant has been recovered that actually has been. The equipment 
lubricant measuring system must take into account such dissolved 
refrigerant removed from the A/C system being serviced to prevent 
overcharging the vehicle system with lubricant.

    (Note: Use only new lubricant to replace the amount removed the 
recycling process. Used lubricant should be discarded per applicable 
federal, state and local requirements.)

    7.6.2 The equipment must be provided with some means, such as a 
lockout device, which will prevent initiation of the recovery operation 
after switching to the other refrigerant, if the lubricant has not been 
drained from the oil separator.

Sec. 82.106  Warning statement requirements.

    (a) Required warning statements. Unless otherwise exempted by this 
subpart, each container or product identified in Sec. 82.102 (a) or (b) 
shall bear the following warning statement, meeting the requirements of 
this subpart for placement and form:

    WARNING: Contains [or Manufactured with, if applicable] [insert name 
of substance], a substance which harms public health and environment by 
destroying ozone in the upper atmosphere.

    (b) Exemptions from warning label requirement. The following 
products need not bear a warning label:
    (1) Products containing trace quantities of a controlled substance 
remaining as a residue or impurity due to a chemical reaction, and where 
the controlled substance serves no useful purpose in or for the product 
itself. However, if such product was manufactured using the controlled 
substance, the product is required to be labeled as a ``product 
manufactured with'' the controlled substance, unless otherwise exempted;

[[Page 573]]

    (2) Containers containing a controlled substance in which trace 
quantities of that controlled substance remain as a residue or impurity;
    (3) Waste containing controlled substances or blends of controlled 
substances bound for discard;
    (4) Products manufactured using methyl chloroform or CFC-113 by 
persons who can demonstrate and certify a 95% reduction in overall usage 
from their 1990 calendar year usage of methyl chloroform or CFC-113 as 
solvents during a twelve (12) month period ending within sixty (60) days 
of such certification or during the most recently completed calendar 
year. In calculating such reduction, persons may subtract from 
quantities used those quantities for which they possess accessible data 
that establishes the amount of methyl chloroform or CFC-113 transformed. 
Such subtraction must be performed for both the applicable twelve month 
period and the 1990 calendar year. If at any time future usage exceeds 
the 95% reduction, all products manufactured with methyl chloroform or 
CFC-113 as solvents by that person must be labeled immediately. No 
person may qualify for this exemption after May 15, 1994;
    (5) Products intended only for export outside of the United States 
shall not be considered ``products introduced into interstate commerce'' 
provided such products are clearly designated as intended for export 
only;
    (6) Products that are otherwise not subject to the requirements of 
this subpart that are being repaired, using a process that uses a 
controlled substance.
    (7) Products, processes, or substitute chemicals undergoing research 
and development, by which a controlled substance is used. Such products 
must be labeled when they are introduced into interstate commerce.
    (c) Interference with other required labeling information. The 
warning statement shall not interfere with, detract from, or mar any 
labeling information required on the labeling by federal or state law.


<R05>
Sec. 82.108  Placement of warning statement.

    The warning statement shall be placed so as to satisfy the 
requirement of the Act that the warning statement be ``clearly legible 
and conspicuous.'' The warning statement is clearly legible and 
conspicuous if it appears with such prominence and conspicuousness as to 
render it likely to be read and understood by consumers under normal 
conditions of purchase. Such placement includes, but is not limited to, 
the following:
    (a) Display panel placement. For any affected product or container 
that has a display panel that is normally viewed by the purchaser at the 
time of the purchase, the warning statement described in Sec. 82.106 
may appear on any such display panel of the affected product or 
container such that it is ``clearly legible and conspicuous'' at the 
time of the purchase. If the warning statement appears on the principal 
display panel or outer packaging of any such affected product or 
container, the warning statement shall qualify as ``clearly legible and 
conspicuous,'' as long as the label also fulfills all other requirements 
of this subpart and is not obscured by any outer packaging, as required 
by paragraph (b) of this section. The warning statement need not appear 
on such display panel if either:
    (1) The warning statement appears on the outer packaging of the 
product or container, consistent with paragraph (b) of this section, and 
is clearly legible and conspicuous; or
    (2) The warning statement is placed in a manner consistent with 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) Outer packaging. If the product or container is normally 
packaged, wrapped, or otherwise covered when viewed by the purchaser at 
the time of the purchase the warning statement described in Sec. 82.106 
shall appear on any outer packaging, wrapping or other covering used in 
the retail display of the product or container, such that the warning 
statement is clearly legible and conspicuous at the time of the 
purchase. If the outer packaging has a display panel that is normally 
viewed by

[[Page 574]]

the purchaser at the time of the purchase, the warning statement shall 
appear on such display panel. If the warning statement so appears on 
such product's or container's outer packaging, it need not appear on the 
surface of the product or container, as long as the statement also 
fulfills all other requirements of this subpart. The warning statement 
need not appear on such outer packaging if either:
    (1) The warning statement appears on the surface of the product or 
container, consistent with paragraph (a) of this section, and is clearly 
legible and conspicuous through any outer packaging, wrapping or other 
covering used in display; or
    (2) The warning statement is placed in a manner consistent with 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Alternative placement. The warning statement may be placed on a 
hang tag, tape, card, sticker, invoice, bill of lading, supplemental 
printed material, or similar overlabeling that is securely attached to 
the container, product, outer packaging or display case, or accompanies 
the product containing or manufactured with a controlled substance or a 
container containing class I or class II substances through its sale to 
the consumer or ultimate consumer. For prescription medical products 
that have been found to be essential for patient health by the Food and 
Drug Administration, the warning statement may be placed in supplemental 
printed material intended to be read by the prescribing physician, as 
long as the following statement is placed on the product, its packaging, 
or supplemental printed material intended to be read by the patient: 
``This product contains [insert name of substance], a substance which 
harms the environment by depleting ozone in the upper atmosphere.'' In 
any case, the warning statement must be clearly legible and conspicuous 
at the time of the purchase.
    (d) Products not viewed by the purchaser at the time of purchase. 
Where the purchaser of a product cannot view a product, its packaging or 
alternative labeling such that the warning statement is clearly legible 
and conspicuous at the time of purchase, as specified under paragraphs 
(a), (b), or (c) of this section, the warning statement may be placed in 
the following manner:
    (1) Where promotional printed material is prepared for display or 
distribution, the warning statement may be placed on such promotional 
printed material such that it is clearly legible and conspicuous at the 
time of purchase; or
    (2) The warning statement may be placed on the product, on its outer 
packaging, or on alternative labeling, consistent with paragraphs (a), 
(b), or (c) of this section, such that the warning statement is clearly 
legible and conspicuous at the time of product delivery, if the product 
may be returned by the purchaser at or after the time of delivery or if 
the purchase is not complete until the time of delivery (e.g., products 
delivered C.O.D.).


<R05>
Sec. 82.110  Form of label bearing warning statement.

    (a) Conspicuousness and contrast. The warning statement shall appear 
in conspicuous and legible type by typography, layout, and color with 
other printed matter on the label. The warning statement shall appear in 
sharp contrast to any background upon which it appears. Examples of 
combinations of colors which may not satisfy the proposed requirement 
for sharp contrast are: black letters on a dark blue or dark green 
background, dark red letters on a light red background, light red 
letters on a reflective silver background, and white letters on a light 
gray or tan background.
    (b) Name of substance. The name of the class I or class II substance 
to be inserted into the warning statement shall be the standard chemical 
name of the substance as listed in 40 CFR part 82, appendix A to subpart 
A, except that:
    (1) The acronym ``CFC'' may be substituted for 
``chlorofluorocarbon.''
    (2) The acronym ``HCFC'' may be substituted for 
``hydrochlorofluorocarbon.''
    (3) The term ``1,1,1-trichloroethane'' may be substituted for 
``methyl chloroform.''
    (c) Combined statement for multiple class I substances. If a 
container containing or a product contains or is manufactured with, more 
than one

[[Page 575]]

class I or class II substance, the warning statement may include the 
names of all of the substances in a single warning statement, provided 
that the combined statement clearly distinguishes which substances the 
container or product contains and which were used in the manufacturing 
process.
    (d) Format. (1) The warning statement shall be blocked within a 
square or rectangular area, with or without a border. (2) The warning 
statement shall appear in lines that are parallel to the surrounding 
text on the product's PDP, display panel, supplemental printed material 
or promotional printed material.
    (e) Type style. The ratio of the height of a capital letter to its 
width shall be such that the height of the letter is no more than 3 
times its width; the signal word ``WARNING'' shall appear in all capital 
letters.
    (f) Type size. The warning statement shall appear at least as large 
as the type sizes prescribed by this paragraph. The type size refers to 
the height of the capital letters. A larger type size materially 
enhances the legibility of the statement and is desirable.
    (1) Display panel or outer packaging. Minimum type size requirements 
for the warning statement are given in Table 1 to this paragraph and are 
based upon the area of the display panel of the product or container. 
Where the statement is on outer packaging, as well as the display panel 
area, the statement shall appear in the same minimum type size as on the 
display panel.

                                                             Table 1 to Sec.  82.110(f)(1)

<R05>
Sec. 82.112  Removal of label bearing warning statement.

    (a) Prohibition on removal. Except as described in paragraph (b) or 
(c) of this section, any warning statement that accompanies a product or 
container introduced into interstate commerce, as required by this 
subpart, must remain with the product or container and any product 
incorporating such product or container, up to and including the point 
of sale to the ultimate consumer.
    (b) Incorporation of warning statement by subsequent manufacturers. 
A manufacturer of a product that incorporates a product that is 
accompanied by a label bearing the warning statement may remove such 
label from the incorporated product if the information on such label is 
incorporated into a warning statement accompanying the manufacturer's 
product, or if, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, the 
manufacturer of the product is not required to pass through the 
information contained on or incorporated in the product's label.
    (c) Manufacturers that incorporate products manufactured with 
controlled substances. A manufacturer that incorporates into its own 
product a component product that was purchased from another 
manufacturer, was manufactured with a process that uses a controlled 
substance(s), but does not contain such substance(s), may remove such 
label from the incorporated product and need not apply a warning 
statement to its own product, if the

[[Page 576]]

manufacturer does not use a controlled substance in its own 
manufacturing process. A manufacturer that uses controlled substances in 
its own manufacturing process, and is otherwise subject to the 
regulations of this subpart, must label pursuant to Sec. 82.106, but 
need not include information regrading the incorporated product on the 
required label.
    (d) Manufacturers, distributors, wholesalers, retailers that sell 
spare parts manufactured with controlled substances solely for repair. 
Manufacturers, distributors, wholesalers, and retailers that purchase 
spare parts manufactured with a class I substance from another 
manufacturer or supplier, and sell such spare parts for the sole purpose 
of repair, are not required to pass through an applicable warning label 
if such products are removed from the original packaging provided by the 
manufacturer from whom the products are purchased. Manufacturers of the 
spare parts manufactured with controlled substances must still label 
their products; furthermore, manufacturers, importers, and distributors 
of such products must pass through the labeling information as long as 
products remain assembled and packaged in the manner assembled and 
packaged by the original manufacturer. This exemption shall not apply if 
a spare part is later used for manufacture and/or for purposes other 
than repair.


<R05>
Sec. 82.114  Compliance by manufacturers and importers with requirements for labeling of containers of controlled substances, or products containing controlled 
          substances.

    (a) Compliance by manufacturers and importers with requirements for 
labeling of containers of controlled substances, or products containing 
controlled substances. Each manufacturer of a product incorporating 
another product or container containing a controlled substance, to which 
Sec. 82.102 (a)(1), or, (a)(2) or (b)(1) applies, that is purchased or 
obtained from another manufacturer or supplier, is required to pass 
through and incorporate the labeling information that accompanies such 
incorporated product in a warning statement accompanying the 
manufacturer's finished product. Each importer of a product, or 
container containing a controlled substance, to which Sec. 82.102 
(a)(1), (a)(2), or (b)(1) applies, including a component product or 
container incorporated into the product, that is purchased from a 
foreign manufacturer or supplier, is required to apply a label, or to 
ensure that a label has been properly applied, at the site of U.S. 
Customs clearance.
    (b) Reliance on reasonable belief. The manufacturer or importer of a 
product that incorporates another product container from another 
manufacturer or supplier may rely on the labeling information (or lack 
thereof) that it receives with the product, and is not required to 
independently investigate whether the requirements of this subpart are 
applicable to such purchased product or container, as long as the 
manufacturer reasonably believes that the supplier or foreign 
manufacturer is reliably and accurately complying with the requirements 
of this subpart.
    (c) Contractual obligations. A manufacturer's or importer's 
contractual relationship with its supplier under which the supplier is 
required to accurately label, consistent with the requirements of this 
subpart, any products containing a controlled substance or containers of 
a controlled substance that are supplied to the manufacturer or 
importer, is evidence of reasonable belief.


<R05>
Sec. 82.116  Compliance by manufacturers or importers incorporating 
products manufactured with controlled substances.

    (a) Compliance by manufacturers or importers incorporating products 
manufactured with controlled substances, or importing products 
manufactured with controlled substances. Each manufacturer or importer 
of a product incorporating another product to which Sec. 82.102 (a)(3) 
or (b)(2) applies, that is purchased from another manufacturer or 
supplier, is not required to pass through and incorporate the labeling 
information that accompanies such incorporated product in a warning 
statement accompanying the manufacturer's or importer's finished 
product. Importers of products to which Sec. 82.102 (a)(3) or (b)(2) 
applies are required to apply a label, or to ensure that a label has 
been properly applied at the site of U.S. Customs clearance.

[[Page 577]]

    (b) Reliance on reasonable belief. The importer of a product 
purchased or obtained from a foreign manufacturer or supplier, which 
product may have been manufactured with a controlled substance, may rely 
on the information that it receives with the purchased product, and is 
not required to independently investigate whether the requirements of 
this subpart are applicable to the purchased or obtained product, as 
long as the importer reasonably believes that there was no use of 
controlled substances by the final manufacturer of the product being 
imported.
    (c) Contractual obligations. An importer's contractual relationship 
with its supplier under which the supplier is required to accurately 
label, consistent with the requirements of this subpart, any products 
manufactured with a controlled substance that are supplied to the 
importer, or to certify to the importer whether a product was or was not 
manufactured with a controlled substance is evidence of reasonable 
belief.


<R05>
Sec. 82.118  Compliance by wholesalers, distributors and retailers.

    (a) Requirement of compliance by wholesalers, distributors and 
retailers. All wholesalers, distributors and retailers of products or 
containers to which this subpart applies are required to pass through 
the labeling information that accompanies the product, except those 
purchasing from other manufacturers or suppliers spare parts 
manufactured with controlled substances and selling those parts for the 
demonstrable sole purpose of repair.
    (b) Reliance on reasonable belief. The wholesaler, distributor or 
retailer of a product may rely on the labeling information that it 
receives with the product or container, and is not required to 
independently investigate whether the requirements of this subpart are 
applicable to the product or container, as long as the wholesaler, 
distributor or retailer reasonably believes that the supplier of the 
product or container is reliably and accurately complying with the 
requirements of this subpart.
    (c) Contractual obligations. A wholesaler, distributor or retailer's 
contractual relationship with its supplier under which the supplier is 
required to accurately label, consistent with the requirements of this 
subpart, any products manufactured with a controlled substance that are 
supplied to the wholesaler, distributor or retailer is evidence of 
reasonable belief.

    (d) Criteria for evaluating petitions. Adequate data in support of 
any petition to the Agency to add a product to the labeling requirement 
or temporarily remove a product from the labeling requirement will be 
evaluated based upon a showing of sufficient quality and scope by the 
petitioner of whether there are or are not substitute products or 
manufacturing processes for such product:
    (1) That do not rely on the use of such class I or class II 
substance;
    (2) That reduce the overall risk to human health and the 
environment; and
    (3) That are currently or potentially available.
    (e) Procedure for acceptance or denial of petition. (1) If a

Sec. 82.152  Definitions.

    Appliance means any device which contains and uses a refrigerant and 
which is used for household or commercial purposes, including any air 
conditioner, refrigerator, chiller, or freezer.
    Apprentice means any person who is currently registered as an 
apprentice in service, maintenance, repair, or disposal of appliances 
with the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Apprenticeship and 
Training (or a State Apprenticeship Council recognized by the Bureau of 
Apprenticeship and Training). If more than two years have elapsed since 
the person first registered as an apprentice with the Bureau of 
Apprenticeship and Training (or a State Apprenticeship Council 
recognized by the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training), the person 
shall not be considered an apprentice.
    Approved equipment testing organization means any organization which 
has applied for and received approval from the Administrator pursuant to 
Sec. 82.160.
    Certified refrigerant recovery or recycling equipment means 
equipment manufactured before November 15, 1993, that meets the 
standards in Sec. 82.158(c), (e), or (g); equipment certified by an 
approved equipment testing organization to meet the standards in Sec. 
82.158(b), (d), or (f); or equipment certified pursuant to Sec. 
82.36(a).

[[Page 581]]

    Commercial refrigeration means, for the purposes of Sec. 82.156(i), 
the refrigeration appliances utilized in the retail food and cold 
storage warehouse sectors. Retail food includes the refrigeration 
equipment found in supermarkets, convenience stores, restaurants and 
other food service establishments. Cold storage includes the equipment 
used to store meat, produce, dairy products, and other perishable goods. 
All of the equipment contains large refrigerant charges, typically over 
75 pounds.
    Critical component means, for the purposes of Sec. 82.156(i), a 
component without which industrial process refrigeration equipment will 
not function, will be unsafe in its intended environment, and/or will be 
subject to failures that would cause the industrial process served by 
the refrigeration appliance to be unsafe.
    Custom-built means, for the purposes of Sec. 82.156(i), that the 
equipment or any of its critical components cannot be purchased and/or 
installed without being uniquely designed, fabricated and/or assembled 
to satisfy a specific set of industrial process conditions.
    Disposal means the process leading to and including:
    (1) The discharge, deposit, dumping or placing of any discarded 
appliance into or on any land or water;
    (2) The disassembly of any appliance for discharge, deposit, dumping 
or placing of its discarded component parts into or on any land or 
water; or
    (3) The disassembly of any appliance for reuse of its component 
parts.
    Follow-up verification test means, for the purposes of Sec. 
82.156(i), those tests that involve checking the repairs within 30 days 
of the appliance's returning to normal operating characteristics and 
conditions. Follow-up verification tests for appliances from which the 
refrigerant charge has been evacuated means a test conducted after the 
appliance or portion of the appliance has resumed operation at normal 
operating characteristics and conditions of temperature and pressure, 
except in cases where sound professional judgment dictates that these 
tests will be more meaningful if performed prior to the return to normal 
operating characteristics and conditions. A follow-up verification test 
with respect to repairs conducted without evacuation of the refrigerant 
charge means a reverification test conducted after the initial 
verification test and usually within 30 days of normal operating 
conditions. Where an appliance is not evacuated, it is only necessary to 
conclude any required changes in pressure, temperature or other 
conditions to return the appliance to normal operating characteristics 
and conditions.
    Full charge means the amount of refrigerant required for normal 
operating characteristics and conditions of the appliance as determined 
by using one or a combination of the following four methods:
    (1) Use the equipment manufacturer's determination of the correct 
full charge for the equipment;
    (2) Determine the full charge by making appropriate calculations 
based on component sizes, density of refrigerant, volume of piping, and 
other relevant considerations;
    (3) Use actual measurements of the amount of refrigerant added or 
evacuated from the appliance; and/or
    (4) Use an established range based on the best available data 
regarding the normal operating characteristics and conditions for the 
appliance, where the midpoint of the range will serve as the full 
charge, and where records are maintained in accordance with Sec. 
82.166(q).
    High-pressure appliance means an appliance that uses a refrigerant 
with a liquid phase saturation pressure between 170 psia and 355 psia at 
104 [deg]F. This definition includes but is not limited to appliances 
using R-401A, R-409A, R-401B, R-411A, R-22, R-411B, R-502, R-402B, R-
408A, and R-402A.
    Industrial process refrigeration means, for the purposes of Sec. 
82.156(i), complex customized appliances used in the chemical, 
pharmaceutical, petrochemical and manufacturing industries. These 
appliances are directly linked to the industrial process. This sector 
also includes industrial ice machines, appliances used directly in the 
generation of electricity, and ice rinks. Where one appliance is used 
for both industrial process refrigeration and other applications, it 
will be considered industrial process refrigeration equipment if 50 
percent or more of its

[[Page 582]]

operating capacity is used for industrial process refrigeration.
    Industrial process shutdown means, for the purposes of Sec. 
82.156(i), that an industrial process or facility temporarily ceases to 
operate or manufacture whatever is being produced at that facility.
    Initial verification test means, for the purposes of Sec. 
82.156(i), those leak tests that are conducted as soon as practicable 
after the repair is completed. An initial verification test, with regard 
to the leak repairs that require the evacuation of the appliance or 
portion of the appliance, means a test conducted prior to the 
replacement of the full refrigerant charge and before the appliance or 
portion of the appliance has reached operation at normal operating 
characteristics and conditions of temperature and pressure. An initial 
verification test with regard to repairs conducted without the 
evacuation of the refrigerant charge means a test conducted as soon as 
practicable after the conclusion of the repair work.
    Leak rate means the rate at which an appliance is losing 
refrigerant, measured between refrigerant charges. The leak rate is 
expressed in terms of the percentage of the appliance's full charge that 
would be lost over a 12-month period if the current rate of loss were to 
continue over that period. The rate is calculated using only one of the 
following methods for all appliances located at an operating facility.
    (1) Method 1. (i) Step 1. Take the number of pounds of refrigerant 
added to the appliance to return it to a full charge and divide it by 
the number of pounds of refrigerant the appliance normally contains at 
full charge;
    (ii) Step 2. Take the shorter of the number of days that have passed 
since the last day refrigerant was added or 365 days and divide that 
number by 365 days;
    (iii) Step 3. Take the number calculated in Step 1. and divide it by 
the number calculated in Step 2.; and
    (iv) Step 4. Multiply the number calculated in Step 3. by 100 to 
calculate a percentage. This method is summarized in the following 
formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11JA05.010

    (2) Method 2. (i) Step 1. Take the sum of the quantity of 
refrigerant added to the appliance over the previous 365-day period (or 
over the period that has passed since leaks in the appliance were last 
repaired, if that period is less than one year),
    (ii) Step 2. Divide the result of Step 1. by the quantity (e.g., 
pounds) of refrigerant the appliance normally contains at full charge, 
and
    (iii) Step 3. Multiply the result of Step 2. by 100 to obtain a 
percentage. This method is summarized in the following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11JA05.011

    Low-loss fitting means any device that is intended to establish a 
connection between hoses, appliances, or recovery or recycling machines 
and that is designed to close automatically or to be closed manually 
when disconnected, minimizing the release of refrigerant from hoses, 
appliances, and recovery or recycling machines.

[[Page 583]]

intended to cover appliances using R-22 refrigerant.
    Normal operating characteristics or conditions means, for the 
purposes of Sec. 82.156(i), temperatures, pressures, fluid flows, 
speeds and other characteristics that would normally be expected for a 
given process load and ambient condition during operation. Normal 
operating characteristics and conditions are marked by the absence of 
atypical conditions affecting the operation of the refrigeration 
appliance.
    Normally containing a quantity of refrigerant means containing the 
quantity of refrigerant within the appliance or appliance component when 
the appliance is operating with a full charge of refrigerant.
    One-time expansion device means an appliance that relies on the one-
time release of its refrigerant charge to the environment in order to 
provide a cooling effect.
    Opening an appliance means any service, maintenance, repair, or 
disposal of an appliance that would release refrigerant from the 
appliance to the atmosphere unless the refrigerant was recovered 
previously from the appliance. Connecting and disconnecting hoses and 
gauges to and from the appliance to measure pressures within the 
appliance and to add refrigerant to or recover refrigerant from the 
appliance shall not be considered ``opening.''
    Parent company means an individual, corporation, partnership, 
association, joint-stock company, or an unincorporated organization that 
can direct or cause the direction of management and policies of another 
entity, through the ownership of shares or otherwise.
    Person means any individual or legal entity, including an 
individual, corporation, partnership, association, state, municipality, 
political subdivision of a state, Indian tribe, and any agency, 
department, or instrumentality of the United States, and any officer,

Refrigerants) that are applicable to that refrigerant and to verify that 
the refrigerant meets these specifications using the analytical 
methodology prescribed in section 5 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 82, 
subpart F.
    Recover refrigerant means to remove refrigerant in any condition 
from an appliance and to store it in an external container without 
necessarily testing or processing it in any way.
    Recovery efficiency means the percentage of refrigerant in an 
appliance that is recovered by a piece of recycling or recovery 
equipment.
    Recycle refrigerant means to extract refrigerant from an appliance 
and clean refrigerant for reuse without meeting all of the requirements 
for

[[Page 584]]

reclamation. In general, recycled refrigerant is refrigerant that is 
cleaned using oil separation and single or multiple passes through 
devices, such as replaceable core filter-driers, which reduce moisture, 
acidity, and particulate matter. These procedures are usually 
implemented at the field job site.
    Refrigerant means, for purposes of this subpart, any substance 
consisting in part or whole of a class I or class II ozone-depleting 
substance that is used for heat transfer purposes and provides a cooling 
effect.

normally connected to each other (or are separated only by internal 
valves) and are designed to contain refrigerant.
    Self-contained recovery equipment means refrigerant recovery or 
recycling equipment that is capable of removing the refrigerant from an 
appliance without the assistance of components contained in the 
appliance.
    Small appliance means any appliance that is fully manufactured, 
charged, and hermetically sealed in a factory with five (5) pounds or 
less of a class I or class II substance used as a refrigerant, 
including, but not limited to, refrigerators and freezers (designed for

refrigeration equipment, room air conditioners (including window air 
conditioners and packaged terminal air heat pumps), dehumidifiers, 
under-the-counter ice makers, vending machines, and drinking water 
coolers.
    Substitute means any chemical or product, whether existing or new, 
that is used by any person as an EPA approved replacement for a class I 
or II ozone-depleting substance in a given refrigeration or air-
conditioning end-use.
    Suitable replacement refrigerant means, for the purposes of Sec. 
82.156(i)(7)(i), a refrigerant that is acceptable under section 612(c) 
of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and all regulations promulgated 
under that section, compatible with other materials with which it may 
come into contact, and able to achieve the temperatures required for the 
affected industrial process in a technically feasible manner.
    System-dependent recovery equipment means refrigerant recovery 
equipment that requires the assistance of components contained in an 
appliance to remove the refrigerant from the appliance.
    System mothballing means the intentional shutting down of a 
refrigeration appliance undertaken for an extended period of time by the

evacuated from the appliance or the affected isolated section of the 
appliance, at least to atmospheric pressure.
    Technician means any person who performs maintenance, service, or 
repair, that could be reasonably expected to release refrigerants from 
appliances, except for MVACs, into the atmosphere. Technician also means 
any person who performs disposal of appliances, except for small 
appliances, MVACs, and MVAC-like appliances, that could be reasonably 
expected to release refrigerants from the appliances into the 
atmosphere. Performing maintenance, service, repair, or disposal could 
be reasonably expected to release refrigerants only if the activity is 
reasonably expected to violate the integrity of the refrigerant circuit. 
Activities reasonably expected to violate the integrity of the 
refrigerant circuit include activities such as attaching and detaching 
hoses and gauges to and from the appliance to add or remove refrigerant 
or to measure pressure and adding refrigerant to and removing 
refrigerant from the appliance. Activities such as painting the 
appliance, rewiring an external electrical circuit, replacing insulation 
on a length of pipe, or tightening nuts and bolts on the appliance are 
not reasonably expected to violate the integrity of the refrigerant 
circuit. Performing maintenance, service, repair, or disposal of 
appliances that have been evacuated pursuant to Sec. 82.156 could not 
be reasonably expected to release refrigerants from the appliance unless 
the maintenance, service, or repair consists of adding refrigerant to 
the appliance. Technician includes but is not limited to installers, 
contractor employees, in-house service personnel, and in some cases 
owners and/or operators.

Sec. 82.156  Required practices.

    (a) All persons disposing of appliances, except for small 
appliances, MVACs, and MVAC-like appliances must evacuate the 
refrigerant, including all the liquid refrigerant, in the entire unit to 
a recovery or recycling machine certified pursuant to Sec. 82.158. All 
persons opening appliances except for MVACs and MVAC-like appliances for 
maintenance, service, or repair must evacuate the refrigerant, including 
all the liquid refrigerant (except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) 
of this section), in either the entire unit or the part to be serviced 
(if the latter can be isolated) to a system receiver (e.g., the 
remaining portions of the appliance, or a specific vessel within the 
appliance) or a recovery or recycling machine certified pursuant to 
Sec. 82.158. A technician must verify that the applicable level of 
evacuation has been reached in the appliance or the part before it is 
opened.
    (1) Persons opening appliances except for small appliances, MVACs, 
and MVAC-like appliances for maintenance, service, or repair must 
evacuate to the levels in table 1 before opening the appliance, unless
    (i) Evacuation of the appliance to the atmosphere is not to be 
performed after completion of the maintenance, service, or repair, and 
the maintenance, service, or repair is not major as defined at Sec. 
82.152; or
    (ii) Due to leaks in the appliance, evacuation to the levels in 
table 1 is not attainable, or would substantially contaminate the 
refrigerant being recovered; or
    (iii) The recycling or recovery equipment was certified pursuant to 
Sec. 82.158(b)(2). In any of these cases, the requirements of Sec. 
82.156(a)(2) must be followed.
    (2)(i) If evacuation of the appliance to the atmosphere is not to be 
performed after completion of the maintenance, service, or repair, and 
if the maintenance, service, or repair is not major as defined at Sec. 
82.152, the appliance must:
    (A) Be evacuated to a pressure no higher than 0 psig before it is 
opened if it is a high- or very high-pressure appliance;
    (B) Be pressurized to a pressure no higher than 0 psig before it is 
opened if it is a low-pressure appliance. Persons must cover openings 
when isolation is not possible. Persons pressurizing low-pressure 
appliances that use refrigerants with boiling points at or below 85 
degrees Fahrenheit at 29.9 inches of mercury (standard atmospheric 
pressure), (e.g. R-11 and R-123), must not use methods such as nitrogen, 
that require subsequent purging. Persons pressurizing low-pressure 
appliances that use refrigerants with boiling points above 85 degrees 
Fahrenheit at 29.9 inches of mercury, e.g., R-113, must use heat to 
raise the internal pressure of the appliance as much as possible, but 
may use nitrogen to raise the internal pressure of the appliance from 
the level attainable through use of heat to atmospheric pressure; or
    (C) For the purposes of oil changes, be evacuated or pressurized to 
a pressure no higher than 5 psig, before it is opened; or drain the oil 
into a system receiver to be evacuated or pressurized to a pressure no 
higher than 5 psig.
    (ii) If, due to leaks in the appliance, evacuation to the levels in 
table 1 is not attainable, or would substantially contaminate the 
refrigerant being recovered, persons opening the appliance must:
    (A) Isolate leaking from non-leaking components wherever possible;
    (B) Evacuate non-leaking components to be opened to the levels 
specified in table 1; and
    (C) Evacuate leaking components to be opened to the lowest level 
that can be attained without substantially contaminating the 
refrigerant. In no case shall this level exceed 0 psig.
    (iii) If the recycling or recovery equipment was certified pursuant 
to

[[Page 588]]

Sec. 82.158(b)(2), technicians must follow the manufacturer's 
directions for achieving the required recovery efficiency.
    (3) Persons disposing of appliances except for small appliances, 
MVACs, and MVAC-like appliances, must evacuate to the levels in table 1 
unless, due to leaks in the appliance, evacuation to the levels in table 
1 is not attainable, or would substantially contaminate the refrigerant 
being recovered. If, due to leaks in the appliance, evacuation to the 
levels in table 1 is not attainable, or would substantially contaminate 
the refrigerant being recovered, persons disposing of the appliance 
must:
    (i) Isolate leaking from non-leaking components wherever possible;
    (ii) Evacuate non-leaking components to the levels specified in 
table 1; and
    (iii) Evacuate leaking components to the lowest level that can be 
attained without substantially contaminating the refrigerant. In no case 
shall this level exceed 0 psig.

    (4) Persons opening small appliances for maintenance, service, or 
repair must:
    (i) When using recycling and recovery equipment manufactured before 
November 15, 1993, recover 80% of the refrigerant in the small 
appliance; or
    (ii) When using recycling or recovery equipment manufactured on or 
after November 15, 1993, recover 90% of the refrigerant in the appliance 
when the compressor in the appliance is operating, or 80% of the 
refrigerant in the appliance when the compressor in the appliance is not 
operating; or
    (iii) Evacuate the small appliance to four inches of mercury vacuum.
    (5) Persons opening MVAC-like appliances for maintenance, service, 
or repair may do so only while properly using, as defined at Sec. 
82.32(e), recycling or recovery equipment certified pursuant to Sec. 
82.158 (f) or (g), as applicable.
    (b) All persons opening appliances except for small appliances, 
MVACs, and MVAC-like appliances for maintenance, service, or repair and 
all persons disposing of appliances except small appliances, MVACs, and 
MVAC-like appliances must have at least one piece of certified, self-
contained recovery or recycling equipment available at their place of 
business. Persons who maintain, service, repair, or dispose of only 
appliances that they own and that contain pump-out units are exempt from 
this requirement. This exemption does not relieve such persons from 
other applicable requirements of this section.
    (c) System-dependent equipment shall not be used with appliances 
normally containing more than 15 pounds of refrigerant, unless the 
system-dependent equipment is permanently attached to the appliance as a 
pump-out unit.

[[Page 589]]

    (d) All recovery or recycling equipment shall be used in accordance 
with the manufacturer's directions unless such directions conflict with 
the requirements of this subpart.
    (e) Refrigerant may be returned to the appliance from which it is 
recovered or to another appliance owned by the same person without being 
recycled or reclaimed, unless the appliance is an MVAC or MVAC-like 
appliance.
    (f) Effective July 13, 1993, persons who take the final step in the 
disposal process (including but not limited to scrap recyclers and 
landfill operators) of a small appliance, room air conditioning, MVACs, 
or MVAC-like appliances must either:
    (1) Recover any remaining refrigerant from the appliance in 
accordance with paragraph (g) or (h) of this section, as applicable; or
    (2) Verify that the refrigerant has been evacuated from the 
appliance or shipment of appliances previously. Such verification must 
include a signed statement from the person from whom the appliance or 
shipment of appliances is obtained that all refrigerant that had not 
leaked previously has been recovered from the appliance or shipment of 
appliances in accordance with paragraph (g) or (h) of this section, as 
applicable. This statement must include the name and address of the 
person who recovered the refrigerant and the date the refrigerant was 
recovered or a contract that refrigerant will be removed prior to 
delivery.
    (3) Persons complying with paragraph (f)(2) of this section must 
notify suppliers of appliances that refrigerant must be properly removed 
before delivery of the items to the facility. The form of this 
notification may be warning signs, letters to suppliers, or other 
equivalent means.
    (g) All persons recovering refrigerant from MVACs and MVAC-like 
appliances for purposes of disposal of these appliances must reduce the 
system pressure to or below 102 mm of mercury vacuum, using equipment 
that meets the standards set forth in Sec. 82.158(l).
    (h) All persons recovering the refrigerant from small appliances for 
purposes of disposal of these appliances must either:
    (1) Recover 90% of the refrigerant in the appliance when the 
compressor in the appliance is operating, or 80% of the refrigerant in 
the appliance when the compressor in the appliance is not operating; or
    (2) Evacuate the small appliance to four inches of mercury vacuum.
    (i)(1) Owners or operators of commercial refrigeration equipment 
normally containing more than 50 pounds of refrigerant must have leaks 
repaired in accordance with paragraph (i)(9) of this section, if the 
appliance is leaking at a rate such that the loss of refrigerant will 
exceed 35 percent of the total charge during a 12-month period, except 
as described in paragraphs (i)(6), (i)(8), and (i)(10) of this section 
and paragraphs (i)(1)(i), (i)(1)(ii), and (i)(1)(iii) of this section. 
Repairs must bring the annual leak rate to below 35 percent.
    (i) If the owners or operators of the federally-owned commercial 
refrigerant appliances determine that the leaks cannot be repaired in 
accordance with paragraph (i)(9) of this section and that an extension 
in accordance with the requirements discussed in this paragraph 
(i)(1)(i) of this section apply, they must document all repair efforts, 
and notify EPA of their inability to comply within the 30-day repair 
requirement, and the reason for the inability must be submitted to EPA 
in accordance with Sec. 82.166(n). Such notification must be made 
within 30 days of discovering the leaks. EPA will determine if the 
extension requested in accordance with the requirements discussed in 
paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section is justified. If the extension is 
not justified, EPA will notify the owner/operator within 30 days of 
receipt of the notification.
    (ii) Owners or operators of federally-owned commercial refrigeration 
equipment may have more than 30 days to repair leaks if the 
refrigeration appliance is located in an area subject to radiological 
contamination or where the shutting down of the appliance will directly 
lead to radiological contamination. Only the additional time needed to 
conduct and complete repairs in a safe working environment will be 
permitted.

[[Page 590]]

    (iii) Owners or operators of federally-owned commercial 
refrigeration equipment requesting or who are granted time extensions 
under this paragraph must comply with paragraphs (i)(3) and (i)(4) of 
this section.
    (2) The owners or operators of industrial process refrigeration 
equipment normally containing more than 50 pounds of refrigerant must 
have leaks repaired if the appliance is leaking at a rate such that the 
loss of refrigerant will exceed 35 percent of the total charge during a 
12-month period in accordance with paragraph (i)(9) of this section, 
except as described in paragraphs (i)(6), (i)(7) and (i)(10) of this 
section, and paragraphs (i)(2)(i) and (i)(2)(ii) of this section. 
Repairs must bring annual leak rates to below 35 percent during a 12-
month period. If the owners or operators of the industrial process 
refrigeration equipment determine that the leak rate cannot be brought 
to below 35 percent during a 12-month period within 30 days (or 120 
days, where an industrial process shutdown in accordance with paragraph 
(i)(2)(ii) of this section is required,) and in accordance with 
paragraph (i)(9) of this section, and that an extension in accordance 
with the requirements discussed in this paragraph apply, the owners or 
operators of the appliance must document all repair efforts, and notify 
EPA of the reason for the inability in accordance with Sec. 82.166(n) 
within 30 days of making this determination. Owners or operators who 
obtain an extension pursuant to this section or elect to utilize the 
additional time provided in paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section, must 
conduct all necessary leak repairs, if any, that do not require any 
additional time beyond the initial 30 or 120 days.
    (i) The owners or operators of industrial process refrigeration 
equipment are permitted more than 30 days (or 120 days where an 
industrial process shutdown in accordance with paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of 
this section is required) to repair leaks, if the necessary parts are 
unavailable or if requirements of other applicable federal, state, or 
local regulations make a repair within 30 or 120 days impossible. Only 
the additional time needed to receive delivery of the necessary parts or 
to comply with the pertinent regulations will be permitted.
    (ii) Owners or operators of industrial process refrigeration 
equipment will have a 120-day repair period, rather than a 30-day repair 
period, to repair leaks in instances where an industrial process 
shutdown is needed to repair a leak or leaks from industrial process 
refrigeration equipment.
    (3) Owners or operators of industrial process refrigeration 
equipment and owners or operators of federally-owned commercial 
refrigeration equipment or of federally-owned comfort cooling appliances 
who are granted additional time under paragraphs (i)(1) or (i)(5) of 
this section, must have repairs performed in a manner that sound 
professional judgment indicates will bring the leak rate below the 
applicable allowable leak rate. When an industrial process shutdown has 
occurred or when repairs have been made while an appliance is 
mothballed, the owners or operators shall conduct an initial 
verification test at the conclusion of the repairs and a follow-up 
verification test. The follow-up verification test shall be conducted 
within 30 days of completing the repairs or within 30 days of bringing 
the appliance back on-line, if taken off-line, but no sooner than when 
the appliance has achieved normal operating characteristics and 
conditions. When repairs have been conducted without an industrial 
process shutdown or system mothballing, an initial verification test 
shall be conducted at the conclusion of the repairs, and a follow-up 
verification test shall be conducted within 30 days of the initial 
verification test. In all cases, the follow-up verification test shall 
be conducted at normal operating characteristics and conditions, unless 
sound professional judgment indicates that tests performed at normal 
operating characteristics and conditions will produce less reliable 
results, in which case the follow-up verification test shall be 
conducted at or near the normal operating pressure where practicable, 
and at or near the normal operating temperature where practicable.
    (i) If the owners or operators of industrial process refrigeration 
equipment takes the appliance off-line, or if the owners or operators of 
federally-

[[Page 591]]

owned commercial refrigeration or of federally-owned comfort cooling 
appliances who are granted additional time under paragraphs (i)(1) or 
(i)(5) of this section take the appliance off-line, they cannot bring 
the appliance back on-line until an initial verification test indicates 
that the repairs undertaken in accordance with paragraphs (i)(1)(i), 
(ii), (iii), or (i)(2)(i) and (ii), or (5)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this 
section have been successfully completed, demonstrating the leak or 
leaks are repaired. The owners or operators of the industrial process 
refrigeration equipment, federally-owned commercial refrigeration 
appliances, or federally-owned comfort cooling appliances are exempted 
from this requirement only where the owners or operators will retrofit 
or retire the industrial process refrigeration equipment, federally-
owned commercial refrigeration appliance, or federally-owned comfort 
cooling appliance in accordance with paragraph (i)(6) of this section. 
Under this exemption, the owner or operators may bring the industrial 
process refrigeration equipment, federally-owned commercial 
refrigeration appliance, or federally-owned comfort cooling appliance 
back on-line without successful completion of an initial verification 
test.
    (ii) If the follow-up verification test indicates that the repairs 
to industrial process refrigeration equipment, federally-owned 
commercial refrigeration equipment, or federally-owned comfort cooling 
appliances have not been successful, the owner or operator must retrofit 
or retire the equipment in accordance with paragraph (i)(6) and any such 
longer time period as may apply under paragraphs (i)(7)(i), (ii) and 
(iii) or (i)(8)(i) and (ii) of this section. The owners and operators of 
the industrial process refrigeration equipment, federally-owned 
commercial refrigeration equipment, or federally-owned comfort cooling 
appliances are relieved of this requirement if the conditions of 
paragraphs (i)(3)(iv) and/or (i)(3)(v) of this section are met.
    (iii) The owner or operator of industrial process refrigeration 
equipment that fails a follow-up verification test must notify EPA 
within 30 days of the failed follow-up verification test in accordance 
with Sec. 82.166(n).
    (iv) The owner or operator is relieved of the obligation to retrofit 
or replace the industrial process refrigeration equipment as discussed 
in paragraph (i)(6) of this section if second repair efforts to fix the 
same leaks that were the subject of the first repair efforts are 
successfully completed within 30 days or 120 days where an industrial 
process shutdown is required, after the initial failed follow-up 
verification test. The second repair efforts are subject to the same 
verification requirements of paragraphs (i)(3), (i)(3) (i) and (ii) of 
this section. The owner or operator is required to notify EPA within 30 
days of the successful follow-up verification test in accordance with 
Sec. 82.166(n) and the owner or operator is no longer subject to the 
obligation to retrofit or replace the appliance that arose as a 
consequence of the initial failure to verify that the leak repair 
efforts were successful.
    (v) The owner or operator of industrial process refrigeration 
equipment is relieved of the obligation to retrofit or replace the 
equipment in accordance with paragraph (i)(6) of this section if within 
180 days of the initial failed follow-up verification test, the owner or 
operator establishes that the appliance's annual leak rate does not 
exceed the applicable allowable annual leak rate, in accordance with 
paragraph (i)(4) of this section. If the appliance's owner or operator 
establishes that the appliance's annual leak rate does not exceed the 
applicable allowable annual leak rate, the owner or operator is required 
to notify EPA within 30 days of that determination in accordance with 
Sec. 82.166(n) and the owner or operator would no longer be subject to 
the obligation to retrofit or replace the equipment that arose as a 
consequence of the initial failure to verify that the leak repair 
efforts were successful.
    (4) In the case of a failed follow-up verification test subject to 
paragraph (i)(3)(v) of this section, the determination of whether 
industrial process refrigeration equipment has an annual leak rate that 
exceeds the applicable allowable annual leak rate will be made in 
accordance with parameters identified by the owner or operator in its 
notice to EPA regarding the failure of the initial follow-up 
verification

[[Page 592]]

test, if those parameters are acceptable to EPA; otherwise by parameters 
selected by EPA. The determination must be based on the full charge for 
the affected industrial process refrigeration equipment. The leak rate 
determination parameters in the owner's or operator's notice will be 
considered acceptable unless EPA notifies the owners or operators within 
30 days of receipt of the notice. Where EPA does not accept the 
parameters identified by the owner or operator in its notice, EPA will 
not provide additional time beyond the additional time permitted in 
paragraph (i)(3)(v) of this section unless specifically stated in the 
parameters selected by EPA.
    (5) Owners or operators of comfort cooling appliances normally 
containing more than 50 pounds of refrigerant and not covered by 
paragraph (i)(1) or (i)(2) of this section must have leaks repaired in 
accordance with paragraph (i)(9) of this section if the appliance is 
leaking at a rate such that the loss of refrigerant will exceed 15 
percent of the total charge during a 12-month period, except as 
described in paragraphs (i)(6), (i)(8) and (i)(10) of this section and 
paragraphs (i)(5)(i), (i)(5)(ii) and (i)(5)(iii) of this section. 
Repairs must bring the annual leak rate to below 15 percent.
    (i) If the owners or operators of federally-owned comfort-cooling 
appliances determine that the leaks cannot be repaired in accordance 
with paragraph (i)(9) of this section and that an extension in 
accordance with the requirements discussed in paragraph (i)(5) of this 
section apply, they must document all repair efforts, and notify EPA of 
their inability to comply within the 30-day repair requirement, and the 
reason for the inability must be submitted to EPA in accordance with 
Sec. 82.166(n). Such notification must be made within 30 days of 
discovering that leak repair efforts cannot be completed within 30 days.
    (ii) Owners or operators of federally-owned comfort-cooling 
appliances may have more than 30 days to repair leaks where the 
refrigeration appliance is located in an area subject to radiological 
contamination or where the shutting down of the appliance will directly 
lead to radiological contamination. Only the additional time needed to 
conduct and complete work in a safe environment will be permitted.
    (iii) Owners or operators of federally-owned comfort-cooling 
appliances requesting, or who are granted, time extensions under this 
paragraph must comply with paragraphs (i)(3) and (i)(4) of this section.
    (6) Owners or operators are not required to repair leaks as provided 
in paragraphs (i)(1), (i)(2), and (i)(5) of this section if, within 30 
days of discovering a leak greater than the applicable allowable leak 
rate, or within 30 days of a failed follow-up verification test, or 
after making good faith efforts to repair the leaks as described in 
paragraph (i)(6)(i) of this section, they develop a one-year retrofit or 
retirement plan for the leaking appliance. Owners or operators who 
decide to retrofit the appliance must use a refrigerant or substitute 
with a lower or equivalent ozone-depleting potential than the previous 
refrigerant and must include such a change in the retrofit plan. Owners 
or operators who retire and replace the appliance must replace the 
appliance with an appliance that uses a refrigerant or substitute with a 
lower or equivalent ozone-depleting potential and must include such a 
change in the retirement plan. The retrofit or retirement plan (or a 
legible copy) must be kept at the site of the appliance. The original 
plan must be made available for EPA inspection upon request. The plan 
must be dated, and all work performed in accordance with the plan must 
be completed within one year of the plan's date, except as described in 
paragraphs (i)(6)(i), (i)(7), and (i)(8) of this section. Owners or 
operators are temporarily relieved of this obligation if the appliance 
has undergone system mothballing as defined in Sec. 82.152.
    (i) If the owner or operator has made good faith efforts to repair 
leaks from the appliance in accordance with paragraphs (i)(1), (i)(2), 
or (i)(5) of this section and has decided prior to completing a follow-
up verification test, to retrofit or retire the appliance in accordance

radiological contamination and creating a safe working environment will 
require more than 30 weeks;
    (B) The operator notifies EPA within six months of the expiration of 
the 30-day period following the discovery of an exceedance of the 
applicable allowable annual leak rate to identify the operator, describe 
the appliance involved, explain why more than one year is needed, and 
demonstrate that the first criterion is met in accordance with Sec. 
82.166(o); and
    (C) The operator maintains records adequate to allow a determination 
that the criteria are met.
    (ii) The owners or operators of federally-owned commercial or 
comfort-cooling appliances may request additional time to complete 
retrofitting, replacement or retiring such appliances beyond the 
additional one-year period if needed and where the initial additional 
one year was granted in accordance with paragraph (i)(8)(i) of this 
section. The request shall be submitted to EPA before the end of the 
ninth month of the first additional year and shall include revisions of 
information earlier submitted as required under Sec. 82.166(o). Unless 
EPA objects to this request submitted in accordance with Sec. 82.166(o) 
within 30 days of receipt, it shall be deemed approved.
    (9) Owners or operators must repair leaks pursuant to paragraphs 
(i)(1), (i)(2) and (i)(5) of this section within 30 days after 
discovery, or within 30 days after when the leaks should have been 
discovered if the owners intentionally shielded themselves from 
information which would have revealed a leak, unless granted additional 
time pursuant to Sec. 82.156(i).
    (10) The amount of time for owners and operators to complete 
repairs, retrofit plans or retrofits/replacements/ retirements under 
paragraphs (i)(1), (i)(2), (i)(5), (i)(6), (i)(7), (i)(8), and (i)(9) of 
this section is temporarily suspended at the time an appliance is 
mothballed as defined in Sec. 82.152. The time for owners and operators 
to complete repairs, retrofit plans, or retrofits/replacements will 
resume on the day the appliance is brought back on-line and is no longer 
considered mothballed. All initial and follow-up verification tests must 
be performed in accordance with paragraphs (i)(3), (i)(3)(i), and 
(i)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (11) In calculating annual leak rates, purged refrigerant that is 
destroyed at a verifiable destruction efficiency of 98 percent or 
greater will not be counted toward the leak rate. Owners or operators 
destroying purged refrigerants must maintain information as set forth in 
Sec. 82.166(p)(1) and submit to EPA, within 60 days after the first 
time such exclusion is used by that facility, information set forth in 
Sec. 82.166(p)(2).

listed in appendix D and the following standards:
    (1) Alternative Examinations. Programs are encouraged to make 
provisions for non-English speaking technicians by providing tests in 
other languages or allowing the use of a translator when taking the 
test. If a translator is used, the certificate received must indicate 
that translator assistance was required. A test may be administered 
orally to any person who makes this request, in writing, to the program 
at least 30 days before the scheduled date for the examination. The 
letter must explain why the request is being made.
    (2) Recertification. The Administrator reserves the right to specify 
the need for technician recertification at some future date, if 
necessary, by placing a notice in the Federal Register.
    (3) Proof of Certification. Programs must issue individuals a 
wallet-sized card to be used as proof of certification, upon successful 
completion of the test. Programs must issue an identification card to 
technicians that receive a score of 70 percent or higher on the closed-
book certification exam, within 30 days. Programs providing Type I 
certification using the mail-in format, must issue a permanent 
identification card to technicians that receive a score of 84 percent or 
higher on the certification exam, no later than 30 days after the 
program has received the exam and any additional required material. Each 
card must include, at minimum, the name of the certifying program, and 
the date the organization became a certifying program, the name of the 
person certified, the type of certification, a unique number for the 
certified person, and the following text:
    [Name of person] has been certified as a [Type I, Type II, Type III, 
and/or Universal, as appropriate] technician as required by 40 CFR part 
82, subpart F.
    (4) The Administrator reserves the right to consider other factors 
deemed relevant to ensure the effectiveness of certification programs.
    (d) If approval is denied under this section, the Administrator 
shall give written notice to the program setting forth the basis for her 
or his determination.
    (e) If at any time an approved program violates any of the above 
requirements, the Administrator reserves the right to revoke approval in 
accordance with Sec. 82.169. In such cases, the Administrator or her or 
his designated representative shall give notice to the organization 
setting forth the basis for her or his determination.
    (f) Authorized representatives of the Administrator may require 
technicians to demonstrate on the business entity's premises their 
ability to perform proper procedures for recovering and/or recycling 
refrigerant. Failure to demonstrate or failure to properly use the 
equipment may result in revocation of the certificate. Failure to abide 
by any of the provisions of this subpart may also result in revocation 
or suspension of the certificate. If a technician's certificate is 
revoked, the technician would need to recertify before maintaining, 
servicing, repairing or disposing of any appliances.

[[Page 600]]

    (g)(1) Any person seeking approval of a technician certification 
program may also seek approval to certify technicians who successfully 
completed a voluntary certification program operated previously by that 
person. Interested persons must submit to the Administrator at the 
address in Sec. 82.160(a) verification that the voluntary certification 
program substantially complied with most of the standards of Sec. 
82.161(c) and appendix D of subpart F of this part. If the program did 
not test or train participants on some elements of the test subject 
material, the person must submit supplementary information on the 
omitted material to the Administrator for approval and verify that the 
approved information will be provided to technicians pursuant to section 
j of appendix D of subpart F of this part. In this case, the person may 
not issue a certification card to a technician until he or she has 
received a signed statement from the technician indicating that the 
technician has read the supplementary information. Approval may be 
granted for Type I, Type II, or Type III certification, or some 
combination of these, depending upon the coverage in the voluntary 
certification program of the information in each Type. In order to have 
their voluntary programs considered for approval, persons must submit 
applications both for approval as a technician certification program and 
for approval as a voluntary program by December 9, 1994.
    (2)(i) Persons who are approved to certify technicians who 
successfully completed their voluntary programs pursuant to Sec. 
82.161(g)(1) must:
    (A) Notify technicians who successfully completed their voluntary 
programs of the Administrator's decision within 60 days of that 
decision;
    (B) Send any supplementary materials required pursuant to Sec. 
82.161(g)(1) to technicians who successfully completed their voluntary 
programs within 60 days of the Administrator's decision; and
    (C) Send certification cards to technicians who successfully 
completed their voluntary programs within 60 days of receipt of signed 
statements from the technicians indicating that the technicians have 
read the supplementary information.
    (ii) Persons who are disapproved to certify technicians who 
successfully completed their voluntary programs pursuant to Sec. 
82.161(g)(1) must notify technicians who successfully completed their 
voluntary programs of the Administrator's decision within 30 days of 
that decision.
    (iii) Persons who withdraw applications for voluntary program 
approval submitted pursuant to Sec. 82.161(g)(1) must inform 
technicians who successfully completed their voluntary programs of the 
withdrawal by the later of 30 days after the withdrawal or December 9, 
1994.
    (3) Technicians who successfully completed voluntary certification 
programs may receive certification in a given Type through that program 
only if:
    (i) The voluntary certification program successfully completed by 
the technician is approved for that Type pursuant to Sec. 82.161(g)(1);
    (ii) The technician successfully completed the portions of the 
voluntary certification program that correspond to that Type; and
    (iii) The technician reads any supplementary materials required by 
the Administrator pursuant to Sec. 82.161(g)(1) and section j of 
appendix D of subpart F of this part, and returns the signed statement 
required by Sec. 82.161(g)(1).

  Section 5. Sampling, Summary of Test Methods and Maximum Permissible 
                           Contaminant Levels

    5.1 Referee Test. The referee test methods for the various 
contaminants are summarized in the following paragraphs. Detailed test 
procedures are included in Appendix C to ARI Standard 700-1995: 
Analytical Procedures for ARI Standard 700-1995, 1995, Air-Conditioning 
and Refrigeration Institute. Appendix C to ARI Standard 700-1995 is 
incorporated by reference. [This incorporation by reference was approved 
by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 
552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be obtained from the Air-
Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute, 4301 North Fairfax Drive, 
Arlington, Virginia 22203. Copies may also be inspected at Public Docket 
No. A-92-01, Environmental Protection Agency, 1301 Constitution Ave., 
NW., Washington, DC, 20460 or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 
North Capitol Street, NW., Suite 700, Washington, DC.] If alternative 
test methods are employed, the user must be able to demonstrate that 
they produce results equivalent to the specified referee method.
    5.2 Refrigerant Sampling
    5.2.1 Sampling Precautions. Special precautions should be taken to 
assure that representative samples are obtained for analysis. Sampling 
shall be done by trained laboratory personnel following accepted 
sampling and safety procedures.
    5.2.2 Gas Phase Sample. A gas phase sample shall be obtained for 
determining the non-condensables. Since non-condensable gases, if 
present, will concentrate in the vapor phase of the refrigerant, care 
must be exercised to eliminate introduction of air during the sample 
transfer. Purging is not an acceptable procedure for a gas phase sample 
since it may introduce a foreign product. Since R-11, R-113, and R-123 
have normal boiling points at or above room temperature, non-condensable 
determination is not required for these refrigerants.
    5.2.2.1 Connection. The sample cylinder shall be connected to an 
evacuated gas sampling bulb by means of a manifold. The manifold should 
have a valve arrangement that facilitates evacuation of all connecting 
tubing leading to the sampling bulb.
    5.2.2.2 Equalizing Pressures. After the manifold has been evacuated, 
close the valve to the pump and open the valve on the system. Allow the 
pressure to equilibrate and close valves.
    5.2.3 Liquid Phase Sample. A liquid phase sample is required for all 
tests listed in this standard except the test for non-condensables.
    5.2.3.1 Preparation. Place a clean, empty sample cylinder with the 
valve open in an oven at 110 [deg]C (230 [deg]F) for one hour. Remove it 
from the oven while hot, immediately connect to an evacuation system and 
evacuate

[[Page 609]]

to less than 1 mm mercury (1000 microns). Close the valve and allow it 
to cool. Weigh the empty cylinder.
    5.2.3.2 Manifolding. The valve and lines from the unit to be sampled 
shall be clean and dry. The cylinder shall be connected to an evacuated 
gas sampling cylinder by means of a manifold. The manifold should have a 
valve arrangement that facilitates evacuation of all connecting tubing 
leading to the sampling cylinder.
    5.2.3.3 Liquid Sampling. After the manifold has been evacuated, 
close the valve to the pump and open the valve on the system. Take the 
sample as a liquid by chilling the sample cylinder slightly. Accurate 
analysis requires that the sample container be filled to at least 60% by 
volume, however under no circumstances should the cylinder be filled to 
more than 80% by volume. This can be accomplished by weighing the empty 
cylinder and then the cylinder with refrigerant. When the desired amount 
of refrigerant has been collected, close the valve(s) and disconnect the 
sample cylinder immediately.
    5.2.3.4 Record Weight. Check the sample cylinder for leaks and 
record the gross weight.
    5.3 Refrigerant Characterization.
    5.3.1 Primary Method. The primary method shall be gas chromatography 
(GC) as described in Appendix C to ARI Standard 700-1995. The 
chromatogram of the sample shall be compared to known standards.
    5.3.2 Alternative Method. Determination of the boiling point and 
boiling point range is an acceptable alternative test method which can 
be used to characterize refrigerants. The test method shall be that 
described in the Federal Specification for ``Fluorocarbon 
Refrigerants,'' BB-F-1421 B, dated March 5, 1982, section 4.4.3.
    5.3.3 Required Values. The required values for boiling point and 
boiling point range are given in Table 1A, Physical Properties of Single 
Component Refrigerants; Table 1B, Physical Properties of Zeotropic 
Blends (400 Series Refrigerants); and Table 1C, Physical Properties of 
Azeotropic Blends (500 Series Refrigerants).
    5.4 Water Content.
    5.4.1 Method. The Coulometric Karl Fischer Titration shall be the 
primary test method for determining the water content of refrigerants. 
This method is described in Appendix C to ARI Standard 700-1995. This 
method can be used for refrigerants that are either a liquid or a gas at 
room temperature, including refrigerants 11, 113, and 123. For all 
refrigerants, the sample for water analysis shall be taken from the 
liquid phase of the container to be tested. Proper operation of the 
analytical method requires special equipment and an experienced 
operator. The precision of the results is excellent if proper sampling 
and handling procedures are followed. Refrigerants containing a colored 
dye can be successfully analyzed for water using this method.
    5.4.2 Limits. The value for water content shall be expressed as 
parts per million (ppm) by weight and shall not exceed the maximum 
specified (see Tables 1A, 1B, and 1C).
    5.5 Chloride.
    The refrigerant shall be tested for chloride as an indication of the 
presence of hydrochloric acid and/or metal chlorides. The recommended 
procedure is intended for use with new or reclaimed refrigerants. 
Significant amounts of oil may interfere with the results by indicating 
a failure in the absence of chloride.
    5.5.1 Method. The test method shall be that described in Appendix C 
to ARI Standard 700-1995. The test will show noticeable turbidity at 
chloride levels of about 3 ppm by weight or higher.
    5.5.2 Turbidity. The results of the test shall not exhibit any sign 
of turbidity. Report the results as ``pass'' or ``fail.''
    5.6 Acidity.
    5.6.1 Method. The acidity test uses the titration principle to 
detect any compound that is highly soluble in water and ionizes as an 
acid. The test method shall be that described in Appendix C to ARI 
Standard 700-1995. This test may not be suitable for determination of 
high molecular weight organic acids; however these acids will be found 
in the high boiling residue test outlined in 5.7. The test requires a 
100 to 120 gram sample and has a detection limit of 0.1 ppm by weight 
calculated as HCl.
    5.6.2 Limits. The maximum permissible acidity is 1 ppm by weight as 
HCl.
    5.7 High Boiling Residue.
    5.7.1 Method. High boiling residue shall be determined by measuring 
the residue of a standard volume of refrigerant after evaporation. The 
refrigerant sample shall be evaporated at room temperature or at a 
temperature 45 [deg]C (115 [deg]F) for all refrigerants, except R-113 
which shall be evaporated at 60 [deg]C (140 [deg]F), using a Goetz bulb 
as specified in Appendix C to ARI Standard 700-1995. Oils and/or organic 
acids will be captured by this method.
    5.7.2 Limits. The value for high boiling residue shall be expressed 
as a percentage by volume and shall not exceed the maximum percent 
specified (see Tables 1A, 1B, and 1C). An alternative gravimetric method 
is described in Appendix C to ARI Standard 700-1995.
    5.8 Method of Tests for Particulates and Solids.
    5.8.1 Method. A measured amount of sample is evaporated from a Goetz 
bulb under controlled temperature conditions. The particulates/solids 
shall be determined by visual examination of the Goetz bulb prior to the 
evaporation of refrigerant. Presence of dirt, rust or other particulate 
contamination is reported as ``fail.'' For details of this test

[[Page 610]]

method, refer to Part 3 of Appendix C to ARI Standard 700-1995.
    5.9 Non-Condensables.
    5.9.1 Sample. A vapor phase sample shall be used for determination 
of non-condensables. Non-condensable gases consist primarily of air 
accumulated in the vapor phase of refrigerants. The solubility of air in 
the refrigerants liquid phase is extremely low and air is not 
significant as a liquid phase contaminant. The presence of non-
condensable gases may reflect poor quality control in transferring 
refrigerants to storage tanks and cylinders.
    5.9.2 Method. The test method shall be gas chromatography with a 
thermal conductivity detector as described in Appendix C to ARI Standard 
700-1995.
    5.9.3 Limit. The maximum level of non-condensables in the vapor 
phase of a refrigerant in a container shall not exceed 1.5% by volume 
(see Tables 1A, 1B, and 1C).
    5.10 Impurities, including Other Refrigerants.
    5.10.1 Method. The amount of other impurities including other 
refrigerants in the subject refrigerant shall be determined by gas 
chromatography as described in Appendix C to ARI Standard 700-1995.
    5.10.2 Limit. The subject refrigerant shall not contain more than 
0.5% by weight of impurities including other refrigerants (see Tables 
1A, 1B, and 1C).

                     Section 6. Reporting Procedure

    6.1 Reporting Procedure. The source (manufacturer, reclaimer or 
repackager) of the packaged refrigerant shall be identified. The 
refrigerant shall be identified by its accepted refrigerant number and/
or its chemical name. Maximum permissible levels of contaminants are 
shown in Tables 1A, 1B, and 1C. Test results shall be tabulated in a 
like manner.

  Sec. Appendix B1 to Subpart F of Part 82--Performance of Refrigerant 
              Recovery, Recycling and/or Reclaim Equipment

    This appendix is based on the Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration 
Institute Standard 740-1993.

                Refrigerant Recovery/Recycling Equipment

                           Section 1. Purpose

    1.1 Purpose. The purpose of this standard is to establish methods of 
testing for rating and evaluating the performance of refrigerant 
recovery, and/or recycling equipment, and general equipment requirements 
(herein referred to as ``equipment'') for containment or purity levels, 
capacity, speed, and purge loss to minimize emission into the atmosphere 
of designated refrigerants.
    1.1.1 This standard is intended for the guidance of the industry, 
including manufacturers, refrigerant reclaimers, repackers, 
distributors, installers, servicemen, contractors and for consumers.
    1.1.2 This standard is not intended to be used as a guide in 
defining maximum levels of contaminants in recycled or reclaimed 
refrigerants used in various applications.
    1.2 Review and Amendment. This standard is subject to review and 
amendment as the technology advances.

                            Section 2. Scope

    2.1 Scope. This standard defines general equipment requirements and 
the test apparatus, test mixtures, sampling and analysis techniques that 
will be used to determine the performance of recovery and/or recycling 
equipment for various refrigerants including R11, R12, R13, R22, R113, 
R114, R123, R134a, R500, R502, and R503, as referenced in the ANSI/
ASHRAE Standard 34-1992, ``Number Designation of Refrigerants'' 
(American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning 
Engineers, Inc.).

                         Section 3. Definitions

    3.1 Recovered refrigerant. Refrigerant that has been removed from a 
system for the purpose of storage, recycling, reclamation or 
transportation.
    3.2 Recover. Reference 40 CFR 82.152.
    3.3 Recycle. Reference 40 CFR 82.152.
    3.4 Reclaim. Reference 40 CFR 82.152.
    3.5 Standard Contaminated Refrigerant Sample. A mixture of new and/
or reclaimed refrigerant and specified quantities of identified 
contaminants which are representative of field obtained, used 
refrigerant samples and which constitute the mixture to be processed by 
the equipment under test.
    3.6 Push/Pull Method. The push/pull refrigerant recovery method is 
defined as the process of transferring liquid refrigerant from a 
refrigeration system to a receiving vessel by lowering the pressure in 
the vessel and raising the pressure in the system, and by connecting a 
separate line between the system liquid port and the receiving vessel.
    3.7 Recycle Rate. The amount of refrigerant processed (in pounds) 
divided by the time elapsed in the recycling mode in pounds per minute. 
For equipment which uses a separate recycling sequence, the recycle rate 
does not include the recovery rate (or elapsed time). For equipment 
which does not use a separate recycling sequence, the recycle rate is a 
maximum rate based solely on the higher of the liquid or vapor recovery 
rate, by which the rated contaminant levels can be achieved.
    3.8 Equipment Classification.
    3.8.1 Self Contained Equipment. A refrigerant recovery or recycling 
system which is capable of refrigerant extraction without the assistance 
of components contained within an air conditioning or refrigeration 
system.

[[Page 616]]

    3.8.2 System Dependent Equipment. Refrigerant recovery equipment 
which requires for its operation the assistance of components contained 
in an air conditioning or refrigeration system.
    3.9 ``Shall'', ``Should'', ``Recommended'' or ``It is Recommended'', 
``Shall'' ``Should'', ``recommended'', or ``it is recommended'' shall be 
interpreted as follows:
    3.9.1 Shall. Where ``shall'' or ``shall not'' is used for a 
provision specified, that provision is mandatory if compliance with the 
standard is claimed.
    3.9.2 Should, Recommended, or It is Recommended, ``Should'', 
``recommended'', is used to indicate provisions which are not mandatory 
but which are desirable as good practice.

                Section 4. General Equipment Requirements

    4.1 The equipment manufacturer shall provide operating instructions, 
necessary maintenance procedures, and source information for replacement 
parts and repair.
    4.2 The equipment shall indicate when any filter/drier(s) needs 
replacement. This requirement can be met by use of a moisture transducer 
and indicator light, by use of a sight glass/moisture indicator, or by 
some measurement of the amount of refrigerant processed such as a flow 
meter or hour meter. Written instructions such as ``to change the filter 
every 400 pounds, or every 30 days'' shall not be acceptable except for 
equipment in large systems where the Liquid Recovery Rate is greater 
than 25 lbs/min [11.3 Kg/min] where the filter/drier(s) would be changed 
for every job.
    4.3 The equipment shall either automatically purge non-condensables 
if the rated level is exceeded or alert the operator that the non-
condensable level has been exceeded. While air purge processes are 
subject to the requirements of this section, there is no specific 
requirement to include an air purge process for ``recycle'' equipment.
    4.4 The equipment's refrigerant loss due to non-condensable purging 
shall not be exceeded 5% by weight of total recovered refrigerant. (See 
Section 9.4)
    4.5 Internal hose assemblies shall not exceed a permeation rate of 
12 pounds mass per square foot [5.8 g/cm \2\] of internal surface per 
year at a temperature of 120 F [48.8 [deg]C] for any designated 
refrigerant.
    4.6 The equipment shall be evaluated at 75 F [24 [deg]C] per 7.1. 
Normal operating conditions range from 50 [deg]F to 104 F [10 [deg]C to 
40 [deg]C].
    4.7 Exemptions:
    4.7.1 Equpment intended for recovery only shall be exempt from 
sections 4.2 and 4.3.

                  Section 5. Contaminated Refrigerants

    5.1 The standard contaminated refrigerant sample shall have the 
characteristics specified in Table 1, except as provided in 5.2
    5.2 Recovery equipment not rated for any specific contaminant can be 
tested with new or reclaimed refrigerant.

                        Section 6. Test Apparatus

    6.1 Self Contained Equipment Test Apparatus. The apparatus as shown 
in Figure 1 consists of a 3 cubic foot [0.085 m\3\] mixing chamber with 
a conical-shaped bottom, although a larger mixing chamber is 
permissible. The size of the mixing chamber depends upon the size of the 
equipment. The outlet at the bottom of the cone and all restrictions and 
valves for liquid and vapor refrigerant lines in the test apparatus 
shall be a minimum of 0.375 in. [9.5 mm] inside diameter or equivalent. 
The minimum inside diameter for large equipment for use on chillers 
shall be 1.5 in. [38 mm.]. The mixing chamber shall contain various 
ports for receiving liquid refrigerant, oil, and contaminants. A 
recirculating line connected from the bottom outlet through a 
recirculating pump and then to a top vapor port shall be provided for 
stirring of the mixture. Isolation valves may be required for the pump. 
Alternative stirring means may be used if demonstrated to be equally 
effective.
    6.1.1 For liquid refrigerant feed, the liquid valve is opened. For 
vapor refrigerant feed, the vapor valve is opened and refrigerant passes 
through an evaporator coil. Flow is controlled by a thermostatic 
expansion valve to create 5 F [3 [deg]C] superheat at an evaporator 
temperature of 70 F <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3 F[21 [deg]C<plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>2[deg]]. The evaporator coil or equivalent evaporator 
means shall be either sized large enough for the largest system or be 
sized for each system.
    6.1.2 An alternative method for vapor refrigerant feed is to pass 
through a boiler and then an automatic pressure regulating valve set at 
refrigerant saturation pressure at 75 F <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3 F [24 
[deg]C <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 [deg]C].
    6.2 System Dependent Equipment Test Apparatus. This test apparatus 
is to be used for final recovery vacuum rating of all system dependent 
equipment.
    6.2.1 The test apparatus shown in Figure 2 consists of a complete 
refrigeration system. The manufacturer shall identify the refrigerants 
to be tested. The test apparatus can be modified to facilitate operation 
or testing of the system dependent equipment if the modifications to the 
apparatus are specifically described within the manufacturer's 
literature. (See Figure 2.) A \1/4\ inch [6.3 mm] balance line shall be 
connected across the test apparatus between the high and low pressure 
sides, with an isolation valve located at the connection to the 
compressor high side. A \1/4\ inch [6.3 mm] access port with a valve 
core shall be located in the balance line for the purpose of measuring 
final recovery vacuum at the conclusion of the test.

                     Section 7. Performance Testing

    7.1 Contaminant removal and performance testing shall be conducted 
at 75 F <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 F [23.9 [deg]C <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1.1 
[deg]C].
    7.1.1 The equipment shall be prepared for operation per the 
instruction manual.
    7.1.2 The contaminated sample batch shall consist of not less than 
the sum of the amounts required to complete steps 7.1.2.2 and 7.1.2.3 
below.
    7.1.2.1 A liquid sample shall be drawn from the mixing chamber prior 
to starting the test to assure quality control of the mixing process.
    7.1.2.2 Vapor refrigerant feed testing, if elected, shall normally 
be processed first. After the equipment reaches stabilized conditions of 
condensing temperature and/or storage tank pressure, the vapor feed 
recovery rate shall be measured. One method is to start measuring the 
vapor refrigerant recovery rate when 85% of refrigerant remains in the 
mixing chamber and continue for a period of time sufficient to achieve 
the accuracy in 9.2. If liquid feed is not elected, complete Step 
7.1.2.4.
    7.1.2.3 Liquid refrigerant feed testing, if elected, shall be 
processed next. After the equipment reaches stabilized conditions, the 
liquid feed recovery rate shall be measured. One method is to wait 2 
minutes after starting liquid feed and then measure the liquid 
refrigerant recovery rate for a period of time sufficient to achieve the 
accuracy in 9.1. Continue liquid recovery operation as called for in 
7.1.2.4.
    7.1.2.4 Continue recovery operation until all liquid is removed from 
the mixing chamber and vapor is removed to the point where the equipment 
shuts down per automatic means or is manually stopped per the operating 
instructions.
    7.1.2.5 After collecting the first contaminated refrigerant sample 
batch, the liquid and vapor value of the apparatus shall be closed and 
the mixing chamber pressure recorded after 1 minute as required in 9.5. 
After preparing a second contaminated refrigerant sample batch, continue 
recovery until the storage container reaches 80% liquid fill level. 
After recycling and measuring

[[Page 620]]

the recycle rate per section 7.1.3, set this container aside for the 
vapor sample in 8.2.2.
    7.1.2.6 Interruptions in equipment operations as called for in 
instruction manual are allowable.
    7.1.3 Recycle as called for in equipment operating instructions. 
Determine recycle rate by appropriate means as required in 9.3.
    7.1.4 Repeat steps 7.1.2, 7.1.2.4, and 7.1.3 with contaminated 
refrigerant sample until equipment indicator(s) show need to change 
filter(s). It will not be necessary to repeat the recycle rate 
determination in 7.1.3.
    7.1.4.1 For equipment with a multiple pass recirculating filter 
system, analyze the contents of the previous storage container.
    7.1.4.2 For equipment with a single pass filter system, analyze the 
contents of the current storage container.
    7.1.5 Refrigerant loss due to the equipment's non-condensable gas 
purge shall be determined by appropriate means. (See Section 9.4.)
    7.2 System Dependent Equipment. This procedure shall be used for 
vacuum rating of all system dependent equipment. Liquid refrigerant 
recovery rate, vapor refrigerant recovery rate, and recycle rate are not 
tested on system dependent systems.
    7.2.1 The apparatus operation and testing shall be conducted at 75 F 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 F. [23.9 [deg]C. <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>/1.1. 
[deg]C.].
    7.2.2 The apparatus shall be charged with refrigerant per its system 
design specifications.
    7.2.3 For measurement of final recovery vacuum as required in 9.5, 
first shut the balance line isolation valve and wait 1 minute for 
pressure to balance. Then connect and operate the recovery system per 
manufacturers recommendations. When the evacuation is completed, open 
the balance line isolation valve and measure the pressure in the balance 
line.

            Section 8. Sampling and Chemical Analysis Methods

    8.1 The referee test methods for the various contaminants are 
summarized in the following paragraphs. Detailed test procedures are 
included in Appendix A ``Test Procedures for ARI STD 700.'' If alternate 
test methods are employed, the user must be able to demonstrate that 
they produce results equivalent to the specified referee method.
    8.2 Refrigerant Sampling.
    8.2.1 Sampling Precautions. Special precautions should be taken to 
assure that representative samples are obtained for analysis. Sampling 
shall be done by trained laboratory personnel following accepted 
sampling and safety procedures.
    8.2.2 Gas Phase Sample. A gas phase sample shall be obtained for 
determining the non-condensables. Since non-condensable gases, if 
present, will concentrate in the vapor phase of the refrigerant, care 
must be exercised to eliminate introduction of air during the sample 
transfer. Purging is not and acceptable procedure for a gas phase sample 
since it may introduce a foreign product. Since R11, R113 and R123 have 
normal boiling points at or above room temperature, noncondensable 
determination is not required for these refrigerants.
    8.2.2.1 The sample cylinder shall be connected to an evacuated gas 
sampling bulb by means of a manifold. The manifold should have a valve 
arrangement that facilitates evacuation of all connecting tubing leading 
to the sampling bulb.
    8.2.2.2 After the manifold has been evacuated, close the valve to 
the pump and open the valve on the system. Allow the pressure to 
equilibrate and close valves.
    8.2.3 Liquid Phase Sample. A liquid phase sample is required for all 
tests listed in this standard, except the test for non-condensables.
    8.2.3.1 Place an empty sample cylinder with the valve open in an 
oven at 230 F [110 [deg]C] for one hour. Remove it from the oven while 
hot, immediately connect to an evacuation system and evacuate to less 
than 1mm. mercury (1000 microns). Close the valve and allow it to cool.
    8.2.3.2 The valve and lines from the unit to be sampled shall be 
clean and dry. Connect the line to the sample cylinder loosely. Purge 
through the loose connection. Make the connection tight at the end of 
the purge period. Take the sample as a liquid by chilling the sample 
cylinder slightly. Accurate analysis requires that the sample container 
be filled to at least 60% by volume; however under no circumstances 
should the cylinder be filled to more than 80% by volume. This can be 
accomplished by weighing the empty cylinder and then the cylinder with 
refrigerant. When the desired amount of refrigerant has been collected, 
close the valve(s) and disconnect the sample cylinder immediately.
    8.2.3.3 Check the sample cylinder for leaks and record the gross 
weight.
    8.3 Water Content.
    8.3.1. The Coulometric Karl Fischer Titration shall be the primary 
test method for determining the water content of refrigerants. This 
method is described in Appendix A. This method can be used for 
refrigerants that are either a liquid or a gas at room temperature, 
including Refrigerants 11 and 13. For all refrigerants, the sample for 
water analysis shall be taken from the liquid phase of the container to 
be tested. Proper operation of the analytical method requires special 
equipment and an experienced operator. The precision of the results is 
excellent if proper sampling and handling procedures are followed. 
Refrigerants containing a colored dye can be successfully analyzed for 
water using this method.

[[Page 621]]

    8.3.2 The Karl Fischer Test Method is an acceptable alternative test 
method for determining the water content of refrigerants. This method is 
described in ASTM Standard for ``Water in gases Using Karl Fisher 
Reagent'' E700-79, reapproved 1984 (American Society for Testing and 
Materials, Philadelphia, PA).
    8.3.3 Report the moisture level in parts per million by weight if a 
sample is required.
    8.4 Chloride. The refrigerant shall be tested for chlorides as an 
indication of the presence of hydrochloric or similar acids. The 
recommended procedure is intended for use with new or reclaimed 
refrigerants. Significant amounts of oil may interfere with the results 
by indicating a failure in the absence of chlorides.
    8.4.1 The test method shall be that described in Appendix A ``Test 
Procedures for ARI-700.'' The test will show noticeable turbidity at 
equivalent chloride levels of about 3 ppm by weight or higher.
    8.4.2 The results of the test shall not exhibit any sign of turbity. 
Report results as ``pass'' or ``fail.''
    8.5 Acidity.
    8.5.1 The acidity test uses the titration principle to detect any 
compound that is highly soluble in water and ionizes as an acid. The 
test method shall be that described in Appendix A. ``Test Procedures for 
ARI-700.'' The test may not be suitable for determination of high 
molecular weight organic acids; however these acids will be found in the 
high boiling residue test outlined in Section 5.7. The test requires 
about a 100 to 120 gram sample and has a low detection limit of 0.1 ppm 
by weight as HC1.
    8.6 High Boiling Residue.
    8.6.1 High boiling residue will be determined by measuring the 
residue of a standard volume of refrigerant after evaporation. The 
refrigerant sample shall be evaporated at room temperature or a 
temperature 50 F [10[deg].0C], above the boiling point of the sample 
using a Goetz tube as specified in Appendix A ``Test Procedures for ARI-
700.'' Oils and or organic acids will be captured by this method.
    8.6.2 The value for high boiling residue shall be expressed as a 
percentage by volume.
    8.7 Particulates/Solids.
    8.7.1 A measured amount of sample is evaporated from a Goetz bulb 
under controlled temperature conditions. The particulates/solids shall 
be determined by visual examination of the empty Goetz bulb after the 
sample has evaporated completely. Presence of dirt, rust or other 
particulate contamination is reported a ``fail.'' For details of this 
test method, refer to Appendix B ``Test Procedures for ARI-700.''
    8.8 Non-Condensables
    8.8.1 A vapor phase sample shall be used for determination of non-
condensables. Non-condensable gases consist primarily of air accumulated 
in the vapor phase of refrigerant containing tanks. The solubility of 
air in the refrigerants liquid phase is extremely low and air is not 
significant as a liquid phase contaminant. The presence of non-
condensable gases may reflect poor quality control in transferring 
refrigerants to storage tanks and cylinders.
    8.8.2 The test method shall be gas chromatography with a thermal 
conductivity detector as described in Appendix A ``Test Procedures for 
ARI-700.''
    8.8.2.1 The Federal Specification for ``Fluorocarbon Refrigerants,'' 
BB-F-1421B, dated March 5, 1992, section 4.4.2 (perchloroethylene 
method) is an acceptable alternate test method.
    8.8.3 Report the level of non-condensable as percent by volume.

              Section 9. Performance Calculation and Rating

    9.1 The liquid refrigerant recovery rate shall be expressed in 
pounds per minute [kg/min] and measured by weight change at the mixing 
chamber (See Figure 1) divided by elapsed time to an accuracy within .02 
lbs/min. [.009 kg/min]. Ratings using the Push/Pull method shall be 
identified ``Push/Pull''. Equipment may be rated by both methods.
    9.2 The vapor refrigerant recovery rate shall be expressed in pounds 
per minute [kg/min] and measured by weight change at the mixing chamber 
(See Figure 1) divided by elapsed time to an accuracy within .02 lbs/
min. [.0.009 kg/min].
    9.3 The recycle rate is defined in 3.7 and expressed in pounds per 
minute [kg/min] of flow and shall be per ASHRAE 41.7-84 ``Procedure For 
Fluid Measurement Of Gases'' or ASHRAE 41.8-89 ``Standard Method of Flow 
of Fluids--Liquids.''
    9.3.1 For equipment using multipass recycling or a separate 
sequence, the recycle rate shall be determined by dividing the net 
weight W of the refrigerant to be recycled by the actual time T required 
to recycle the refrigerant. Any set-up or operator interruptions shall 
not be included in the time T. The accuracy of the recycle rate shall be 
within .02 lbs/min. [.009 kg/min].
    9.3.2 If no separate recycling sequence is used, the recycle rate 
shall be the higher of the vapor refrigerant recovery rate or the liquid 
refrigerant recovery rate. The recycle rate shall match a process which 
leads to contaminant levels in 9.6. Specifically, a recovery rate 
determined from bypassing a contaminant removal device cannot be used as 
a recycle rate when the contaminant levels in 9.6 are determined by 
passing the refrigerant through the containment removal device.
    9.4 Refrigerant loss due to non-condensable purging shall be less 
than 5%. This rating shall be expressed as ``passed'' if less than 5%.

[[Page 622]]

    This calculation will be based upon net loss of non-condensables and 
refrigerant due to the purge divided by the initial net content. The net 
loss shall be determined by weighing before and after the purge, by 
collecting purged gases, or an equivalent method.
    9.5 The final recovery vacuum shall be the mixing chamber pressure 
called for in 7.1.2.5 expressed in inches of mercury vacuum, [mm Hg or 
kP]. The accuracy of the measurement shall be within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>.1 inch [<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.5mm] of Hg and rounding 
down to the nearest whole number.
    9.6 The contaminant levels remaining after testing shall be 
published as follows:

Moisture content, PPM by weight
Chloride ions, Pass/Fail
Acidity, PPM by weight
High boiling residue, percentage by volume
Particulate/solid, Pass/Fail
Non-condensables, % by volume

    9.7 Product Literature: Except as provided under product labelling 
in Section 11. performance ratings per 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, and 9.5 must be 
grouped together and shown for all listed refrigerants (11.2) subject to 
limitations of 9.8. Wherever any contaminant levels per 9.6 are rated, 
all ratings in 9.6 must be shown for all listed refrigerants subject to 
limitations of 9.8. The type of equipment in 11.1 must be included with 
either grouping. Optional ratings in 9.8 need not be shown.
    9.8 Ratings shall include all of the parameters for each designed 
refrigerant in 11.2 as shown in Tables 2 and 3.

    Particulate Used in Standard Contaminated Refrigerant Sample.

[[Page 623]]

                      1. Particulate Specification

    1.1 The particulate material pm will be a blend of 50% coarse air 
cleaner dust as received, and 50% retained on a 200-mesh screen. The 
coarse air cleaner dust is available from: AC Spark Plug Division, 
General Motors Corporation, Flint, Michigan.

                1.2 Preparation of Particulate Materials

    To prepare the blend of contaminant, first wet screen a quantity of 
coarse air cleaner dust on a 200-mesh screen (particle retention 74 pm). 
This is done by placing a portion of the dust on a 200-mesh screen and

fingers. The fine contaminant particles passing through the screen are 
discarded. The +200 mesh particles collected on the screen are removed 
and dried for one hour at 230 F [110 [deg]C]. The blend of standard 
contaminant is prepared by mixing 50% by weight of coarse air cleaner 
dust as received after drying for one hour at 230 F [110 [deg]C] with 
50% by weight of the +200 mesh screened dust.

  Sec. Appendix B2 to Subpart F of Part 82--Performance of Refrigerant 
              Recovery, Recycling, and/or Reclaim Equipment

    This appendix is based on the Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration 
Institute Standard 740-1995.

                           Section 1. Purpose

    1.1 Purpose. The purpose of this standard is to establish methods of 
testing for rating and evaluating the performance of refrigerant 
recovery, and/or recycling equipment and general equipment requirements 
(herein referred to as ``equipment'') for contaminant or purity levels, 
capacity, speed and purge loss to minimize emission into the atmosphere 
of designated refrigerants.

                            Section 2. Scope

    2.1 Scope. This standard applies to equipment for recovering and/or 
recycling single refrigerants, azeotropics, zeotropic blends, and their 
normal contaminants from refrigerant systems. This standard defines the 
test apparatus, test gas mixtures, sampling procedures and analytical 
techniques that will be used to determine the performance of refrigerant 
recovery and/or recycling equipment (hereinafter, ``equipment'').

                         Section 3. Definitions

    3.1 Definitions. All terms in this appendix will follow the 
definitions in Sec. 82.152 unless otherwise defined in this appendix.
    3.2 Clearing Refrigerant. Procedures used to remove trapped 
refrigerant from equipment before switching from one refrigerant to 
another.
    3.3 High Temperature Vapor Recovery Rate. For equipment having at 
least one designated refrigerant (see 11.2) with a boiling point in the 
range of -50 to +10 [deg]C, the rate will be measured for R-22, or the 
lowest boiling point refrigerant if R-22 is not a designated 
refrigerant.
    3.4 Published Ratings. A statement of the assigned values of those 
performance characteristics, under stated rating conditions, by which a 
unit may be chosen to fit its application. These values apply to all 
units of like nominal size and type (identification) produced by the 
same manufacturer. As used herein, the term ``published rating'' 
includes the rating of all performance characteristics shown on the unit 
or published in specifications, advertising or other literature 
controlled by the manufacturer, at stated rating conditions.
    3.5 Push/Pull Method. The push/pull refrigerant recovery method is 
defined as the process of transferring liquid refrigerant from a 
refrigeration system to a receiving vessel by lowering the pressure in 
the vessel and raising the pressure in the system, and by connecting a 
separate line between the system liquid port and the receiving vessel.
    3.6 Recycle Flow Rate. The amount of refrigerant processed divided 
by the time elapsed in the recycling mode. For equipment which uses a 
separate recycling sequence, the recycle rate does not include the 
recovery rate (or elapsed time). For equipment which does not use a 
separate recycling sequence, the recycle rate is a rate based solely on 
the higher of the liquid or vapor recovery rate, by which the 
contaminant levels were measured.
    3.7 Residual Trapped Refrigerant. Refrigerant remaining in equipment 
after clearing.
    3.8 Shall, Should, Recommended or It Is Recommended shall be 
interpreted as follows:
    3.8.1 Shall. Where ``shall'' or ``shall not'' is used for a 
provision specified, that provision

[[Page 624]]

is mandatory if compliance with this appendix is claimed.
    3.8.2 Should, Recommended or It Is Recommended is used to indicate 
provisions which are not mandatory but which are desirable as good 
practice.
    3.9 Standard Contaminated Refrigerant Sample. A mixture of new or 
reclaimed refrigerant and specified quantities of identified 
contaminants which constitute the mixture to be processed by the 
equipment under test. These contaminant levels are expected only from 
severe service conditions.
    3.10 Trapped Refrigerant. The amount of refrigerant remaining in the 
equipment after the recovery or recovery/recycling operation but before 
clearing.
    3.11 Vapor Recovery Rate. The average rate that refrigerant is 
withdrawn from the mixing chamber between two pressures as vapor 
recovery rate is changing pressure and temperature starting at saturated 
conditions either 24 [deg]C or at the boiling point 100 kPa (abs), 
whichever is higher. The final pressure condition is 10% of the initial 
pressure, but not lower than the equipment final recovery vacuum and not 
higher than 100 kPa (abs).

                Section 4. General Equipment Requirements

    4.1 Equipment Information. The equipment manufacturer shall provide 
operating instructions, necessary maintenance procedures and source 
information for replacement parts and repair.
    4.2 Filter Replacement. The equipment shall indicate when any 
filter/drier(s) needs replacement. This requirement can be met by use of 
a moisture transducer and indicator light, by use of a sight glass/
moisture indicator or by some measurement of the amount of refrigerant 
processed such as a flow meter or hour meter. Written instructions such 
as ``to change the filter every 181 kg, or every 30 days'' shall not be 
acceptable except for equipment in large systems where the liquid 
recovery rate is greater than 11.3 kg/min where the filter/drier(s) 
would be changed for every job.
    4.3 Purge of Non-Condensable. If non-condensables are purged, the 
equipment shall either automatically purge non-condensables or provide 
indicating means to guide the purge process.
    4.4 Purge Loss. The total refrigerant loss due to purging non-
condensables, draining oil and clearing refrigerant (see 9.5) shall be 
less than 3% (by weight) of total processed refrigerant.
    4.5 Permeation Rate. High pressure hose assemblies \5/8\ in. [16 mm] 
nominal and smaller shall not exceed a permeation rate of 3.9 g/cm\2\/yr 
(internal surface) at a temperature of 48.8 [deg]C. Hose assemblies that 
UL recognized as having passed ANSI/UL 1963 requirements shall be 
accepted without testing. See 7.1.4.
    4.6 Clearing Trapped Refrigerant. For equipment rated for more than 
one refrigerant, the manufacturer shall provide a method and 
instructions which will accomplish connections and clearing within 15 
minutes. Special equipment, other than a vacuum pump or manifold gauge 
set shall be furnished. The clearing procedure shall not rely upon the 
storage cylinder below saturated pressure conditions at ambient 
temperature.
    4.7 Temperature. The equipment shall be evaluated at 24 [deg]C with 
additional limited evaluation at 40 [deg]C. Normal operating conditions 
range from 10 [deg]C to 40 [deg]C.
    4.8 Exemptions. Equipment intended for recovery only shall be exempt 
from 4.2 and 4.3.

specific contaminant shall be tested with new or reclaimed refrigerant.

                        Section 6. Test Apparatus

    6.1 General Recommendations. The recommended test apparatus is 
described in the following paragraphs. If alternate test apparatus are 
employed, the user shall be able to demonstrate that they produce 
results equivalent to the specified referee apparatus.

conical-shaped bottom, a bottom port and piping for delivering 
refrigerant to the equipment, various ports and valves for adding 
refrigerant to the chamber and stirring means for mixing.
    6.2.2 Filling Storage Cylinder. The storage cylinder to be filled by 
the refrigerant transferred shall be cleaned and at the pressure of the 
recovered refrigerant at the beginning of the test. It will not be 
filled over 80%, by volume.
    6.2.3 Vapor Feed. Vapor refrigerant feed consisting of evaporator, 
control valves and piping to create a 3.0 [deg]C superheat condition at 
an evaporating temperature of 21 [deg]C <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2K.
    6.2.4 Alternative Vapor Feed. An alternative method for vapor feed 
shall be to pass the refrigerant through a boiler and then through an 
automatic pressure regulating valve set at different saturation 
pressures, moving from saturated pressure at 24 [deg]C to final pressure 
of recovery.

    6.3 Size. The size of the mixing chamber shall be a minimum of .09 
m\3\. The bottom port and the refrigerant feed shall depend on the size 
of the equipment. Typically, the mixing valves and piping shall be 9.5 
mm. For large equipment to be used on chillers, the minimum inside 
diameter of ports, valves and pipings shall be the smaller of the 
manufacturer's recommendation or 37 mm.
    6.4 System Dependent Equipment Test Apparatus. This test apparatus 
is to be used for final recovery vacuum rating of all system dependent 
equipment.

[[Page 627]]

    6.4.1 Test Setup. The test apparatus shown in Figure 2 consists of a 
complete refrigeration system. The manufacturer shall identify the 
refrigerants to be tested. The test apparatus can be modified to 
facilitate operation or testing of the system dependent equipment if the 
modifications to the apparatus are specifically described within the 
manufacturer's literature. (See Figure 2.) A 6.3 mm balance line shall 
be connected across the test apparatus between the high and low-pressure 
sides, with an isolation valve located at the connection to the 
compressor high side. A 6.3 mm access port with a valve core shall be 
located in the balance line for the purpose of measuring final recovery 
vacuum at the conclusion of the test.

                     Section 7. Performance Testing

    7.1 General Testing.
    7.1.1 Temperatures. Testing shall be conducted at an ambient 
temperature of 24 [deg]C <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1K except high 
temperature vapor recovery shall be at 40 [deg]C <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>1K. The evaporator conditions of 6.2.3 shall be 
maintained as long as liquid refrigerant remains in the mixing chamber.
    7.1.2 Refrigerants. The equipment shall be tested for all designated 
refrigerants (see 11.2). All tests in Section 7 shall be completed for 
each refrigerant before starting tests with the next refrigerant.
    7.1.3 Selected Tests. Tests shall be as appropriate for the 
equipment type and ratings parameters selected (see 9.9, 11.1 and 11.2).
    7.1.4 Hose Assemblies. For the purpose of limiting refrigerant 
emissions to the atmosphere, hose assemblies shall be tested for 
permeation according to ANSI/UL Standard 1963, Section 40.10.
    7.2 Equipment Preparation and Operation. The equipment shall be 
prepared and operated per the operating instructions.
    7.3 Test Batch. The test batch consisting of refrigerant sample (see 
Section 5) of the test refrigerant shall be prepared and thoroughly 
mixed. Continued mixing or stirring shall be required during the test 
while liquid refrigerant remains in the mixing chamber. The mixing 
chamber shall be filled to 80% level by volume.
    7.3.1 Control Test Batch. Prior to starting the test for the first 
batch for each refrigerant, a liquid sample will be drawn from the 
mixing chamber and analyzed per Section 8 to assure that contaminant 
levels match Table 1 within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>10 ppm for moisture, 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>20 ppm for particulate, <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>20 
ppm for oleic acid and <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5% for oil.
    7.4 Recovery Tests (Recovery and Recovery/Recycle Equipment).
    7.4.1 Determining Recovery Rates. The liquid and vapor refrigerant 
recovery rates shall be measured during the first test batch for each 
refrigerant (see 9.1, 9.2 and 9.4). Equipment preparation and recovery 
cylinder changeover shall not be included in elapsed time measurements 
for determining vapor recovery rate and liquid refrigerant recovery 
rate. Operations such as subcooling the recovery cylinder shall be 
included. Recovery cylinder shall be the same size as normally furnished 
or specified in the instructions by the equipment manufacturer. 
Oversized tanks shall not be permitted.
    7.4.1.1 Liquid Refrigerant Recovery Rate. If elected, the recovery 
rate using the liquid refrigerant feed means (see 6.2.5) shall be 
determined. After the equipment reaches stabilized conditions of 
condensing temperature and/or recovery cylinder pressure, the recovery 
process shall be stopped and an initial weight shall be taken of the 
mixing chamber (see 9.2). The recovery process shall be continued for a 
period of time sufficient to achieve the accuracy in 9.4. The recovery 
process shall be stopped and a final weight shall be taken of the mixing 
chamber.

[[Page 628]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR24JY03.008

    7.4.1.2 Vapor Refrigerant Recovery Rate. If elected, the average 
vapor flow rate shall be measured to accuracy requirements in clause 9.4 
under conditions with no liquid refrigerant in the mixing chamber. The 
liquid recovery feed means shall be used. At initial conditions of 
saturated vapor at the higher of 24 [deg]C or the boiling temperature 
(100 kPa absolute pressure), the weight of the mixing chamber and the 
pressure shall be recorded. At final conditions representing pressure in 
the mixing chamber of 10% of the initial condition, but not less than 
the final recovery vacuum (see 9.6) nor more than 100 kPa, measure the 
weight of the mixing chamber and the elapsed time.
    7.4.1.3 High Temperature Vapor Recovery Rate. Applicable for 
equipment having at least one designated refrigerant (see 11.2) with a 
boiling point between -50 [deg]C and +10 [deg]C. Measure the rate for R-
22, or the refrigerant with the lowest boiling point if R-22 is not a 
designated refrigerant. Repeat the test in 7.4.1.2 at saturated 
conditions at 40 [deg]C and continue to operate equipment to assure it 
will achieve the final recovery vacuum (see 7.4.3).
    7.4.2 Recovery Operation. This test is for determining the final 
recovery vacuum and the ability to remove contaminants as appropriate. 
If equipment is rated for liquid recovery (see 7.4.1.3), liquid recovery 
feed means described in 6.2.5 shall be used. If not, vapor recovery 
means described in 6.2.3 or 6.2.4 shall be used. Continue recovery 
operation until all liquid is removed from the test apparatus and vapor 
is removed to the point where equipment shuts down by automatic means or 
is manually shut off per operating instructions.
    7.4.2.1 Oil Draining. Capture oil from the equipment at intervals as 
required in the instructions. Record the weight of the container. 
Completely remove refrigerant from oil by evacuation or other 
appropriate means. The weight difference shall be used in 9.5.2.
    7.4.3 Final Recovery Vacuum. At the end of the first test batch for 
each refrigerant, the liquid valve and vapor valve of the apparatus 
shall be closed. After waiting 1 minute, the mixing chamber pressure 
shall be recorded (see 9.6).
    7.4.4 Residual Refrigerant. This test will measure the mass of 
remaining refrigerant in the equipment after clearing and therefore the 
potential for mixing refrigerants (see 4.6).

[[Page 629]]

    7.4.4.1 Initial Conditions. At the end of the last test for each 
batch for each refrigerant, the equipment shall be disconnected from the 
test apparatus (Figure 1). Recycle per 7.5, if appropriate. Perform 
refrigerant clearing operations as called for in the instruction manual. 
Capture and record the weight of any refrigerant which would have been 
emitted to the atmosphere during the clearing process for use in 9.5. If 
two loops are used for recycling, trapped refrigerant shall be measured 
for both.
    7.4.4.2 Residual Trapped Refrigerant. Evacuate an empty test 
cylinder to 1.0 kPa absolute. Record the empty weight of the test 
cylinder. Open all valves to the equipment so as to provide access to 
all trapped refrigerant. Connect the equipment to the test cylinder and 
operate valves to recover the residual refrigerant. Record the weight of 
the test cylinder using a recovery cylinder pressure no less than 
specified in 6.2.2. Place the test cylinder in liquid nitrogen for a 
period of 30 minutes or until a vacuum of 1000 microns is reached, 
whichever occurs first.
    7.5 Recycling Tests (Recovery/Recycle Equipment).
    7.5.1 Recycling Operation. As each recovery cylinder is filled in 
7.4.2, recycle according to operating instructions. There will not 
necessarily be a separate recycling sequence. Note non-condensable purge 
measurement in 9.5.
    7.5.1.1 Recycle Flow Rate. While recycling the first recovery 
cylinder for each refrigerant, determine the recycling flow rate by 
appropriate means (see 9.3) to achieve the accuracy required in 9.4.
    7.5.2 Non-Condensable Sample. After completing 7.4.3, prepare a 
second test batch (7.3). Recover per 7.4.2 until the current recovery 
cylinder is filled to 80% level by volume. Recycle per 7.5.1. Mark this 
cylinder and set aside for taking the vapor sample. For equipment having 
both an internal tank of at least 3 kg refrigerant capacity and an 
external recovery cylinder, two recovery cylinders shall be marked and 
set aside. The first is the cylinder described above. The second 
cylinder is the final recovery cylinder after filling it to 80% level by 
volume and recycling.
    7.5.3 Liquid Sample for Analysis. Repeat steps 7.3, 7.4.2 and 7.5.1 
with further test batches until indication means in 4.2 show the filter/
drier(s) need replacing.
    7.5.3.1 Multiple Pass. For equipment with a separate recycling 
circuit (multiple pass), set aside the current cylinder and draw the 
liquid sample (see 7.4) from the previous cylinder.
    7.5.3.2 Single Pass. For equipment with the single pass recycling 
circuit, draw the liquid sample (see 7.4) from the current cylinder.
    7.6 Measuring Refrigerant Loss. Refrigerant loss due to non-
condensables shall be determined by appropriate means (see 9.5.1). The 
loss could occur in 7.4.1, 7.4.2 and 7.5.1.

            Section 8. Sampling and Chemical Analysis Methods

    8.1 Chemical Analysis. Chemical analysis methods shall be specified 
in appropriate standards such as ARI 700-95 and Appendix C to ARI 
Standard 700-95.
    8.2 Refrigerant Sampling.
    8.2.1 Water Content. The water content in refrigerant shall be 
measured by the Karl Fischer Analytical Method or by the Karl Fischer 
Coulometric techniques. Report the moisture level in parts per million 
by weight.
    8.2.2 Chloride Ions. Chloride ions shall be measured by turbidity 
tests. At this time, quantitative results have not been defined. Report 
chloride content as ``pass'' or ``fail.'' In the future, when 
quantitative results are possible, report chloride content as parts per 
million by weight.
    8.2.3 Acidity. The acidity test uses the titration principle. Report 
the acidity in parts per million by weight (mg KOH/kg) of sample.
    8.2.4 High Boiling Residue. High boiling residues shall use 
measurement of the volume of residue after evaporating a standard volume 
of refrigerant. Using weight measurement and converting to volumetric 
units is acceptable. Report high boiling residues as percent by volume.
    8.2.5 Particulates/Solids. The particulates/solids measurement 
employs visual examination. Report results as ``pass'' or ``fail.''
    8.2.6 Non-condensables. The level of contamination by non-
condensable gases in the base refrigerant being recycled shall be 
determined by gas chromatography. Report results as percent by volume.

              Section 9. Performance Calculation and Rating

    9.1 Vapor Refrigerant Recovery Rate. This rate shall be measured by 
weight change of the mixing chamber divided by elapsed time (see 
7.4.1.2). The units shall be kg/min and the accuracy shall be per 9.4.
    9.1.1 High Temperature Vapor Recovery Rate.
    9.2 Liquid Refrigerant Recovery Rate. This rate shall be measured by 
weight change of the mixing chamber divided by elapsed time (see 
7.4.1.3). The units shall be kg/min and the accuracy shall be per 9.4.
    9.3 Recycle Flow Rate. The recycle flow rate shall be as defined in 
3.10, expressed in kg/min, and the accuracy shall be per 9.4.
    9.3.1 For equipment using multi-pass recycling or a separate 
sequence, the recycle rate shall be determined by dividing the net 
weight W of the refrigerant to be recycled by the actual time T required 
to recycle. Any set-up or operator interruptions shall not be included 
in the time T.

[[Page 630]]

    9.3.2 If no separate recycling sequence is used, the recycle rate 
shall be the higher of the vapor refrigerant recovery rate or the liquid 
refrigerant recovery rate. The recycle rate shall match a process which 
leads to contaminant levels in 9.9. Specifically, a recovery rate 
determined from bypassing a contaminant removal device cannot be used as 
a recycle rate when the contaminant levels in 9.9 are determined by 
passing the refrigerant through the contaminant removal device.
    9.4 Accuracy of Flow Rates. The accuracy of test measurements in 
9.1, 9.2 and 9.3 shall be <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>008 kg/min or flow rates 
up to .42 kg/min and <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.0% for flow rates larger 
than .42 kg/min. Ratings shall be expressed to the nearest .02 kg/min.
    9.5 Refrigerant Loss. This calculation will be based upon the net 
loss of refrigerant which would have been eliminated in the non-
condensable purge process (see 7.5.1), the oil draining process (see 
7.4.2.1) and the refrigerant clearing process (see 7.4.4.1), all divided 
by the net refrigerant content of the test batches. The refrigerant loss 
shall not exceed 3% by weight.
    9.5.1 Non-Condensable Purge. Evacuate an empty container to 2 kPa 
absolute. Record the empty weight of the container. Place the container 
in a dry ice bath. Connect the equipment purge connection to the 
container and operate purge according to operating instructions so as to 
capture the non-condensables and lost refrigerant. Weigh the cylinder 
after the recycling is complete. Equivalent means are permissible.
    9.5.2 Oil Draining. Refrigerant removed from the oil after draining 
shall be collected and measured in accordance with 7.4.2.1.
    9.5.3 Clearing Unit. Refrigerant captured during the clearing 
process shall be measured in accordance with 7.4.4.1.
    9.6 Final Recovery Vacuum. The final recovery vacuum shall be the 
mixing chamber pressure in 7.4.3 expressed in kPa. The accuracy of the 
measurement shall be within 0.33 kPa.
    9.7 Residual Trapped Refrigerant. The amount of residual trapped 
refrigerant shall be the final weight minus the initial weight of the 
test cylinder in 7.4.4.2, expressed in kg. The accuracy shall be <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.02 kg and reported to the nearest 0.05 kg.

                      1. Particulate Specification

    B1.1 The particulate material (pm) will be a blend of 50% coarse air 
cleaner dust as received, and 50% retained on a 200-mesh screen. The 
coarse air cleaner dust is available from: AC Spark Plug Division; 
General Motors Corporation; Flint, Michigan.
    B1.2 Preparation of Particulate Materials.
    To prepare the blend of contaminant, first wet screen a quantity of 
coarse air cleaner dust on a 200-mesh screen (particle retention 74 pm). 
This is done by placing a portion of the dust on a 200-mesh screen and 
running water through the screen while stirring the dust with the 
fingers. The fine contaminant particles passing through the screen are 
discarded. The +200-mesh particles collected on the screen are removed 
and dried for one hour at 110 [deg]C. The blend of standard contaminant 
is prepared by mixing 50% by weight of coarse air cleaner dust as 
received (after drying for one hour at 110 [deg]C) with 50% by weight of 
the +200 mesh screened dust.
    B1.3 Particle Size Analysis.
    The coarse air cleaner dust as received and the blend used as the

  Sec. Appendix C to Subpart F of Part 82--Method for Testing Recovery 
                  Devices for Use With Small Appliances

 Recovery Efficiency Test Procedure for Refrigerant Recovery Equipment 
                        Used on Small Appliances

    The following test procedure is utilized to evaluate the efficiency 
of equipment designed to recover ozone depleting refrigerants (or any 
substitute refrigerant subject to the recycling rules promulgated 
pursuant to section 608 of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990) from 
small appliances when service of those appliances requires entry into 
the sealed refrigeration system or when those appliances are destined 
for disposal. This procedure is designed to calculate on a weight or 
mass basis the percentage of a known charge of CFC-12 refrigerant 
removed and captured from a test stand refrigeration system. Captured 
refrigerant is that refrigerant delivered to a container suitable for 
shipment to a refrigerant reclaimer plus any refrigerant remaining in 
the recovery system in a manner that it will be transferred to a 
shipping container after additional recovery operations.
    The test stand refrigeration system required for this procedure is 
constructed with standard equipment utilized in currently produced 
household refrigerator and freezer products. The procedure also accounts 
for compressor oils that might be added to or removed from the test 
stand compressor or any compressor used in the recovery system.

                              I. Test Stand

    Test stands are constructed in accordance with the following 
standards.
    1. Evaporator--\5/16\ in. outside dia. with 30 cu. in. volume.
    2. Condenser--\1/4\ in. outside dia. with 20 cu. in volume.
    3. Suction line capillary heat exchanger--appropriate for compressor 
used.
    4. An 800-950 Btu/hr high side case (rotary) compressor; or 
(depending on the test senario);
    5. An 800-9500 Btu/hr low side case (reciprocating) compressor.
    A person seeking to have its recovery system certified shall specify 
the compressors by manufacturer and model that are to be used in test 
stands constructed for evaluation of its equipment, and the type and 
quantity of compressor to be used in those compressors. Only a 
compressor oil approved for use by the compressor's manufacturer may be 
specified, and the quantity of compressor oil specified shall be an 
appropriate quantity for the type of oil and compressor to be used. In 
order to reduce the cost of testing, the person seeking certification of 
its recovery system may supply an EPA approved third party testing 
laboratory with test stands meeting these standards for use in 
evaluating its recovery system.

                           II. Test Conditions

    Tests are to be conducted at 75 degrees F, plus or minus 2 degrees F 
(23.9 C <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1.1 C). Separate tests are conducted on 
both high side case compressor stands and low side case compressor 
stands. Separate tests are also conducted with the test stand compressor 
running during the recovery operation, and without the test stand 
compressor running during the recovery operation, to calculate the 
system's recovery efficiency under either condition.
    These tests are to be performed using a representative model of all 
equipment used in the recovery system to deliver recovered refrigerant 
to a container suitable for shipment to a refrigerant reclaimer. The 
test stands are to be equipped with access valves permanently installed 
as specific by the recovery system's vendor to represent the valves used 
with that system in actual field operations.
    A series of five (5) recovery operations are to be performed for 
each compressor scenario and a recovery efficiency is calculated based 
on the total quantity of refrigerant captured during all five (5) 
recoveries. Alternatively, at the request of the recovery system's 
vendor, a recovery efficiency is to be calculated for each recovery 
event. In this case, a statistically significant number of recovery 
operations are to be performed. Determination of what is a statistically 
significant number of recoveries is to be calculated as set out below. 
These individual recovery efficiencies are then averaged.
    There are four (4) compressor scenarios to be tested. These are a 
high side case compressor in working condition; a high side case 
compressor in nonworking condition; a low side case compressor in 
working condition; and a low side case compressor in nonworking 
condition. Recovery efficiencies calculated for the two working 
compressor scenarios are to be averaged to report a working compressor 
performance. The two nonworking compressor efficiencies are also to be 
averaged to report a nonworking compressor performance.
    If large scale equipment is required in the system to deliver 
recovered refrigerant to a refrigerant reclaimer (eg. carbon desorption 
equipment) and it is not possible to have that equipment evaluated under 
the procedure, the system's vendor shall obtain engineering data on the 
performance of that large scale equipment that will reasonably 
demonstrate the percentage refrigerant lost when processed by that 
equipment. That data will be supplied to any person required to evaluate 
the performance of those systems. The following procedure will also be 
modified as needed to determine the weight

[[Page 633]]

of refrigerant recovered from a test stand and delivered to a container 
for shipment to the large process equipment for further processing. The 
percentage loss documented to occur during processing is then to be 
applied to the recovery efficiencies calculated in this modified 
procedure to determine the overall capture efficiency for the entire 
system.
    The following are definitions of symbols used in the test procedure.

Test Stand:
    ``TSO'' means an original test stand weight.
    ``TSC'' means a charged test stand weight.
Shipping Containers:
    ``SCO'' means the original or empty weight of shipping container(s).
    ``SCF'' means the final or full weight of shipping container(s).
Recover/Transfer System:
    ``RSO'' means the original weight of a recovery/transfer system.
    ``RSF'' means the final weight of a recovery/transfer system.
    ``OL'' means the net amount of oil added/removed from the recovery 
device and/or transfer device between the beginning and end of the test 
for one compressor scenario.
Weighing steps are conducted with precision and accuracy of plus or 
          minus 1.0 gram.

                           III. Test Procedure

    1. Evacuate the test stand to 20 microns vacuum (pressure measured 
at a vacuum pump) for 12 hours.
    2. Weigh the test stand (TSO).
    3. If this is the first recovery operation being performed for a 
compressor scenario (or if a recovery efficiency is to be calculated for 
each recovery event), then weigh all devices used in the recovery system 
to deliver recovered refrigerant to a container suitable for shipment or 
delivery to a refrigerant reclaimer. Weigh only devices that can retain 
refrigerant in a manner that it will ultimately be transferred to a 
shipping container without significant release to the atmosphere (RSO).
    4. Weigh final shipping containers (SCO).
    5. Charge the test stand with an appropriate CFC-12 charge (either 6 
oz. or 9 oz.).
    6. Run the test stand for four (4) hours with 100% run time.
    7. Turn off the test stand for twelve (12) hours. During this period 
evaporate all condensation that has collected on the test stand during 
step 6.
    8. Weigh the test stand (TSC).
    9. Recover CFC-12 from the test stand and perform all operations 
needed to transfer the recovered refrigerant to one of the shipping 
containers weighed in step 4. All recovery and transfer operations are 
to be performed in accordance with the operating instructions provided 
by the system's vendor. The compressor in the test stand is to remain 
``off'' or be turned ``on'' during the recovery operation depending on 
whether the test is for a nonworking or working compressor performance 
evaluation. If a recovery efficiency is to be calculated for each 
recovery event, transfer the captured refrigerant to a shipping 
container and then skip to step 13. Otherwise continue. If the system 
allows for multiple recovery operations to be performed before 
transferring recovered refrigerant to a shipping container, the transfer 
operation can be delayed until either the maximum number of recovery 
operations allowed before a transfer is required have been performed, or 
the last of the five (5) recovery operations has been performed.
    10. Perform any oil removal or oil addition operations needed to 
properly maintain the test stand and the devices used for recovery or 
transfer operations. Determine the net weight of the oil added or 
removed from the recovery device and/or transfer device. (OP1 for oil 
added, OP2 for oil removed).
    11. Evacuate the test stand to 20 microns vacuum for 4 hours.
    12. Return to step 2 unless five (5) recovery operations have been 
performed.
    13. Weigh all final shipping containers that received recovered 
refrigerant (SCF).
    14. Weigh the equipment weighed in step three (3) above (RSF). If a 
recovery efficiency is to be calculated for each recovery event, perform 
calculations and return to step one (1) for additional recoveries.

                            IV. Calculations

                 A. For Five (5) Consecutive Recoveries

    Refrigerant Recoverable equals the summation of charged test stand 
weights minus original test stand weights.
<GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>


[[Page 634]]


    Oil Loss equals the net weight of oil added to and removed from the 
recovery device and/or transfer device.
<GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>

    Refrigerant Recovered equals the final weight of shipping containers 
minus the initial weight of final shipping containers, plus final 
recovery system weight, minus original recovery system weight, plus the 
net value of all additions and removals of oil from the recovery and 
transfer devices.

    3. Re-compute N<INF>add</INF>. Continue to test additional samples 
until N<INF>add</INF><0.

              V. Test Procedure Approval and Certification

    Each vendor of capture equipment for small appliances desiring 
certification will provide a representative model of its capture system 
and its recommended recovery procedures to an EPA approved third party 
laboratory for testing in accordance with this procedure. The third 
party laboratory will certify recovery systems that when tested in 
accordance with this procedure demonstrate a sufficient recovery 
efficiency to meet EPA regulatory requirements.


<R05>
   Sec. Appendix D to Subpart F of Part 82--Standards for Becoming a 
                   Certifying Program for Technicians

                    Standards for Certifying Programs

                           a. Test Preparation

    Certification for Type II, Type III and Universal technicians will 
be dependent upon passage of a closed-book, proctored test, administered 
in a secure environment, by an EPA-approved certifying program.
    Certification for Type I technicians will be dependent upon passage 
of an EPA-approved test, provided by an EPA-approved certifying program. 
Organizations providing Type I certification only, may chose either an 
on-site format, or a mail-in format, similar to what is permitted under 
the MVACs program.
    Each certifying program must assemble tests by choosing a prescribed 
subset from the EPA test bank. EPA expects to have a test bank with a 
minimum of 500 questions, which will enable the certifying program to 
generate multiple tests in order to discourage cheating. Each test must 
include 25 questions drawn from Group 1 and 25 questions drawn from each 
relevant technical Group. Tests for Universal technicians will include 
100 questions (25 from Group 1 and 25 from each relevant technical 
Group). Each 50-question test represents 10 percent of the total test 
bank. Questions should be divided in order to sufficiently cover each 
topic within the Group.
    Each certifying program must show a method of randomly choosing 
which questions will be on the tests. Multiple versions of the test must 
be used during each testing event. Test answer sheets or (for those 
testing via the computer medium) computer files must include the name 
and address of the applicant, the name and address of the certifying 
program, and the date and location at which the test was administered.
    Training material accompanying mail-in Type I tests must not include 
sample test questions mimicking the language of the certification test. 
All mail-in material will be subject to review by EPA.
    Certifying programs may charge individuals reasonable fees for the 
administration of the tests. EPA will publish a list of all approved 
certifying programs periodically, including the fees charged by the 
programs. This information will be available from the Stratospheric 
Ozone Protection Hotline.

                              b. Proctoring

    A certifying program for Type II, Type III and Universal technicians 
must designate or

[[Page 636]]

arrange for the designation of at least one proctor registered for each 
testing event. If more than 50 people are taking tests at the same time 
at a given site, the certifying organization must adhere to normal 
testing procedures, by designating at least one additional proctor or 
monitor for every 50 people taking tests at that site.
    The certification test for Type II, Type III and Universal 
technicians is a closed-book exam. The proctors must ensure that the 
applicants for certification do not use any notes or training materials 
during testing. Desks or work space must be placed in a way that 
discourages cheating. The space and physical facilities are to be 
conducive to continuous surveillance by the proctors and monitors during 
testing.
    The proctor may not receive any benefit from the outcome of the 
testing other than a fee for proctoring. Proctors cannot know in advance 
which questions are on the tests they are proctoring.
    Proctors are required to verify the identity of individuals taking 
the test by examining photo identification. Acceptable forms of 
identification include but are not limited to drivers' licenses, 
government identification cards, passports, and military identification.
    Certifying programs for Type I technicians using the mail-in format, 
must take sufficient measures at the test site to ensure that tests are 
completed honestly by each technician. Each test for Type I 
certification must provide a means of verifying the identification of 
the individual taking the test. Acceptable forms of identification 
include but are not limited to drivers' licenses numbers, social 
security numbers, and passport numbers.

                            c. Test Security

    A certifying program must demonstrate the ability to ensure the 
confidentiality and security of the test questions and answer keys 
through strict accountability procedures. An organization interested in 
developing a technician certification program will be required to 
describe these test security procedures to EPA.
    After the completion of a test, proctors must collect all test 
forms, answer sheets, scratch paper and notes. These items are to be 
placed in a sealed envelope.

                             d. Test Content

    All technician certification tests will include 25 questions from 
Group I. Group I will ask questions in the following areas:
    I. Environmental impact of CFCs and HCFCs
    II. Laws and regulations
    III. Changing industry outlook

    Type I, Type II and Type III certification tests will include 25 
questions from Group II. Group II will ask questions covering sector-
specific issues in the following areas:

    IV. Leak detection

    Universal Certification will include 75 questions from Group II, 
with 25 from each of the three sector-specific areas.

                               e. Grading

    Tests must be graded objectively. Certifying programs must inform 
the applicant of their test results no later than 30 days from the date 
of the test. Type I certifying programs using the mail-in format, must 
notify the applicants of their test results no later than 30 days from 
the date the certifying programs received the completed test and any 
required documentation. Certifying programs may mail or hand deliver the 
results.
    The passing score for the closed-book Type I, Type II, Type III and 
Universal certification test is 70 percent. For Type I certification 
tests using the mail-in format, passing score is 84 percent.

                        f. Proof of Certification

    Certifying programs must issue a standard wallet-sized 
identification card no later than 30 days from the date of the test. 
Type I certifying programs using mail-in formats must issue cards to 
certified technicians no later than 30 days from the date the certifying 
program receives the completed test and any required documentation.
    Each wallet-sized identification card must include, at a minimum, 
the name of the certifying program including the date the certifying 
program received EPA approval, the name of the person certified, the 
type of certification, a unique number for the certified person and the 
following text:
    [name of person] has been certified as [Type I, Type II, Type III 
and/or Universal--as appropriate] technician as required by 40 CFR part 
82, subpart F.

               g. Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements

    1. Certifying programs must maintain records that include, but are 
not limited to, the names and addresses of all individuals taking the 
tests, the scores of all certification tests administered, and the dates 
and locations of all testing administered.
    2. EPA must receive an activity report from all approved certifying 
programs by every January 30 and June 30, the first to be submitted 
following the first full six-month period for which the program has been 
approved by EPA. This report will include the pass/fail rate and testing 
schedules. This will allow the Agency to determine the relative progress 
and success of these programs. If

[[Page 637]]

the certifying program believes a test bank question needs to be 
modified, information about that question should also be included.
    3. Approved certifying programs will receive a letter of approval 
from EPA. Each testing center must display a copy of that letter at 
their place of business.
    4. Approved technician certification programs that voluntarily plan 
to stop providing the certification test must forward all records 
required by this appendix, Sec. Sec. 82.161, and 82.166 to another 
program currently approved by EPA in accordance with this appendix and 
with Sec. 82.161. Approved technician certification programs that 
receive records of certified technicians from a program that no longer 
offers the certification test must inform EPA in writing at the address 
listed in Sec. 82.160 within 30 days of receiving these records. The 
notification notice must include the name and address of the program to 
which the records have been transferred. If another currently approved 
program willing to accept the records cannot be located, these records 
must be submitted to EPA at the address listed at Sec. 82.160.
    5. Technician certification programs that have had their 
certification revoked in accordance with Sec. 82.169 must forward all 
records required by this appendix, Sec. Sec. 82.161, and 82.166 to EPA 
at the address listed in Sec. 82.160.

                       h. Additional Requirements

    EPA will periodically inspect testing sites to ensure compliance 
with EPA regulations. If testing center discrepancies are found, they 
must be corrected within a specified time period. If discrepancies are 
not corrected, EPA may suspend or revoke the certifying programs's 
approval. The inspections will include but are not limited to a review 
of the certifying programs' provisions for test security, the 
availability of space and facilities to conduct the administrative 
requirements and ensure the security of the tests, the availability of 
adequate testing facilities and spacing of the applicants during 
testing, a review of the proper procedures regarding accountability, and 
that there is no evidence of misconduct on the part of the certifying 
programs, their representatives and proctors, or the applicants for 
certification.
    If the certifying programs offer training or provide review 
materials to the applicants, these endeavors are to be considered 
completely separate from the administration of the certification test.

                           i. Approval Process

    EPA anticipates receiving a large number of applications from 
organizations seeking to become certifying programs. In order to certify 
as many technicians as possible in a reasonable amount of time, EPA will 
give priority to national programs. Below are the guidelines EPA will 
use:
    First: Certifying programs providing at least 25 testing centers 
with a minimum of one site in at least 8 different states will be 
considered.
    Second: Certifying programs forming regional networks with a minimum 
of 10 testing centers will be considered.
    Third: Certifying programs providing testing centers in 
geographically isolated areas not sufficiently covered by the national 
or regional programs will be considered.
    Fourth: All other programs applying for EPA approval will be 
considered.
    Sample application forms may be obtained by contacting the 
Stratopheric Ozone Hotline at 1-800-296-1996.

                            j. Grandfathering

    EPA will grandfather technicians who successfully completed 
voluntary programs whose operators seek and receive EPA approval to 
grandfather these technicians, in accordance with Sec. 82.161(g). As 
part of this process, these certifying programs may be required to send 
EPA-approved supplementary information to ensure the level of the 
technicians' knowledge. Technicians will be required to read this 
supplementary information as a condition of certification. The 
certifying programs will also issue new identification cards meeting the 
requirements specified above.

                          k. Sample Application

    EPA has provided a sample application. The Agency designed the 
application to demonstrate the information certifying programs must 
provide to EPA. Programs are not required to use this form or this 
format.

<R05>
Sec. 82.170  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The purpose of these regulations in this subpart is to implement 
section 612 of the Clean Air Act, as amended, regarding the safe 
alternatives policy on the acceptability of substitutes for ozone-
depleting compounds. This program will henceforth be referred to as the 
``Significant New Alternatives Policy'' (SNAP) program. The objectives

[[Page 638]]

of this program are to identify substitutes for ozone-depleting 
compounds, to evaluate the acceptability of those substitutes, to 
promote the use of those substitutes believed to present lower overall 
risks to human health and the environment, relative to the class I and 
class II compounds being replaced, as well as to other substitutes for 
the same end-use, and to prohibit the use of those substitutes found, 
based on the same comparisons, to increase overall risks.
    (b) The regulations in this subpart describe persons and substitutes 
subject to reporting requirements under the SNAP program and explain 
preparation and submission of notices and petitions on substitutes. The 
regulations also establish Agency procedures for reviewing and 
processing EPA's determinations regarding notices and petitions on 
substitutes. Finally, the regulations prohibit the use of alternatives 
which EPA has determined may have adverse effects on human health or the 
environment where EPA has identified alternatives in particular 
industrial use sectors that on an overall basis, reduce risk to human 
health and the environment and are currently or potentially available. 
EPA will only prohibit substitutes where it has identified other 
substitutes for a specific application that are acceptable and are 
currently or potentially available.
    (c) Notifications, petitions and other materials requested shall be 
sent to: SNAP Document Control Officer, U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (6205-J), 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460.

[59 FR 13147, Mar. 18, 1994, as amended at 59 FR 63256, Dec. 8, 1994; 60 
FR 3303, Jan. 13, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 82.176  Applicability.

    (a) Any producer of a new substitute must submit a notice of intent 
to introduce a substitute into interstate commerce 90 days prior to such 
introduction. Any producer of an existing substitute already in 
interstate commerce must submit a notice as of July 18, 1994, if such 
substitute has not already been reviewed and approved by the Agency.
    (b) With respect to the following substitutes, producers are exempt 
from notification requirements:
    (1) Substitutes already listed as acceptable. Producers need not 
submit notices on substitutes that are already listed as acceptable 
under SNAP.
    (2) Small sectors. Persons using substitutes in sectors other than 
the nine principal sectors reviewed under this program are exempt from 
the notification requirements. This exemption shall not be construed to 
nullify an unacceptability determination or to allow use of an otherwise 
unacceptable substitute.
    (3) Small volume use within SNAP sectors. Within the nine principal 
SNAP sectors, persons introducing a substitute whose expected volume of 
use amounts to less than 10,000 lbs. per year within a SNAP sector are 
exempt from notification requirements. This exemption shall not be 
construed to allow use of an otherwise unacceptable substitute in any 
quantity. Persons taking advantage of this exemption for small uses must 
maintain documentation for each substitute describing how the substitute 
meets this small use definition. This documentation must include annual 
production and sales information by sector.
    (4) Research and development. Production of substitutes for the sole 
purpose of research and development is exempt from reporting 
requirements.
    (5) Test marketing. Use of substitutes for the sole purpose of test 
marketing is exempt from SNAP notification requirements until 90 days 
prior to the introduction of such substitutes for full-scale commercial 
sale in interstate commerce. Persons taking advantage of this exemption 
are, however, required to notify the Agency in writing that they are 
conducting test marketing 30 days prior to the commencement of such 
marketing. Notification shall include the name of the substitute, the 
volume used in the test marketing, intended sector end-uses,

[[Page 641]]

and expected duration of the test marketing period.
    (6) Formulation changes. In cases where replacement of class I or II 
compounds causes formulators to change other components in a product, 
formulators are exempt from reporting with respect to these auxiliary 
formulation changes. However, the SNAP submitter is required to notify 
the Agency if such changes are expected to significantly increase the 
environmental and human health risk associated with the use of any class 
I or class II substitute.
    (7) Substitutes used as feedstocks. Producers of substitutes used as 
feedstocks which are largely or entirely consumed, transformed or 
destroyed in the manufacturing or use process are exempt from reporting 
requirements concerning such substitutes.
    (c) Use of a substitute in the possession of an end-user as of March 
18, 1994, listed as unacceptable or acceptable subject to narrowed use 
limits may continue until the individual end-users' existing supply, as 
of that date, of the substitute is exhausted. Use of substitutes 
purchased after March 18, 1994, is not permitted subsequent to April 18, 
1994.


<R05>
Sec. 82.178  Information required to be submitted.

    (a) Persons whose substitutes are subject to reporting requirements 
pursuant to Sec. 82.176 must provide the following information:
    (1) Name and description of the substitute. The substitute should be 
identified by its: Chemical name; trade name(s); identification numbers; 
chemical formula; and chemical structure.
    (2) Physical and chemical information. The substitute should be 
characterized by its key properties including but not limited to: 
Molecular weight; physical state; melting point; boiling point; density; 
taste and/or odor threshold; solubility; partition coefficients (Log 
K<INF>ow</INF>, Log K<INF>oc</INF>); atmospheric lifetime and vapor 
pressure.
    (3) Substitute applications. Identification of the applications 
within each sector end-use in which the substitutes are likely to be 
used.
    (4) Process description. For each application identified, 
descriptive data on processing, including in-place pollution controls.
    (5) Ozone depletion potential. The predicted 100-year ozone 
depletion potential (ODP) of substitute chemicals. The submitter must 
also provide supporting documentation or references.
    (6) Global warming impacts. Data on the total global warming 
potential of the substitute, including information on the GWP index and 
the indirect contributions to global warming caused by the production or 
use of the substitute (e.g., changes in energy efficiency). GWP must be 
calculated over a 100, 500 and 1000-year integrated time horizon.
    (7) Toxicity data. Health and safety studies on the effects of a 
substitute, its components, its impurities, and its degradation products 
on any organism (e.g., humans, mammals, fish, wildlife, and plants). For 
tests on mammals, the Agency requires a minimum submission of the 
following tests to characterize substitute risks: A range-finding study 
that considers the appropriate exposure pathway for the specific use 
(e.g., oral ingestion, inhalation, etc.), and a 90-day subchronic 
repeated dose study in an appropriate rodent species. For certain 
substitutes, a cardiotoxicity study is also required. Additional 
mammalian toxicity tests may be identified based on the substitute and 
application in question. To sufficiently characterize aquatic toxicity 
concerns, both acute and chronic toxicity data for a variety of species 
are required. For this purpose, the Agency requires a minimum data set 
as described in ``Guidelines for Deriving Numerical National Water 
Quality Criteria for the Protection of Aquatic Organisms and their 
Uses,'' which is available through the National Technical Information 
Service (<greek-i>PB 85-227049). Other relevant information and data 
summaries, such as the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS), should also 
be submitted. To assist in locating any studies previously submitted to 
EPA and referred to, but not included in a SNAP submission, the 
submitter must provide citations for the date, type of submission, and 
EPA Office to which they were submitted, to help EPA locate these 
quickly.
    (8) Environmental fate and transport. Where available, information 
must be

[[Page 642]]

submitted on the environmental fate and transport of substitutes. Such 
data shall include information on bioaccumulation, biodegradation, 
adsorption, volatility, transformation, and other data necessary to 
characterize movement and reaction of substitutes in the environment.
    (9) Flammability. Data on the flammability of a substitute chemical 
or mixture are required. Specifically, the flash point and flammability 
limits are needed, as well as information on the procedures used for 
determining the flammability limits. Testing of blends should identify 
the compositions for which the blend itself is flammable and include 
fractionation data on changes in the composition of the blend during 
various leak scenarios. For substitutes that will be used in consumer 
applications, documentation of testing results conducted by independent 
laboratories should be submitted, where available. If a substitute is 
flammable, the submitter must analyze the risk of fire resulting from 
the use of such a substitute and assess the effectiveness of measures to 
minimize such risk.
    (10) Exposure data. Available modeling or monitoring data on 
exposures associated with the manufacture, formulation, transport, use 
and disposal of a substitute. Descriptive process information for each 
substitute application, as described above, will be used to develop 
exposure estimates where exposure data are not readily available. 
Depending on the application, exposure profiles may be needed for 
workers, consumers, and the general population.
    (11) Environmental release data. Data on emissions from the 
substitute application and equipment, as well as on pollutant releases 
or discharge to all environmental media. Submitters should provide 
information on release locations, and data on the quantities, including 
volume, of anticipated waste associated with the use of the substitute. 
In addition, information on anticipated waste management practices 
associated with the use of the substitute. Any available information on 
any pollution controls used or that could be used in association with 
the substitute (e.g., emissions reduction technologies, wastewater 
treatment, treatment of hazardous waste) and the costs of such 
technology must also be submitted.
    (12) Replacement ratio for a chemical substitute. Information on the 
replacement ratio for a chemical substitute versus the class I or II 
substances being replaced. The term ``replacement ratio'' means how much 
of a substitute must be used to replace a given quantity of the class I 
or II substance being replaced.
    (13) Required changes in use technology. Detail on the changes in 
technology needed to use the alternative. Such information should 
include a description of whether the substitute can be used in existing 
equipment--with or without some retrofit--or only in new equipment. Data 
on the cost (capital and operating expenditures) and estimated life of 
any technology modifications should also be submitted.
    (14) Cost of substitute. Data on the expected average cost of the 
alternative. In addition, information is needed on the expected 
equipment lifetime for an alternative technology. Other critical cost 
considerations should be identified, as appropriate.
    (15) Availability of substitute. If the substitute is not currently 
available, the timing of availability of a substitute should be 
provided.
    (16) Anticipated market share. Data on the anticipated near-term and 
long-term nationwide substitute sales.
    (17) Applicable regulations under other environmental statutes. 
Information on whether the substitute is regulated under other statutory 
authorities, in particular the Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, 
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Federal Insecticide, 
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, 
the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, or other titles 
under the Clean Air Act.
    (18) Information already submitted to the Agency. Information 
requested in the SNAP program notice that has been previously submitted 
to the Agency as part of past regulatory and information-gathering 
activities may be referenced rather than resubmitted.

[[Page 643]]

Submitters who cannot provide accurate references to data sent 
previously to the Agency should include all requested information in the 
SNAP notice.
    (19) Information already available in the literature. If any of the 
data needed to complete the SNAP program notice are available in the 
public literature, complete references for such information should be 
provided.
    (b) The Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) Information 
Notice is designed to provide the Agency with the information necessary 
to reach a decision on the acceptability of a substitute.
    (1) Submitters requesting review under the SNAP program should send 
the completed SNAP notice to: SNAP Document Control Officer, U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (6205-J), 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., 
Washington, DC 20460.
    (2) Submitters filing jointly under SNAP and the Premanufacture 
Notice Program (PMN) should send the SNAP addendum along with the PMN 
form to: PMN Document Control Officer, U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (7407), 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460. 
Submitters must also send both documents to the SNAP program, with a 
reference to indicate the notice has been furnished to the Agency under 
the PMN program. Submitters providing information on new chemicals for 
joint review under the TSCA and SNAP programs may be required to supply 
additional toxicity data under TSCA section 5.
    (3) Submitters filing jointly under SNAP and under the Federal 
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act should send the SNAP form to 
the Office of Pesticide Programs, Registration Division, (7505C) 1200 
Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460, as well as to the SNAP 
Document Control Officer.


<R05>
Sec. 82.180  Agency review of SNAP submissions.

    (a) Processing of SNAP notices--(1) 90-day review process. The 90-
day review process will begin once EPA receives a submission and 
determines that such submission includes data on the substitute that are 
complete and adequate, as described in Sec. 82.178. The Agency may 
suspend or extend the review period to allow for submission of 
additional data needed to complete the review of the notice.
    (2) Initial review of notice. The SNAP Document Control Officer will 
review the notice to ensure that basic information necessary to process 
the submission is present (i.e., name of company, identification of 
substitute, etc.). The SNAP Document Control Officer will also review 
substantiation of any claim of confidentiality.
    (3) Determination of data adequacy. Upon receipt of the SNAP 
submission, the Agency will review the completeness of the information 
supporting the application. If additional data are needed, the submitter 
will be contacted following completion of this review. The 90-day review 
period will not commence until EPA has received data it judges adequate 
to support analysis of the submission.
    (4) Letter of receipt. The SNAP Document Control Officer will send a 
letter of receipt to the submitter to confirm the date of notification 
and the beginning of EPA's 90-day review period. The SNAP Document 
Control Officer will also assign the SNAP notice a tracking number, 
which will be identified in the letter of receipt.
    (5) Availability of new information during review period. If 
critical new information becomes available during the review period that 
may influence the Agency's evaluation of a substitute, the submitter 
must notify the Agency about the existence of such information within 10 
days of learning of such data. The submitter must also inform the Agency 
of new studies underway, even if the results will not be available 
within the 90-day review period. The Agency may contact the submitter to 
explore extending or suspending the review period depending on the type 
of information received and the stage of review.
    (6) Completion of detailed review. Once the initial data review, 
described in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section, has been 
completed, the Agency will complete a detailed evaluation of the notice. 
If during any time the Agency perceives a lack of information necessary 
to reach a SNAP determination,

[[Page 644]]

it will contact the submitter and request the missing data.
    (7) Criteria for review. To determine whether a substitute is 
acceptable or unacceptable as a replacement for class I or II compounds, 
the Agency will evaluate:
    (i) Atmospheric effects and related health and environmental 
impacts;
    (ii) General population risks from ambient exposure to compounds 
with direct toxicity and to increased ground-level ozone;
    (iii) Ecosystem risks;
    (iv) Occupational risks;
    (v) Consumer risks;
    (vi) Flammability; and
    (vii) Cost and availability of the substitute.
    (8) Communication of decision--(i) Communication of decision to the 
submitter. Once the SNAP program review has been completed, the Agency 
will notify the submitter in writing of the decision. Sale or 
manufacture of new substitutes may commence after the initial 90-day 
notification period expires even if the Agency fails to reach a decision 
within the 90-day review period or fails to communicate that decision or 
the need for additional data to the submitter. Sale or manufacture of 
existing substitutes may continue throughout the Agency's 90-day review.
    (ii) Communication of decision to the public. The Agency will 
publish in the Federal Register periodic updates to the list of the 
acceptable and unacceptable alternatives that have been reviewed to 
date. In the case of substitutes proposed as acceptable with use 
restrictions, proposed as unacceptable or proposed for removal from 
either list, a rulemaking process will ensue. Upon completion of such 
rulemaking, EPA will publish revised lists of substitutes acceptable 
subject to use conditions or narrowed use limits and unacceptable 
substitutes to be incorporated into the Code of Federal Regulations. 
(See Appendices to this subpart.)
    (b) Types of listing decisions. When reviewing substitutes, the 
Agency will list substitutes in one of five categories:
    (1) Acceptable. Where the Agency has reviewed a substitute and found 
no reason to prohibit its use, it will list the alternative as 
acceptable for the end-uses listed in the notice.
    (2) Acceptable subject to use conditions. After reviewing a notice, 
the Agency may make a determination that a substitute is acceptable only 
if conditions of use are met to minimize risks to human health and the 
environment. Where users intending to adopt a substitute acceptable 
subject to use conditions must make reasonable efforts to ascertain that 
other alternatives are not feasible due to safety, performance or 
technical reasons, documentation of this assessment must be retained on 
file for the purpose of demonstrating compliance. This documentation 
shall include descriptions of substitutes examined and rejected, 
processes or products in which the substitute is needed, reason for 
rejection of other alternatives, e.g., performance, technical or safety 
standards. Use of such substitutes in ways that are inconsistent with 
such use conditions renders them unacceptable.
    (3) Acceptable subject to narrowed use limits. Even though the 
Agency can restrict the use of a substitute based on the potential for 
adverse effects, it may be necessary to permit a narrowed range of use 
within a sector end-use because of the lack of alternatives for 
specialized applications. Users intending to adopt a substitute 
acceptable with narrowed use limits must ascertain that other 
alternatives are not technically feasible. Companies must document the 
results of their evaluation, and retain the results on file for the 
purpose of demonstrating compliance. This documentation shall include 
descriptions of substitutes examined and rejected, processes or products 
in which the substitute is needed, reason for rejection of other 
alternatives, e.g., performance, technical or safety standards, and the 
anticipated date other substitutes will be available and projected time 
for switching to other available substitutes. Use of such substitutes in 
applications and end-uses which are not specified as acceptable in the 
narrowed use limit renders them unacceptable.
    (4) Unacceptable. This designation will apply to substitutes where 
the Agency's review indicates that the substitute poses risk of adverse 
effects to

[[Page 645]]

human health and the environment and that other alternatives exist that 
reduce overall risk.
    (5) Pending. Submissions for which the Agency has not reached a 
determination will be described as pending. For all substitutes in this 
category, the Agency will work with the submitter to obtain any missing 
information and to determine a schedule for providing the missing 
information if the Agency wishes to extend the 90-day review period. EPA 
will use the authority under section 114 of the Clean Air Act to gather 
this information, if necessary. In some instances, the Agency may also 
explore using additional statutory provisions (e.g., section 5 of TSCA) 
to collect the needed data.
    (c) Joint processing under SNAP and TSCA. The Agency will coordinate 
reviews of substitutes submitted for evaluation under both the TSCA PMN 
program and the CAA.
    (d) Joint processing under SNAP and FIFRA. The Agency will 
coordinate reviews of substitutes submitted for evaluation under both 
FIFRA and the CAA.

<R05>
Sec. 82.182  Confidentiality of data.

    (a) Clean Air Act provisions. Anyone submitting information must 
assert a claim of confidentiality at the time of submission for any data 
they wish to have treated as confidential business information (CBI) 
under 40 CFR part 2, subpart B. Failure to assert a claim of 
confidentiality at the time of submission may result in disclosure of 
the information by the Agency without further notice to the submitter. 
The submitter should also be aware that under section 114(c), emissions 
data may not be claimed as confidential.
    (b) Substantiation of confidentiality claims. At the time of 
submission, EPA requires substantiation of any confidentiality claims 
made. Failure to provide any substantiation may result in disclosure of 
information without further notice by the Agency. All submissions must 
include adequate substantiation in order for an acceptability 
determination on a substitute to be published. Moreover, under 40 CFR 
part 2, subpart B, there are further instances in which confidentiality 
assertions may later be reviewed even when confidentiality claims are 
initially received. The submitter will also be contacted as part of such 
an evaluation process.
    (c) Confidentiality provisions for toxicity data. In the event that 
toxicity or health and safety studies are listed as confidential, this 
information cannot be maintained as confidential where such data are 
also submitted under TSCA or FIFRA, to the extent that confidential 
treatment is prohibited under those statutes. However, information 
contained in a toxicity study that is not health and safety data and is 
not relevant to the effects of a substance on human health and the 
environment (e.g., discussion of process information, proprietary 
blends) can be maintained as confidential subject to 40 CFR part 2, 
subpart B.
    (d) Joint submissions under other statutes. Information submitted as 
part of a joint submission to either SNAP/TSCA or SNAP/FIFRA must adhere 
to the security provisions of the program offices implementing these 
statutes. For such submissions, the SNAP handling of such notices will 
follow the security provisions under these statutes.


<R05>
Sec. 82.184  Petitions.

    (a) Who may petition. Any person may petition the Agency to amend 
existing listing decisions under the SNAP program, or to add a new 
substance to any of the SNAP lists.
    (b) Types of petitions. Five types of petitions exist:
    (1) Petitions to add a substitute not previously reviewed under the 
SNAP program to the acceptable list. This type of petition is comparable 
to the 90-day notifications, except that it would generally be initiated 
by entities other than the companies that manufacture, formulate, or 
otherwise use the substitute. Companies that manufacture, formulate, or 
use substitutes that want to have their substitutes added to the 
acceptable list should submit information on the substitute under the 
90-day review program;
    (2) Petitions to add a substitute not previously reviewed under the 
SNAP program to the unacceptable list;

[[Page 646]]

    (3) Petitions to delete a substitute from the acceptable list and 
add it to the unacceptable list or to delete a substitute from the 
unacceptable and add it to the acceptable list;
    (4) Petitions to add or delete use restrictions on an acceptability 
listing.
    (5) Petitions to grandfather use of a substitute listed as 
unacceptable or acceptable subject to use restrictions.
    (c) Content of the petition. The Agency requires that the petitioner 
submit information on the type of action requested and the rationale for 
the petition. Petitions in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section 
must contain the information described in Sec. 82.178, which lists the 
items to be submitted in a 90-day notification. For petitions that 
request the re-examination of a substitute previously reviewed under the 
SNAP program, the submitter must also reference the prior submittal or 
existing listing. Petitions to grandfather use of an unacceptable 
substitute must describe the applicability of the test to judge the 
appropriateness of Agency grandfathering as established by the United 
States District Court for the District of Columbia Circuit (see Sierra 
Club v. EPA, 719 F.2d 436 (D.C. Cir. 1983)). This test includes whether 
the new rule represents an abrupt departure from previously established 
practice, the extent to which a party relied on the previous rule, the 
degree of burden which application of the new rule would impose on the 
party, and the statutory interest in applying the new rule immediately.
    (d) Petition process. (1) Notification of affected companies. If the 
petition concerns a substitute previously either approved or restricted 
under the SNAP program, the Agency will contact the original submitter 
of that substitute.
    (2) Review for data adequacy. The Agency will review the petition 
for adequacy of data. As with a 90-day notice, the Agency may suspend 
review until the petitioner submits the information necessary to 
evaluate the petition. To reach a timely decision on substitutes, EPA 
may use collection authorities such as those contained in section 114 of 
the Clean Air Act as amended, as well as information collection 
provisions of other environmental statutes.
    (3) Review procedures. To evaluate the petition, the Agency may 
submit the petition for review to appropriate experts inside and outside 
the Agency.
    (4) Timing of determinations. If data are adequate, as described in 
Sec. 82.180, the Agency will respond to the petition within 90 days of 
receiving a complete petition. If the petition is inadequately 
supported, the Agency will query the petitioner to fill any data gaps 
before the 90-day review period begins, or may deny the petition because 
data are inadequate.
    (5) Rulemaking procedures. EPA will initiate rulemaking whenever EPA 
grants a petition to add a substance to the list of unacceptable 
substitutes, remove a substance from any list, or change or create an 
acceptable listing by imposing or deleting use conditions or use limits.
    (6) Communication of decision. The Agency will inform petitioners 
within 90 days of receiving a complete petition whether their request 
has been granted or denied. If a petition is denied, the Agency will 
publish in the Federal Register an explanation of the determination. If 
a petition is granted, the Agency will publish the revised SNAP list 
incorporating the final petition decision within 6 months of reaching a 
determination or in the next scheduled update, if sooner, provided any 
required rulemaking has been completed within the shorter period.

  Sec. Appendix C to Subpart G of Part 82--Substitutes Subject to Use 
  Restrictions and Unacceptable Substitutes Listed in the May 22, 1996 
                   Final Rule, Effective June 21, 1996

  Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Sector--Acceptable Subject to Use 
                               Conditions

    HCFC Blend Delta and Blend Zeta are acceptable subject to the 
following conditions when used to retrofit a CFC-12 motor vehicle air 
conditioning system:
    1. Each refrigerant may only be used with a set of fittings that is 
unique to that refrigerant. These fittings (male or female, as 
appropriate) must be used with all containers of the refrigerant, on can 
taps, on recovery, recycling, and charging equipment, and on all air 
conditioning system service ports. These fittings must be designed to 
mechanically prevent cross-charging with another refrigerant. A 
refrigerant may only be used with the fittings and can taps specifically 
intended for that refrigerant. Using an adapter or deliberately 
modifying a fitting to use a different refrigerant will be a violation 
of this use condition. In addition, fittings shall meet the following 
criteria, derived from Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) standards 
and recommended practices:
    a. When existing CFC-12 service ports are to be retrofitted, 
conversion assemblies shall attach to the CFC-12 fitting with a thread 
lock adhesive and/or a separate mechanical latching mechanism in a 
manner that permanently prevents the assembly from being removed.
    b. All conversion assemblies and new service ports must satisfy the 
vibration testing requirements of sections 3.2.1 or 3.2.2 of SAE J1660, 
as applicable, excluding references to SAE J639 and SAE J2064, which are 
specific to HFC-134a.
    c. In order to prevent discharge of refrigerant to the atmosphere, 
systems shall have a device to limit compressor operation before the 
pressure relief device will vent refrigerant. This requirement is waived 
for systems that do not feature such a pressure relief device.
    d. All CFC-12 service ports not retrofitted with conversion 
assemblies shall be rendered permanently incompatible for use with CFC-
12 related service equipment by fitting with a device attached with a 
thread lock adhesive and/or a separate mechanical latching mechanism in 
a manner that prevents the device from being removed.
    2. When a retrofit is performed, a label must be used as follows:
    a. The person conducting the retrofit must apply a label to the air 
conditioning system in the engine compartment that contains the 
following information:
    i. The name and address of the technician and the company performing 
the retrofit.
    ii. The date of the retrofit.
    iii. The trade name, charge amount, and, when applicable, the ASHRAE 
refrigerant numerical designation of the refrigerant.
    iv. The type, manufacturer, and amount of lubricant used.
    v. If the refrigerant is or contains an ozone-depleting substance, 
the phrase ``ozone depleter.''
    vi. If the refrigerant displays flammability limits as measured 
according to ASTM E681, the statement ``This refrigerant is FLAMMABLE. 
Take appropriate precautions.''
    b. This label must be large enough to be easily read and must be 
permanent.
    c. The background color must be unique to the refrigerant.
    d. The label must be affixed to the system over information related 
to the previous refrigerant, in a location not normally replaced during 
vehicle repair.
    e. Information on the previous refrigerant that cannot be covered by 
the new label must be permanently rendered unreadable.
    3. No substitute refrigerant may be used to ``top-off'' a system 
that uses another refrigerant. The original refrigerant must be 
recovered in accordance with regulations issued under section 609 of the 
CAA prior to charging with a substitute.

[61 FR 25592, May 22, 1996, as amended at 67 FR 4201, Jan. 29, 2002]

    Effective Date Note: At 61 FR 25592, May 22, 1996, Appendix C to 
Part 82 Subpart G was added. This appendix contains information 
collection and recordkeeping requirements which will not become 
effective until approval has been given by the Office of Management and 
Budget.


<R05>
  Sec. Appendix D to Subpart G of Part 82--Substitutes Subject to Use 
                Restrictions and Unacceptable Substitutes

                          Summary of Decisions

  Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Sector Acceptable Subject to Use 
                               Conditions

    R-406A/``GHG''/``McCool'', ``GHG-HP'', ``GHG-X4''/``Autofrost''/
``Chill-It'', and ``Hot Shot''/``Kar Kool'' are acceptable substitutes 
for CFC-12 in retrofitted motor vehicle air conditioning systems (MVACs) 
subject to the use condition that a retrofit to these refrigerants must 
include replacing non-barrier hoses with barrier hoses.
    For all refrigerants submitted for use in motor vehicle air 
conditioning systems, subsequent to the effective date of this FRM, in 
addition to the information previously required in the March 18, 1994 
final SNAP rule (58 FR 13044), SNAP submissions must include 
specifications for the fittings similar to those found in SAE J639, 
samples of all fittings, and the detailed label described below at the 
same time as the initial SNAP submission, or the submission will be 
considered incomplete. Under section 612 of the

[[Page 659]]

Clean Air Act, substitutes for which submissions are incomplete may not 
be sold or used, regardless of other acceptability determinations, and 
the prohibition against sale of a new refrigerant will not end until 90 
days after EPA determines the submission is complete.
    In addition, the use of a) R-406A/``GHG''/``McCool'', ``GHG-HP'', 
``GHG-X4/``Autofrost''/``Chill-It'', ``Hot Shot''/``Kar Kool'', and 
``FREEZE 12'' as CFC-12 substitutes in MVACs, and b) all refrigerants 
submitted for, and listed in, subsequent Notices of Acceptability as 
substitutes for CFC-12 in MVACs, must meet the following conditions:
    1. Each refrigerant may only be used with a set of fittings that is 
unique to that refrigerant. These fittings (male or female, as 
appropriate) must be designed by the manufacturer of the refrigerant. 
The manufacturer is responsible to ensure that the fittings meet all of 
the requirements listed below, including testing according to SAE 
standards. These fittings must be designed to mechanically prevent 
cross-charging with another refrigerant, including CFC-12.
    The fittings must be used on all containers of the refrigerant, on 
can taps, on recovery, recycling, and charging equipment, and on all air 
conditioning system service ports. A refrigerant may only be used with 
the fittings and can taps specifically intended for that refrigerant and 
designed by the manufacturer of the refrigerant. Using a refrigerant 
with a fitting designed by anyone else, even if it is different from 
fittings used with other refrigerants, is a violation of this use 
condition. Using an adapter or deliberately modifying a fitting to use a 
different refrigerant is a violation of this use condition.
    Fittings shall meet the following criteria, derived from Society of 
Automotive Engineers (SAE) standards and recommended practices:
    a. When existing CFC-12 service ports are retrofitted, conversion 
assemblies shall attach to the CFC-12 fitting with a thread lock 
adhesive and/or a separate mechanical latching mechanism in a manner 
that permanently prevents the assembly from being removed.
    b. All conversion assemblies and new service ports must satisfy the 
vibration testing requirements of section 3.2.1 or 3.2.2 of SAE J1660, 
as applicable, excluding references to SAE J639 and SAE J2064, which are 
specific to HFC-134a.
    c. In order to prevent discharge of refrigerant to the atmosphere, 
systems shall have a device to limit compressor operation before the 
pressure relief device will vent refrigerant.
    d. All CFC-12 service ports not retrofitted with conversion 
assemblies shall be rendered permanently incompatible for use with CFC-
12 related service equipment by fitting with a device attached with a 
thread lock adhesive and/or a separate mechanical latching mechanism in 
a manner that prevents the device from being removed.
    2. When a retrofit is performed, a label must be used as follows:
    a. The person conducting the retrofit must apply a label to the air 
conditioning system in the engine compartment that contains the 
following information:
    i. The name and address of the technician and the company performing 
the retrofit.
    ii. The date of the retrofit.
    iii. The trade name, charge amount, and, when applicable, the ASHRAE 
refrigerant numerical designation of the refrigerant.
    iv. The type, manufacturer, and amount of lubricant used.
    v. If the refrigerant is or contains an ozone-depleting substance, 
the phrase ``ozone depleter''.
    vi. If the refrigerant displays flammability limits as measured 
according to ASTM E681, the statement ``This refrigerant is FLAMMABLE. 
Take appropriate precautions.''
    b. The label must be large enough to be easily read and must be 
permanent.
    c. The background color must be unique to the refrigerant.
    d. The label must be affixed to the system over information related 
to the previous refrigerant, in a location not normally replaced during 
vehicle repair.
    e. In accordance with SAE J639, testing of labels must meet ANSI/UL 
969-1991.
    f. Information on the previous refrigerant that cannot be covered by 
the new label must be rendered permanently unreadable.
    3. No substitute refrigerant may be used to ``top-off'' a system 
that uses another refrigerant. The original refrigerant must be 
recovered in accordance with regulations issued under section 609 of the 
CAA prior to charging with a substitute.

  CFC-12 Automobile and Non-automobile Motor Vehicle Air Conditioners, 
                            Retrofit and New

                   Criteria for Uniqueness of Fittings

    (a) All fittings for alternative motor vehicle refrigerants must 
meet the following requirements:
    (1) High-side screw-on fittings for each refrigerant must differ 
from high-side screw-on fittings for all other refrigerants, including 
CFC-12, and from low-side screw-on fittings for CFC-12;
    (2) Low-side screw-on fittings for each refrigerant must differ from 
low-side screw-on fittings for all other refrigerants, including CFC-12;
    (3) High-side screw-on fittings for a given refrigerant must differ 
from low-side screw-on fittings for that refrigerant, to protect against 
connecting a low-pressure system to a high-pressure one;
    (4) High-side quick-connect fittings for each refrigerant must 
differ from high-side quick-connect fittings for all other refrigerants, 
including CFC-12 (if they exist);
    (5) Low-side quick-connect fittings for each refrigerant must differ 
from low-side quick-connect fittings for all other refrigerants, 
including CFC-12 (if they exist);
    (6) High-side quick-connect fittings for a given refrigerant must 
differ from low-side quick-connect fittings for that refrigerant, to 
protect against connecting a low-pressure system to a high-pressure one;
    (7) For each type of container, the fitting for each refrigerant 
must differ from the fitting for that type of container for all other 
refrigerants, including CFC-12.
    (b) For screw-on fittings, ``differ'' means that either the diameter 
must differ by at least \1/16\ inch or the thread direction must be 
reversed (i.e. right-handed vs. left-handed). Simply changing the thread 
pitch is not sufficient. For quick-connect fittings, ``differ''

[[Page 663]]

means that a person using normal force and normal tools (including 
wrenches) must not be able to cross-connect fittings.
    (c) The sole exception to the \1/16\ inch difference requirement is 
the difference between the small can fittings for GHG-X4 and R-406A. The 
GHG-X4 small can fitting uses a metric measurement, and is slightly less 
than \1/16\ inch larger than the small can fitting for R-406A. EPA has 
concluded that these fittings will not cross-connect, and therefore they 
may be used.

 Additional comments.
 1--Discharge testing should be strictly limited to that which is essential to meet safety or performance
  requirements.
 2--The agent should be recovered from the fire protection system in conjunction with testing or servicing, and
  recycled for later use or destroyed.
 3--EPA has no intention of duplicating or displacing OSHA coverage related to the use of personal protective
  equipment (e.g., respiratory protection), fire protection, hazard communication, worker training or any other
  occupational safety and health standard with respect to halon substitutes.
 4--As with other streaming agents, EPA recommends that potential risks of combustion by-products be labelled on
  the extinguisher (see UL 2129)

                   Subpart H_Halon Emissions Reduction

    Source: 63 FR 11096, Mar. 5, 1998, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 82.250  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The purpose of this subpart is to reduce the emissions of halon 
in accordance with section 608 of the Clean Air Act by banning the 
manufacture of halon blends; banning the intentional release of halons 
during repair, testing, and disposal of equipment containing halons and 
during technician training; requiring organizations that employ 
technicians to provide emissions reduction training; and requiring 
proper disposal of halons and equipment containing halons.
    (b) This subpart applies to any person testing, servicing, 
maintaining, repairing or disposing of equipment that contains halons or 
using such equipment during technician training. This subpart also 
applies to any person disposing of halons; to manufacturers of halon 
blends; and to organizations that employ technicians who service halon-
containing equipment.


<R05>
Sec. 82.260  Definitions.

    Halon-containing equipment means equipment used to store, transfer, 
and/or disperse halon.
    Disposal of halon means the process leading to and including 
discarding of halon from halon-containing equipment.
    Disposal of halon-containing equipment means the process leading to 
and including:
    (1) The discharge, deposit, dumping or placing of any discarded 
halon-containing equipment into or on any land or water;
    (2) The disassembly of any halon-containing equipment for discharge, 
deposit, or dumping or placing of its discarded component parts into or 
on any land or water; or
    (3) The disassembly of any halon-containing equipment for reuse of 
its component parts.
    Halon means any of the Class I, Group II substances listed in 
subpart A, Appendix A of 40 CFR Part 82. This group consists of the 
three halogenated hydrocarbons known as Halon 1211, Halon 1301, and 
Halon 2402, and all isomers of these chemicals.
    Halon product means any mixture or combination of substances that 
contains only one halon (e.g., Halon 1301 plus dinitrogen gas 
(N<INF>2</INF>))
    Halon blend means any mixture or combination of substances that 
contains two or more halons.
    Manufacturer means any person engaged in the direct manufacture of 
halon, halon blends or halon-containing equipment.
    Person means any individual or legal entity, including an 
individual, corporation, partnership, association, state, municipality, 
political subdivision of a state, Indian tribe, and any agency, 
department, or instrumentality of the United States, and any officer, 
agent, or employee thereof.
    Technician means any person who performs testing, maintenance, 
service, or repair that could reasonably be expected to release halons 
from equipment into the atmosphere. Technician also means any person who 
performs disposal of equipment that could reasonably be expected to 
release halons from the equipment into the atmosphere. Technician 
includes but is not

[[Page 678]]

limited to installers, contractor employees, in-house service personnel, 
and in some cases, owners.


<R05>
Sec. 82.270  Prohibitions.

    (a) Effective April 6, 1998 no person may newly manufacture any 
halon blend. Halon blends manufactured solely for the purpose of 
aviation fire protection are not subject to this prohibition, provided 
that:
    (1) The manufacturer or its designee is capable of recycling the 
blend to the relevant industry standards for the chemical purity of each 
individual halon;
    (2) The manufacturer includes in all sales contracts for blends 
produced by it on or after April 6, 1998 the provision that the blend 
must be returned to it or its designee for recycling; and
    (3) The manufacturer or its designee in fact recycles blends 
produced by the manufacturer on or after April 6, 1998 and returned to 
it for recycling to the relevant industry standards for the chemical 
purity of each individual halon.
    (b) Effective April 6, 1998, no person testing, maintaining, 
servicing, repairing, or disposing of halon-containing equipment or 
using such equipment for technician training may knowingly vent or 
otherwise release into the environment any halons used in such 
equipment.
    (1) De minimis releases associated with good faith attempts to 
recycle or recover halon are not subject to this prohibition.
    (2) Release of residual halon contained in fully discharged total 
flooding fire extinguishing systems would be considered a de minimis 
release associated with good faith attempts to recycle or recover halon.
    (3) Release of halons during testing of fire extinguishing systems 
is not subject to this prohibition if the following four conditions are 
met:
    (i) Systems or equipment employing suitable alternative fire 
extinguishing agents are not available;
    (ii) System or equipment testing requiring release of extinguishing 
agent is essential to demonstrate system or equipment functionality;
    (iii) Failure of the system or equipment would pose great risk to 
human safety or the environment; and
    (iv) A simulant agent cannot be used in place of the halon during 
system or equipment testing for technical reasons.
    (4) Releases of halons associated with research and development of 
halon alternatives, and releases of halons necessary during analytical 
determination of halon purity using established laboratory practices are 
exempt from this prohibition.
    (5) This prohibition does not apply to qualification and development 
testing during the design and development process of halon-containing 
systems or equipment when such tests are essential to demonstrate system 
or equipment functionality and when a suitable simulant agent can not be 
used in place of the halon for technical reasons.
    (6) This prohibition does not apply to the emergency release of 
halons for the legitimate purpose of fire extinguishing, explosion 
inertion, or other emergency applications for which the equipment or 
systems were designed.
    (c) Effective April 6, 1998, organizations that employ technicians 
who test, maintain, service, repair or dispose of halon-containing 
equipment shall take appropriate steps to ensure that technicians hired 
on or before April 6, 1998 will be trained regarding halon emissions 
reduction by September 1, 1998. Technicians hired after April 6, 1998 
shall be trained regarding halon emissions reduction within 30 days of 
hiring, or by September 1, 1998, whichever is later.
    (d) Effective April 6, 1998, no person shall dispose of halon-
containing equipment except by sending it for halon recovery to a 
manufacturer operating in accordance with NFPA 10 and NFPA 12A 
standards, a fire equipment dealer operating in accordance with NFPA 10 
and NFPA 12A standards or a recycler operating in accordance with NFPA 
10 and NFPA 12A standards. This provision does not apply to ancillary 
system devices such as electrical detection control components which are 
not necessary to the safe and secure containment of the halon within the 
equipment, to fully discharged total

[[Page 679]]

flooding systems, or to equipment containing only de minimis quantities 
of halons.
    (e) Effective April 6, 1998, no person shall dispose of halon except 
by sending it for recycling to a recycler operating in accordance with 
NFPA 10 and NFPA 12A standards, or by arranging for its destruction 
using one of the following controlled processes:
    (1) Liquid injection incineration;
    (2) Reactor cracking;
    (3) Gaseous/fume oxidation;
    (4) Rotary kiln incineration;
    (5) Cement kiln;
    (6) Radiofrequency plasma destruction; or
    (7) An EPA-approved destruction technology that achieves a 
destruction efficiency of 98% or greater.
    (f) Effective April 6, 1998, no owner of halon-containing equipment 
shall allow halon release to occur as a result of failure to maintain 
such equipment.
