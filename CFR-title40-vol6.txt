              the Federal Register (44 U.S.C. 1510).

          It is prohibited to use NARA's official seal and the stylized Code 
              of Federal Regulations logo on any republication of this 
              material without the express, written permission of the 
              Archivist of the United States or the Archivist's designee. 
              Any person using NARA's official seals and logos in a manner 
              inconsistent with the provisions of 36 CFR part 1200 is 
              subject to the penalties specified in 18 U.S.C. 506, 701, and

                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2007), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

    Administrator means the Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency or his authorized representative.
    Affected facility means, with reference to a stationary source, any 
apparatus to which a standard is applicable.
    Alternative method means any method of sampling and analyzing for an 
air pollutant which is not a reference or equivalent method but which 
has been demonstrated to the Administrator's satisfaction to, in 
specific cases, produce results adequate for his determination of 
compliance.
    Approved permit program means a State permit program approved by the 
Administrator as meeting the requirements of part 70 of this chapter or 
a Federal permit program established in this chapter pursuant to Title V 
of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7661).
    Capital expenditure means an expenditure for a physical or 
operational change to an existing facility which exceeds the product of 
the applicable ``annual asset guideline repair allowance percentage'' 
specified in the latest edition of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
Publication 534 and the existing facility's basis, as defined by section 
1012 of the Internal Revenue Code. However, the total expenditure for a 
physical or operational change to an existing facility must not be 
reduced by any ``excluded additions'' as defined in IRS Publication 534, 
as would be done for tax purposes.
    Clean coal technology demonstration project means a project using 
funds appropriated under the heading `Department of Energy-Clean Coal 
Technology', up to a total amount of $2,500,000,000 for commercial 
demonstrations of clean coal technology, or similar projects funded 
through appropriations for the Environmental Protection Agency.
    Commenced means, with respect to the definition of new source in 
section 111(a)(2) of the Act, that an owner or operator has undertaken a 
continuous program of construction or modification or that an owner or 
operator has entered into a contractual obligation to undertake and 
complete, within a reasonable time, a continuous program of construction 
or modification.
    Construction means fabrication, erection, or installation of an 
affected facility.
    Continuous monitoring system means the total equipment, required 
under the emission monitoring sections in applicable subparts, used to 
sample and condition (if applicable), to analyze, and to provide a 
permanent record of emissions or process parameters.
    Electric utility steam generating unit means any steam electric 
generating unit that is constructed for the purpose of supplying more 
than one-third of its potential electric output capacity and more than 
25 MW electrical output to any utility power distribution system for 
sale. Any steam supplied to a steam distribution system for the purpose 
of providing steam to a steam-electric generator that would produce 
electrical energy for sale is also considered in determining the 
electrical energy output capacity of the affected facility.
    Equivalent method means any method of sampling and analyzing for an 
air pollutant which has been demonstrated to the Administrator's 
satisfaction to have a consistent and quantitatively known relationship 
to the reference method, under specified conditions.
    Excess Emissions and Monitoring Systems Performance Report is a 
report that must be submitted periodically by a

[[Page 29]]

source in order to provide data on its compliance with stated emission 
limits and operating parameters, and on the performance of its 
monitoring systems.
    Existing facility means, with reference to a stationary source, any 
apparatus of the type for which a standard is promulgated in this part, 
and the construction or modification of which was commenced before the 
date of proposal of that standard; or any apparatus which could be 
altered in such a way as to be of that type.
    Force majeure means, for purposes of Sec. 60.8, an event that will 
be or has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of the 
affected facility, its contractors, or any entity controlled by the 
affected facility that prevents the owner or operator from complying 
with the regulatory requirement to conduct performance tests within the 
specified timeframe despite the affected facility's best efforts to 
fulfill the obligation. Examples of such events are acts of nature, acts 
of war or terrorism, or equipment failure or safety hazard beyond the 
control of the affected facility.
    Isokinetic sampling means sampling in which the linear velocity of 
the gas entering the sampling nozzle is equal to that of the undisturbed 
gas stream at the sample point.
    Issuance of a part 70 permit will occur, if the State is the 
permitting authority, in accordance with the requirements of part 70 of 
this chapter and the applicable, approved State permit program. When the 
EPA is the permitting authority, issuance of a Title V permit occurs 
immediately after the EPA takes final action on the final permit.
    Malfunction means any sudden, infrequent, and not reasonably 
preventable failure of air pollution control equipment, process 
equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner. Failures 
that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are 
not malfunctions.
    Modification means any physical change in, or change in the method 
of operation of, an existing facility which increases the amount of any 
air pollutant (to which a standard applies) emitted into the atmosphere 
by that facility or which results in the emission of any air pollutant 
(to which a standard applies) into the atmosphere not previously 
emitted.
    Monitoring device means the total equipment, required under the

    One-hour period means any 60-minute period commencing on the hour.
    Opacity means the degree to which emissions reduce the transmission 
of light and obscure the view of an object in the background.
    Owner or operator means any person who owns, leases, operates, 
controls, or supervises an affected facility or a stationary source of 
which an affected facility is a part.
    Part 70 permit means any permit issued, renewed, or revised pursuant 
to part 70 of this chapter.
    Particulate matter means any finely divided solid or liquid 
material, other than uncombined water, as measured by the reference 
methods specified under each applicable subpart, or an equivalent or 
alternative method.
    Permit program means a comprehensive State operating permit system 
established pursuant to title V of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7661) and 
regulations codified in part 70 of this chapter and applicable State 
regulations, or a comprehensive Federal operating permit system 
established pursuant to title V of the Act and regulations codified in 
this chapter.
    Permitting authority means:
    (1) The State air pollution control agency, local agency, other 
State agency, or other agency authorized by the Administrator to carry

Date

    (e)(1) Notwithstanding the frequency of reporting requirements 
specified in paragraph (c) of this section, an owner or operator who is 
required by an applicable subpart to submit excess emissions and 
monitoring systems performance reports (and summary reports) on a 
quarterly (or more frequent) basis may reduce the frequency of reporting 
for that standard to semiannual if the following conditions are met:
    (i) For 1 full year (e.g., 4 quarterly or 12 monthly reporting 
periods) the affected facility's excess emissions and monitoring systems 
reports submitted to comply with a standard under this part continually 
demonstrate that the facility is in compliance with the applicable 
standard;
    (ii) The owner or operator continues to comply with all 
recordkeeping and monitoring requirements specified in this subpart and 
the applicable standard; and
    (iii) The Administrator does not object to a reduced frequency of 
reporting

[[Page 67]]

for the affected facility, as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section.
    (2) The frequency of reporting of excess emissions and monitoring 
systems performance (and summary) reports may be reduced only after the 
owner or operator notifies the Administrator in writing of his or her 
intention to make such a change and the Administrator does not object to 
the intended change. In deciding whether to approve a reduced frequency 
of reporting, the Administrator may review information concerning the 
source's entire previous performance history during the required 
recordkeeping period prior to the intended change, including performance 
test results, monitoring data, and evaluations of an owner or operator's 
conformance with operation and maintenance requirements. Such 
information may be used by the Administrator to make a judgment about 
the source's potential for noncompliance in the future. If the 
Administrator disapproves the owner or operator's request to reduce the 
frequency of reporting, the Administrator will notify the owner or 
operator in writing within 45 days after receiving notice of the owner 
or operator's intention. The notification from the Administrator to the 
owner or operator will specify the grounds on which the disapproval is 
based. In the absence of a notice of disapproval within 45 days, 
approval is automatically granted.
    (3) As soon as monitoring data indicate that the affected facility 
is not in compliance with any emission limitation or operating parameter 
specified in the applicable standard, the frequency of reporting shall 
revert to the frequency specified in the applicable standard, and the 
owner or operator shall submit an excess emissions and monitoring 
systems performance report (and summary report, if required) at the next 
appropriate reporting period following the noncomplying event. After 
demonstrating compliance with the applicable standard for another full 
year, the owner or operator may again request approval from the 
Administrator to reduce the frequency of reporting for that standard as 
provided for in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section.
    (f) Any owner or operator subject to the provisions of this part 
shall maintain a file of all measurements, including continuous 
monitoring system, monitoring device, and performance testing 
measurements; all continuous monitoring system performance evaluations; 
all continuous monitoring system or monitoring device calibration 
checks; adjustments and maintenance performed on these systems or 
devices; and all other information required by this part recorded in a 
permanent form suitable for inspection. The file shall be retained for 
at least two years following the date of such measurements, maintenance, 
reports, and records, except as follows:
    (1) This paragraph applies to owners or operators required to 
install a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) where the CEMS 
installed is automated, and where the calculated data averages do not 
exclude periods of CEMS breakdown or malfunction. An automated CEMS 
records and reduces the measured data to the form of the pollutant 
emission standard through the use of a computerized data acquisition 
system. In lieu of maintaining a file of all CEMS subhourly measurements 
as required under paragraph (f) of this section, the owner or operator 
shall retain the most recent consecutive three averaging periods of 
subhourly measurements and a file that contains a hard copy of the data 
acquisition system algorithm used to reduce the measured data into the 
reportable form of the standard.
    (2) This paragraph applies to owners or operators required to 
install a CEMS where the measured data is manually reduced to obtain the 
reportable form of the standard, and where the calculated data averages 
do not exclude periods of CEMS breakdown or malfunction. In lieu of 
maintaining a file of all CEMS subhourly measurements as required under 
paragraph (f) of this section, the owner or operator shall retain all 
subhourly measurements for the most recent reporting period. The 
subhourly measurements shall be retained for 120 days from the date of 
the most recent summary or excess emission report submitted to the 
Administrator.

[[Page 68]]

    (3) The Administrator or delegated authority, upon notification to 
the source, may require the owner or operator to maintain all 
measurements as required by paragraph (f) of this section, if the 
Administrator or the delegated authority determines these records are 
required to more accurately assess the compliance status of the affected 
source.
    (g) If notification substantially similar to that in paragraph (a) 
of this section is required by any other State or local agency, sending 
the Administrator a copy of that notification will satisfy the 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
    (h) Individual subparts of this part may include specific provisions 
which clarify or make inapplicable the provisions set forth in this 
section.

<R05>
Sec. 60.8  Performance tests.

    (a) Except as specified in paragraphs (a)(1),(a)(2), (a)(3), and 
(a)(4) of this section, within 60 days after achieving the maximum 
production rate at which the affected facility will be operated, but not 
later than 180 days after initial startup of such facility, or at such 
other times specified by this part, and at such other times as may be 
required by the Administrator under section 114 of the Act, the owner or 
operator of such facility shall conduct performance test(s) and furnish 
the Administrator a written report of the results of such performance 
test(s).
    (1) If a force majeure is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred 
for which the affected owner or operator intends to assert a claim of 
force majeure, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator, in 
writing as soon as practicable following the date the owner or operator 
first knew, or through due diligence should have known that the event 
may cause or caused a delay in testing beyond the regulatory deadline, 
but the notification must occur before the performance test deadline 
unless the initial force majeure or a subsequent force majeure event 
delays the notice, and in such cases, the notification shall occur as 
soon as practicable.
    (2) The owner or operator shall provide to the Administrator a 
written description of the force majeure event and a rationale for 
attributing the delay in testing beyond the regulatory deadline to the 
force majeure; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize 
the delay; and identify a date by which the owner or operator proposes 
to conduct the performance test. The performance test shall be conducted 
as soon as practicable after the force majeure occurs.
    (3) The decision as to whether or not to grant an extension to the 
performance test deadline is solely within the discretion of the 
Administrator. The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in 
writing of approval or disapproval of the request for an extension as 
soon as practicable.
    (4) Until an extension of the performance test deadline has been 
approved by the Administrator under paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of 
this section, the owner or operator of the affected facility remains 
strictly subject to the requirements of this part.
    (b) Performance tests shall be conducted and data reduced in 
accordance with the test methods and procedures contained in each 
applicable subpart unless the Administrator (1) specifies or approves, 
in specific cases, the use of a reference method with minor changes in 
methodology, (2) approves the use of an equivalent method, (3) approves 
the use of an alternative method the results of which he has determined 
to be adequate for indicating whether a specific source is in 
compliance, (4) waives the requirement for performance tests because the 
owner or operator of a source has demonstrated by other means to the 
Administrator's satisfaction that the affected facility is in compliance 
with the standard, or (5) approves shorter sampling times and smaller 
sample volumes when necessitated by process variables or other factors. 
Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to abrogate the 
Administrator's authority to require testing under section 114 of the 
Act.

[[Page 69]]

    (c) Performance tests shall be conducted under such conditions as 
the Administrator shall specify to the plant operator based on 
representative performance of the affected facility. The owner or 
operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may 
be necessary to determine the conditions of the performance tests. 
Operations during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction shall 
not constitute representative conditions for the purpose of a 
performance test nor shall emissions in excess of the level of the 
applicable emission limit during periods of startup, shutdown, and 
malfunction be considered a violation of the applicable emission limit 
unless otherwise specified in the applicable standard.
    (d) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall provide the 
Administrator at least 30 days prior notice of any performance test, 
except as specified under other subparts, to afford the Administrator 
the opportunity to have an observer present. If after 30 days notice for 
an initially scheduled performance test, there is a delay (due to 
operational problems, etc.) in conducting the scheduled performance 
test, the owner or operator of an affected facility shall notify the 
Administrator (or delegated State or local agency) as soon as possible 
of any delay in the original test date, either by providing at least 7 
days prior notice of the rescheduled date of the performance test, or by 
arranging a rescheduled date with the Administrator (or delegated State 
or local agency) by mutual agreement.
    (e) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall provide, or 
cause to be provided, performance testing facilities as follows:
    (1) Sampling ports adequate for test methods applicable to such 
facility. This includes (i) constructing the air pollution control 
system such that volumetric flow rates and pollutant emission rates can 
be accurately determined by applicable test methods and procedures and 
(ii) providing a stack or duct free of cyclonic flow during performance 
tests, as demonstrated by applicable test methods and procedures.
    (2) Safe sampling platform(s).
    (3) Safe access to sampling platform(s).
    (4) Utilities for sampling and testing equipment.
    (f) Unless otherwise specified in the applicable subpart, each 
performance test shall consist of three separate runs using the 
applicable test method. Each run shall be conducted for the time and 
under the conditions specified in the applicable standard. For the 
purpose of determining compliance with an applicable standard, the 
arithmetic means of results of the three runs shall apply. In the event 
that a sample is accidentally lost or conditions occur in which one of 
the three runs must be discontinued because of forced shutdown, failure 
of an irreplaceable portion of the sample train, extreme meteorological 
conditions, or other circumstances, beyond the owner or operator's 
control, compliance may, upon the Administrator's approval, be 
determined using the arithmetic mean of the results of the two other 
runs.

<R05>
Sec. 60.11  Compliance with standards and maintenance requirements.

    (a) Compliance with standards in this part, other than opacity 
standards, shall be determined in accordance with performance tests 
established by Sec. 60.8, unless otherwise specified in the applicable 
standard.
    (b) Compliance with opacity standards in this part shall be 
determined by conducting observations in accordance with Method 9 in 
appendix A of this part, any alternative method that is approved by the 
Administrator, or as provided in paragraph (e)(5) of this section. For 
purposes of determining initial compliance, the minimum total time of 
observations shall be 3 hours (30 6-minute averages) for the performance 
test or other set of observations (meaning those fugitive-type emission 
sources subject only to an opacity standard).
    (c) The opacity standards set forth in this part shall apply at all 
times except during periods of startup, shutdown, malfunction, and as 
otherwise provided in the applicable standard.
    (d) At all times, including periods of startup, shutdown, and 
malfunction, owners and operators shall, to the extent practicable, 
maintain and operate any affected facility including associated air 
pollution control equipment in a manner consistent with good air 
pollution control practice for minimizing emissions. Determination of 
whether acceptable operating and maintenance procedures are being used 
will be based on information available to the Administrator which may 
include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, opacity 
observations, review of operating and maintenance procedures, and 
inspection of the source.
    (e)(1) For the purpose of demonstrating initial compliance, opacity 
observations shall be conducted concurrently with the initial 
performance test required in Sec. 60.8 unless one of the following 
conditions apply. If no performance test under Sec. 60.8 is required, 
then opacity observations shall be conducted within 60 days after 
achieving the maximum production rate at which the affected facility 
will be operated but no later than 180 days after initial startup of the 
facility. If visibility or other conditions prevent the opacity 
observations from being conducted concurrently with the initial 
performance test required under Sec. 60.8, the source owner or operator 
shall reschedule the opacity observations as soon after the initial 
performance test as possible, but not later than 30 days thereafter, and 
shall advise the Administrator of the rescheduled date. In these cases, 
the 30-day prior notification to the Administrator required in Sec. 
60.7(a)(6) shall be waived. The rescheduled opacity observations shall 
be conducted (to the extent possible) under the same operating 
conditions that existed during the initial performance test conducted 
under Sec. 60.8. The visible emissions observer shall determine whether 
visibility or other conditions prevent the opacity observations from 
being made concurrently with the initial performance test in accordance 
with procedures contained in Method 9 of appendix B of this part. 
Opacity readings of portions of plumes which contain condensed, 
uncombined water vapor shall not be used for purposes of determing 
compliance with opacity standards. The owner or operator of an affected 
facility shall make available, upon request by the Administrator, such 
records as may be necessary to determine the conditions under which the 
visual observations were made and shall provide evidence indicating 
proof of current visible observer emission certification. Except as 
provided in paragraph (e)(5) of this section, the results of continuous 
monitoring by transmissometer which indicate that the opacity at the 
time visual observations were made was not in excess of the standard are 
probative but not conclusive evidence of the actual opacity of an 
emission, provided that the source shall meet the burden of proving that 
the instrument used meets (at the time of the alleged violation) 
Performance Specification 1 in appendix B of this part, has been 
properly maintained and (at the time of the alleged violation) that the 
resulting data have not been altered in any way.

[[Page 71]]

    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the 
owner or operator of an affected facility to which an opacity standard 
in this part applies shall conduct opacity observations in accordance 
with paragraph (b) of this section, shall record the opacity of 
emissions, and shall report to the Administrator the opacity results 
along with the results of the initial performance test required under 
Sec. 60.8. The inability of an owner or operator to secure a visible 
emissions observer shall not be considered a reason for not conducting 
the opacity observations concurrent with the initial performance test.
    (3) The owner or operator of an affected facility to which an 
opacity standard in this part applies may request the Administrator to 
determine and to record the opacity of emissions from the affected 
facility during the initial performance test and at such times as may be 
required. The owner or operator of the affected facility shall report 
the opacity results. Any request to the Administrator to determine and 
to record the opacity of emissions from an affected facility shall be 
included in the notification required in Sec. 60.7(a)(6). If, for some 
reason, the Administrator cannot determine and record the opacity of 
emissions from the affected facility during the performance test, then 
the provisions of paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall apply.
    (4) An owner or operator of an affected facility using a continuous 
opacity monitor (transmissometer) shall record the monitoring data 
produced during the initial performance test required by Sec. 60.8 and 
shall furnish the Administrator a written report of the monitoring 
results along with Method 9 and Sec. 60.8 performance test results.
    (5) An owner or operator of an affected facility subject to an 
opacity standard may submit, for compliance purposes, continuous opacity 
monitoring system (COMS) data results produced during any performance 
test required under Sec. 60.8 in lieu of Method 9 observation data. If 
an owner or operator elects to submit COMS data for compliance with the 
opacity standard, he shall notify the Administrator of that decision, in 
writing, at least 30 days before any performance test required under 
Sec. 60.8 is conducted. Once the owner or operator of an affected 
facility has notified the Administrator to that effect, the COMS data 
results will be used to determine opacity compliance during subsequent 
tests required under Sec. 60.8 until the owner or operator notifies the 
Administrator, in writing, to the contrary. For the purpose of 
determining compliance with the opacity standard during a performance 
test required under Sec. 60.8 using COMS data, the minimum total time 
of COMS data collection shall be averages of all 6-minute continuous 
periods within the duration of the mass emission performance test. 
Results of the COMS opacity determinations shall be submitted along with 
the results of the performance test required under Sec. 60.8. The owner 
or operator of an affected facility using a COMS for compliance purposes 
is responsible for demonstrating that the COMS meets the requirements 
specified in Sec. 60.13(c) of this part, that the COMS has been 
properly maintained and operated, and that the resulting data have not 
been altered in any way. If COMS data results are submitted for 
compliance with the opacity standard for a period of time during which 
Method 9 data indicates noncompliance, the Method 9 data will be used to 
determine compliance with the opacity standard.
    (6) Upon receipt from an owner or operator of the written reports of 
the results of the performance tests required by Sec. 60.8, the opacity 
observation results and observer certification required by Sec. 
60.11(e)(1), and the COMS results, if applicable, the Administrator will 
make a finding concerning compliance with opacity and other applicable 
standards. If COMS data results are used to comply with an opacity 
standard, only those results are required to be submitted along with the 
performance test results required by Sec. 60.8. If the Administrator 
finds that an affected facility is in compliance with all applicable 
standards for which performance tests are conducted in accordance with 
Sec. 60.8 of this part but during the time such performance tests are 
being conducted fails to meet any applicable opacity standard, he shall 
notify the owner or operator and advise

[[Page 72]]

him that he may petition the Administrator within 10 days of receipt of 
notification to make appropriate adjustment to the opacity standard for 
the affected facility.
    (7) The Administrator will grant such a petition upon a 
demonstration by the owner or operator that the affected facility and 
associated air pollution control equipment was operated and maintained 
in a manner to minimize the opacity of emissions during the performance 
tests; that the performance tests were performed under the conditions 
established by the Administrator; and that the affected facility and 
associated air pollution control equipment were incapable of being 
adjusted or operated to meet the applicable opacity standard.
    (8) The Administrator will establish an opacity standard for the 
affected facility meeting the above requirements at a level at which the 
source will be able, as indicated by the performance and opacity tests, 
to meet the opacity standard at all times during which the source is 
meeting the mass or concentration emission standard. The Administrator 
will promulgate the new opacity standard in the Federal Register.
    (f) Special provisions set forth under an applicable subpart shall 
supersede any conflicting provisions in paragraphs (a) through (e) of 
this section.
    (g) For the purpose of submitting compliance certifications or 
establishing whether or not a person has violated or is in violation of 
any standard in this part, nothing in this part shall preclude the use, 
including the exclusive use, of any credible evidence or information, 
relevant to whether a source would have been in compliance with 
applicable requirements if the appropriate performance or compliance 
test or procedure had been performed.

Sec. 60.12  Circumvention.

    No owner or operator subject to the provisions of this part shall 
build, erect, install, or use any article, machine, equipment or 
process, the use of which conceals an emission which would otherwise 
constitute a violation of an applicable standard. Such concealment 
includes, but is not limited to, the use of gaseous diluents to achieve 
compliance with an opacity standard or with a standard which is based on 
the concentration of a pollutant in the gases discharged to the 
atmosphere.

<R05>
Sec. 60.13  Monitoring requirements.

    (a) For the purposes of this section, all continuous monitoring 
systems required under applicable subparts shall be subject to the 
provisions of this section upon promulgation of performance 
specifications for continuous monitoring systems under appendix B to 
this part and, if the continuous monitoring system is used to 
demonstrate compliance with emission limits on a continuous basis, 
appendix F to this part, unless otherwise specified in an applicable 
subpart or by the Administrator. Appendix F is applicable December 4, 
1987.
    (b) All continuous monitoring systems and monitoring devices shall 
be installed and operational prior to conducting performance tests under 
Sec. 60.8. Verification of operational status shall, as a minimum, 
include completion of the manufacturer's written requirements or 
recommendations for installation, operation, and calibration of the 
device.
    (c) If the owner or operator of an affected facility elects to 
submit continous opacity monitoring system (COMS) data for compliance 
with the opacity standard as provided under Sec. 60.11(e)(5), he shall 
conduct a performance evaluation of the COMS as specified in Performance 
Specification 1, appendix B, of this part before the performance test 
required under Sec. 60.8 is conducted. Otherwise, the owner or operator 
of an affected facility shall conduct a performance evaluation of the 
COMS or continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) during any 
performance test required under Sec. 60.8 or within 30 days thereafter 
in accordance with the applicable performance specification in appendix 
B of this part, The

[[Page 73]]

owner or operator of an affected facility shall conduct COMS or CEMS 
performance evaluations at such other times as may be required by the 
Administrator under section 114 of the Act.
    (1) The owner or operator of an affected facility using a COMS to 
determine opacity compliance during any performance test required under 
Sec. 60.8 and as described in Sec. 60.11(e)(5) shall furnish the 
Administrator two or, upon request, more copies of a written report of 
the results of the COMS performance evaluation described in paragraph 
(c) of this section at least 10 days before the performance test 
required under Sec. 60.8 is conducted.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the 
owner or operator of an affected facility shall furnish the 
Administrator within 60 days of completion two or, upon request, more 
copies of a written report of the results of the performance evaluation.
    (d)(1) Owners and operators of a CEMS installed in accordance with 
the provisions of this part, must check the zero (or low level value 
between 0 and 20 percent of span value) and span (50 to 100 percent of 
span value) calibration drifts at least once daily in accordance with a 
written procedure. The zero and span must, as a minimum, be adjusted 
whenever either the 24-hour zero drift or the 24-hour span drift exceeds 
two times the limit of the applicable performance specification in 
appendix B of this part. The system must allow the amount of the excess 
zero and span drift to be recorded and quantified whenever specified. 
Owners and operators of a COMS installed in accordance with the 
provisions of this part, must automatically, intrinsic to the opacity 
monitor, check the zero and upscale (span) calibration drifts at least 
once daily. For a particular COMS, the acceptable range of zero and 
upscale calibration materials is as defined in the applicable version of 
PS-1 in appendix B of this part. For a COMS, the optical surfaces, 
exposed to the effluent gases, must be cleaned before performing the 
zero and upscale drift adjustments, except for systems using automatic 
zero adjustments. The optical surfaces must be cleaned when the 
cumulative automatic zero compensation exceeds 4 percent opacity.
    (2) Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, the following 
procedures must be followed for a COMS. Minimum procedures must include 
an automated method for producing a simulated zero opacity condition and 
an upscale opacity condition using a certified neutral density filter or 
other related technique to produce a known obstruction of the light 
beam. Such procedures must provide a system check of all active analyzer 
internal optics with power or curvature, all active electronic circuitry 
including the light source and photodetector assembly, and electronic or 
electro-mechanical systems and hardware and or software used during 
normal measurement operation.
    (e) Except for system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and 
zero and span adjustments required under paragraph (d) of this section, 
all continuous monitoring systems shall be in continuous operation and 
shall meet minimum frequency of operation requirements as follows:
    (1) All continuous monitoring systems referenced by paragraph (c) of 
this section for measuring opacity of emissions shall complete a minimum 
of one cycle of sampling and analyzing for each successive 10-second 
period and one cycle of data recording for each successive 6-minute 
period.
    (2) All continuous monitoring systems referenced by paragraph (c) of 
this section for measuring emissions, except opacity, shall complete a 
minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data 
recording) for each successive 15-minute period.
    (f) All continuous monitoring systems or monitoring devices shall be 
installed such that representative measurements of emissions or process 
parameters from the affected facility are obtained. Additional 
procedures for location of continuous monitoring systems contained in 
the applicable Performance Specifications of appendix B of this part 
shall be used.
    (g) When the effluents from a single affected facility or two or 
more affected facilities subject to the same emission standards are 
combined before being released to the atmosphere,

[[Page 74]]

the owner or operator may install applicable continuous monitoring 
systems on each effluent or on the combined effluent. When the affected 
facilities are not subject to the same emission standards, separate 
continuous monitoring systems shall be installed on each effluent. When 
the effluent from one affected facility is released to the atmosphere 
through more than one point, the owner or operator shall install an 
applicable continuous monitoring system on each separate effluent unless 
the installation of fewer systems is approved by the Administrator. When 
more than one continuous monitoring system is used to measure the 
emissions from one affected facility (e.g., multiple breechings, 
multiple outlets), the owner or operator shall report the results as 
required from each continuous monitoring system.
    (h)(1) Owners or operators of all continuous monitoring systems for 
measurement of opacity shall reduce all data to 6-minute averages and 
for continuous monitoring systems other than opacity to 1-hour averages 
for time periods as defined in Sec. 60.2. Six-minute opacity averages 
shall be calculated from 36 or more data points equally spaced over each 
6-minute period.
    (2) For continuous monitoring systems other than opacity, 1-hour 
averages shall be computed as follows, except that the provisions 
pertaining to the validation of partial operating hours are only 
applicable for affected facilities that are required by the applicable 
subpart to include partial hours in the emission calculations:
    (i) Except as provided under paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section, 
for a full operating hour (any clock hour with 60 minutes of unit 
operation), at least four valid data points are required to calculate 
the hourly average, i.e., one data point in each of the 15-minute 
quadrants of the hour.
    (ii) Except as provided under paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section, 
for a partial operating hour (any clock hour with less than 60 minutes 
of unit operation), at least one valid data point in each 15-minute 
quadrant of the hour in which the unit operates is required to calculate 
the hourly average.
    (iii) For any operating hour in which required maintenance or 
quality-assurance activities are performed:
    (A) If the unit operates in two or more quadrants of the hour, a 
minimum of two valid data points, separated by at least 15 minutes, is 
required to calculate the hourly average; or
    (B) If the unit operates in only one quadrant of the hour, at least 
one valid data point is required to calculate the hourly average.
    (iv) If a daily calibration error check is failed during any 
operating hour, all data for that hour shall be invalidated, unless a 
subsequent calibration error test is passed in the same hour and the 
requirements of paragraph (h)(2)(iii) of this section are met, based 
solely on valid data recorded after the successful calibration.
    (v) For each full or partial operating hour, all valid data points 
shall be used to calculate the hourly average.
    (vi) Except as provided under paragraph (h)(2)(vii) of this section, 
data recorded during periods of continuous monitoring system breakdown, 
repair, calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments shall not be 
included in the data averages computed under this paragraph.
    (vii) Owners and operators complying with the requirements of Sec. 
60.7(f)(1) or (2) must include any data recorded during periods of 
monitor breakdown or malfunction in the data averages.
    (viii) When specified in an applicable subpart, hourly averages for 
certain partial operating hours shall not be computed or included in the 
emission averages (e.g. hours with < 30 minutes of unit operation under 
Sec. 60.47b(d)).
    (ix) Either arithmetic or integrated averaging of all data may be 
used to calculate the hourly averages. The data may be recorded in 
reduced or nonreduced form (e.g., ppm pollutant and percent 
O<INF>2 or ng/J of pollutant).
    (3) All excess emissions shall be converted into units of the 
standard using the applicable conversion procedures specified in the 
applicable subpart. After conversion into units of the standard, the 
data may be rounded to the same number of significant digits used in the 
applicable subpart to specify the emission limit.

[[Page 75]]

    (i) After receipt and consideration of written application, the 
Administrator may approve alternatives to any monitoring procedures or 
requirements of this part including, but not limited to the following:
    (1) Alternative monitoring requirements when installation of a 
continuous monitoring system or monitoring device specified by this part 
would not provide accurate measurements due to liquid water or other 
interferences caused by substances in the effluent gases.
    (2) Alternative monitoring requirements when the affected facility 
is infrequently operated.
    (3) Alternative monitoring requirements to accommodate continuous 
monitoring systems that require additional measurements to correct for 
stack moisture conditions.
    (4) Alternative locations for installing continuous monitoring 
systems or monitoring devices when the owner or operator can demonstrate 
that installation at alternate locations will enable accurate and 
representative measurements.
    (5) Alternative methods of converting pollutant concentration 
measurements to units of the standards.
    (6) Alternative procedures for performing daily checks of zero and 
span drift that do not involve use of span gases or test cells.
    (7) Alternatives to the A.S.T.M. test methods or sampling procedures 
specified by any subpart.
    (8) Alternative continuous monitoring systems that do not meet the 
design or performance requirements in Performance Specification 1, 
appendix B, but adequately demonstrate a definite and consistent 
relationship between its measurements and the measurements of opacity by 
a system complying with the requirements in Performance Specification 1. 
The Administrator may require that such demonstration be performed for 
each affected facility.
    (9) Alternative monitoring requirements when the effluent from a 
single affected facility or the combined effluent from two or more 
affected facilities is released to the atmosphere through more than one 
point.
    (j) An alternative to the relative accuracy (RA) test specified in 
Performance Specification 2 of appendix B may be requested as follows:
    (1) An alternative to the reference method tests for determining RA 
is available for sources with emission rates demonstrated to be less 
than 50 percent of the applicable standard. A source owner or operator 
may petition the Administrator to waive the RA test in Section 8.4 of 
Performance Specification 2 and substitute the procedures in Section 
16.0 if the results of a performance test conducted according to the 
requirements in Sec. 60.8 of this subpart or other tests performed 
following the criteria in Sec. 60.8 demonstrate that the emission rate 
of the pollutant of interest in the units of the applicable standard is 
less than 50 percent of the applicable standard. For sources subject to 
standards expressed as control efficiency levels, a source owner or 
operator may petition the Administrator to waive the RA test and 
substitute the procedures in Section 16.0 of Performance Specification 2 
if the control device exhaust emission rate is less than 50 percent of 
the level needed to meet the control efficiency requirement. The 
alternative procedures do not apply if the continuous emission 
monitoring system is used to determine compliance continuously with the 
applicable standard. The petition to waive the RA test shall include a 
detailed description of the procedures to be applied. Included shall be 
location and procedure for conducting the alternative, the concentration 
or response levels of the alternative RA materials, and the other 
equipment checks included in the alternative procedure. The 
Administrator will review the petition for completeness and 
applicability. The determination to grant a waiver will depend on the 
intended use of the CEMS data (e.g., data collection purposes other than 
NSPS) and may require specifications more stringent than in Performance 
Specification 2 (e.g., the applicable emission limit is more stringent 
than NSPS).
    (2) The waiver of a CEMS RA test will be reviewed and may be 
rescinded at such time, following successful completion of the 
alternative RA procedure, that the CEMS data indicate that

[[Page 76]]

the source emissions are approaching the level. The criterion for 
reviewing the waiver is the collection of CEMS data showing that 
emissions have exceeded 70 percent of the applicable standard for seven, 
consecutive, averaging periods as specified by the applicable 
regulation(s). For sources subject to standards expressed as control 
efficiency levels, the criterion for reviewing the waiver is the 
collection of CEMS data showing that exhaust emissions have exceeded 70 
percent of the level needed to meet the control efficiency requirement 
for seven, consecutive, averaging periods as specified by the applicable 
regulation(s) [e.g., Sec. 60.45(g) (2) and (3), Sec. 60.73(e), and 
Sec. 60.84(e)]. It is the responsibility of the source operator to 
maintain records and determine the level of emissions relative to the 
criterion on the waiver of RA testing. If this criterion is exceeded, 
the owner or operator must notify the Administrator within 10 days of 
such occurrence and include a description of the nature and cause of the 
increasing emissions. The Administrator will review the notification and 
may rescind the waiver and require the owner or operator to conduct a RA 
test of the CEMS as specified in Section 8.4 of Performance 
Specification 2.

    Editorial Note: At 65 FR 61749, Oct. 17, 2000, Sec. 60.13 was 
amended by revising the words ``ng/J of pollutant'' to read ``ng of 
pollutant per J of heat input'' in the sixth sentence of paragraph (h). 
However, the amendment could not be incorporated because the words ``ng/
J of pollutant'' do not exist in the sixth sentence of paragraph (h).


<R05>
Sec. 60.14  Modification.

    (a) Except as provided under paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, 
any physical or operational change to an existing facility which results 
in an increase in the emission rate to the atmosphere of any pollutant 
to which a standard applies shall be considered a modification within 
the meaning of section 111 of the Act. Upon modification, an existing 
facility shall become an affected facility for each pollutant to which a 
standard applies and for which there is an increase in the emission rate 
to the atmosphere.
    (b) Emission rate shall be expressed as kg/hr of any pollutant 
discharged into the atmosphere for which a standard is applicable. The 
Administrator shall use the following to determine emission rate:
    (1) Emission factors as specified in the latest issue of 
``Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors,'' EPA Publication No. 
AP-42, or other emission factors determined by the Administrator to be 
superior to AP-42 emission factors, in cases where utilization of 
emission factors demonstrates that the emission level resulting from the 
physical or operational change will either clearly increase or clearly 
not increase.
    (2) Material balances, continuous monitor data, or manual emission 
tests in cases where utilization of emission factors as referenced in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not demonstrate to the 
Administrator's satisfaction whether the emission level resulting from 
the physical or operational change will either clearly increase or 
clearly not increase, or where an owner or operator demonstrates to the 
Administrator's satisfaction that there are reasonable grounds to 
dispute the result obtained by the Administrator utilizing emission 
factors as referenced in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. When the 
emission rate is based on results from manual emission tests or 
continuous monitoring systems, the procedures specified in appendix C of 
this part shall be used to determine whether an increase in emission 
rate has occurred. Tests shall be conducted under such conditions as the 
Administrator shall specify to the owner or operator based on 
representative performance of the facility. At least three valid test 
runs must be conducted before and at least three after the physical or 
operational change. All operating parameters which may affect emissions 
must be held constant to the maximum feasible degree for all test runs.

[[Page 77]]

    (c) The addition of an affected facility to a stationary source as 
an expansion to that source or as a replacement for an existing facility 
shall not by itself bring within the applicability of this part any 
other facility within that source.
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) The following shall not, by themselves, be considered 
modifications under this part:
    (1) Maintenance, repair, and replacement which the Administrator 
determines to be routine for a source category, subject to the 
provisions of paragraph (c) of this section and Sec. 60.15.
    (2) An increase in production rate of an existing facility, if that 
increase can be accomplished without a capital expenditure on that 
facility.
    (3) An increase in the hours of operation.
    (4) Use of an alternative fuel or raw material if, prior to the date 
any standard under this part becomes applicable to that source type, as 
provided by Sec. 60.1, the existing facility was designed to 
accommodate that alternative use. A facility shall be considered to be 
designed to accommodate an alternative fuel or raw material if that use 
could be accomplished under the facility's construction specifications 
as amended prior to the change. Conversion to coal required for energy 
considerations, as specified in section 111(a)(8) of the Act, shall not 
be considered a modification.
    (5) The addition or use of any system or device whose primary 
function is the reduction of air pollutants, except when an emission 
control system is removed or is replaced by a system which the 
Administrator determines to be less environmentally beneficial.
    (6) The relocation or change in ownership of an existing facility.
    (f) Special provisions set forth under an applicable subpart of this 
part shall supersede any conflicting provisions of this section.
    (g) Within 180 days of the completion of any physical or operational 
change subject to the control measures specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section, compliance with all applicable standards must be achieved.
    (h) No physical change, or change in the method of operation, at an 
existing electric utility steam generating unit shall be treated as a 
modification for the purposes of this section provided that such change 
does not increase the maximum hourly emissions of any pollutant 
regulated under this section above the maximum hourly emissions 
achievable at that unit during the 5 years prior to the change.
    (i) Repowering projects that are awarded funding from the Department 
of Energy as permanent clean coal technology demonstration projects (or 
similar projects funded by EPA) are exempt from the requirements of this 
section provided that such change does not increase the maximum hourly 
emissions of any pollutant regulated under this section above the 
maximum hourly emissions achievable at that unit during the five years 
prior to the change.
    (j)(1) Repowering projects that qualify for an extension under 
section 409(b) of the Clean Air Act are exempt from the requirements of 
this section, provided that such change does not increase the actual 
hourly emissions of any pollutant regulated under this section above the 
actual hourly emissions achievable at that unit during the 5 years prior 
to the change.
    (2) This exemption shall not apply to any new unit that:
    (i) Is designated as a replacement for an existing unit;
    (ii) Qualifies under section 409(b) of the Clean Air Act for an 
extension of an emission limitation compliance date under section 405 of 
the Clean Air Act; and
    (iii) Is located at a different site than the existing unit.
    (k) The installation, operation, cessation, or removal of a 
temporary clean coal technology demonstration project is exempt from the

Sec. 60.15  Reconstruction.

    (a) An existing facility, upon reconstruction, becomes an affected 
facility, irrespective of any change in emission rate.
    (b) ``Reconstruction'' means the replacement of components of an 
existing facility to such an extent that:
    (1) The fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent 
of the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a 
comparable entirely new facility, and
    (2) It is technologically and economically feasible to meet the 
applicable standards set forth in this part.
    (c) ``Fixed capital cost'' means the capital needed to provide all 
the depreciable components.
    (d) If an owner or operator of an existing facility proposes to 
replace components, and the fixed capital cost of the new components 
exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost that would be required to 
construct a comparable entirely new facility, he shall notify the 
Administrator of the proposed replacements. The notice must be 
postmarked 60 days (or as soon as practicable) before construction of 
the replacements is commenced and must include the following 
information:
    (1) Name and address of the owner or operator.
    (2) The location of the existing facility.
    (3) A brief description of the existing facility and the components 
which are to be replaced.
    (4) A description of the existing air pollution control equipment 
and the proposed air pollution control equipment.
    (5) An estimate of the fixed capital cost of the replacements and of 
constructing a comparable entirely new facility.
    (6) The estimated life of the existing facility after the 
replacements.
    (7) A discussion of any economic or technical limitations the 
facility may have in complying with the applicable standards of 
performance after the proposed replacements.
    (e) The Administrator will determine, within 30 days of the receipt 
of the notice required by paragraph (d) of this section and any 
additional information he may reasonably require, whether the proposed 
replacement constitutes reconstruction.
    (f) The Administrator's determination under paragraph (e) shall be 
based on:
    (1) The fixed capital cost of the replacements in comparison to the 
fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a comparable 
entirely new facility;
    (2) The estimated life of the facility after the replacements 
compared to the life of a comparable entirely new facility;
    (3) The extent to which the components being replaced cause or 
contribute to the emissions from the facility; and
    (4) Any economic or technical limitations on compliance with 
applicable standards of performance which are inherent in the proposed 
replacements.
    (g) Individual subparts of this part may include specific provisions 
which refine and delimit the concept of reconstruction set forth in this 
section.

Sec. 60.18  General control device requirements.

    (a) Introduction. This section contains requirements for control 
devices used to comply with applicable subparts of parts 60 and 61. The 
requirements are placed here for administrative convenience and only 
apply to facilities covered by subparts referring to this section.
    (b) Flares. Paragraphs (c) through (f) apply to flares.
    (c)(1) Flares shall be designed for and operated with no visible 
emissions as determined by the methods specified in paragraph (f), 
except for periods not to exceed a total of 5 minutes during any 2 
consecutive hours.
    (2) Flares shall be operated with a flame present at all times, as 
determined by the methods specified in paragraph (f).
    (3) An owner/operator has the choice of adhering to either the heat 
content specifications in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section and the 
maximum tip velocity specifications in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, 
or adhering to the requirements in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.
    (i)(A) Flares shall be used that have a diameter of 3 inches or 
greater, are nonassisted, have a hydrogen content of 8.0 percent (by 
volume), or greater, and are designed for and operated with an exit 
velocity less than 37.2 m/sec (122 ft/sec) and less than the velocity, 
V<INF>max, as determined by the following equation:

V<INF>max=(X<INF>H2-K<INF>1)* K<INF>2

Where:

V<INF>max=Maximum permitted velocity, m/sec.
K<INF>1=Constant, 6.0 volume-percent hydrogen.
K<INF>2=Constant, 3.9(m/sec)/volume-percent hydrogen.
X<INF>H2=The volume-percent of hydrogen, on a wet basis, as 
calculated by using the American Society for Testing and Materials 
(ASTM) Method D1946-77. (Incorporated by reference as specified in Sec. 
60.17).

    (B) The actual exit velocity of a flare shall be determined by the 
method specified in paragraph (f)(4) of this section.
    (ii) Flares shall be used only with the net heating value of the gas 
being combusted being 11.2 MJ/scm (300 Btu/scf) or greater if the flare 
is steam-assisted or air-assisted; or with the net heating value of the 
gas being combusted being 7.45 MJ/scm (200 Btu/scf) or greater if the 
flare is nonassisted. The net heating value of the gas being combusted 
shall be determined by the methods specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this 
section.
    (4)(i) Steam-assisted and nonassisted flares shall be designed for 
and operated with an exit velocity, as determined by the methods 
specified in paragraph (f)(4) of this section, less than 18.3 m/sec (60 
ft/sec), except as provided in paragraphs (c)(4) (ii) and (iii) of this 
section.
    (ii) Steam-assisted and nonassisted flares designed for and operated 
with an exit velocity, as determined by the methods specified in 
paragraph (f)(4), equal to or greater than 18.3 m/sec (60

[[Page 86]]

ft/sec) but less than 122 m/sec (400 ft/sec) are allowed if the net 
heating value of the gas being combusted is greater than 37.3 MJ/scm 
(1,000 Btu/scf).
    (iii) Steam-assisted and nonassisted flares designed for and 
operated with an exit velocity, as determined by the methods specified 
in paragraph (f)(4), less than the velocity, V<INF>max, as 
determined by the method specified in paragraph (f)(5), and less than 
122 m/sec (400 ft/sec) are allowed.
    (5) Air-assisted flares shall be designed and operated with an exit 
velocity less than the velocity, V<INF>max, as determined by the 
method specified in paragraph (f)(6).
    (6) Flares used to comply with this section shall be steam-assisted, 
air-assisted, or nonassisted.
    (d) Owners or operators of flares used to comply with the provisions 
of this subpart shall monitor these control devices to ensure that they 
are operated and maintained in conformance with their designs. 
Applicable subparts will provide provisions stating how owners or 
operators of flares shall monitor these control devices.
    (e) Flares used to comply with provisions of this subpart shall be 
operated at all times when emissions may be vented to them.
    (f)(1) Method 22 of appendix A to this part shall be used to 
determine the compliance of flares with the visible emission provisions 
of this subpart. The observation period is 2 hours and shall be used 
according to Method 22.
    (2) The presence of a flare pilot flame shall be monitored using a 
thermocouple or any other equivalent device to detect the presence of a 
flame.
    (3) The net heating value of the gas being combusted in a flare 
shall be calculated using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.008

where:

H<INF>T=Net heating value of the sample, MJ/scm; where the net 
enthalpy per mole of offgas is based on combustion at 25 [deg]C and 760 
mm Hg, but the standard temperature for determining the volume 
corresponding to one mole is 20 [deg]C;
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.009

C<INF>i=Concentration of sample component i in ppm on a wet basis, 
as measured for organics by Reference Method 18 and measured for 
hydrogen and carbon monoxide by ASTM D1946-77 or 90 (Reapproved 1994) 
(Incorporated by reference as specified in Sec. 60.17); and
H<INF>i=Net heat of combustion of sample component i, kcal/g mole 
at 25 [deg]C and 760 mm Hg. The heats of combustion may be determined 
using ASTM D2382-76 or 88 or D4809-95 (incorporated by reference as 
specified in Sec. 60.17) if published values are not available or 
cannot be calculated.

    (4) The actual exit velocity of a flare shall be determined by 
dividing the volumetric flowrate (in units of standard temperature and 
pressure), as determined by Reference Methods 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D as 
appropriate; by the unobstructed (free) cross sectional area of the 
flare tip.
    (5) The maximum permitted velocity, V<INF>max, for flares 
complying with paragraph (c)(4)(iii) shall be determined by the 
following equation.
Log<INF>10 (V<INF>max)=(H<INF>T+28.8)/31.7

V<INF>max=Maximum permitted velocity, M/sec
28.8=Constant
31.7=Constant
H<INF>T=The net heating value as determined in paragraph (f)(3).

    (6) The maximum permitted velocity, V<INF>max, for air-
assisted flares shall be determined by the following equation.
V<INF>max=8.706+0.7084 (H<INF>T)

V<INF>max=Maximum permitted velocity, m/sec
8.706=Constant
0.7084=Constant

Sec. 60.19  General notification and reporting requirements.

    (a) For the purposes of this part, time periods specified in days 
shall be measured in calendar days, even if the word ``calendar'' is 
absent, unless otherwise specified in an applicable requirement.
    (b) For the purposes of this part, if an explicit postmark deadline 
is not specified in an applicable requirement for the submittal of a 
notification, application, report, or other written communication to the 
Administrator, the owner or operator shall postmark the submittal on or 
before the number of days specified in the applicable requirement. For 
example, if a notification must be submitted 15 days before a particular 
event is scheduled to take place, the notification shall be postmarked 
on or before 15 days preceding the event; likewise, if a notification 
must be submitted 15 days after a particular event takes place, the 
notification shall be delivered or postmarked on or before 15 days 
following the end of the event. The use of reliable non-Government mail 
carriers that provide indications of verifiable delivery of information 
required to be submitted to the Administrator, similar to the postmark 
provided by the U.S. Postal Service, or alternative means of delivery, 
including the use of electronic media, agreed to by the permitting 
authority, is acceptable.
    (c) Notwithstanding time periods or postmark deadlines specified in 
this part for the submittal of information to the Administrator by an 
owner or operator, or the review of such information by the 
Administrator, such time periods or deadlines may be changed by mutual 
agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator. 
Procedures governing the implementation of this provision are specified 
in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (d) If an owner or operator of an affected facility in a State with 
delegated authority is required to submit periodic reports under this 
part to the State, and if the State has an established timeline for the 
submission of periodic reports that is consistent with the reporting 
frequency(ies) specified for such facility under this part, the owner or 
operator may change the dates by which periodic reports under this part 
shall be submitted (without changing the frequency of reporting) to be 
consistent with the State's schedule by mutual agreement between the 
owner or operator and the State. The allowance in the previous sentence 
applies in each State beginning 1 year after the affected facility is 
required to be in compliance with the applicable subpart in this part. 
Procedures governing the implementation of this provision are specified 
in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (e) If an owner or operator supervises one or more stationary 
sources affected by standards set under this part and standards set 
under part 61, part 63, or both such parts of this chapter, he/she may 
arrange by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the 
Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) a common 
schedule on which periodic reports required by each applicable standard 
shall be submitted throughout the year. The allowance in the previous 
sentence applies in each State beginning 1 year after the stationary 
source is required to be in compliance with the applicable subpart in 
this part, or 1 year after the stationary source is required to be in 
compliance with the applicable 40 CFR part 61 or part 63 of this chapter 
standard, whichever is latest. Procedures governing the implementation 
of this provision are specified in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (f)(1)(i) Until an adjustment of a time period or postmark deadline 
has been approved by the Administrator under paragraphs (f)(2) and 
(f)(3) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected facility 
remains strictly subject to the requirements of this part.
    (ii) An owner or operator shall request the adjustment provided for 
in paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section each time he or she 
wishes to change an applicable time period or postmark deadline 
specified in this part.

[[Page 88]]

    (2) Notwithstanding time periods or postmark deadlines specified in 
this part for the submittal of information to the Administrator by an 
owner or operator, or the review of such information by the 
Administrator, such time periods or deadlines may be changed by mutual 
agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator. An owner 
or operator who wishes to request a change in a time period or postmark 
deadline for a particular requirement shall request the adjustment in 
writing as soon as practicable before the subject activity is required 
to take place. The owner or operator shall include in the request 
whatever information he or she considers useful to convince the 
Administrator that an adjustment is warranted.
    (3) If, in the Administrator's judgment, an owner or operator's 
request for an adjustment to a particular time period or postmark 
deadline is warranted, the Administrator will approve the adjustment. 
The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of 
approval or disapproval of the request for an adjustment within 15 
calendar days of receiving sufficient information to evaluate the 
request.
    (4) If the Administrator is unable to meet a specified deadline, he 
or she will notify the owner or operator of any significant delay and 
inform the owner or operator of the amended schedule.

                               Facilities

    Source: 40 FR 53346, Nov. 17, 1975, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 60.20  Applicability.

    The provisions of this subpart apply to States upon publication of a 
final guideline document under Sec. 60.22(a).


<R05>
Sec. 60.21  Definitions.

    Terms used but not defined in this subpart shall have the meaning 
given them in the Act and in subpart A:
    (a) Designated pollutant means any air pollutant, the emissions of 
which are subject to a standard of performance for new stationary 
sources, but for which air quality criteria have not been issued and 
that is not included on a list published under section 108(a) of the 
Act. Designated pollutant also means any air pollutant, the emissions of 
which are subject to a standard of performance for new stationary 
sources, that is on the section 112(b)(1) list and is emitted from a 
facility that is not part of a source category regulated under section 
112. Designated pollutant does not include pollutants on the section 
112(b)(1) list that are emitted from a facility that is part of a source 
category regulated under section 112.
    (b) Designated facility means any existing facility (see Sec. 
60.2(aa)) which emits a designated pollutant and which would be subject 
to a standard of performance for that pollutant if the existing facility 
were an affected facility (see Sec. 60.2(e)).
    (c) Plan means a plan under section 111(d) of the Act which 
establishes emission standards for designated pollutants from designated 
facilities and provides for the implementation and enforcement of such 
emission standards.
    (d) Applicable plan means the plan, or most recent revision thereof, 
which has been approved under Sec. 60.27(b) or promulgated under Sec. 
60.27(d).
    (e) Emission guideline means a guideline set forth in subpart C of 
this part, or in a final guideline document published under Sec. 
60.22(a), which reflects the degree of emission reduction achievable 
through the application of the best system of emission reduction which 
(taking into account the cost of such reduction) the Administrator has 
determined has been adequately demonstrated for designated facilities.
    (f) Emission standard means a legally enforceable regulation setting 
forth an allowable rate of emissions into the atmosphere, establishing 
an allowance system, or prescribing equipment specifications for control 
of air pollution emissions.
    (g) Compliance schedule means a legally enforceable schedule 
specifying a date or dates by which a source or category of sources must 
comply with specific emission standards contained in a

[[Page 89]]

plan or with any increments of progress to achieve such compliance.
    (h) Increments of progress means steps to achieve compliance which 
must be taken by an owner or operator of a designated facility, 
including:
    (1) Submittal of a final control plan for the designated facility to 
the appropriate air pollution control agency;
    (2) Awarding of contracts for emission control systems or for 
process modifications, or issuance of orders for the purchase of 
component parts to accomplish emission control or process modification;
    (3) Initiation of on-site construction or installation of emission 
control equipment or process change;
    (4) Completion of on-site construction or installation of emission 
control equipment or process change; and
    (5) Final compliance.
    (i) Region means an air quality control region designated under 
section 107 of the Act and described in part 81 of this chapter.
    (j) Local agency means any local governmental agency.
    (k) Allowance system means a control program under which the owner 
or operator of each designated facility is required to hold an 
authorization for each specified unit of a designated pollutant emitted 
from that facility during a specified period and which limits the total 
amount of such authorizations available to be held for a designated 
pollutant for a specified period and allows the transfer of such 
authorizations not used to meet the authorization-holding requirement.

<R05>
Sec. 60.22  Publication of guideline documents, emission guidelines, 

and final compliance times.

    (a) Concurrently upon or after proposal of standards of performance 
for the control of a designated pollutant from affected facilities, the 
Administrator will publish a draft guideline document containing 
information pertinent to control of the designated pollutant form 
designated facilities. Notice of the availability of the draft guideline 
document will be published in the Federal Register and public comments 
on its contents will be invited. After consideration of public comments 
and upon or after promulgation of standards of performance for control 
of a designated pollutant from affected facilities, a final guideline 
document will be published and notice of its availability will be 
published in the Federal Register.
    (b) Guideline documents published under this section will provide 
information for the development of State plans, such as:
    (1) Information concerning known or suspected endangerment of public 
health or welfare caused, or contributed to, by the designated 
pollutant.
    (2) A description of systems of emission reduction which, in the 
judgment of the Administrator, have been adequately demonstrated.
    (3) Information on the degree of emission reduction which is 
achievable with each system, together with information on the costs and 
environmental effects of applying each system to designated facilities.
    (4) Incremental periods of time normally expected to be necessary 
for the design, installation, and startup of identified control systems.
    (5) An emission guideline that reflects the application of the best 
system of emission reduction (considering the cost of such reduction) 
that has been adequately demonstrated for designated facilities, and the 
time within which compliance with emission standards of equivalent 
stringency can be achieved. The Administrator will specify different 
emission guidelines or compliance times or both for different sizes, 
types, and classes of designated facilities when costs of control, 
physical limitations, geographical location, or similar factors make 
subcategorization appropriate. (6) Such other available information as 
the Administrator determines may contribute to the formulation of State 
plans.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the 
emission guidelines and compliance times referred to in paragraph (b)(5) 
of this section will be proposed for comment upon publication of the 
draft guideline document, and after consideration of comments will be 
promulgated in subpart C of this part with such modifications as may be 
appropriate.

[[Page 90]]

    (d)(1) If the Administrator determines that a designated pollutant 
may cause or contribute to endangerment of public welfare, but that 
adverse effects on public health have not been demonstrated, he will 
include the determination in the draft guideline document and in the 
Federal Register notice of its availability. Except as provided in 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section, paragraph (c) of this section shall be 
inapplicable in such cases.
    (2) If the Administrator determines at any time on the basis of new 
information that a prior determination under paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section is incorrect or no longer correct, he will publish notice of the 
determination in the Federal Register, revise the guideline document as 
necessary under paragraph (a) of this section, and propose and 
promulgate emission guidelines and compliance times under paragraph (c) 
of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 60.23  Adoption and submittal of State plans; public hearings.

    (a)(1) Unless otherwise specified in the applicable subpart, within 
9 months after notice of the availability of a final guideline document 
is published under Sec. 60.22(a), each State shall adopt and submit to 
the Administrator, in accordance with Sec. 60.4 of subpart A of this 
part, a plan for the control of the designated pollutant to which the 
guideline document applies.
    (2) Within nine months after notice of the availability of a final 
revised guideline document is published as provided in Sec. 
60.22(d)(2), each State shall adopt and submit to the Administrator any 
plan revision necessary to meet the requirements of this subpart.
    (b) If no designated facility is located within a State, the State 
shall submit a letter of certification to that effect to the 
Administrator within the time specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section. Such certification shall exempt the State from the requirements 
of this subpart for that designated pollutant.
    (c)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this 
section, the State shall, prior to the adoption of any plan or revision 
thereof, conduct one or more public hearings within the State on such 
plan or plan revision.
    (2) No hearing shall be required for any change to an increment of 
progress in an approved compliance schedule unless the change is likely 
to cause the facility to be unable to comply with the final compliance 
date in the schedule.
    (3) No hearing shall be required on an emission standard in effect 
prior to the effective date of this subpart if it was adopted after a 
public hearing and is at least as stringent as the corresponding 
emission guideline specified in the applicable guideline document 
published under Sec. 60.22(a).
    (d) Any hearing required by paragraph (c) of this section shall be 
held only after reasonable notice. Notice shall be given at least 30 
days prior to the date of such hearing and shall include:
    (1) Notification to the public by prominently advertising the date, 
time, and place of such hearing in each region affected;
    (2) Availability, at the time of public announcement, of each 
proposed plan or revision thereof for public inspection in at least one 
location in each region to which it will apply;
    (3) Notification to the Administrator;
    (4) Notification to each local air pollution control agency in each 
region to which the plan or revision will apply; and
    (5) In the case of an interstate region, notification to any other 
State included in the region.
    (e) The State shall prepare and retain, for a minimum of 2 years, a 
record of each hearing for inspection by any interested party. The 
record shall contain, as a minimum, a list of witnesses together with 
the text of each presentation.
    (f) The State shall submit with the plan or revision:
    (1) Certification that each hearing required by paragraph (c) of 
this section was held in accordance with the notice required by 
paragraph (d) of this section; and
    (2) A list of witnesses and their organizational affiliations, if 
any, appearing at the hearing and a brief written summary of each 
presentation or written submission.

[[Page 91]]

    (g) Upon written application by a State agency (through the 
appropriate Regional Office), the Administrator may approve State 
procedures designed to insure public participation in the matters for 
which hearings are required and public notification of the opportunity 
to participate if, in the judgment of the Administrator, the procedures, 
although different from the requirements of this subpart, in fact 
provide for adequate notice to and participation of the public. The 
Administrator may impose such conditions on his approval as he deems 
necessary. Procedures approved under this section shall be deemed to 
satisfy the requirements of this subpart regarding procedures for public 
hearings.

<R05>
Sec. 60.24  Emission standards and compliance schedules.

    (a) Each plan shall include emission standards and compliance 
schedules.
    (b)(1) Emission standards shall either be based on an allowance 
system or prescribe allowable rates of emissions except when it is 
clearly impracticable.
    (2) Test methods and procedures for determining compliance with the 
emission standards shall be specified in the plan. Methods other than 
those specified in appendix A to this part may be specified in the plan 
if shown to be equivalent or alternative methods as defined in Sec. 
60.2 (t) and (u).
    (3) Emission standards shall apply to all designated facilities 
within the State. A plan may contain emission standards adopted by local 
jurisdictions provided that the standards are enforceable by the State.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, where the 
Administrator has determined that a designated pollutant may cause or 
contribute to endangerment of public health, emission standards shall be 
no less stringent than the corresponding emission guideline(s) specified 
in subpart C of this part, and final compliance shall be required as 
expeditiously as practicable but no later than the compliance times 
specified in subpart C of this part.
    (d) Where the Administrator has determined that a designated 
pollutant may cause or contribute to endangerment of public welfare but 
that adverse effects on public health have not been demonstrated, States 
may balance the emission guidelines, compliance times, and other 
information provided in the applicable guideline document against other 
factors of public concern in establishing emission standards, compliance 
schedules, and variances. Appropriate consideration shall be given to 
the factors specified in Sec. 60.22(b) and to information presented at 
the public hearing(s) conducted under Sec. 60.23(c).
    (e)(1) Any compliance schedule extending more than 12 months from 
the date required for submittal of the plan must include legally 
enforceable increments of progress to achieve compliance for each 
designated facility or category of facilities. Unless otherwise 
specified in the applicable subpart, increments of progress must 
include, where practicable, each increment of progress specified in 
Sec. 60.21(h) and must include such additional increments of progress 
as may be necessary to permit close and effective supervision of 
progress toward final compliance.
    (2) A plan may provide that compliance schedules for individual 
sources or categories of sources will be formulated after plan 
submittal. Any such schedule shall be the subject of a public hearing 
held according to Sec. 60.23 and shall be submitted to the 
Administrator within 60 days after the date of adoption of the schedule 
but in no case later than the date prescribed for submittal of the first 
semiannual report required by Sec. 60.25(e).
    (f) Unless otherwise specified in the applicable subpart on a case-
by-case basis for particular designated facilities or classes of 
facilities, States may provide for the application of less stringent 
emissions standards or longer compliance schedules than those otherwise 
required by paragraph (c) of this section, provided that the State 
demonstrates with respect to each such facility (or class of 
facilities):
    (1) Unreasonable cost of control resulting from plant age, location, 
or basic process design;
    (2) Physical impossibility of installing necessary control 
equipment; or

[[Page 92]]

    (3) Other factors specific to the facility (or class of facilities) 
that make application of a less stringent standard or final compliance 
time significantly more reasonable.
    (g) Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to preclude any State 
or political subdivision thereof from adopting or enforcing (1) emission 
standards more stringent than emission guidelines specified in subpart C 
of this part or in applicable guideline documents or (2) compliance 
schedules requiring final compliance at earlier times than those 
specified in subpart C or in applicable guideline documents.
    (h) Each of the States identified in paragraph (h)(1) of this 
section shall be subject to the requirements of paragraphs (h)(2) 
through (7) of this section.
    (1) Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, 
Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, 
Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, 
Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North 
Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode 
Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, 
Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming, and the 
District of Columbia shall each, and, if approved for treatment as a 
State under part 49 of this chapter, the Navajo Nation and the Ute 
Indian Tribe may each, submit a State plan meeting the requirements of 
paragraphs (h)(2) through (7) of this section and the other applicable 
requirements for a State plan under this subpart.
    (2) The State's State plan under paragraph (h)(1) of this section 
must be submitted to the Administrator by no later than November 17, 
2006. The State shall deliver five copies of the State plan to the 
appropriate Regional Office, with a letter giving notice of such action.
    (3) The State's State plan under paragraph (h)(1) of this section 
shall contain emission standards and compliance schedules and 
demonstrate that they will result in compliance with the State's annual 
electrical generating unit (EGU) mercury (Hg) budget for the appropriate 
periods. The amount of the annual EGU Hg budget, in tons of Hg per year, 
shall be as follows, for the indicated State for the indicated period:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                  Annual EGU Hg budget

Subpart Cc_Emission Guidelines and Compliance Times for Municipal Solid 
                             Waste Landfills

    Source: 61 FR 9919, Mar. 12, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 60.30c  Scope.

    This subpart contains emission guidelines and compliance times for 
the control of certain designated pollutants from certain designated 
municipal solid waste landfills in accordance with section 111(d) of the 
Act and subpart B.


<R05>
Sec. 60.31c  Definitions.

    Terms used but not defined in this subpart have the meaning given 
them in the Act and in subparts A, B, and WWW of this part.
    Municipal solid waste landfill or MSW landfill means an entire 
disposal facility in a contiguous geographical space where household 
waste is placed in or on land. An MSW landfill may also receive other 
types of RCRA Subtitle D wastes such as commercial solid waste, 
nonhazardous sludge, conditionally exempt small quantity generator 
waste, and industrial solid waste. Portions of an MSW landfill may be 
separated by access roads. An MSW landfill may be publicly or privately 
owned. An MSW landfill may be a new MSW landfill, an existing MSW 
landfill or a lateral expansion.


<R05>
Sec. 60.32c  Designated facilities.

    (a) The designated facility to which the guidelines apply is each 
existing MSW landfill for which construction, reconstruction or 
modification was commenced before May 30, 1991.
    (b) Physical or operational changes made to an existing MSW landfill 
solely to comply with an emission guideline are not considered a 
modification or reconstruction and would not subject an existing MSW 
landfill to the requirements of subpart WWW [see Sec. 60.750 of Subpart 
WWW].
    (c) For purposes of obtaining an operating permit under title V of 
the Act, the owner or operator of a MSW landfill subject to this subpart 
with a design capacity less than 2.5 million megagrams or 2.5 million 
cubic meters is not subject to the requirement to obtain an operating 
permit for the landfill under part 70 or 71 of this chapter, unless the 
landfill is otherwise subject to either part 70 or 71. For purposes of 
submitting a timely application for an operating permit under part 70 or 
71,

[[Page 110]]

the owner or operator of a MSW landfill subject to this subpart with a 
design capacity greater than or equal to 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 
million cubic meters on the effective date of EPA approval of the 
State's program under section 111(d) of the Act, and not otherwise 
subject to either part 70 or 71, becomes subject to the requirements of 
Sec. Sec. 70.5(a)(1)(i) or 71.5(a)(1)(i) of this chapter 90 days after 
the effective date of such 111(d) program approval, even if the design 
capacity report is submitted earlier.
    (d) When a MSW landfill subject to this subpart is closed, the owner 
or operator is no longer subject to the requirement to maintain an 
operating permit under part 70 or 71 of this chapter for the landfill if 
the landfill is not otherwise subject to the requirements of either part 
70 or 71 and if either of the following conditions are met.
    (1) The landfill was never subject to the requirement for a control 
system under Sec. 60.33c(c) of this subpart; or
    (2) The owner or operator meets the conditions for control system 
removal specified in Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(v) of subpart WWW.

<R05>
Sec. 60.33c  Emission guidelines for municipal solid waste landfill

emissions.

    (a) For approval, a State plan shall include control of MSW landfill 
emissions at each MSW landfill meeting the following three conditions:
    (1) The landfill has accepted waste at any time since November 8, 
1987, or has additional design capacity available for future waste 
deposition;
    (2) The landfill has a design capacity greater than or equal to 2.5 
million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters. The landfill may 
calculate design capacity in either megagrams or cubic meters for 
comparison with the exemption values. Any density conversions shall be 
documented and submitted with the design capacity report; and
    (3) The landfill has a nonmethane organic compound emission rate of 
50 megagrams per year or more.
    (b) For approval, a State plan shall include the installation of a 
collection and control system meeting the conditions provided in Sec. 
60.752(b)(2)(ii) of this part at each MSW landfill meeting the 
conditions in paragraph (a) of this section. The State plan shall 
include a process for State review and approval of the site-specific 
design plans for the gas collection and control system(s).
    (c) For approval, a State plan shall include provisions for the 
control of collected MSW landfill emissions through the use of control 
devices meeting the requirements of paragraph (c)(1), (2), or (3) of 
this section, except as provided in Sec. 60.24.
    (1) An open flare designed and operated in accordance with the 
parameters established in Sec. 60.18; or
    (2) A control system designed and operated to reduce NMOC by 98 
weight percent; or
    (3) An enclosed combustor designed and operated to reduce the outlet 
NMOC concentration to 20 parts per million as hexane by volume, dry 
basis at 3 percent oxygen, or less.
    (d) For approval, a State plan shall require each owner or operator 
of an MSW landfill having a design capacity less than 2.5 million 
megagrams by mass or 2.5 million cubic meters by volume to submit an 
initial design capacity report to the Administrator as provided in Sec. 
60.757(a)(2) of subpart WWW by the date specified in Sec. 60.35c of 
this subpart. The landfill may calculate design capacity in either 
megagrams or cubic meters for comparison with the exemption values. Any 
density conversions shall be documented and submitted with the report. 
Submittal of the initial design capacity report shall fulfill the 
requirements of this subpart except as provided in paragraph (d)(1) and 
(d)(2) of this section.
    (1) The owner or operator shall submit an amended design capacity 
report as provided in Sec. 60.757(a)(3) of subpart WWW. [Guidance: Note 
that if the design capacity increase is the result of a modification, as 
defined in Sec. 60.751 of subpart WWW, that was commenced on or after 
May 30, 1991, the landfill will become subject to subpart WWW instead of 
this subpart. If the design capacity increase is the result of a change 
in operating practices, density, or some other change that is not a 
modification, the landfill remains subject to this subpart.]

[[Page 111]]

    (2) When an increase in the maximum design capacity of a landfill 
with an initial design capacity less than 2.5 million megagrams or 2.5 
million cubic meters results in a revised maximum design capacity equal 
to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters, 
the owner or operator shall comply with paragraph (e) of this section.
    (e) For approval, a State plan shall require each owner or operator 
of an MSW landfill having a design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 
million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters to either install a 
collection and control system as provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section and Sec. 60.752(b)(2) of subpart WWW or calculate an initial 
NMOC emission rate for the landfill using the procedures specified in 
Sec. 60.34c of this subpart and Sec. 60.754 of subpart WWW. The NMOC 
emission rate shall be recalculated annually, except as provided in 
Sec. 60.757(b)(1)(ii) of subpart WWW.
    (1) If the calculated NMOC emission rate is less than 50 megagrams 
per year, the owner or operator shall:
    (i) Submit an annual emission report, except as provided for in 
Sec. 60.757(b)(1)(ii); and
    (ii) Recalculate the NMOC emission rate annually using the 
procedures specified in Sec. 60.754(a)(1) of subpart WWW until such 
time as the calculated NMOC emission rate is equal to or greater than 50 
megagrams per year, or the landfill is closed.
    (2)(i) If the NMOC emission rate, upon initial calculation or annual 
recalculation required in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, is equal 
to or greater than 50 megagrams per year, the owner or operator shall 
install a collection and control system as provided in paragraph (b) of 
this section and Sec. 60.752(b)(2) of subpart WWW.
    (ii) If the landfill is permanently closed, a closure notification 
shall be submitted to the Administrator as provided in Sec. 60.35c of 
this subpart and Sec. 60.757(d) of subpart WWW.

proration using the following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13JN07.001

Where:

PS<INF>NO<INF>X = Prorated standard for NO<INF>X when

    (e) As an alternate to meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a), 
(b), and (d) of this section, an owner or operator can petition the 
Administrator (in writing) to comply with Sec. 60.44Da(e)(3) of subpart 
Da of this part. If the Administrator grants the petition, the source 
will from then on (unless the unit is modified or reconstructed in the 
future) have to comply with the requirements in Sec. 60.44Da(e)(3) of 
subpart Da of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 60.45  Emissions and fuel monitoring.

    (a) Each owner or operator shall install, calibrate, maintain, and 
operate continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS) for measuring the 
opacity of emissions, SO<INF>2 emissions, NO<INF>X 
emissions, and either oxygen (O<INF>2) or carbon dioxide 
(CO<INF>2) except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Certain of the CEMS requirements under paragraph (a) of this 
section do not apply to owners or operators under the following 
conditions:
    (1) For a fossil-fuel-fired steam generator that burns only gaseous 
fossil fuel and that does not use post-combustion technology to reduce 
emissions of SO<INF>2 or PM, CEMS for measuring the opacity of 
emissions and SO<INF>2 emissions are not required.
    (2) For a fossil-fuel-fired steam generator that does not use a flue 
gas desulfurization device, a CEMS for

[[Page 120]]

measuring SO<INF>2 emissions is not required if the owner or 
operator monitors SO<INF>2 emissions by fuel sampling and 
analysis.
    (3) Notwithstanding Sec. 60.13(b), installation of a CEMS for 
NO<INF>X may be delayed until after the initial performance tests 
under Sec. 60.8 have been conducted. If the owner or operator 
demonstrates during the performance test that emissions of 
NO<INF>X are less than 70 percent of the applicable standards in 
Sec. 60.44, a CEMS for measuring NO<INF>X emissions is not 
required. If the initial performance test results show that 
NO<INF>X emissions are greater than 70 percent of the applicable 
standard, the owner or operator shall install a CEMS for NO<INF>X 
within one year after the date of the initial performance tests under 
Sec. 60.8 and comply with all other applicable monitoring requirements 
under this part.
    (4) If an owner or operator does not install any CEMS for sulfur 
oxides and NO<INF>X, as provided under paragraphs (b)(1) and 
(b)(3) or paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section a CEMS for 
measuring either O<INF>2 or CO<INF>2 is not required.
    (5) An owner or operator may petition the Administrator (in writing) 
to install a PM CEMS as an alternative to the CEMS for monitoring 
opacity emissions.
    (6) A CEMS for measuring the opacity of emissions is not required 
for a fossil fuel-fired steam generator that does not use post-
combustion technology (except a wet scrubber) for reducing PM, 
SO<INF>2, or carbon monoxide (CO) emissions, burns only gaseous 
fuels or fuel oils that contain less than or equal to 0.30 weight 
percent sulfur, and is operated such that emissions of CO to the 
atmosphere from the affected source are maintained at levels less than 
or equal to 0.15 lb/MMBtu on a boiler operating day average basis. 
Owners and operators of affected sources electing to comply with this 
paragraph must demonstrate compliance according to the procedures 
specified in paragraphs (b)(6)(i) through (iv) of this section.
    (i) You must monitor CO emissions using a CEMS according to the 
procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(6)(i)(A) through (D) of this 
section.
    (A) The CO CEMS must be installed, certified, maintained, and 
operated according to the provisions in Sec. 60.58b(i)(3) of subpart Eb 
of this part.
    (B) Each 1-hour CO emissions average is calculated using the data 
points generated by the CO CEMS expressed in parts per million by volume 
corrected to 3 percent oxygen (dry basis).
    (C) At a minimum, valid 1-hour CO emissions averages must be 
obtained for at least 90 percent of the operating hours on a 30-day 
rolling average basis. At least two data points per hour must be used to 
calculate each 1-hour average.
    (D) Quarterly accuracy determinations and daily calibration drift 
tests for the CO CEMS must be performed in accordance with procedure 1 
in appendix F of this part.
    (ii) You must calculate the 1-hour average CO emissions levels for 
each boiler operating day by multiplying the average hourly CO output 
concentration measured by the CO CEMS times the corresponding average 
hourly flue gas flow rate and divided by the corresponding average 
hourly heat input to the affected source. The 24-hour average CO 
emission level is determined by calculating the arithmetic average of 
the hourly CO emission levels computed for each boiler operating day.
    (iii) You must evaluate the preceding 24-hour average CO emission 
level each boiler operating day excluding periods of affected source 
startup, shutdown, or malfunction. If the 24-hour average CO emission 
level is greater than 0.15 lb/MMBtu, you must initiate investigation of 
the relevant equipment and control systems within 24 hours of the first 
discovery of the high emission incident and, take the appropriate 
corrective action as soon as practicable to adjust control settings or 
repair equipment to reduce the 24-hour average CO emission level to 0.15 
lb/MMBtu or less.
    (iv) You must record the CO measurements and calculations performed 
according to paragraph (b)(6) of this section and any corrective actions 
taken. The record of corrective action taken must include the date and 
time during which the 24-hour average CO emission level was greater than 
0.15 lb/MMBtu, and the date, time, and description of the corrective 
action.

Sec. 60.46(d).
    (2) Sulfur dioxide or nitric oxide, as applicable, shall be used for 
preparing calibration gas mixtures under Performance Specification 2 of 
appendix B to this part.
    (3) For affected facilities burning fossil fuel(s), the span value 
for a continuous monitoring system measuring the opacity of emissions 
shall be 80, 90, or 100 percent. For a continuous monitoring system 
measuring sulfur oxides or NO<INF>X the span value shall be 
determined using one of the following procedures:
    (i) Except as provided under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, 
SO<INF>2 and NO<INF>X span values shall be determined as 
follows:

determined according to sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 in appendix A to part 
75 of this chapter.
    (4) All span values computed under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this 
section for burning combinations of fossil fuels shall be rounded to the 
nearest 500 ppm. Span values that are computed under paragraph 
(c)(3)(ii) of this section shall be rounded off according to the 
applicable procedures in section 2 of appendix A to part 75 of this 
chapter.

    (a) In conducting the performance tests required in Sec. 60.8, and 
subsequent performance tests as requested by the EPA Administrator, the 
owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test 
methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as 
specified in this section, except as provided in Sec. 60.8(b). 
Acceptable alternative methods and procedures are given in paragraph (d) 
of this section.
    (b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the PM, 
SO<INF>2, and NO<INF>X standards in Sec. Sec. 60.42, 60.43, 
and 60.44 as follows:
    (1) The emission rate (E) of PM, SO<INF>2, or NO<INF>X 
shall be computed for each run using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13JN07.006

Where:

E = Emission rate of pollutant, ng/J (1b/million Btu);
C = Concentration of pollutant, ng/dscm (1b/dscf);
%O<INF>2 = O<INF>2 concentration, percent dry basis; and
F<INF>d = Factor as determined from Method 19 of appendix A of 
          this part.

    (2) Method 5 of appendix A of this part shall be used to determine 
the PM concentration (C) at affected facilities without wet flue-gas-
desulfurization (FGD) systems and Method 5B of appendix A of this part 
shall be used to determine the PM concentration (C) after FGD systems.
    (i) The sampling time and sample volume for each run shall be at 
least 60 minutes and 0.85 dscm (30 dscf). The probe and filter holder 
heating systems in the sampling train shall be set to provide an average 
gas temperature of 160<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>14 [deg]C (320<plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>25 [deg]F).
    (ii) The emission rate correction factor, integrated or grab 
sampling and analysis procedure of Method 3B of appendix A of this part 
shall be used to determine the O<INF>2 concentration 
(%O<INF>2).

[[Page 125]]

The O<INF>2 sample shall be obtained simultaneously with, and at 
the same traverse points as, the particulate sample. If the grab 
sampling procedure is used, the O<INF>2 concentration for the run 
shall be the arithmetic mean of the sample O<INF>2 concentrations 
at all traverse points.
    (iii) If the particulate run has more than 12 traverse points, the 
O<INF>2 traverse points may be reduced to 12 provided that Method 
1 of appendix A of this part is used to locate the 12 O<INF>2 
traverse points.
    (3) Method 9 of appendix A of this part and the procedures in Sec. 
60.11 shall be used to determine opacity.
    (4) Method 6 of appendix A of this part shall be used to determine 
the SO<INF>2 concentration.
    (i) The sampling site shall be the same as that selected for the 
particulate sample. The sampling location in the duct shall be at the 
centroid of the cross section or at a point no closer to the walls than 
1 m (3.28 ft). The sampling time and sample volume for each sample run 
shall be at least 20 minutes and 0.020 dscm (0.71 dscf). Two samples 
shall be taken during a 1-hour period, with each sample taken within a 
30-minute interval.
    (ii) The emission rate correction factor, integrated sampling and 
analysis procedure of Method 3B of appendix A of this part shall be used 
to determine the O<INF>2 concentration (%O<INF>2). The 
O<INF>2 sample shall be taken simultaneously with, and at the same 
point as, the SO<INF>2 sample. The SO<INF>2 emission rate 
shall be computed for each pair of SO<INF>2 and O<INF>2 
samples. The SO<INF>2 emission rate (E) for each run shall be the 
arithmetic mean of the results of the two pairs of samples.
    (5) Method 7 of appendix A of this part shall be used to determine 
the NO<INF>X concentration.
    (i) The sampling site and location shall be the same as for the 
SO<INF>2 sample. Each run shall consist of four grab samples, with 
each sample taken at about 15-minute intervals.
    (ii) For each NO<INF>X sample, the emission rate correction 
factor, grab sampling and analysis procedure of Method 3B of appendix A 
of this part shall be used to determine the O<INF>2 concentration 
(%O<INF>2). The sample shall be taken simultaneously with, and at 
the same point as, the NO<INF>X sample.
    (iii) The NO<INF>X emission rate shall be computed for each 
pair of NO<INF>X and O<INF>2 samples. The NO<INF>X 
emission rate (E) for each run shall be the arithmetic mean of the 
results of the four pairs of samples.

residue are fired, the owner or operator (in order to compute the 
prorated standard as shown in Sec. Sec. 60.43(b) and 60.44(b)) shall 
determine the percentage (w, x, y, or z) of the total heat input derived 
from each type of fuel as follows:
    (1) The heat input rate of each fuel shall be determined by 
multiplying the gross calorific value of each fuel fired by the rate of 
each fuel burned.
    (2) ASTM Methods D2015, or D5865 (solid fuels), D240 (liquid fuels), 
or D1826 (gaseous fuels) (all of these methods are incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 60.17) shall be used to determine the gross 
calorific values of the fuels. The method used to determine the 
calorific value of wood residue must be approved by the Administrator.
    (3) Suitable methods shall be used to determine the rate of each 
fuel burned during each test period, and a material balance over the 
steam generating system shall be used to confirm the rate.
    (d) The owner or operator may use the following as alternatives to 
the reference methods and procedures in this section or in other 
sections as specified:
    (1) The emission rate (E) of PM, SO<INF>2 and NO<INF>X 
may be determined by using the Fc factor, provided that the following 
procedure is used:
    (i) The emission rate (E) shall be computed using the following 
equation:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13JN07.007

Where:

E = Emission rate of pollutant, ng/J (lb/MMBtu);
C = Concentration of pollutant, ng/dscm (lb/dscf);
%CO<INF>2 = CO<INF>2 concentration, percent dry basis; and
F<INF>c = Factor as determined in appropriate sections of Method 
          19 of appendix A of this part.


[[Page 126]]


    (ii) If and only if the average Fc factor in Method 19 of appendix A 
of this part is used to calculate E and either E is from 0.97 to 1.00 of 
the emission standard or the relative accuracy of a continuous emission 
monitoring system is from 17 to 20 percent, then three runs of Method 3B 
of appendix A of this part shall be used to determine the O<INF>2 
and CO<INF>2 concentration according to the procedures in 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii), (4)(ii), or (5)(ii) of this section. Then if 
F<INF>o (average of three runs), as calculated from the equation 
in Method 3B of appendix A of this part, is more than <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>3 percent than the average F<INF>o value, as 
determined from the average values of F<INF>d and F<INF>c in 
Method 19 of appendix A of this part, i.e., F<INF>oa = 0.209 
(F<INF>da/F<INF>ca), then the following procedure shall be 
followed:
    (A) When F<INF>o is less than 0.97 F<INF>oa, then E 
shall be increased by that proportion under 0.97 F<INF>oa, e.g., 
if F<INF>o is 0.95 F<INF>oa, E shall be increased by 2 
percent. This recalculated value shall be used to determine compliance 
with the emission standard.
    (B) When F<INF>o is less than 0.97 F<INF>oa and when the 
average difference (d) between the continuous monitor minus the 
reference methods is negative, then E shall be increased by that 
proportion under 0.97 F<INF>oa, e.g., if F<INF>o is 0.95 
F<INF>oa, E shall be increased by 2 percent. This recalculated 
value shall be used to determine compliance with the relative accuracy 
specification.
    (C) When F<INF>o is greater than 1.03 F<INF>oa and when 
the average difference d is positive, then E shall be decreased by that 
proportion over 1.03 F<INF>oa, e.g., if F<INF>o is 1.05 
F<INF>oa, E shall be decreased by 2 percent. This recalculated 
value shall be used to determine compliance with the relative accuracy 
specification.
    (2) For Method 5 or 5B of appendix A of this part, Method 17 of 
appendix A of this part may be used at facilities with or without wet 
FGD systems if the stack gas temperature at the sampling location does 
not exceed an average temperature of 16 0 [deg]C (320 [deg]F). The 
procedures of sections 2.1 and 2.3 of Method 5B of appendix A of this 
part may be used with Method 17 of appendix A of this part only if it is 
used after wet FGD systems. Method 17 of appendix A of this part shall 
not be used after wet FGD systems if the effluent gas is saturated or 
laden with water droplets.
    (3) Particulate matter and SO<INF>2 may be determined 
simultaneously with the Method 5 of appendix A of this part train 
provided that the following changes are made:
    (i) The filter and impinger apparatus in sections 2.1.5 and 2.1.6 of 
Method 8 of appendix A of this part is used in place of the condenser 
(section 2.1.7) of Method 5 of appendix A of this part.
    (ii) All applicable procedures in Method 8 of appendix A of this 
part for the determination of SO<INF>2 (including moisture) are 
used:
    (4) For Method 6 of appendix A of this part, Method 6C of appendix A 
of this part may be used. Method 6A of appendix A of this part may also 
be used whenever Methods 6 and 3B of appendix A of this part data are 
specified to determine the SO<INF>2 emission rate, under the 
conditions in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (5) For Method 7 of appendix A of this part, Method 7A, 7C, 7D, or 
7E of appendix A of this part may be used. If Method 7C, 7D, or 7E of 
appendix A of this part is used, the sampling time for each run shall be 
at least 1 hour and the integrated sampling approach shall be used to 
determine the O<INF>2 concentration (%O<INF>2) for the 
emission rate correction factor.
    (6) For Method 3 of appendix A of this part, Method 3A or 3B of 
appendix A of this part may be used.
    (7) For Method 3B of appendix A of this part, Method 3A of appendix 
A of this part may be used.

heat input capacity would have a 289,080 MWh 12 month potential 
electrical output capacity). For electric utility combined cycle gas

Sec. 60.48Da  Compliance provisions.

    (a) Compliance with the PM emission limitation under Sec. 
60.42Da(a)(1) constitutes compliance with the percent reduction 
requirements for PM under Sec. 60.42Da(a)(2) and (3).
    (b) Compliance with the NO<INF>X emission limitation under 
Sec. 60.44Da(a)(1) constitutes compliance with the percent reduction 
requirements under Sec. 60.44Da(a)(2).
    (c) The PM emission standards under Sec. 60.42Da, the 
NO<INF>X emission standards under Sec. 60.44Da, and the Hg 
emission standards under Sec. 60.45Da apply at all times except during 
periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction.
    (d) During emergency conditions in the principal company, an 
affected facility with a malfunctioning flue gas desulfurization system 
may be operated if SO<INF>2 emissions are minimized by:
    (1) Operating all operable flue gas desulfurization system modules, 
and bringing back into operation any malfunctioned module as soon as 
repairs are completed,
    (2) Bypassing flue gases around only those flue gas desulfurization 
system modules that have been taken out of operation because they were 
incapable of any SO<INF>2 emission reduction or which would have 
suffered significant physical damage if they had remained in operation, 
and
    (3) Designing, constructing, and operating a spare flue gas 
desulfurization system module for an affected facility larger than 365 
MW (1,250 MMBtu/hr)

[[Page 139]]

heat input (approximately 125 MW electrical output capacity). The 
Administrator may at his discretion require the owner or operator within 
60 days of notification to demonstrate spare module capability. To 
demonstrate this capability, the owner or operator must demonstrate 
compliance with the appropriate requirements under paragraph under Sec. 
60.43Da(a), (b), (d), (e), and (h) for any period of operation lasting 
from 24 hours to 30 days when:
    (i) Any one flue gas desulfurization module is not operated,
    (ii) The affected facility is operating at the maximum heat input 
rate,
    (iii) The fuel fired during the 24-hour to 30-day period is 
representative of the type and average sulfur content of fuel used over 
a typical 30-day period, and
    (iv) The owner or operator has given the Administrator at least 30 
days notice of the date and period of time over which the demonstration 
will be performed.
    (e) After the initial performance test required under Sec. 60.8, 
compliance with the SO<INF>2 emission limitations and percentage 
reduction requirements under Sec. 60.43Da and the NO<INF>X 
emission limitations under Sec. 60.44Da is based on the average 
emission rate for 30 successive boiler operating days. A separate 
performance test is completed at the end of each boiler operating day 
after the initial performance test, and a new 30 day average emission 
rate for both SO<INF>2 and NO<INF>X and a new percent 
reduction for SO<INF>2 are calculated to show compliance with the 
standards.
    (f) For the initial performance test required under Sec. 60.8, 
compliance with the SO<INF>2 emission limitations and percent 
reduction requirements under Sec. 60.43Da and the NO<INF>X 
emission limitation under Sec. 60.44Da is based on the average emission 
rates for SO<INF>2, NO<INF>X, and percent reduction for 
SO<INF>2 for the first 30 successive boiler operating days. The 
initial performance test is the only test in which at least 30 days 
prior notice is required unless otherwise specified by the 
Administrator. The initial performance test is to be scheduled so that 
the first boiler operating day of the 30 successive boiler operating 
days is completed within 60 days after achieving the maximum production 
rate at which the affected facility will be operated, but not later than 
180 days after initial startup of the facility.
    (g) The owner or operator of an affected facility subject to 
emission limitations in this subpart shall determine compliance as 
follows:
    (1) Compliance with applicable 30-day rolling average SO<INF>2 
and NO<INF>X emission limitations is determined by calculating the 
arithmetic average of all hourly emission rates for SO<INF>2 and 
NO<INF>X for the 30 successive boiler operating days, except for 
data obtained during startup, shutdown, malfunction (NO<INF>X 
only), or emergency conditions (SO<INF>2 only).
    (2) Compliance with applicable SO<INF>2 percentage reduction 
requirements is determined based on the average inlet and outlet 
SO<INF>2 emission rates for the 30 successive boiler operating 
days.
    (3) Compliance with applicable daily average PM emission limitations 
is determined by calculating the arithmetic average of all hourly 
emission rates for PM each boiler operating day, except for data 
obtained during startup, shutdown, and malfunction. Averages are only 
calculated for boiler operating days that have valid data for at least 
18 hours of unit operation during which the standard applies. Instead, 
the valid hourly emission rates are averaged with the next boiler 
operating day with 18 hours or more of valid PM CEMS data to determine 
compliance.
    (h) If an owner or operator has not obtained the minimum quantity of 
emission data as required under Sec. 60.49Da of this subpart, 
compliance of the affected facility with the emission requirements under 
Sec. Sec. 60.43Da and 60.44Da of this subpart for the day on which the 
30-day period ends may be determined by the Administrator by following 
the applicable procedures in section 7 of Method 19 of appendix A of 
this part.
    (i) Compliance provisions for sources subject to Sec. 
60.44Da(d)(1), (e)(1), (e)(2)(i), (e)(3)(i), or (f). The owner or 
operator of an affected facility subject to Sec. 60.44Da(d)(1), (e)(1), 
(e)(2)(i), (e)(3)(i), or (f) shall calculate NO<INF>X emissions as 
1.194 x 10<SUP>-</SUP>\7\ lb/scf-ppm times the average hourly 
NO<INF>X output concentration in ppm (measured according to the 
provisions of Sec. 60.49Da(c)), times the average hourly flow rate 
(measured in scfh,

[[Page 140]]

according to the provisions of Sec. 60.49Da(l) or Sec. 60.49Da(m)), 
divided by the average hourly gross energy output (measured according to 
the provisions of Sec. 60.49Da(k)). Alternatively, for oil-fired and 
gas-fired units, NO<INF>X emissions may be calculated by 
multiplying the hourly NO<INF>X emission rate in lb/MMBtu 
(measured by the CEMS required under Sec. Sec. 60.49Da(c) and (d)), by 
the hourly heat input rate (measured according to the provisions of 
Sec. 60.49Da(n)), and dividing the result by the average gross energy 
output (measured according to the provisions of Sec. 60.49Da(k)).
    (j) Compliance provisions for duct burners subject to Sec. 
60.44Da(a)(1). To determine compliance with the emissions limits for 
NO<INF>X required by Sec. 60.44Da(a) for duct burners used in 
combined cycle systems, either of the procedures described in paragraph 
(j)(1) or (2) of this section may be used:
    (1) The owner or operator of an affected duct burner shall conduct 
the performance test required under Sec. 60.8 using the appropriate 
methods in appendix A of this part. Compliance with the emissions limits 
under Sec. 60.44Da(a)(1) is determined on the average of three (nominal 
1-hour) runs for the initial and subsequent performance tests. During 
the performance test, one sampling site shall be located in the exhaust 
of the turbine prior to the duct burner. A second sampling site shall be 
located at the outlet from the heat recovery steam generating unit. 
Measurements shall be taken at both sampling sites during the 
performance test; or
    (2) The owner or operator of an affected duct burner may elect to 
determine compliance by using the continuous emission monitoring system 
(CEMS) specified under Sec. 60.49Da for measuring NO<INF>X and 
oxygen (O<INF>2) (or carbon dioxide (CO<INF>2)) and meet the 
requirements of Sec. 60.49Da. Alternatively, data from a NO<INF>X 
emission rate (i.e., NO<INF>X-diluent) CEMS certified according to 
the provisions of Sec. 75.20(c) of this chapter and appendix A to part 
75 of this chapter, and meeting the quality assurance requirements of 
Sec. 75.21 of this chapter and appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, 
may be used, with the following caveats. Data used to meet the 
requirements of Sec. 60.51Da shall not include substitute data values 
derived from the missing data procedures in subpart D of part 75 of this 
chapter, nor shall the data have been bias adjusted according to the 
procedures of part 75 of this chapter. The sampling site shall be 
located at the outlet from the steam generating unit. The NO<INF>X 
emission rate at the outlet from the steam generating unit shall 
constitute the NO<INF>X emission rate from the duct burner of the 
combined cycle system.
    (k) Compliance provisions for duct burners subject to Sec. 
60.44Da(d)(1) or (e)(1). To determine compliance with the emission 
limitation for NO<INF>X required by Sec. 60.44Da(d)(1) or (e)(1) 
for duct burners used in combined cycle systems, either of the 
procedures described in paragraphs (k)(1) and (2) of this section may be 
used:
    (1) The owner or operator of an affected duct burner used in 
combined cycle systems shall determine compliance with the applicable 
NO<INF>X emission limitation in Sec. 60.44Da(d)(1) or (e)(1) as 
follows:

          combustion turbine, dscm/hr (dscf/hr);
O<INF>sg = Average hourly gross energy output from steam 
          generating unit, J (MWh); and
h = Average hourly fraction of the total heat input to the steam 
          generating unit derived from the combustion of fuel in the 
          affected duct burner.

    (ii) Method 7E of appendix A of this part shall be used to determine 
the NO<INF>X concentrations (C<INF>sg and C<INF>te). 
Method 2, 2F or 2G of appendix A of this

[[Page 141]]

part, as appropriate, shall be used to determine the volumetric flow 
rates (Q<INF>sg and Q<INF>te) of the exhaust gases. The 
volumetric flow rate measurements shall be taken at the same time as the 
concentration measurements.
    (iii) The owner or operator shall develop, demonstrate, and provide 
information satisfactory to the Administrator to determine the average 
hourly gross energy output from the steam generating unit, and the 
average hourly percentage of the total heat input to the steam 
generating unit derived from the combustion of fuel in the affected duct 
burner.
    (iv) Compliance with the applicable NO<INF>X emission 
limitation in Sec. 60.44Da(d)(1) or (e)(1) is determined by the three-
run average (nominal 1-hour runs) for the initial and subsequent 
performance tests.
    (2) The owner or operator of an affected duct burner used in a 
combined cycle system may elect to determine compliance with the 
applicable NO<INF>X emission limitation in Sec. 60.44Da(d)(1) or

    (ii) The CEMS specified under Sec. 60.49Da for measuring 
NO<INF>X and O<INF>2 (or CO<INF>2) shall be used to 
determine the average hourly NO<INF>X concentrations 
(C<INF>sg). The continuous flow monitoring system specified in 
Sec. 60.49Da(l) or Sec. 60.49Da(m) shall be used to determine the

emissions by installing, operating, and maintaining continuous fuel 
flowmeters following the appropriate measurements procedures specified 
in appendix D of part 75 of this chapter. If this compliance option is 
selected, the emission rate (E) of NO<INF>X shall be computed 
using Equation 4 in this section:

the Administrator on methods for apportioning the combined gross energy 
output from the steam turbine for each of the affected duct burners. The 
Administrator may approve such demonstrated substitute methods for 
apportioning the combined gross energy output measured at the steam 
turbine whenever the demonstration ensures accurate estimation of 
emissions regulated under this part.
    (l) Compliance provisions for sources subject to Sec. 60.45Da. The 
owner or operator of an affected facility subject to Sec. 60.45Da (new 
sources constructed or reconstructed after January 30, 2004) shall 
calculate the Hg emission rate (lb/MWh) for each calendar month of the 
year, using hourly Hg concentrations measured according to the 
provisions of Sec. 60.49Da(p) in conjunction with hourly stack gas 
volumetric flow rates measured according to the provisions of Sec. 
60.49Da(l) or (m), and hourly gross electrical outputs, determined 
according to the provisions in Sec. 60.49Da(k). Compliance with the 
applicable standard under Sec. 60.45Da is determined on a 12-month 
rolling average basis.
    (m) Compliance provisions for sources subject to Sec. 
60.43Da(i)(1)(i), (i)(2)(i), (i)(3)(i), (j)(1)(i), (j)(2)(i), or

(j)(3)(i) shall calculate SO<INF>2 emissions as 1.660 x 
10<SUP>-7</SUP> lb/scf-ppm times the average hourly SO<INF>2 
output concentration in ppm (measured according to the provisions of 
Sec. 60.49Da(b)), times the average hourly flow rate (measured 
according to the provisions of Sec. 60.49Da(l) or Sec. 60.49Da(m)), 
divided by the average hourly gross energy output (measured according to 
the provisions of Sec. 60.49Da(k)). Alternatively, for oil-fired and 
gas-fired units, SO<INF>2 emissions may be calculated by 
multiplying the hourly SO<INF>2 emission rate (in lb/MMBtu), 
measured by the CEMS required under Sec. 60.49Da, by the hourly heat 
input rate (measured according to the provisions of Sec. 60.49Da(n)), 
and dividing the result by the average gross energy output (measured 
according to the provisions of Sec. 60.49Da(k)).
    (n) Compliance provisions for sources subject to Sec. 
60.42Da(c)(1). The owner or operator of an affected facility subject to 
Sec. 60.42Da(c)(1) shall calculate PM emissions by multiplying the 
average hourly PM output concentration, measured according to the 
provisions of Sec. 60.49Da(t), by the average hourly flow rate, 
measured according to the provisions of Sec. 60.49Da(l), and divided by 
the average hourly gross energy output, measured according to the 
provisions of Sec. 60.49Da(k). Compliance with the emission limit is 
determined by calculating the arithmetic average of the hourly emission 
rates computed for each boiler operating day.
    (o) Compliance provisions for sources subject to Sec. 60.42Da(c)(2) 
or (d). Except as provided for in paragraph (p) of this section, the 
owner or operator of an affected facility for which construction, 
reconstruction, or modification commenced after February 28, 2005, shall 
demonstrate compliance with each applicable emission limit according to 
the requirements in paragraphs (o)(1) through (o)(5) of this section and 
use a COMS to demonstrate compliance with Sec. 60.42Da(b).
    (1) You must conduct a performance test to demonstrate initial 
compliance with the applicable PM emissions limit in 60.42Da(c)(2) or 
(d) by the applicable date specified in Sec. 60.8(a). Thereafter, you 
must conduct each subsequent performance test within 12 calendar months 
of the date of the prior performance test. You must conduct each 
performance test according to the requirements in Sec. 60.8 using the 
test methods and procedures in Sec. 60.50Da.
    (2) You must monitor the performance of each electrostatic 
precipitator or fabric filter (baghouse) operated to comply with the 
applicable PM emissions limit in Sec. 60.42Da(c)(2) or (d) using a 
continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS) according to the 
requirements in paragraphs (o)(2)(i) through (vi) unless you elect to 
comply with one of the alternatives provided in paragraphs (o)(3) and 
(o)(4) of this section, as applicable to your control device.

[[Page 143]]

    (i) Each COMS must meet Performance Specification 1 in 40 CFR part 
60, appendix B.
    (ii) You must comply with the quality assurance requirements in 
paragraphs (o)(4)(ii)(A) through (E) of this section.
    (A) You must automatically (intrinsic to the opacity monitor) check 
the zero and upscale (span) calibration drifts at least once daily. For 
a particular COMS, the acceptable range of zero and upscale calibration 
materials is as defined in the applicable version of Performance 
Specification 1 in 40 CFR part 60, appendix B.
    (B) You must adjust the zero and span whenever the 24-hour zero 
drift or 24-hour span drift exceeds 4 percent opacity. The COMS must 
allow for the amount of excess zero and span drift measured at the 24-
hour interval checks to be recorded and quantified. The optical surfaces 
exposed to the effluent gases must be cleaned prior to performing the 
zero and span drift adjustments, except for systems using automatic zero 
adjustments. For systems using automatic zero adjustments, the optical 
surfaces must be cleaned when the cumulative automatic zero compensation 
exceeds 4 percent opacity.
    (C) You must apply a method for producing a simulated zero opacity 
condition and an upscale (span) opacity condition using a certified 
neutral density filter or other related technique to produce a known 
obscuration of the light beam. All procedures applied must provide a 
system check of the analyzer internal optical surfaces and all 
electronic circuitry including the lamp and photodetector assembly.
    (D) Except during periods of system breakdowns, repairs, calibration 
checks, and zero and span adjustments, the COMS must be in continuous 
operation and must complete a minimum of one cycle of sampling and 
analyzing for each successive 10 second period and one cycle of data 
recording for each successive 6-minute period.
    (E) You must reduce all data from the COMS to 6-minute averages. 
Six-minute opacity averages must be calculated from 36 or more data 
points equally spaced over each 6-minute period. Data recorded during 
periods of system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero and 
span adjustments must not be included in the data averages. An 
arithmetic or integrated average of all data may be used.
    (iii) During each performance test conducted according to paragraph 
(o)(1) of this section, you must establish an opacity baseline level. 
The value of the opacity baseline level is determined by averaging all 
of the 6-minute average opacity values (reported to the nearest 0.1 
percent opacity) from the COMS measurements recorded during each of the 
test run intervals conducted for the performance test, and then adding 
2.5 percent opacity to your calculated average opacity value for all of 
the test runs. If your calculated average opacity value for all of the 
test runs is less than 5.0 percent, then the opacity baseline level is 
set at 5.0 percent.
    (iv) You must evaluate the preceding 24-hour average opacity level 
measured by the COMS each boiler operating day excluding periods of 
affected source startup, shutdown, or malfunction. If the measured 24-
hour average opacity emission level is greater than the baseline opacity 
level determined in paragraph (o)(2)(iii) of this section, you must 
initiate investigation of the relevant equipment and control systems 
within 24 hours of the first discovery of the high opacity incident and 
take the appropriate corrective action as soon as practicable to adjust 
control settings or repair equipment to reduce the measured 24-hour 
average opacity to a level below the baseline opacity level.
    (v) You must record the opacity measurements, calculations 
performed, and any corrective actions taken. The record of corrective 
action taken must include the date and time during which the measured 
24-hour average opacity was greater than baseline opacity level, and the 
date, time, and description of the corrective action.
    (vi) If the measured 24-hour average opacity for your affected 
source remains at a level greater than the opacity baseline level after 
7 days, then you must conduct a new PM performance test according to 
paragraph (o)(1) of this section and establish a new opacity baseline 
value according to paragraph (o)(2) of this section. This new

[[Page 144]]

performance test must be conducted within 60 days of the date that the 
measured 24-hour average opacity was first determined to exceed the 
baseline opacity level unless a wavier is granted by the appropriate 
delegated permitting authority.
    (3) As an alternative to complying with the requirements of 
paragraph (o)(2) of this section, an owner or operator may elect to 
monitor the performance of an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) operated 
to comply with the applicable PM emissions limit in Sec. 60.42Da(c)(2) 
or (d) using an ESP predictive model developed in accordance with the 
requirements in paragraphs (o)(3)(i) through (v) of this section.
    (i) You must calibrate the ESP predictive model with each PM control 
device used to comply with the applicable PM emissions limit in Sec. 
60.42Da(c)(2) or (d) operating under normal conditions. In cases when a 
wet scrubber is used in combination with an ESP to comply with the PM 
emissions limit, the daily average liquid-to-gas flow rate for the wet 
scrubber must be maintained at 90 percent of average ratio measured 
during all test run intervals for the performance test conducted 
according to paragraph (o)(1) of this section.
    (ii) You must develop a site-specific monitoring plan that includes 
a description of the ESP predictive model used, the model input 
parameters, and the procedures and criteria for establishing monitoring 
parameter baseline levels indicative of compliance with the PM emissions 
limit. You must submit the site-specific monitoring plan for approval by 
the appropriate delegated permitting authority. For reference purposes 
in preparing the monitoring plan, see the OAQPS ``Compliance Assurance 
Monitoring (CAM) Protocol for an Electrostatic Precipitator (ESP) 
Controlling Particulate Matter (PM) Emissions from a Coal-Fired 
Boiler.'' This document is available from the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (U.S. EPA); Office of Air Quality Planning and 
Standards; Sector Policies and Programs Division; Measurement Policy 
Group (D243-02), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. This document is also 
available on the Technology Transfer Network (TTN) under Emission 
Measurement Center Continuous Emission Monitoring .
    (iii) You must run the ESP predictive model using the applicable 
input data each boiler operating day and evaluate the model output for 
the preceding boiler operating day excluding periods of affected source 
startup, shutdown, or malfunction. If the values for one or more of the 
model parameters exceed the applicable baseline levels determined 
according to your approved site-specific monitoring plan, you must 
initiate investigation of the relevant equipment and control systems 
within 24 hours of the first discovery of a model parameter deviation 
and, take the appropriate corrective action as soon as practicable to 
adjust control settings or repair equipment to return the model output 
to within the applicable baseline levels.
    (iv) You must record the ESP predictive model inputs and outputs and 
any corrective actions taken. The record of corrective action taken must 
include the date and time during which the model output values exceeded 
the applicable baseline levels, and the date, time, and description of 
the corrective action.
    (v) If after 7 consecutive days a model parameter continues to 
exceed the applicable baseline level, then you must conduct a new PM 
performance test according to paragraph (o)(1) of this section. This new 
performance test must be conducted within 60 days of the date that the 
model parameter was first determined to exceed its baseline level unless 
a wavier is granted by the appropriate delegated permitting authority.
    (4) As an alternative to complying with the requirements of 
paragraph (o)(2) of this section, an owner or operator may elect to 
monitor the performance of a fabric filter (baghouse) operated to comply 
with the applicable PM emissions limit in Sec. 60.42Da(c)(2) or (d) by 
using a bag leak detection system according to the requirements in 
paragraphs (o)(4)(i) through (v) of this section.
    (i) Each bag leak detection system must meet the specifications and 
requirements in paragraphs (o)(4)(i)(A) through (H) of this section.

[[Page 145]]

    (A) The bag leak detection system must be certified by the 
manufacturer to be capable of detecting PM emissions at concentrations 
of 1 milligram per actual cubic meter (0.00044 grains per actual cubic 
foot) or less.
    (B) The bag leak detection system sensor must provide output of 
relative PM loadings. The owner or operator must continuously record the 
output from the bag leak detection system using electronic or other 
means (e.g., using a strip chart recorder or a data logger.)
    (C) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an alarm 
system that will react when the system detects an increase in relative 
particulate loading over the alarm set point established according to 
paragraph (o)(4)(i)(D) of this section, and the alarm must be located 
such that it can be noticed by the appropriate plant personnel.
    (D) In the initial adjustment of the bag leak detection system, you 
must establish, at a minimum, the baseline output by adjusting the 
sensitivity (range) and the averaging period of the device, the alarm 
set points, and the alarm delay time.
    (E) Following initial adjustment, you must not adjust the averaging 
period, alarm set point, or alarm delay time without approval from the 
appropriate delegated permitting authority except as provided in 
paragraph (d)(1)(vi) of this section.
    (F) Once per quarter, you may adjust the sensitivity of the bag leak 
detection system to account for seasonal effects, including temperature 
and humidity, according to the procedures identified in the site-
specific monitoring plan required by paragraph (o)(4)(ii) of this 
section.
    (G) You must install the bag leak detection sensor downstream of the 
fabric filter and upstream of any wet scrubber.
    (H) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's 
instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.
    (ii) You must develop and submit to the appropriate delegated 
permitting authority for approval a site-specific monitoring plan for 
each bag leak detection system. You must operate and maintain the bag 
leak detection system according to the site-specific monitoring plan at 
all times. Each monitoring plan must describe the items in paragraphs 
(o)(4)(ii)(A) through (F) of this section.
    (A) Installation of the bag leak detection system;
    (B) Initial and periodic adjustment of the bag leak detection 
system, including how the alarm set-point will be established;
    (C) Operation of the bag leak detection system, including quality 
assurance procedures;
    (D) How the bag leak detection system will be maintained, including 
a routine maintenance schedule and spare parts inventory list;
    (E) How the bag leak detection system output will be recorded and 
stored; and
    (F) Corrective action procedures as specified in paragraph 
(o)(4)(iii) of this section. In approving the site-specific monitoring 
plan, the appropriate delegated permitting authority may allow owners 
and operators more than 3 hours to alleviate a specific condition that 
causes an alarm if the owner or operator identifies in the monitoring 
plan this specific condition as one that could lead to an alarm, 
adequately explains why it is not feasible to alleviate this condition 
within 3 hours of the time the alarm occurs, and demonstrates that the 
requested time will ensure alleviation of this condition as 
expeditiously as practicable.
    (iii) For each bag leak detection system, you must initiate 
procedures to determine the cause of every alarm within 1 hour of the 
alarm. Except as provided in paragraph (o)(4)(ii)(F) of this section, 
you must alleviate the cause of the alarm within 3 hours of the alarm by 
taking whatever corrective action(s) are necessary. Corrective actions 
may include, but are not limited to the following:
    (A) Inspecting the fabric filter for air leaks, torn or broken bags 
or filter media, or any other condition that may cause an increase in 
particulate emissions;
    (B) Sealing off defective bags or filter media;

[[Page 146]]

    (C) Replacing defective bags or filter media or otherwise repairing 
the control device;
    (D) Sealing off a defective fabric filter compartment;
    (E) Cleaning the bag leak detection system probe or otherwise 
repairing the bag leak detection system; or
    (F) Shutting down the process producing the particulate emissions.
    (iv) You must maintain records of the information specified in 
paragraphs (o)(4)(iv)(A) through (C) of this section for each bag leak 
detection system.
    (A) Records of the bag leak detection system output;
    (B) Records of bag leak detection system adjustments, including the 
date and time of the adjustment, the initial bag leak detection system 
settings, and the final bag leak detection system settings; and
    (C) The date and time of all bag leak detection system alarms, the 
time that procedures to determine the cause of the alarm were initiated, 
if procedures were initiated within 1 hour of the alarm, the cause of 
the alarm, an explanation of the actions taken, the date and time the 
cause of the alarm was alleviated, and if the alarm was alleviated 
within 3 hours of the alarm.
    (v) If after any period of composed of 30 boiler operating days 
during which the alarm rate exceeds 5 percent of the process operating 
time (excluding control device or process startup, shutdown, and 
malfunction), then you must conduct a new PM performance test according 
to paragraph (o)(1) of this section. This new performance test must be 
conducted within 60 days of the date that the alarm rate was first 
determined to exceed 5 percent limit unless a wavier is granted by the 
appropriate delegated permitting authority.
    (5) An owner or operator of a modified affected source electing to 
meet the emission limitations in Sec. .42Da(d) shall determine the 
percent reduction in PM by using the emission rate for PM determined by 
the performance test conducted according to the requirements in 
paragraph (o)(1) of this section and the ash content on a mass basis of 
the fuel burned during each performance test run as determined by 
analysis of the fuel as fired.
    (p) As an alternative to meeting the compliance provisions specified 
in paragraph (o) of this section, an owner or operator may elect to 
install, certify, maintain, and operate a CEMS measuring PM emissions 
discharged from the affected facility to the atmosphere and record the 
output of the system as specified in paragraphs (p)(1) through (p)(8) of 
this section.
    (1) The owner or operator shall submit a written notification to the 
Administrator of intent to demonstrate compliance with this subpart by 
using a CEMS measuring PM. This notification shall be sent at least 30 
calendar days before the initial startup of the monitor for compliance 
determination purposes. The owner or operator may discontinue operation 
of the monitor and instead return to demonstration of compliance with 
this subpart according to the requirements in paragraph (o) of this 
section by submitting written notification to the Administrator of such 
intent at least 30 calendar days before shutdown of the monitor for 
compliance determination purposes.
    (2) Each CEMS shall be installed, certified, operated, and 
maintained according to the requirements in Sec. 60.49Da(v).
    (3) The initial performance evaluation shall be completed no later 
than 180 days after the date of initial startup of the affected 
facility, as specified under Sec. 60.8 of subpart A of this part or 
within 180 days of the date of notification to the Administrator 
required under paragraph (p)(1) of this section, whichever is later.
    (4) Compliance with the applicable emissions limit shall be 
determined based on the 24-hour daily (block) average of the hourly 
arithmetic average emissions concentrations using the continuous 
monitoring system outlet data. The 24-hour block arithmetic average 
emission concentration shall be calculated using EPA Reference Method 19 
of appendix A of this part, section 4.1.
    (5) At a minimum, valid CEMS hourly averages shall be obtained for 
75 percent of all operating hours on a 30-day rolling average basis. 
Beginning on January 1, 2012, valid CEMS hourly

[[Page 147]]

averages shall be obtained for 90 percent of all operating hours on a 
30-day rolling average basis.
    (i) At least two data points per hour shall be used to calculate 
each 1-hour arithmetic average.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (6) The 1-hour arithmetic averages required shall be expressed in 
ng/J, MMBtu/hr, or lb/MWh and shall be used to calculate the boiler 
operating day daily arithmetic average emission concentrations. The 1-
hour arithmetic averages shall be calculated using the data points 
required under Sec. 60.13(e)(2) of subpart A of this part.
    (7) All valid CEMS data shall be used in calculating average 
emission concentrations even if the minimum CEMS data requirements of 
paragraph (j)(5) of this section are not met.
    (8) When PM emissions data are not obtained because of CEMS 
breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments, 
emissions data shall be obtained by using other monitoring systems as 
approved by the Administrator or EPA Reference Method 19 of appendix A 
of this part to provide, as necessary, valid emissions data for a 
minimum of 90 percent (only 75 percent is required prior to January 1, 
2012) of all operating hours per 30-day rolling average.

Sec. 60.49Da  Emission monitoring.

    (a) Except as provided for in paragraphs (t) and (u) of this 
section, the owner or operator of an affected facility, shall install, 
calibrate, maintain, and operate a CEMS, and record the output of the 
system, for measuring the opacity of emissions discharged to the 
atmosphere. If opacity interference due to water droplets exists in the 
stack (for example, from the use of an FGD system), the opacity is 
monitored upstream of the interference (at the inlet to the FGD system). 
If opacity interference is experienced at all locations (both at the 
inlet and outlet of the SO<INF>2 control system), alternate 
parameters indicative of the PM control system's performance and/or good 
combustion are monitored (subject to the approval of the Administrator).
    (b) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall install, 
calibrate, maintain, and operate a CEMS, and record the output of the 
system, for measuring SO<INF>2 emissions, except where natural gas 
is the only fuel combusted, as follows:
    (1) Sulfur dioxide emissions are monitored at both the inlet and 
outlet of the SO<INF>2 control device.
    (2) For a facility that qualifies under the numerical limit 
provisions of Sec. 60.43Da(d), (i), (j), or (k) SO<INF>2 
emissions are only monitored as discharged to the atmosphere.
    (3) An ``as fired'' fuel monitoring system (upstream of coal 
pulverizers) meeting the requirements of Method 19 of appendix A of this 
part may be used to determine potential SO<INF>2 emissions in 
place of a continuous SO<INF>2 emission monitor at the inlet to 
the SO<INF>2 control device as required under paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section.
    (4) If the owner or operator has installed and certified a 
SO<INF>2 continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) according 
to the requirements of Sec. 75.20(c)(1) of this chapter and appendix A

CO<INF>2 (or O<INF>2) relative accuracy specifications in 
Figure 2 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, the relative accuracy 
(RA) standard in section 13.2 of Performance Specification 2 in appendix 
B to this part is met when the RA is calculated on a lb/MMBtu basis; and
    (iii) The reporting requirements of Sec. 60.51Da are met. The 
SO<INF>2 and CO<INF>2 (or O<INF>2) data reported to 
meet the requirements of Sec. 60.51Da shall not include substitute data 
values derived from the

[[Page 148]]

missing data procedures in subpart D of part 75 of this chapter, nor 
shall the SO<INF>2 data have been bias adjusted according to the 
procedures of part 75 of this chapter.
    (c)(1) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall install, 
calibrate, maintain, and operate a CEMS, and record the output of the 
system, for measuring NO<INF>X emissions discharged to the 
atmosphere; or
    (2) If the owner or operator has installed a NO<INF>X emission 
rate CEMS to meet the requirements of part 75 of this chapter and is 
continuing to meet the ongoing requirements of part 75 of this chapter, 
that CEMS may be used to meet the requirements of this section, except 
that the owner or operator shall also meet the requirements of Sec. 
60.51Da. Data reported to meet the requirements of Sec. 60.51Da shall 
not include data substituted using the missing data procedures in 
subpart D of part 75 of this chapter, nor shall the data have been bias 
adjusted according to the procedures of part 75 of this chapter.

lb/MMBtu. SO<INF>2 data used to meet the requirements of Sec. 
60.51Da shall not include substitute data values derived from the 
missing data procedures in subpart D of part 75 of this chapter, nor 
shall the data have been bias adjusted according to the procedures of 
part 75 of this chapter.
    (e) The CEMS under paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section are 
operated and data recorded during all periods of operation of the 
affected facility including periods of startup, shutdown, malfunction or 
emergency conditions, except for CEMS breakdowns, repairs, calibration 
checks, and zero and span adjustments.

expressed in ng/J (lb/MMBtu) heat input and used to calculate the 
average emission rates under Sec. 60.48Da. The 1-hour averages are 
calculated using the data points required under Sec. 60.13(h)(2).
    (h) When it becomes necessary to supplement CEMS data to meet the 
minimum data requirements in paragraph (f) of this section, the owner or 
operator shall use the reference methods and procedures as specified in 
this paragraph. Acceptable alternative methods and procedures are given 
in paragraph (j) of this section.
    (1) Method 6 of appendix A of this part shall be used to determine 
the SO<INF>2 concentration at the same location as the 
SO<INF>2 monitor. Samples shall be taken at 60-minute intervals. 
The sampling time and sample volume for each

CEMS to measure NO<INF>X emissions; a wattmeter to measure gross 
electrical output; meters to measure steam flow, temperature, and 
pressure; and a continuous flow monitoring system to measure the flow of 
exhaust gases discharged to the atmosphere.
    (p) The owner or operator of an affected facility demonstrating 
compliance with an Hg limit in Sec. 60.45Da shall install and operate a 
CEMS to measure and record the concentration of Hg in the exhaust gases 
from each stack according to the requirements in paragraphs (p)(1) 
through (p)(3) of this section. Alternatively, for an affected facility

chapter, the owner or operator may install, certify, maintain, operate 
and quality-assure the data from a Hg CEMS according to Sec. 75.10 of 
this chapter and appendices A and B to part 75 of this chapter, in lieu 
of following the procedures in paragraphs (p)(1) through (p)(3) of this 
section.
    (1) The owner or operator must install, operate, and maintain each

[[Page 151]]

CEMS according to Performance Specification 12A in appendix B to this 
part.
    (2) The owner or operator must conduct a performance evaluation of 
each CEMS according to the requirements of Sec. 60.13 and Performance 
Specification 12A in appendix B to this part.
    (3) The owner or operator must operate each CEMS according to the 
requirements in paragraphs (p)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section.
    (i) As specified in Sec. 60.13(e)(2), each CEMS must complete a 
minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data 
recording) for each successive 15-minute period.
    (ii) The owner or operator must reduce CEMS data as specified in 
Sec. 60.13(h).
    (iii) The owner or operator shall use all valid data points 
collected during the hour to calculate the hourly average Hg 
concentration.
    (iv) The owner or operator must record the results of each required 
certification and quality assurance test of the CEMS.
    (4) Mercury CEMS data collection must conform to paragraphs 
(p)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section.
    (i) For each calendar month in which the affected unit operates, 
valid hourly Hg concentration data, stack gas volumetric flow rate data, 
moisture data (if required), and electrical output data (i.e., valid 
data for all of these parameters) shall be obtained for at least 75 
percent of the unit operating hours in the month.
    (ii) Data reported to meet the requirements of this subpart shall 
not include hours of unit startup, shutdown, or malfunction. In 
addition, for an affected facility that is also subject to subpart I of 
part 75 of this chapter, data reported to meet the requirements of this 
subpart shall not include data substituted using the missing data 
procedures in subpart D of part 75 of this chapter, nor shall the data 
have been bias adjusted according to the procedures of part 75 of this 
chapter.
    (iii) If valid data are obtained for less than 75 percent of the 
unit operating hours in a month, you must discard the data collected in 
that month and replace the data with the mean of the individual monthly 
emission rate values determined in the last 12 months. In the 12-month 
rolling average calculation, this substitute Hg emission rate shall be 
weighted according to the number of unit operating hours in the month 
for which the data capture requirement of Sec. 60.49Da(p)(4)(i) was not 
met.
    (iv) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (p)(4)(iii) of 
this section, if valid data are obtained for less than 75 percent of the 
unit operating hours in another month in that same 12-month rolling 
average cycle, discard the data collected in that month and replace the 
data with the highest individual monthly emission rate determined in the 
last 12 months. In the 12-month rolling average calculation, this 
substitute Hg emission rate shall be weighted according to the number of 
unit operating hours in the month for which the data capture requirement 
of Sec. 60.49Da(p)(4)(i) was not met.
    (q) As an alternative to the CEMS required in paragraph (p) of this 
section, the owner or operator may use a sorbent trap monitoring system 
(as defined in Sec. 72.2 of this chapter) to monitor Hg concentration, 
according to the procedures described in Sec. 75.15 of this chapter and 
appendix K to part 75 of this chapter.
    (r) For Hg CEMS that measure Hg concentration on a dry basis or for 
sorbent trap monitoring systems, the emissions data must be corrected 
for the stack gas moisture content. A certified continuous moisture 
monitoring system that meets the requirements of Sec. 75.11(b) of this 
chapter is acceptable for this purpose. Alternatively, the appropriate 
default moisture value, as specified in Sec. 75.11(b) or Sec. 75.12(b) 
of this chapter, may be used.
    (s) The owner or operator shall prepare and submit to the 
Administrator for approval a unit-specific monitoring plan for each 
monitoring system, at least 45 days before commencing certification 
testing of the monitoring systems. The owner or operator shall comply 
with the requirements in your plan. The plan must address the 
requirements in paragraphs (s)(1) through (6) of this section.
    (1) Installation of the CEMS sampling probe or other interface at a 
measurement location relative to each

[[Page 152]]

affected process unit such that the measurement is representative of the 
exhaust emissions (e.g., on or downstream of the last control device);
    (2) Performance and equipment specifications for the sample 
interface, the pollutant concentration or parametric signal analyzer, 
and the data collection and reduction systems;
    (3) Performance evaluation procedures and acceptance criteria (e.g.,

    (t) The owner or operator of an affected facility demonstrating 
compliance with the output-based emissions limitation under Sec. 
60.42Da(c)(1) shall install, certify, operate, and maintain a CEMS for 
measuring PM emissions according to the requirements of paragraph (v) of 
this section. An owner or operator of an affected source demonstrating 
compliance with the input-based emission limitation under Sec. 
60.42Da(c)(2) may install, certify, operate, and maintain a CEMS for 
measuring PM emissions according to the requirements of paragraph (v) of 
this section.
    (u) An owner or operator of an affected source that meets the 
conditions in either paragraph (u)(1), (2) or (3) of this section is 
exempted from the continuous opacity monitoring system requirements in 
paragraph (a) of this section and the monitoring requirements in Sec. 
60.48Da(o).
    (1) A CEMS for measuring PM emissions is used to demonstrate 
continuous compliance on a boiler operating day average with the 
emissions limitations under Sec. 60.42Da(a)(1) or Sec. 60.42Da(c)(2) 
and is installed, certified, operated, and maintained on the affected 
source according to the requirements of paragraph (v) of this section; 
or
    (2) The affected source burns only gaseous fuels and does not use a 
post-combustion technology to reduce emissions of SO<INF>2 or PM;

oils that contain less than or equal to 0.30 weight percent sulfur, and 
is operated such that emissions of CO to the atmosphere from the 
affected source are maintained at levels less than or equal to 1.4 lb/
MWh on a boiler operating day average basis. Owners and operators of 
affected sources electing to comply with this paragraph must demonstrate 
compliance according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (u)(3)(i) 
through (iv) of this section.
    (i) You must monitor CO emissions using a CEMS according to the

    (ii) You must calculate the 1-hour average CO emissions levels for 
each boiler operating day by multiplying the average hourly CO output 
concentration measured by the CO CEMS times the corresponding average 
hourly flue gas flow rate and divided by the corresponding average 
hourly useful energy output from the affected source. The 24-hour 
average CO emission level

[[Page 153]]

is determined by calculating the arithmetic average of the hourly CO 
emission levels computed for each boiler operating day.
    (iii) You must evaluate the preceding 24-hour average CO emission 
level each boiler operating day excluding periods of affected source 
startup, shutdown, or malfunction. If the 24-hour average CO emission 
level is greater than 1.4 lb/MWh, you must initiate investigation of the 
relevant equipment and control systems within 24 hours of the first 
discovery of the high emission incident and, take the appropriate 
corrective action as soon as practicable to adjust control settings or 
repair equipment to reduce the 24-hour average CO emission level to 1.4 
lb/MWh or less.
    (iv) You must record the CO measurements and calculations performed 
according to paragraph (u)(3) of this section and any corrective actions 
taken. The record of corrective action taken must include the date and

Performance Specification 11 in appendix B of this part, PM and 
O<INF>2 (or CO<INF>2) data shall be collected concurrently 
(or within a 30-to 60-minute period) by both the CEMS and conducting 
performance tests using the following test methods.
    (i) For PM, EPA Reference Method 5, 5B, or 17 of appendix A of this 
part shall be used.
    (ii) For O<INF>2 (or CO<INF>2), EPA Reference Method 3, 
3A, or 3B of appendix A of this part, as applicable shall be used.
    (3) Quarterly accuracy determinations and daily calibration drift 
tests shall be performed in accordance with procedure 2 in appendix F of 
this part. Relative Response Audit's must be performed annually and 
Response Correlation Audits must be performed every 3 years.
    (w)(1) Except as provided for under paragraphs (w)(2), (w)(3), and 
(w)(4) of this section, the SO<INF>2, NO<INF>X, 
CO<INF>2, and O<INF>2 CEMS required under paragraphs (b) 
through (d) of this section shall be installed, certified, and operated 
in accordance with the applicable procedures in Performance 
Specification 2 or 3 in appendix B to this part or according to the 
procedures in appendices A and B to part 75 of this chapter. Daily 
calibration drift assessments and quarterly accuracy determinations 
shall be done in accordance with Procedure 1 in appendix F to this part, 
and a data assessment report (DAR), prepared according to section 7 of

implement the following alternative data accuracy assessment procedures. 
For all required CO<INF>2 and O<INF>2 CEMS and for 
SO<INF>2 and NO<INF>X CEMS with span values greater than 100 
ppm, the daily calibration error test and calibration adjustment 
procedures described in sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.3 of appendix B to part 
75 of this chapter may be followed instead of the CD assessment 
procedures in Procedure 1, section 4.1 of appendix F of this part. If 
this option is selected, the data validation and out-of-control 
provisions in sections 2.1.4 and 2.1.5 of appendix B to part 75 of this 
chapter shall be followed instead of the excessive CD and out-of-control 
criteria in Procedure 1, section 4.3 of appendix F to this part. For the 
purposes of data validation under this subpart, the excessive CD and 
out-of-control criteria in Procedure 1, section 4.3 of appendix F to 
this part shall apply to SO<INF>2 and NO<INF>X span values 
less than 100 ppm;

appendix F to this part. If this option is selected: The frequency of 
the linearity checks shall be as specified in section 2.2.1 of appendix 
B to part 75 of this chapter; the applicable linearity specifications in 
section 3.2 of appendix A to part 75 of this chapter shall be met; the 
data validation and out-of-control criteria in section 2.2.3 of appendix 
B to part 75 of this chapter shall be followed instead of the excessive 
audit inaccuracy and out-of-control criteria in Procedure 1, section 5.2 
of appendix F to this part; and the grace period provisions in section 
2.2.4 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter shall apply. For the 
purposes of data validation under this subpart, the cylinder gas audits 
described in Procedure 1, section 5.1.2 of appendix F to this part shall 
be performed for SO<INF>2 and NO<INF>X span values less than 
or equal to 30 ppm;
    (4) As an alternative to meeting the requirements of paragraph 
(w)(1) of this section, an owner or operator may elect to may elect to 
implement the following alternative data accuracy assessment procedures. 
For SO<INF>2, CO<INF>2, and O<INF>2 CEMS and for 
NO<INF>X CEMS, RATAs may be performed in accordance with section 
2.3 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter instead of following the 
procedures described in Procedure 1, section 5.1.1 of appendix F to this 
part. If this option is selected: The frequency of each RATA shall be as 
specified in section 2.3.1 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter; the 
applicable relative accuracy specifications shown in Figure 2 in 
appendix B to part 75 of this chapter shall be met; the data validation

this chapter shall be followed instead of the excessive audit inaccuracy 
and out-of-control criteria in Procedure 1, section 5.2 of appendix F to 
this part; and the grace period provisions in section 2.3.3 of appendix 
B to part 75 of this chapter shall apply. For the purposes of data 
validation under this subpart, the relative accuracy specification in 
section 13.2 of Performance Specification 2 in appendix B to this part 
shall be met on a lb/MMBtu basis for SO<INF>2 (regardless of the 
SO<INF>2 emission level during the RATA), and for NO<INF>X 
when the average NO<INF>X emission rate measured by the reference 
method during the RATA is less than 0.100 lb/MMBtu;
    (5) If the owner or operator elects to implement the alternative 
data assessment procedures described in paragraphs (w)(2) through (w)(4) 
of this section, each data assessment report shall include a summary of 
the results of all of the RATAs, linearity checks, CGAs, and calibration 
error or drift assessments required by paragraphs (w)(2) through (w)(4) 
of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 60.50Da  Compliance determination procedures and methods.

    (a) In conducting the performance tests required in Sec. 60.8, the 
owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the 
methods in appendix A of this part or the methods and procedures as 
specified in this section, except as provided in Sec. 60.8(b). Section 
60.8(f) does not apply to this section for SO<INF>2 and 
NO<INF>X. Acceptable alternative methods are given in paragraph 
(e) of this section.
    (b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the PM 
standards in Sec. 60.42Da as follows:
    (1) The dry basis F factor (O<INF>2) procedures in Method 19 
of appendix A of this part shall be used to compute the emission rate of 
PM.
    (2) For the particular matter concentration, Method 5 of appendix A 
of this part shall be used at affected facilities without wet FGD 
systems and Method 5B of appendix A of this part shall be used after wet 
FGD systems.
    (i) The sampling time and sample volume for each run shall be at 
least 120 minutes and 1.70 dscm (60 dscf). The probe and filter holder 
heating system in the sampling train may be set to provide an average 
gas temperature of no greater than 160<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>14 [deg]C 
(320<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>25 [deg]F).

[[Page 155]]

    (ii) For each particulate run, the emission rate correction factor, 
integrated or grab sampling and analysis procedures of Method 3B of 
appendix A of this part shall be used to determine the O<INF>2 
concentration. The O<INF>2 sample shall be obtained simultaneously 
with, and at the same traverse points as, the particulate run. If the 
particulate run has more than 12 traverse points, the O<INF>2 
traverse points may be reduced to 12 provided that Method 1 of appendix 
A of this part is used to locate the 12 O<INF>2 traverse points. 
If the grab sampling procedure is used, the O<INF>2 concentration 
for the run shall be the arithmetic mean of the sample O<INF>2 
concentrations at all traverse points.
    (3) Method 9 of appendix A of this part and the procedures in Sec. 
60.11 shall be used to determine opacity.
    (c) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
SO<INF>2 standards in Sec. 60.43Da as follows:
    (1) The percent of potential SO<INF>2 emissions (%Ps) to the 
atmosphere shall be computed using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13JN07.015

Where:

%Ps = Percent of potential SO<INF>2 emissions, percent;
%Rf = Percent reduction from fuel pretreatment, percent; and
%Rg = Percent reduction by SO<INF>2 control system, percent.

    (2) The procedures in Method 19 of appendix A of this part may be 
used to determine percent reduction (%R<INF>f) of sulfur by such 
processes as fuel pretreatment (physical coal cleaning, 
hydrodesulfurization of fuel oil, etc.), coal pulverizers, and bottom 
and fly ash interactions. This determination is optional.
    (3) The procedures in Method 19 of appendix A of this part shall be 
used to determine the percent SO<INF>2 reduction (%R<INF>g) 
of any SO<INF>2 control system. Alternatively, a combination of an 
``as fired'' fuel monitor and emission rates measured after the control 
system, following the procedures in Method 19 of appendix A of this 
part, may be used if the percent reduction is calculated using the 
average emission rate from the SO<INF>2 control device and the 
average SO<INF>2 input rate from the ``as fired'' fuel analysis 
for 30 successive boiler operating days.
    (4) The appropriate procedures in Method 19 of appendix A of this 
part shall be used to determine the emission rate.
    (5) The CEMS in Sec. 60.49Da(b) and (d) shall be used to determine 
the concentrations of SO<INF>2 and CO<INF>2 or 
O<INF>2.
    (d) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
NO<INF>X standard in Sec. 60.44Da as follows:
    (1) The appropriate procedures in Method 19 of appendix A of this 
part shall be used to determine the emission rate of NO<INF>X.
    (2) The continuous monitoring system in Sec. 60.49Da(c) and (d) 
shall be used to determine the concentrations of NO<INF>X and 
CO<INF>2 or O<INF>2.
    (e) The owner or operator may use the following as alternatives to 
the reference methods and procedures specified in this section:
    (1) For Method 5 or 5B of appendix A of this part, Method 17 of 
appendix A of this part may be used at facilities with or without wet 
FGD systems if the stack temperature at the sampling location does not 
exceed an average temperature of 160 [deg]C (320 [deg]F). The procedures 
of Sec. Sec. 2.1 and 2.3 of Method 5B of appendix A of this part may be 
used in Method 17 of appendix A of this part only if it is used after 
wet FGD systems. Method 17 of appendix A of this part shall not be used 
after wet FGD systems if the effluent is saturated or laden with water 
droplets.
    (2) The F<INF>c factor (CO<INF>2) procedures in Method 
19 of appendix A of this part may be used to compute the emission rate 
of PM under the stipulations of Sec. 60.46(d)(1). The CO<INF>2 
shall be determined in the same manner as the O<INF>2 
concentration.
    (f) Electric utility combined cycle gas turbines are performance 
tested for PM, SO<INF>2, and NO<INF>X using the procedures 
of Method 19 of appendix A of this part. The SO<INF>2 and 
NO<INF>X emission rates from the gas turbine used in Method 19 of 
appendix A of this part calculations are determined when the gas turbine 
is performance tested under subpart GG of this part. The potential 
uncontrolled PM emission rate from a gas turbine is

defined as 17 ng/J (0.04 lb/MMBtu) heat input.
    (g) For the purposes of determining compliance with the emission 
limits in Sec. 60.45Da, the owner or operator of an electric utility 
steam generating unit which is also a cogeneration unit shall use the 
procedures in paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section to calculate 
emission rates based on electrical output to the grid plus 75 percent of 
the equivalent electrical energy (measured relative to ISO conditions) 
in the unit's process stream.
    (1) All conversions from Btu/hr unit input to MW unit output must 
use equivalents found in 40 CFR 60.40(a)(1) for electric utilities 
(i.e., 250 MMBtu/hr input to an electric utility steam generating unit 
is equivalent to 73 MW input to the electric utility steam generating 
unit); 73 MW input to the electric utility steam generating unit is 
equivalent to 25 MW output from the boiler electric utility steam 
generating unit; therefore, 250 MMBtu input to the electric utility 
steam generating unit is equivalent to 25 MW output from the electric 
utility steam generating unit).
    (2) Use the Equation 5 in this section to determine the cogeneration 
Hg emission rate over a specific compliance period.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13JN07.016

Where:

ER<INF>cogen = Cogeneration Hg emission rate over a compliance 
          period in lb/MWh;
E = Mass of Hg emitted from the stack over the same compliance period 
          (lb);
V<INF>grid = Amount of energy sent to the grid over the same 
          compliance period (MWh); and
V<INF>process = Amount of energy converted to steam for process 
          use over the same compliance period (MWh).

    (h) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the Hg 
limit in Sec. 60.45Da according to the procedures in paragraphs (h)(1) 
through (3) of this section.
    (1) The initial performance test shall be commenced by the 
applicable date specified in Sec. 60.8(a). The required CEMS must be 
certified prior to commencing the test. The performance test consists of 
collecting hourly Hg emission data (lb/MWh) with the CEMS for 12 
successive months of unit operation (excluding hours of unit startup, 
shutdown and malfunction). The average Hg emission rate is calculated 
for each month, and then the weighted, 12-month average Hg emission rate 
is calculated according to paragraph (h)(2) or (h)(3) of this section, 
as applicable. If, for any month in the initial performance test, the 
minimum data capture requirement in Sec. 60.49Da(p)(4)(i) is not met, 
the owner or operator shall report a substitute Hg emission rate for 
that month, as follows. For the first such month, the substitute monthly 
Hg emission rate shall be the arithmetic average of all valid hourly Hg 
emission rates recorded to date. For any subsequent month(s) with 
insufficient data capture, the substitute monthly Hg emission rate shall 
be the highest valid hourly Hg emission rate recorded to date. When the 
12-month average Hg emission rate for the initial performance test is 
calculated, for each month in which there was insufficient data capture, 
the substitute monthly Hg emission rate shall be weighted according to 
the number of unit operating hours in that month. Following the initial 
performance test, the owner or operator shall demonstrate compliance by 
calculating the weighted average of all monthly Hg emission rates (in 
lb/MWh) for each 12 successive calendar months, excluding data obtained 
during startup, shutdown, or malfunction.
    (2) If a CEMS is used to demonstrate compliance, follow the 
procedures in paragraphs (h)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section to 
determine the 12-month rolling average.
    (i) Calculate the total mass of Hg emissions over a month (M), in 
lb,

[[Page 157]]

using either Equation 6 in paragraph (h)(2)(i)(A) of this section or 
Equation 7 in paragraph (h)(2)(i)(B) of this section, in conjunction 
with Equation 8 in paragraph (h)(2)(i)(C) of this section.
    (A) If the Hg CEMS measures Hg concentration on a wet basis, use 
Equation 6 below to calculate the Hg mass emissions for each valid hour:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13JN07.017

Where:

E<INF>h = Hg mass emissions for the hour, (lb);
K = Units conversion constant, 6.24 x 10<SUP>-</SUP>\11\ lb-scm/
          [micro]gm-scf;
C<INF>h = Hourly H<INF>g concentration, wet basis, 
          ([micro]gm/scm);
Q<INF>h = Hourly stack gas volumetric flow rate, (scfh); and
t<INF>h = Unit operating time, i.e., the fraction of the hour for 
          which the unit operated. For example, th = 0.50 for a half-
          hour of unit operation and 1.00 for a full hour of operation.

    (B) If the Hg CEMS measures Hg concentration on a dry basis, use 
Equation 7 below to calculate the Hg mass emissions for each valid hour:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13JN07.018

Where:

E<INF>h = Hg mass emissions for the hour, (lb);
K = Units conversion constant, 6.24 x 10<SUP>-11</SUP> lb-scm/[micro]gm-
          scf;
C<INF>h = Hourly Hg concentration, dry basis, ([micro]gm/dscm);
Q<INF>h = Hourly stack gas volumetric flow rate, (scfh);
t<INF>h = Unit operating time, i.e., the fraction of the hour for 
          which the unit operated; and
B<INF>ws = Stack gas moisture content, expressed as a decimal 
          fraction (e.g., for 8 percent H<INF>2O, B<INF>ws = 
          0.08).

    (C) Use Equation 8, below, to calculate M, the total mass of Hg 
emitted for the month, by summing the hourly masses derived from 
Equation 6 or 7 (as applicable):
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13JN07.019

Where:

M = Total Hg mass emissions for the month, (lb);
E<INF>h = Hg mass emissions for hour ``h'', from Equation 6 or 7 
of this section, (lb); and
n = Number of unit operating hours in the month with valid CE and 
electrical output data, excluding hours of unit startup, shutdown and 
malfunction.

    (ii) Calculate the monthly Hg emission rate on an output basis (lb/
MWh) using Equation 9, below. For a cogeneration unit, use Equation 5 in 
paragraph (g) of this section instead.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13JN07.020

Where:

ER = Monthly Hg emission rate, (lb/MWh);
M = Total mass of Hg emissions for the month, from Equation 8, above, 
(lb); and
P = Total electrical output for the month, for the hours used to 
calculate M, (MWh).

    (iii) Until 12 monthly Hg emission rates have been accumulated, 
calculate and report only the monthly averages. Then, for each 
subsequent calendar month, use Equation 10 below to calculate the 12-
month rolling average as a weighted average of the Hg emission rate for 
the current month and the Hg emission rates for the previous 11 months, 
with one exception. Calendar months in which the unit does not operate 
(zero unit operating hours) shall not be included in the 12-month 
rolling average.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13JN07.021

Where:

E<INF>avg = Weighted 12-month rolling average Hg emission rate, 
(lb/MWh);
ER<INF>i = Monthly Hg emission rate, for month ``i'', (lb/MWh); 
and
n = Number of unit operating hours in month ``i'' with valid CEM and 
electrical output data, excluding hours of unit startup, shutdown, and 
malfunction.

    (3) If a sorbent trap monitoring system is used in lieu of a Hg 
CEMS, as described in Sec. 75.15 of this chapter and in appendix K to 
part 75 of this chapter, calculate the monthly Hg emission rates using 
Equations 7 through 9 of this section, except that for a particular pair 
of sorbent traps, C<INF>h in Equation 7 shall be the flow-
proportional average Hg concentration measured over the data collection 
period.

[[Page 158]]

    (i) Daily calibration drift (CD) tests and quarterly accuracy 
determinations shall be performed for Hg CEMS in accordance with 
Procedure 1 of appendix F to this part. For the CD assessments, you may 
use either elemental mercury or mercuric chloride (Hg[deg] 
HgCl<INF>2) standards. The four quarterly accuracy determinations 
shall consist of one RATA and three measurement error (ME) tests using 
HgCl<INF>2 standards, as described in section 8.3 of Performance 
Specification 12-A in appendix B to this part (note: Hg[deg] standards 
may be used if the Hg monitor does not have a converter). Alternatively, 
the owner or operator may implement the applicable daily, weekly, 
quarterly, and annual quality assurance (QA) requirements for Hg CEMS in 
appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, in lieu of the QA procedures in 
appendices B and F to this part. Annual RATA of sorbent trap monitoring 
systems shall be performed in accordance with appendices A and B to part 
75 of this chapter, and all other quality assurance requirements 
specified in appendix K to part 75 of this chapter shall be met for 
sorbent trap monitoring systems.

    (b) Except as provided under paragraphs (k) and (l) of this section, 
on and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed 
or is required to be completed under Sec. 60.8, whichever date comes 
first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that simultaneously 
combusts mixtures of coal, oil, or natural gas shall cause to be 
discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any gases 
that contain NO<INF>X in excess of a limit determined by the use 
of the following formula:

no owner or operator of an affected facility that simultaneously 
combusts coal or oil, or a mixture of these fuels with natural gas, and 
wood, municipal-type solid waste, or any other fuel shall cause to be 
discharged into the atmosphere any gases that contain NO<INF>X in 
excess of the emission limit for the coal or oil, or mixtures of these 
fuels with natural gas combusted in the affected facility, as determined 
pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, unless the affected 
facility has an annual capacity factor for coal or oil, or mixture of 
these fuels with natural gas of 10 percent (0.10) or less and is subject 
to a federally enforceable requirement that limits operation of the 
affected facility to an annual capacity factor of 10 percent (0.10) or 
less for coal, oil, or a mixture of these fuels with natural gas.
    (d) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is 
completed or is required to be completed under Sec. 60.8, whichever 
date comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that 
simultaneously combusts natural gas with wood, municipal-type solid 
waste, or other solid fuel, except coal, shall cause to be discharged

          combustion of coal, ng/J (lb/MMBtu); and
H<INF>c = Heat input from combustion of coal, J (MMBtu).

    (f) Any owner or operator of an affected facility that combusts 
byproduct/waste with either natural gas or oil may petition the 
Administrator within 180 days of the initial startup of the affected 
facility to establish a NO<INF>X emission limit that shall apply 
specifically to that affected facility when the byproduct/waste is 
combusted. The petition shall include sufficient and appropriate data, 
as determined by the Administrator, such as NO<INF>X emissions 
from the affected facility, waste composition (including nitrogen 
content), and combustion conditions to allow the Administrator to 
confirm that the affected facility is unable to comply with the emission 
limits in paragraph (e) of this section and to determine the appropriate 
emission limit for the affected facility.
    (1) Any owner or operator of an affected facility petitioning for a 
facility-specific NO<INF>X emission limit under this section 
shall:
    (i) Demonstrate compliance with the emission limits for natural gas 
and distillate oil in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or for residual 
oil in paragraph (a)(2) or (l)(1) of this section, as appropriate, by 
conducting a 30-day performance test as provided in Sec. 60.46b(e). 
During the performance test only natural gas, distillate oil, or 
residual oil shall be combusted in the affected facility; and
    (ii) Demonstrate that the affected facility is unable to comply with 
the emission limits for natural gas and distillate oil in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section or for residual oil in paragraph (a)(2) or (l)(1) 
of this section, as appropriate, when gaseous or liquid byproduct/waste 
is combusted in the affected facility under the same conditions and 
using the same technological system of emission reduction applied when 
demonstrating compliance under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section.
    (2) The NO<INF>X emission limits for natural gas or distillate 
oil in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or for residual oil in paragraph 
(a)(2) or (l)(1) of this section, as appropriate, shall be applicable to 
the affected facility until and unless the petition is approved by the 
Administrator. If the petition is approved by the Administrator, a 
facility-specific NO<INF>X emission limit will be established at 
the NO<INF>X emission level achievable when the affected facility 
is combusting oil or natural gas and byproduct/waste in a manner that 
the Administrator determines to be consistent with minimizing 
NO<INF>X emissions. In lieu of amending this subpart, a letter 
will be sent to the facility describing the facility-specific 
NO<INF>X limit. The facility shall use the compliance procedures 
detailed in the letter and make the letter

[[Page 171]]

available to the public. If the Administrator determines it is 
appropriate, the conditions and requirements of the letter can be 
reviewed and changed at any point.
    (g) Any owner or operator of an affected facility that combusts 
hazardous waste (as defined by 40 CFR part 261 or 40 CFR part 761) with 
natural gas or oil may petition the Administrator within 180 days of the 
initial startup of the affected facility for a waiver from compliance 
with the NO<INF>X emission limit that applies specifically to that 
affected facility. The petition must include sufficient and appropriate 
data, as determined by the Administrator, on NO<INF>X emissions 
from the affected facility, waste destruction efficiencies, waste 
composition (including nitrogen content), the quantity of specific 
wastes to be combusted and combustion conditions to allow the 
Administrator to determine if the affected facility is able to comply 
with the NO<INF>X emission limits required by this section. The 
owner or operator of the affected facility shall demonstrate that when 
hazardous waste is combusted in the affected facility, thermal 
destruction efficiency requirements for hazardous waste specified in an 
applicable federally enforceable requirement preclude compliance with 
the NO<INF>X emission limits of this section. The NO<INF>X 
emission limits for natural gas or distillate oil in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section or for residual oil in paragraph (a)(2) or (l)(1) of this 
section, as appropriate, are applicable to the affected facility until 
and unless the petition is approved by the Administrator. (See 40 CFR 
761.70 for regulations applicable to the incineration of materials 
containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's).) In lieu of amending this 
subpart, a letter will be sent to the facility describing the facility-
specific NO<INF>X limit. The facility shall use the compliance 
procedures detailed in the letter and make the letter available to the 
public. If the Administrator determines it is appropriate, the 
conditions and requirements of the letter can be reviewed and changed at 
any point.
    (h) For purposes of paragraph (i) of this section, the 
NO<INF>X standards under this section apply at all times including 
periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction.
    (i) Except as provided under paragraph (j) of this section, 
compliance with the emission limits under this section is determined on 
a 30-day rolling average basis.
    (j) Compliance with the emission limits under this section is 
determined on a 24-hour average basis for the initial performance test 
and on a 3-hour average basis for subsequent performance tests for any 
affected facilities that:
    (1) Combust, alone or in combination, only natural gas, distillate 
oil, or residual oil with a nitrogen content of 0.30 weight percent or 
less;
    (2) Have a combined annual capacity factor of 10 percent or less for 
natural gas, distillate oil, and residual oil with a nitrogen content of 
0.30 weight percent or less; and
    (3) Are subject to a federally enforceable requirement limiting 
operation of the affected facility to the firing of natural gas, 
distillate oil, and/or residual oil with a nitrogen content of 0.30 
weight percent or less and limiting operation of the affected facility 
to a combined annual capacity factor of 10 percent or less for natural 
gas, distillate oil, and residual oil with a nitrogen content of 0.30 
weight percent or less.
    (k) Affected facilities that meet the criteria described in 
paragraphs (j)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, and that have a heat 
input capacity of 73 MW (250 MMBtu/hr) or less, are not subject to the 
NO<INF>X emission limits under this section.
    (l) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is 
completed or is required to be completed under Sec. 60.8, whichever 
date comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that 
commenced construction or reconstruction after July 9, 1997 shall cause 
to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any 
gases that contain NO<INF>X (expressed as NO<INF>2) in 
excess of the following limits:
    (1) If the affected facility combusts coal, oil, or natural gas, or 
a mixture of these fuels, or with any other fuels: A limit of 86 ng/J 
(0.20 lb/MMBtu) heat input unless the affected facility has an annual 
capacity factor for coal, oil, and natural gas of 10 percent (0.10) or

[[Page 172]]

less and is subject to a federally enforceable requirement that limits 
operation of the facility to an annual capacity factor of 10 percent 
(0.10) or less for coal, oil, and natural gas; or
    (2) If the affected facility has a low heat release rate and 
combusts natural gas or distillate oil in excess of 30 percent of the 
heat input on a 30-day rolling average from the combustion of all fuels, 
a limit determined by use of the following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13JN07.026

Where:

E<INF>n = NO<INF>X emission limit, (lb/MMBtu);
H<INF>go = 30-day heat input from combustion of natural gas or 
          distillate oil; and
H<INF>r = 30-day heat input from combustion of any other fuel.

    (3) After February 27, 2006, units where more than 10 percent of 
total annual output is electrical or mechanical may comply with an 
optional limit of 270 ng/J (2.1 lb/MWh) gross energy output, based on a 
30-day rolling average. Units complying with this output-based limit 
must demonstrate compliance according to the procedures of Sec. 
60.48Da(i) of subpart Da of this part, and must monitor emissions 
according to Sec. 60.49Da(c), (k), through (n) of subpart Da of this 
part.


<R05>
Sec. 60.45b  Compliance and performance test methods and procedures

for sulfur dioxide.

    (a) The SO<INF>2 emission standards under Sec. 60.42b apply 
at all times. Facilities burning coke oven gas alone or in combination 
with any other gaseous fuels or distillate oil and complying with the 
fuel based limit under Sec. 60.42b(d) or Sec. 60.42b(k)(2) are allowed 
to exceed the limit 30 operating days per calendar year for by-product 
plant maintenance.
    (b) In conducting the performance tests required under Sec. 60.8, 
the owner or operator shall use the methods and procedures in appendix A 
(including fuel certification and sampling) of this part or the methods 
and procedures as specified in this section, except as provided in Sec. 
60.8(b). Section 60.8(f) does not apply to this section. The 30-day 
notice required in Sec. 60.8(d) applies only to the initial performance 
test unless otherwise specified by the Administrator.
    (c) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall conduct 
performance tests to determine compliance with the percent of potential 
SO<INF>2 emission rate (% P<INF>s) and the SO<INF>2 
emission rate (E<INF>s) pursuant to Sec. 60.42b following the 
procedures listed below, except as provided under paragraph (d) and (k) 
of this section.
    (1) The initial performance test shall be conducted over 30 
consecutive operating days of the steam generating unit. Compliance with 
the SO<INF>2 standards shall be determined using a 30-day average. 
The first operating day included in the initial performance test shall 
be scheduled within 30 days after achieving the maximum production rate 
at which the affected facility will be operated, but not later than 180 
days after initial startup of the facility.
    (2) If only coal, only oil, or a mixture of coal and oil is 
combusted, the following procedures are used:
    (i) The procedures in Method 19 of appendix A of this part are used 
to determine the hourly SO<INF>2 emission rate (E<INF>ho) 
and the 30-day average emission rate (E<INF>ao). The hourly 
averages used to compute the 30-day averages are obtained from the 
continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) of Sec. 60.47b (a) or (b).
    (ii) The percent of potential SO<INF>2 emission rate 
(%P<INF>s) emitted to the atmosphere is computed using the 
following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13JN07.027

Where:

%P<INF>s = Potential SO<INF>2 emission rate, percent;
%R<INF>g = SO<INF>2 removal efficiency of the control device 
          as determined by Method 19 of appendix A of this part, in 
          percent; and
%R<INF>f = SO<INF>2 removal efficiency of fuel pretreatment 
          as determined by Method 19 of appendix A of this part, in 
          percent.

    (3) If coal or oil is combusted with other fuels, the same 
procedures required in paragraph (c)(2) of this section are used, except 
as provided in the following:
    (i) An adjusted hourly SO<INF>2 emission rate 
(E<INF>ho\o\) is used in Equation 19-19 of

[[Page 173]]

Method 19 of appendix A of this part to compute an adjusted 30-day 
average emission rate (E<INF>ao\o\). The Eho[deg] is computed 
using the following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13JN07.028

Where:

E<INF>ho\o\ = Adjusted hourly SO<INF>2 emission rate, ng/J 
          (lb/MMBtu);
E<INF>ho = Hourly SO<INF>2 emission rate, ng/J (lb/MMBtu);
E<INF>w = SO<INF>2 concentration in fuels other than coal 
          and oil combusted in the affected facility, as determined by 
          the fuel sampling and analysis procedures in Method 19 of 
          appendix A of this part, ng/J (lb/MMBtu). The value 
          E<INF>w for each fuel lot is used for each hourly 
          average during the time that the lot is being combusted; and
X<INF>k = Fraction of total heat input from fuel combustion 
          derived from coal, oil, or coal and oil, as determined by 
          applicable procedures in Method 19 of appendix A of this part.

    (ii) To compute the percent of potential SO<INF>2 emission 
rate (%P<INF>s), an adjusted %R<INF>g (%R<INF>g\o\) is 
computed from the adjusted E<INF>ao\o\ from paragraph (b)(3)(i) of 
this section and an adjusted average SO<INF>2 inlet rate 
(E<INF>ai\o\) using the following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13JN07.029

    To compute E<INF>ai\o\, an adjusted hourly SO<INF>2 
inlet rate (E<INF>hi\o\) is used. The E<INF>hi\o\ is 
computed using the following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13JN07.030

Where:

E<INF>hi\o\ = Adjusted hourly SO<INF>2 inlet rate, ng/J (lb/
          MMBtu); and
E<INF>hi = Hourly SO<INF>2 inlet rate, ng/J (lb/MMBtu).

    (4) The owner or operator of an affected facility subject to 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section does not have to measure parameters 
E<INF>w or X<INF>k if the owner or operator elects to assume 
that X<INF>k = 1.0. Owners or operators of affected facilities who 
assume X<INF>k = 1.0 shall:
    (i) Determine %P<INF>s following the procedures in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section; and
    (ii) Sulfur dioxide emissions (E<INF>s) are considered to be 
in compliance with SO<INF>2 emission limits under Sec. 60.42b.
    (5) The owner or operator of an affected facility that qualifies 
under the provisions of Sec. 60.42b(d) does not have to measure 
parameters E<INF>w or X<INF>k under paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section if the owner or operator of the affected facility elects to 
measure SO<INF>2 emission rates of the coal or oil following the 
fuel sampling and analysis procedures under Method 19 of appendix A of 
this part.
    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (j) of this section, the owner 
or operator of an affected facility that combusts only very low sulfur 
oil, has an annual capacity factor for oil of 10 percent (0.10) or less, 
and is subject to a federally enforceable requirement limiting operation 
of the affected facility to an annual capacity factor for oil of 10 
percent (0.10) or less shall:
    (1) Conduct the initial performance test over 24 consecutive steam 
generating unit operating hours at full load;
    (2) Determine compliance with the standards after the initial 
performance test based on the arithmetic average of the hourly emissions 
data during each steam generating unit operating day if a CEMS is used, 
or based on a daily average if Method 6B of appendix A of this part or 
fuel sampling and analysis procedures under Method 19 of appendix A of 
this part are used.
    (e) The owner or operator of an affected facility subject to Sec. 
60.42b(d)(1) shall demonstrate the maximum design capacity of the steam 
generating unit by operating the facility at maximum capacity for 24 
hours. This demonstration will be made during the initial performance 
test and a subsequent demonstration may be requested at any other time. 
If the 24-hour average firing rate for the affected facility is less 
than the maximum design capacity provided by the manufacturer of the 
affected facility, the 24-hour average firing rate shall be used to 
determine the capacity utilization rate for the affected facility, 
otherwise the maximum design capacity provided by the manufacturer is 
used.
    (f) For the initial performance test required under Sec. 60.8, 
compliance with

[[Page 174]]

the SO<INF>2 emission limits and percent reduction requirements 
under Sec. 60.42b is based on the average emission rates and the 
average percent reduction for SO<INF>2 for the first 30 
consecutive steam generating unit operating days, except as provided 
under paragraph (d) of this section. The initial performance test is the 
only test for which at least 30 days prior notice is required unless 
otherwise specified by the Administrator. The initial performance test 
is to be scheduled so that the first steam generating unit operating day 
of the 30 successive steam generating unit operating days is completed 
within 30 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which the 
affected facility will be operated, but not later than 180 days after 
initial startup of the facility. The boiler load during the 30-day 
period does not have to be the maximum design load, but must be 
representative of future operating conditions and include at least one 
24-hour period at full load.
    (g) After the initial performance test required under Sec. 60.8, 
compliance with the SO<INF>2 emission limits and percent reduction 
requirements under Sec. 60.42b is based on the average emission rates 
and the average percent reduction for SO<INF>2 for 30 successive 
steam generating unit operating days, except as provided under paragraph 
(d). A separate performance test is completed at the end of each steam 
generating unit operating day after the initial performance test, and a 
new 30-day average emission rate and percent reduction for 
SO<INF>2 are calculated to show compliance with the standard.
    (h) Except as provided under paragraph (i) of this section, the 
owner or operator of an affected facility shall use all valid 
SO<INF>2 emissions data in calculating %P<INF>s and 
E<INF>ho under paragraph (c), of this section whether or not the 
minimum emissions data requirements under Sec. 60.46b are achieved. All 
valid emissions data, including valid SO<INF>2 emission data 
collected during periods of startup, shutdown and malfunction, shall be 
used in calculating %P<INF>s and E<INF>ho pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (i) During periods of malfunction or maintenance of the 
SO<INF>2 control systems when oil is combusted as provided under 
Sec. 60.42b(i), emission data are not used to calculate %P<INF>s 
or E<INF>s under Sec. 60.42b(a), (b) or (c), however, the 
emissions data are used to determine compliance with the emission limit 
under Sec. 60.42b(i).
    (j) The owner or operator of an affected facility that combusts very 
low sulfur oil is not subject to the compliance and performance testing 
requirements of this section if the owner or operator obtains fuel 
receipts as described in Sec. 60.49b(r).
    (k) The owner or operator of an affected facility seeking to 
demonstrate compliance under Sec. Sec. 60.42b(d)(4), 60.42b(j), and 
60.42b(k)(2) shall follow the applicable procedures under Sec. 
60.49b(r).


<R05>
Sec. 60.46b  Compliance and performance test methods and procedures

for particulate matter and nitrogen oxides.

    (a) The PM emission standards and opacity limits under Sec. 60.43b 
apply at all times except during periods of startup, shutdown, or 
malfunction. The NO<INF>X emission standards under Sec. 60.44b 
apply at all times.
    (b) Compliance with the PM emission standards under Sec. 60.43b 
shall be determined through performance testing as described in 
paragraph (d) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (i) of 
this section.
    (c) Compliance with the NO<INF>X emission standards under 
Sec. 60.44b shall be determined through performance testing under 
paragraph (e) or (f), or under paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section, 
as applicable.
    (d) To determine compliance with the PM emission limits and opacity 
limits under Sec. 60.43b, the owner or operator of an affected facility 
shall conduct an initial performance test as required under Sec. 60.8, 
and shall conduct subsequent performance tests as requested by the 
Administrator, using the following procedures and reference methods:
    (1) Method 3B of appendix A of this part is used for gas analysis 
when applying Method 5 or 17 of appendix A of this part.
    (2) Method 5, 5B, or 17 of appendix A of this part shall be used to 
measure the concentration of PM as follows:

[[Page 175]]

    (i) Method 5 of appendix A of this part shall be used at affected 
facilities without wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) systems; and
    (ii) Method 17 of appendix A of this part may be used at facilities 
with or without wet scrubber systems provided the stack gas temperature 
does not exceed a temperature of 160 [deg]C (32 [deg]F). The procedures 
of sections 2.1 and 2.3 of Method 5B of appendix A of this part may be 
used in Method 17 of appendix A of this part only if it is used after a 
wet FGD system. Do not use Method 17 of appendix A of this part after 
wet FGD systems if the effluent is saturated or laden with water 
droplets.
    (iii) Method 5B of appendix A of this part is to be used only after 
wet FGD systems.
    (3) Method 1 of appendix A of this part is used to select the 
sampling site and the number of traverse sampling points. The sampling 
time for each run is at least 120 minutes and the minimum sampling 
volume is 1.7 dscm (60 dscf) except that smaller sampling times or 
volumes may be approved by the Administrator when necessitated by 
process variables or other factors.
    (4) For Method 5 of appendix A of this part, the temperature of the 
sample gas in the probe and filter holder is monitored and is maintained 
at 160<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>14 [deg]C (320<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>25 
[deg]F).
    (5) For determination of PM emissions, the oxygen (O<INF>2) or 
CO<INF>2 sample is obtained simultaneously with each run of Method 
5, 5B, or 17 of appendix A of this part by traversing the duct at the 
same sampling location.
    (6) For each run using Method 5, 5B, or 17 of appendix A of this 
part, the emission rate expressed in ng/J heat input is determined 
using:
    (i) The O<INF>2 or CO<INF>2 measurements and PM 
measurements obtained under this section;
    (ii) The dry basis F factor; and
    (iii) The dry basis emission rate calculation procedure contained in 
Method 19 of appendix A of this part.
    (7) Method 9 of appendix A of this part is used for determining the 
opacity of stack emissions.
    (e) To determine compliance with the emission limits for 
NO<INF>X required under Sec. 60.44b, the owner or operator of an 
affected facility shall conduct the performance test as required under 
Sec. 60.8 using the continuous system for monitoring NO<INF>X 
under Sec. 60.48(b).
    (1) For the initial compliance test, NO<INF>X from the steam 
generating unit are monitored for 30 successive steam generating unit 
operating days and the 30-day average emission rate is used to determine 
compliance with the NO<INF>X emission standards under Sec. 
60.44b. The 30-day average emission rate is calculated as the average of 
all hourly emissions data recorded by the monitoring system during the 
30-day test period.
    (2) Following the date on which the initial performance test is 
completed or is required to be completed under Sec. 60.8, whichever 
date comes first, the owner or operator of an affected facility which 
combusts coal or which combusts residual oil having a nitrogen content 
greater than 0.30 weight percent shall determine compliance with the 
NO<INF>X emission standards under Sec. 60.44b on a continuous 
basis through the use of a 30-day rolling average emission rate. A new 
30-day rolling average emission rate is calculated each steam generating 
unit operating day as the average of all of the hourly NO<INF>X 
emission data for the preceding 30 steam generating unit operating days.
    (3) Following the date on which the initial performance test is 
completed or is required to be completed under Sec. 60.8, whichever 
date comes first, the owner or operator of an affected facility that has 
a heat input capacity greater than 73 MW (250 MMBtu/hr) and that 
combusts natural gas, distillate oil, or residual oil having a nitrogen 
content of 0.30 weight percent or less shall determine compliance with 
the NO<INF>X standards under Sec. 60.44b on a continuous basis 
through the use of a 30-day rolling average emission rate. A new 30-day 
rolling average emission rate is calculated each steam generating unit 
operating day as the average of all of the hourly NO<INF>X 
emission data for the preceding 30 steam generating unit operating days.
    (4) Following the date on which the initial performance test is 
completed or required to be completed under Sec. 60.8, whichever date 
comes first, the owner or operator of an affected facility that has a 
heat input capacity of 73

[[Page 176]]

MW (250 MMBtu/hr) or less and that combusts natural gas, distillate oil, 
or residual oil having a nitrogen content of 0.30 weight percent or less 
shall upon request determine compliance with the NO<INF>X 
standards under Sec. 60.44b through the use of a 30-day performance 
test. During periods when performance tests are not requested, 
NO<INF>X emissions data collected pursuant to Sec. 60.48b(g)(1) 
or Sec. 60.48b(g)(2) are used to calculate a 30-day rolling average 
emission rate on a daily basis and used to prepare excess emission 
reports, but will not be used to determine compliance with the 
NO<INF>X emission standards. A new 30-day rolling average emission 
rate is calculated each steam generating unit operating day as the 
average of all of the hourly NO<INF>X emission data for the 
preceding 30 steam generating unit operating days.
    (5) If the owner or operator of an affected facility that combusts 
residual oil does not sample and analyze the residual oil for nitrogen 
content, as specified in Sec. 60.49b(e), the requirements of Sec. 
60.48b(g)(1) apply and the provisions of Sec. 60.48b(g)(2) are 
inapplicable.
    (f) To determine compliance with the emissions limits for 
NO<INF>X required by Sec. 60.44b(a)(4) or Sec. 60.44b(l) for 
duct burners used in combined cycle systems, either of the procedures 
described in paragraph (f)(1) or (2) of this section may be used:
    (1) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall conduct the 
performance test required under Sec. 60.8 as follows:
    (i) The emissions rate (E) of NO<INF>X shall be computed using 
Equation 1 in this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13JN07.031

Where:

E = Emissions rate of NO<INF>X from the duct burner, ng/J (lb/
          MMBtu) heat input;
E<INF>sg = Combined effluent emissions rate, in ng/J (lb/MMBtu) 
          heat input using appropriate F factor as described in Method 
          19 of appendix A of this part;
H<INF>g = Heat input rate to the combustion turbine, in J/hr 
          (MMBtu/hr);
H<INF>b = Heat input rate to the duct burner, in J/hr (MMBtu/hr); 
          and
E<INF>g = Emissions rate from the combustion turbine, in ng/J (lb/
          MMBtu) heat input calculated using appropriate F factor as 
          described in Method 19 of appendix A of this part.

    (ii) Method 7E of appendix A of this part shall be used to determine 
the NO<INF>X concentrations. Method 3A or 3B of appendix A of this 
part shall be used to determine O<INF>2 concentration.
    (iii) The owner or operator shall identify and demonstrate to the 
Administrator's satisfaction suitable methods to determine the average 
hourly heat input rate to the combustion turbine and the average hourly 
heat input rate to the affected duct burner.
    (iv) Compliance with the emissions limits under Sec. 60.44b(a)(4) 
or Sec. 60.44b(l) is determined by the three-run average (nominal 1-
hour runs) for the initial and subsequent performance tests; or
    (2) The owner or operator of an affected facility may elect to 
determine compliance on a 30-day rolling average basis by using the CEMS 
specified under Sec. 60.48b for measuring NO<INF>X and 
O<INF>2 and meet the requirements of Sec. 60.48b. The sampling 
site shall be located at the outlet from the steam generating unit. The 
NO<INF>X emissions rate at the outlet from the steam generating 
unit shall constitute the NO<INF>X emissions rate from the duct 
burner of the combined cycle system.
    (g) The owner or operator of an affected facility described in Sec. 
60.44b(j) or Sec. 60.44b(k) shall demonstrate the maximum heat input 
capacity of the steam generating unit by operating the facility at 
maximum capacity for 24 hours. The owner or operator of an affected 
facility shall determine the maximum heat input capacity using the heat 
loss method described in sections 5 and 7.3 of the ASME Power Test Codes 
4.1 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 60.17). This demonstration of 
maximum heat input capacity shall be made during the initial performance 
test for affected facilities that meet the criteria of Sec. 60.44b(j). 
It shall be made within 60 days after achieving the maximum production 
rate at which the affected facility will be operated, but not later than 
180 days after initial start-up of each facility, for affected 
facilities meeting the criteria of Sec. 60.44b(k). Subsequent 
demonstrations may be required by the Administrator at any

[[Page 177]]

other time. If this demonstration indicates that the maximum heat input 
capacity of the affected facility is less than that stated by the 
manufacturer of the affected facility, the maximum heat input capacity 
determined during this demonstration shall be used to determine the 
capacity utilization rate for the affected facility. Otherwise, the 
maximum heat input capacity provided by the manufacturer is used.
    (h) The owner or operator of an affected facility described in Sec. 
60.44b(j) that has a heat input capacity greater than 73 MW (250 MMBtu/
hr) shall:
    (1) Conduct an initial performance test as required under Sec. 60.8 
over a minimum of 24 consecutive steam generating unit operating hours 
at maximum heat input capacity to demonstrate compliance with the 
NO<INF>X emission standards under Sec. 60.44b using Method 7, 7A, 
7E of appendix A of this part, or other approved reference methods; and
    (2) Conduct subsequent performance tests once per calendar year or 
every 400 hours of operation (whichever comes first) to demonstrate 
compliance with the NO<INF>X emission standards under Sec. 60.44b 
over a minimum of 3 consecutive steam generating unit operating hours at 
maximum heat input capacity using Method 7, 7A, 7E of appendix A of this 
part, or other approved reference methods.
    (i) The owner or operator of an affected facility seeking to 
demonstrate compliance under paragraph Sec. 60.43b(h)(5) shall follow 
the applicable procedures under Sec. 60.49b(r).
    (j) In place of PM testing with EPA Reference Method 5, 5B, or 17 of 
appendix A of this part, an owner or operator may elect to install, 
calibrate, maintain, and operate a CEMS for monitoring PM emissions 
discharged to the atmosphere and record the output of the system. The 
owner or operator of an affected facility who elects to continuously 
monitor PM emissions instead of conducting performance testing using EPA 
Method 5, 5B, or 17 of appendix A of this part shall comply with the 
requirements specified in paragraphs (j)(1) through (j)(13) of this 
section.
    (1) Notify the Administrator one month before starting use of the 
system.
    (2) Notify the Administrator one month before stopping use of the 
system.
    (3) The monitor shall be installed, evaluated, and operated in 
accordance with Sec. 60.13 of subpart A of this part.
    (4) The initial performance evaluation shall be completed no later 
than 180 days after the date of initial startup of the affected 
facility, as specified under Sec. 60.8 of subpart A of this part or 
within 180 days of notification to the Administrator of use of the CEMS 
if the owner or operator was previously determining compliance by Method 
5, 5B, or 17 of appendix A of this part performance tests, whichever is 
later.
    (5) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall conduct an 
initial performance test for PM emissions as required under Sec. 60.8 
of subpart A of this part. Compliance with the PM emission limit shall 
be determined by using the CEMS specified in paragraph (j) of this 
section to measure PM and calculating a 24-hour block arithmetic average 
emission concentration using EPA Reference Method 19 of appendix A of 
this part, section 4.1.
    (6) Compliance with the PM emission limit shall be determined based 
on the 24-hour daily (block) average of the hourly arithmetic average 
emission concentrations using CEMS outlet data.
    (7) At a minimum, valid CEMS hourly averages shall be obtained as 
specified in paragraphs (j)(7)(i) of this section for 75 percent of the 
total operating hours per 30-day rolling average.
    (i) At least two data points per hour shall be used to calculate 
each 1-hour arithmetic average.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (8) The 1-hour arithmetic averages required under paragraph (j)(7) 
of this section shall be expressed in ng/J or lb/MMBtu heat input and 
shall be used to calculate the boiler operating day daily arithmetic 
average emission concentrations. The 1-hour arithmetic averages shall be 
calculated using the data points required under Sec. 60.13(e)(2) of 
subpart A of this part.

[[Page 178]]

    (9) All valid CEMS data shall be used in calculating average 
emission concentrations even if the minimum CEMS data requirements of 
paragraph (j)(7) of this section are not met.
    (10) The CEMS shall be operated according to Performance 
Specification 11 in appendix B of this part.
    (11) During the correlation testing runs of the CEMS required by 
Performance Specification 11 in appendix B of this part, PM and 
O<INF>2 (or CO<INF>2) data shall be collected concurrently 
(or within a 30-to 60-minute period) by both the continuous emission 
monitors and the test methods specified in paragraphs (j)(7)(i) of this 
section.
    (i) For PM, EPA Reference Method 5, 5B, or 17 of appendix A of this 
part shall be used.
    (ii) For O<INF>2 (or CO<INF>2), EPA reference Method 3, 
3A, or 3B of appendix A of this part, as applicable shall be used.
    (12) Quarterly accuracy determinations and daily calibration drift 
tests shall be performed in accordance with procedure 2 in appendix F of 
this part. Relative Response Audit's must be performed annually and 
Response Correlation Audits must be performed every 3 years.
    (13) When PM emissions data are not obtained because of CEMS 
breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments, 
emissions data shall be obtained by using other monitoring systems as 
approved by the Administrator or EPA Reference Method 19 of appendix A 
of this part to provide, as necessary, valid emissions data for a 
minimum of 75 percent of total operating hours per 30-day rolling 
average.

Sec. 60.47b  Emission monitoring for sulfur dioxide.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (f), and (h) of this 
section, the owner or operator of an affected facility subject to the 
SO<INF>2 standards under Sec. 60.42b shall install, calibrate, 
maintain, and operate CEMS for measuring SO<INF>2 concentrations 
and either O<INF>2 or CO<INF>2 concentrations and shall 
record the output of the systems. For units complying with the percent 
reduction standard, the SO<INF>2 and either O<INF>2 or 
CO<INF>2 concentrations shall both be monitored at the inlet and 
outlet of the SO<INF>2 control device. If the owner or operator 
has installed and certified SO<INF>2 and O<INF>2 or 
CO<INF>2 CEMS according to the requirements of Sec. 75.20(c)(1) 
of this chapter and appendix A to part 75 of this chapter, and is 
continuing to meet the ongoing quality assurance requirements of Sec. 
75.21 of this chapter and appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, those 
CEMS may be used to meet the requirements of this section, provided 
that:
    (1) When relative accuracy testing is conducted, SO<INF>2 
concentration data and CO<INF>2 (or O<INF>2) data are 
collected simultaneously; and
    (2) In addition to meeting the applicable SO<INF>2 and 
CO<INF>2 (or O<INF>2) relative accuracy specifications in 
Figure 2 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, the relative accuracy 
(RA) standard in section 13.2 of Performance Specification 2 in appendix 
B to this part is met when the RA is calculated on a lb/MMBtu basis; and
    (3) The reporting requirements of Sec. 60.49b are met. 
SO<INF>2 and CO<INF>2 (or O<INF>2) data used to meet 
the requirements of Sec. 60.49b shall not include substitute data 
values derived from the missing data procedures in subpart D of part 75 
of this chapter, nor shall the SO<INF>2 data have been bias 
adjusted according to the procedures of part 75 of this chapter.
    (b) As an alternative to operating CEMS as required under paragraph 
(a) of this section, an owner or operator may elect to determine the 
average SO<INF>2 emissions and percent reduction by:
    (1) Collecting coal or oil samples in an as-fired condition at the 
inlet to the steam generating unit and analyzing them for sulfur and 
heat content according to Method 19 of appendix A of this part. Method 
19 of appendix A of this part provides procedures for converting these 
measurements into the format to be used in calculating the average 
SO<INF>2 input rate, or
    (2) Measuring SO<INF>2 according to Method 6B of appendix A of 
this part at the inlet or outlet to the SO<INF>2 control system. 
An initial stratification test is required to verify the adequacy of the 
Method 6B of appendix A of this part sampling location. The 
stratification test shall consist of three paired runs of a suitable 
SO<INF>2 and CO<INF>2 measurement

[[Page 179]]

train operated at the candidate location and a second similar train 
operated according to the procedures in section 3.2 and the applicable 
procedures in section 7 of Performance Specification 2. Method 6B of 
appendix A of this part, Method 6A of appendix A of this part, or a 
combination of Methods 6 and 3 or 3B of appendix A of this part or 
Methods 6C and 3A of appendix A of this part are suitable measurement 
techniques. If Method 6B of appendix A of this part is used for the 
second train, sampling time and timer operation may be adjusted for the 
stratification test as long as an adequate sample volume is collected; 
however, both sampling trains are to be operated similarly. For the 
location to be adequate for Method 6B of appendix A of this part 24-hour 
tests, the mean of the absolute difference between the three paired runs 
must be less than 10 percent.
    (3) A daily SO<INF>2 emission rate, E<INF>D, shall be 
determined using the procedure described in Method 6A of appendix A of 
this part, section 7.6.2 (Equation 6A-8) and stated in ng/J (lb/MMBtu) 
heat input.
    (4) The mean 30-day emission rate is calculated using the daily 
measured values in ng/J (lb/MMBtu) for 30 successive steam generating 
unit operating days using equation 19-20 of Method 19 of appendix A of 
this part.
    (c) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall obtain 
emission data for at least 75 percent of the operating hours in at least 
22 out of 30 successive boiler operating days. If this minimum data 
requirement is not met with a single monitoring system, the owner or 
operator of the affected facility shall supplement the emission data 
with data collected with other monitoring systems as approved by the 
Administrator or the reference methods and procedures as described in 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) The 1-hour average SO<INF>2 emission rates measured by the 
CEMS required by paragraph (a) of this section and required under Sec. 
60.13(h) is expressed in ng/J or lb/MMBtu heat input and is used to 
calculate the average emission rates under Sec. 60.42(b). Each 1-hour 
average SO<INF>2 emission rate must be based on 30 or more minutes 
of steam generating unit operation. The hourly averages shall be 
calculated according to Sec. 60.13(h)(2). Hourly SO<INF>2 
emission rates are not calculated if the affected facility is operated 
less than 30 minutes in a given clock hour and are not counted toward 
determination of a steam generating unit operating day.
    (e) The procedures under Sec. 60.13 shall be followed for 
installation, evaluation, and operation of the CEMS.
    (1) Except as provided for in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, all 
CEMS shall be operated in accordance with the applicable procedures 
under Performance Specifications 1, 2, and 3 of appendix B of this part.
    (2) Except as provided for in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, 
quarterly accuracy determinations and daily calibration drift tests 
shall be performed in accordance with Procedure 1 of appendix F of this 
part.
    (3) For affected facilities combusting coal or oil, alone or in 
combination with other fuels, the span value of the SO<INF>2 CEMS 
at the inlet to the SO<INF>2 control device is 125 percent of the 
maximum estimated hourly potential SO<INF>2 emissions of the fuel 
combusted, and the span value of the CEMS at the outlet to the 
SO<INF>2 control device is 50 percent of the maximum estimated 
hourly potential SO<INF>2 emissions of the fuel combusted. 
Alternatively, SO<INF>2 span values determined according to 
section 2.1.1 in appendix A to part 75 of this chapter may be used.
    (4) As an alternative to meeting the requirements of requirements of 
paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section, the owner or operator may 
elect to implement the following alternative data accuracy assessment 
procedures:
    (i) For all required CO<INF>2 and O<INF>2 monitors and 
for SO<INF>2 and NO<INF>X monitors with span values less 
than 100 ppm, the daily calibration error test and calibration 
adjustment procedures described in sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.3 of appendix 
B to part 75 of this chapter may be followed instead of the CD 
assessment procedures in Procedure 1, section 4.1 of appendix F to this 
part. If this option is selected, the data validation and out-of-control 
provisions in sections 2.1.4 and 2.1.5 of appendix B to part 75 of this 
chapter shall be followed instead of the excessive CD and out-of-

[[Page 180]]

control criteria in Procedure 1, section 4.3 of appendix F to this part. 
For the purposes of data validation under this subpart, the excessive CD 
and out-of-control criteria in Procedure 1, section 4.3 of appendix F to 
this part shall apply to SO<INF>2 and NO<INF>X span values 
less than 100 ppm;
    (ii) For all required CO<INF>2 and O<INF>2 monitors and 
for SO<INF>2 and NO<INF>X monitors with span values greater 
than 30 ppm, quarterly linearity checks may be performed in accordance 
with section 2.2.1 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, instead of 
performing the cylinder gas audits (CGAs) described in Procedure 1, 
section 5.1.2 of appendix F to this part. If this option is selected: 
The frequency of the linearity checks shall be as specified in section 
2.2.1 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter; the applicable linearity 
specifications in section 3.2 of appendix A to part 75 of this chapter 
shall be met; the data validation and out-of-control criteria in section 
2.2.3 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter shall be followed instead 
of the excessive audit inaccuracy and out-of-control criteria in 
Procedure 1, section 5.2 of appendix F to this part; and the grace 
period provisions in section 2.2.4 of appendix B to part 75 of this 
chapter shall apply. For the purposes of data validation under this 
subpart, the cylinder gas audits described in Procedure 1, section 5.1.2 
of appendix F to this part shall be performed for SO<INF>2 and 
NO<INF>X span values less than or equal to 30 ppm; and
    (iii) For SO<INF>2, CO<INF>2, and O<INF>2 
monitoring systems and for NO<INF>X emission rate monitoring 
systems, RATAs may be performed in accordance with section 2.3 of 
appendix B to part 75 of this chapter instead of following the 
procedures described in Procedure 1, section 5.1.1 of appendix F to this 
part. If this option is selected: The frequency of each RATA shall be as 
specified in section 2.3.1 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter; the 
applicable relative accuracy specifications shown in Figure 2 in 
appendix B to part 75 of this chapter shall be met; the data validation 
and out-of-control criteria in section 2.3.2 of appendix B to part 75 of 
this chapter shall be followed instead of the excessive audit inaccuracy 
and out-of-control criteria in Procedure 1, section 5.2 of appendix F to 
this part; and the grace period provisions in section 2.3.3 of appendix 
B to part 75 of this chapter shall apply. For the purposes of data 
validation under this subpart, the relative accuracy specification in 
section 13.2 of Performance Specification 2 in appendix B to this part 
shall be met on a lb/MMBtu basis for SO<INF>2 (regardless of the 
SO<INF>2 emission level during the RATA), and for NO<INF>X 
when the average NO<INF>X emission rate measured by the reference 
method during the RATA is less than 0.100 lb/MMBtu.
    (f) The owner or operator of an affected facility that combusts very 
low sulfur oil or is demonstrating compliance under Sec. 60.45b(k) is 
not subject to the emission monitoring requirements under paragraph (a) 
of this section if the owner or operator maintains fuel records as 
described in Sec. 60.49b(r).


<R05>

rate CEMS to meet the requirements of part 75 of this chapter and is 
continuing to meet the ongoing requirements of part 75 of this chapter, 
that CEMS may be used to meet the requirements of this section, except 
that the owner or operator shall also meet the requirements of Sec. 
60.49b. Data reported to meet the requirements of Sec. 60.49b shall not 
include data substituted using the missing data procedures in subpart D 
of part 75 of this chapter, nor shall the data have

[[Page 181]]

been bias adjusted according to the procedures of part 75 of this 
chapter.
    (c) The CEMS required under paragraph (b) of this section shall be 
operated and data recorded during all periods of operation of the 
affected facility except for CEMS breakdowns and repairs. Data is 
recorded during calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments.
    (d) The 1-hour average NO<INF>X emission rates measured by the 
continuous NO<INF>X monitor required by paragraph (b) of this 
section and required under Sec. 60.13(h) shall be expressed in ng/J or 
lb/MMBtu heat input and shall be used to calculate the average emission 
rates under Sec. 60.44b. The 1-hour averages shall be calculated using 
the data points required under Sec. 60.13(h)(2).
    (e) The procedures under Sec. 60.13 shall be followed for 
installation, evaluation, and operation of the continuous monitoring 
systems.
    (1) For affected facilities combusting coal, wood or municipal-type 
solid waste, the span value for a continuous monitoring system for 
measuring opacity shall be between 60 and 80 percent.
    (2) For affected facilities combusting coal, oil, or natural gas, 
the span value for NO<INF>X is determined using one of the 
following procedures:

                Fuel                      Span values for NOX  (ppm)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Natural gas.........................  500.
Oil.................................  500.
Coal................................  1,000.
Mixtures............................  500 (x + y) + 1,000z.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where:

x = Fraction of total heat input derived from natural gas;
y = Fraction of total heat input derived from oil; and
z = Fraction of total heat input derived from coal.

    (ii) As an alternative to meeting the requirements of paragraph

an annual capacity factor for wood of 30 percent (0.30) or less and is 
subject to a federally enforceable requirement limiting operation of the 
affected facility to an annual capacity factor for wood of 30 percent 
(0.30) or less.
    (c) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is 
completed or required to be completed under Sec. 60.8, whichever date 
comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that combusts 
coal, wood, or oil and has a heat input capacity of 8.7 MW (30 MMBtu/hr) 
or greater shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that 
affected facility any gases that exhibit greater than 20 percent opacity

    (d) The PM and opacity standards under this section apply at all 
times, except during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction.
    (e)(1) On and after the date on which the initial performance test 
is completed or is required to be completed under Sec. 60.8, whichever 
date comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that

for which modification commenced after February 28, 2005, may elect to 
meet the requirements of this paragraph. On and after the date on which 
the initial performance test is completed or required to be completed 
under Sec. 60.8, whichever date comes first, no owner or operator of an 
affected facility that commences modification after February 28, 2005 
shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected 
facility any gases that contain PM in excess of both:
    (i) 22 ng/J (0.051 lb/MMBtu) heat input derived from the combustion 
of coal, oil, wood, a mixture of these fuels, or a mixture of these 
fuels with any other fuels; and

Sec. 60.44c  Compliance and performance test methods and procedures

for sulfur dioxide.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section and 
Sec. 60.8(b), performance tests required under Sec. 60.8 shall be 
conducted following the procedures specified in paragraphs (b), (c), 
(d), (e), and (f) of this section, as applicable. Section 60.8(f) does 
not apply to this section. The 30-day notice required in Sec. 60.8(d) 
applies only to the initial performance test unless otherwise specified 
by the Administrator.
    (b) The initial performance test required under Sec. 60.8 shall be 
conducted over 30 consecutive operating days of the steam generating 
unit. Compliance with the percent reduction requirements and 
SO<INF>2 emission limits under Sec. 60.42c shall be determined 
using a 30-day average. The first operating day included in the initial 
performance test shall be scheduled within 30 days after achieving the 
maximum production rate at which the affect facility will be operated, 
but not later than 180 days after the initial startup of the facility. 
The steam generating unit load during the 30-day period does not have to 
be the maximum design heat input capacity, but must be representative of 
future operating conditions.

[[Page 196]]

    (c) After the initial performance test required under paragraph (b) 
of this section and Sec. 60.8, compliance with the percent reduction 
requirements and SO<INF>2 emission limits under Sec. 60.42c is 
based on the average percent reduction and the average SO<INF>2 
emission rates for 30 consecutive steam generating unit operating days. 
A separate performance test is completed at the end of each steam 
generating unit operating day, and a new 30-day average percent 
reduction and SO<INF>2 emission rate are calculated to show 
compliance with the standard.
    (d) If only coal, only oil, or a mixture of coal and oil is 
combusted in an affected facility, the procedures in Method 19 of 
appendix A of this part are used to determine the hourly SO<INF>2 
emission rate (E<INF>ho) and the 30-day average SO<INF>2 
emission rate (E<INF>ao). The hourly averages used to compute the 
30-day averages are obtained from the CEMS. Method 19 of appendix A of 
this part shall be used to calculate E<INF>ao when using daily 
fuel sampling or Method 6B of appendix A of this part.
    (e) If coal, oil, or coal and oil are combusted with other fuels:
    (1) An adjusted E<INF>ho (E<INF>hoo) is used in Equation 
19-19 of Method 19 of appendix A of this part to compute the adjusted 
E<INF>ao (E<INF>aoo). The E<INF>hoo is computed using 
the following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13JN07.033

Where:

E<INF>hoo = Adjusted E<INF>ho, ng/J (lb/MMBtu);
E<INF>ho = Hourly SO<INF>2 emission rate, ng/J (lb/MMBtu);
E<INF>w = SO<INF>2 concentration in fuels other than coal 
          and oil combusted in the affected facility, as determined by 
          fuel sampling and analysis procedures in Method 9 of appendix 
          A of this part, ng/J (lb/MMBtu). The value E<INF>w for 
          each fuel lot is used for each hourly average during the time 
          that the lot is being combusted. The owner or operator does 
          not have to measure E<INF>w if the owner or operator 
          elects to assume E<INF>w = 0.
X<INF>k = Fraction of the total heat input from fuel combustion 
          derived from coal and oil, as determined by applicable 
          procedures in Method 19 of appendix A of this part.

    (2) The owner or operator of an affected facility that qualifies 
under the provisions of Sec. 60.42c(c) or (d) (where percent reduction 
is not required) does not have to measure the parameters E<INF>w 
or X<INF>k if the owner or operator of the affected facility 
elects to measure emission rates of the coal or oil using the fuel 
sampling and analysis procedures under Method 19 of appendix A of this 
part.
    (f) Affected facilities subject to the percent reduction 
requirements under Sec. 60.42c(a) or (b) shall determine compliance 
with the SO<INF>2 emission limits under Sec. 60.42c pursuant to 
paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section, and shall determine compliance 
with the percent reduction requirements using the following procedures:
    (1) If only coal is combusted, the percent of potential 
SO<INF>2 emission rate is computed using the following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13JN07.034

Where:

%P<INF>s = Potential SO<INF>2 emission rate, in percent;
%R<INF>g = SO<INF>2 removal efficiency of the control device 
          as determined by Method 19 of appendix A of this part, in 
          percent; and
%R<INF>f = SO<INF>2 removal efficiency of fuel pretreatment 
          as determined by Method 19 of appendix A of this part, in 
          percent.

    (2) If coal, oil, or coal and oil are combusted with other fuels, 
the same procedures required in paragraph (f)(1) of this section are 
used, except as provided for in the following:
    (i) To compute the %P<INF>s, an adjusted %R<INF>g 
(%R<INF>go) is computed from E<INF>aoo from paragraph (e)(1) 
of this section and an adjusted average SO<INF>2 inlet rate 
(E<INF>aio) using the following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13JN07.035

Where:

%R<INF>go = Adjusted %R<INF>g, in percent;
E<INF>aoo = Adjusted E<INF>ao, ng/J (lb/MMBtu); and
E<INF>aio = Adjusted average SO<INF>2 inlet rate, ng/J (lb/
          MMBtu).

    (ii) To compute E<INF>aio, an adjusted hourly SO<INF>2 
inlet rate (E<INF>hio) is used. The

[[Page 197]]

E<INF>hio is computed using the following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR13JN07.036

Where:

E<INF>hio = Adjusted E<INF>hi, ng/J (lb/MMBtu);
E<INF>hi = Hourly SO<INF>2 inlet rate, ng/J (lb/MMBtu);
E<INF>w = SO<INF>2 concentration in fuels other than coal 
          and oil combusted in the affected facility, as determined by 
          fuel sampling and analysis procedures in Method 19 of appendix 
          A of this part, ng/J (lb/MMBtu). The value E<INF>w for 
          each fuel lot is used for each hourly average during the time 
          that the lot is being combusted. The owner or operator does 
          not have to measure E<INF>w if the owner or operator 
          elects to assume E<INF>w = 0; and
X<INF>k = Fraction of the total heat input from fuel combustion 
          derived from coal and oil, as determined by applicable 
          procedures in Method 19 of appendix A of this part.

    (g) For oil-fired affected facilities where the owner or operator 
seeks to demonstrate compliance with the fuel oil sulfur limits under 
Sec. 60.42c based on shipment fuel sampling, the initial performance 
test shall consist of sampling and analyzing the oil in the initial tank 
of oil to be fired in the steam generating unit to demonstrate that the 
oil contains 0.5 weight percent sulfur or less. Thereafter, the owner or 
operator of the affected facility shall sample the oil in the fuel tank 
after each new shipment of oil is received, as described under Sec. 
60.46c(d)(2).
    (h) For affected facilities subject to Sec. 60.42c(h)(1), (2), or 
(3) where the owner or operator seeks to demonstrate compliance with the 
SO<INF>2 standards based on fuel supplier certification, the 
performance test shall consist of the certification, the certification 
from the fuel supplier, as described under Sec. 60.48c(f), as 
applicable.
    (i) The owner or operator of an affected facility seeking to 
demonstrate compliance with the SO<INF>2 standards under Sec. 
60.42c(c)(2) shall demonstrate the maximum design heat input capacity of 
the steam generating unit by operating the steam generating unit at this 
capacity for 24 hours. This demonstration shall be made during the 
initial performance test, and a subsequent demonstration may be 
requested at any other time. If the demonstrated 24-hour average firing 
rate for the affected facility is less than the maximum design heat 
input capacity stated by the manufacturer of the affected facility, the 
demonstrated 24-hour average firing rate shall be used to determine the 
annual capacity factor for the affected facility; otherwise, the maximum 
design heat input capacity provided by the manufacturer shall be used.
    (j) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall use all 
valid SO<INF>2 emissions data in calculating %P<INF>s and 
E<INF>ho under paragraphs (d), (e), or (f) of this section, as 
applicable, whether or not the minimum emissions data requirements under 
Sec. 60.46c(f) are achieved. All valid emissions data, including valid 
data collected during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, 
shall be used in calculating %P<INF>s or E<INF>ho pursuant 
to paragraphs (d), (e), or (f) of this section, as applicable.

appendix A of this part may be used in Method 17 of appendix A of this 
part only if Method 17 of appendix A of this part is used in conjunction 
with a wet scrubber system. Method 17 of appendix A of this part shall 
not be used in conjunction with a wet scrubber system if the effluent is 
saturated or laden with water droplets.
    (iii) Method 5B of appendix A of this part may be used in 
conjunction with a wet scrubber system.
    (4) The sampling time for each run shall be at least 120 minutes and

by process variables or other factors.
    (5) For Method 5 or 5B of appendix A of this part, the temperature 
of the sample gas in the probe and filter holder shall be monitored and 
maintained at 160 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>14 [deg]C (320<plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>25 [deg]F).
    (6) For determination of PM emissions, an oxygen (O<INF>2) or 
carbon dioxide (CO<INF>2) measurement shall be obtained 
simultaneously with each run of Method 5, 5B, or 17 of appendix A of 
this part by traversing the duct at the same sampling location.
    (7) For each run using Method 5, 5B, or 17 of appendix A of this

be determined using:
    (i) The O<INF>2 or CO<INF>2 measurements and PM 
measurements obtained under this section, (ii) The dry basis F factor, 
and
    (iii) The dry basis emission rate calculation procedure contained in 
Method 19 of appendix A of this part.
    (8) Method 9 of appendix A of this part (6-minute average of 24 
observations) shall be used for determining the opacity of stack

affected facility is less than the maximum design heat input capacity 
stated by the manufacturer of the affected facility, the demonstrated 
24-hour average firing rate shall be used to determine the annual 
capacity factor for the affected facility; otherwise, the maximum design 
heat input capacity provided by the manufacturer shall be used.
    (c) In place of PM testing with EPA Reference Method 5, 5B, or 17 of 
appendix A of this part, an owner or operator may elect to install, 
calibrate, maintain, and operate a CEMS for monitoring PM emissions 
discharged to the atmosphere and record the output of the system. The 
owner or operator of an affected facility who elects to continuously 
monitor PM emissions instead of conducting performance testing using EPA 
Method 5, 5B, or 17 of appendix A of this part shall install, calibrate, 
maintain, and operate a CEMS and shall comply with the requirements 
specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(13) of this section.

emission concentrations using CEMS outlet data.
    (7) At a minimum, valid CEMS hourly averages shall be obtained as 
specified in paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this section for 75 percent of the 
total operating hours per 30-day rolling average.
    (i) At least two data points per hour shall be used to calculate 
each 1-hour arithmetic average.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (8) The 1-hour arithmetic averages required under paragraph (d)(7) 
of this section shall be expressed in ng/J or lb/MMBtu heat input and 
shall be used to calculate the boiler operating day daily arithmetic 
average emission concentrations. The 1-hour arithmetic averages shall be

paragraph (d)(7) of this section are not met.
    (10) The CEMS shall be operated according to Performance 
Specification 11 in appendix B of this part.
    (11) During the correlation testing runs of the CEMS required by 
Performance Specification 11 in appendix B of this part, PM and 
O<INF>2 (or CO<INF>2) data shall be collected concurrently 
(or within a 30- to 60-minute period) by both the continuous emission 
monitors and the test methods specified in paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this 
section.
    (i) For PM, EPA Reference Method 5, 5B, or 17 of appendix A of this 
part shall be used.
    (ii) For O<INF>2 (or CO<INF>2), EPA reference Method 3, 
3A, or 3B of appendix A of this part, as applicable shall be used.

MMBtu/hr).


<R05>
Sec. 60.46c  Emission monitoring for sulfur dioxide.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, 
the owner or operator of an affected facility subject to the 
SO<INF>2 emission limits under Sec. 60.42c shall install, 
calibrate, maintain, and operate a CEMS for measuring SO<INF>2 
concentrations and either O<INF>2 or CO<INF>2 concentrations 
at the outlet of the SO<INF>2 control device (or the outlet of the 
steam generating unit if no SO<INF>2 control device is used), and 
shall record the output of the system. The owner or operator of an 
affected facility subject to the percent reduction requirements under 
Sec. 60.42c shall measure SO<INF>2 concentrations and either 
O<INF>2 or CO<INF>2 concentrations at both the inlet and 
outlet of the SO<INF>2 control device.
    (b) The 1-hour average SO<INF>2 emission rates measured by a 
CEMS shall be expressed in ng/J or lb/MMBtu heat input and shall be used 
to calculate the average emission rates under Sec. 60.42c. Each 1-hour 
average SO<INF>2 emission rate must be based on at least 30 
minutes of operation, and shall be calculated using the data points 
required under Sec. 60.13(h)(2). Hourly SO<INF>2 emission rates 
are not calculated if the affected facility is operated less than 30 
minutes in a 1-hour period and are not counted toward determination of a 
steam generating unit operating day.
    (c) The procedures under Sec. 60.13 shall be followed for 
installation, evaluation, and operation of the CEMS.

[[Page 200]]

    (1) All CEMS shall be operated in accordance with the applicable 
procedures under Performance Specifications 1, 2, and 3 of appendix B of 
this part.
    (2) Quarterly accuracy determinations and daily calibration drift 
tests shall be performed in accordance with Procedure 1 of appendix F of 
this part.
    (3) For affected facilities subject to the percent reduction 
requirements under Sec. 60.42c, the span value of the SO<INF>2 
CEMS at the inlet to the SO<INF>2 control device shall be 125 
percent of the maximum estimated hourly potential SO<INF>2 
emission rate of the fuel combusted, and the span value of the 
SO<INF>2 CEMS at the outlet from the SO<INF>2 control device 
shall be 50 percent of the maximum estimated hourly potential 
SO<INF>2 emission rate of the fuel combusted.
    (4) For affected facilities that are not subject to the percent 
reduction requirements of Sec. 60.42c, the span value of the 
SO<INF>2 CEMS at the outlet from the SO<INF>2 control device 
(or outlet of the steam generating unit if no SO<INF>2 control 
device is used) shall be 125 percent of the maximum estimated hourly 
potential SO<INF>2 emission rate of the fuel combusted.
    (d) As an alternative to operating a CEMS at the inlet to the 
SO<INF>2 control device (or outlet of the steam generating unit if 
no SO<INF>2 control device is used) as required under paragraph 
(a) of this section, an owner or operator may elect to determine the 
average SO<INF>2 emission rate by sampling the fuel prior to 
combustion. As an alternative to operating a CEMS at the outlet from the 
SO<INF>2 control device (or outlet of the steam generating unit if 
no SO<INF>2 control device is used) as required under paragraph 
(a) of this section, an owner or operator may elect to determine the 
average SO<INF>2 emission rate by using Method 6B of appendix A of 
this part. Fuel sampling shall be conducted pursuant to either paragraph 
(d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section. Method 6B of appendix A of this part 
shall be conducted pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
    (1) For affected facilities combusting coal or oil, coal or oil 
samples shall be collected daily in an as-fired condition at the inlet 
to the steam generating unit and analyzed for sulfur content and heat 
content according the Method 19 of appendix A of this part. Method 19 of 
appendix A of this part provides procedures for converting these 
measurements into the format to be used in calculating the average 
SO<INF>2 input rate.
    (2) As an alternative fuel sampling procedure for affected 
facilities combusting oil, oil samples may be collected from the fuel 
tank for each steam generating unit immediately after the fuel tank is 
filled and before any oil is combusted. The owner or operator of the 
affected facility shall analyze the oil sample to determine the sulfur 
content of the oil. If a partially empty fuel tank is refilled, a new 
sample and analysis of the fuel in the tank would be required upon 
filling. Results of the fuel analysis taken after each new shipment of 
oil is received shall be used as the daily value when calculating the 
30-day rolling average until the next shipment is received. If the fuel 
analysis shows that the sulfur content in the fuel tank is greater than 
0.5 weight percent sulfur, the owner or operator shall ensure that the 
sulfur content of subsequent oil shipments is low enough to cause the 
30-day rolling average sulfur content to be 0.5 weight percent sulfur or 
less.
    (3) Method 6B of appendix A of this part may be used in lieu of CEMS 
to measure SO<INF>2 at the inlet or outlet of the SO<INF>2 
control system. An initial stratification test is required to verify the 
adequacy of the Method 6B of appendix A of this part sampling location. 
The stratification test shall consist of three paired runs of a suitable 
SO<INF>2 and CO<INF>2 measurement train operated at the 
candidate location and a second similar train operated according to the 
procedures in Sec. 3.2 and the applicable procedures in section 7 of 
Performance Specification 2 of appendix B of this part. Method 6B of 
appendix A of this part, Method 6A of appendix A of this part, or a 
combination of Methods 6 and 3 of appendix A of this part or Methods 6C 
and 3A of appendix A of this part are suitable measurement techniques. 
If Method 6B of appendix A of this part is used for the second train, 
sampling time and timer operation may be adjusted for the

[[Page 201]]

stratification test as long as an adequate sample volume is collected; 
however, both sampling trains are to be operated similarly. For the 
location to be adequate for Method 6B of appendix A of this part 24-hour 
tests, the mean of the absolute difference between the three paired runs 
must be less than 10 percent (0.10).
    (e) The monitoring requirements of paragraphs (a) and (d) of this 
section shall not apply to affected facilities subject to Sec. 
60.42c(h) (1), (2), or (3) where the owner or operator of the affected 
facility seeks to demonstrate compliance with the SO<INF>2 
standards based on fuel supplier certification, as described under Sec. 
60.48c(f), as applicable.
    (f) The owner or operator of an affected facility operating a CEMS 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, or conducting as-fired fuel 
sampling pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, shall obtain 
emission data for at least 75 percent of the operating hours in at least 
22 out of 30 successive steam generating unit operating days. If this

data with data collected with other monitoring systems as approved by 
the Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 60.47c  Emission monitoring for particulate matter.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (c), (d), (e), and (f) of this 
section, the owner or operator of an affected facility combusting coal, 
oil, or wood that is subject to the opacity standards under Sec. 60.43c 
shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a COMS for measuring the 
opacity of the emissions discharged to the atmosphere and record the 
output of the system.
    (b) All COMS for measuring opacity shall be operated in accordance 
with the applicable procedures under Performance Specification 1 of 
appendix B of this part. The span value of the opacity COMS shall be 
between 60 and 80 percent.
    (c) Affected facilities that burn only distillate oil that contains 
no more than 0.5 weight percent sulfur and/or liquid or gaseous fuels 
with potential sulfur dioxide emission rates of 26 ng/J (0.06 lb/MMBtu) 
heat input or less and that do not use a post-combustion technology to 
reduce SO<INF>2 or PM emissions are not required to operate a CEMS 
for measuring opacity if they follow the applicable procedures under 
Sec. 60.48c(f).
    (d) Owners or operators complying with the PM emission limit by 
using a PM CEMS monitor instead of monitoring opacity must calibrate, 
maintain, and operate a CEMS, and record the output of the system, for 
PM emissions discharged to the atmosphere as specified in Sec. 
60.45c(d). The CEMS specified in paragraph Sec. 60.45c(d) shall be 
operated and data recorded during all periods of operation of the 
affected facility except for CEMS breakdowns and repairs. Data is 
recorded during calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments.
    (e) An affected facility that does not use post-combustion 
technology (except a wet scrubber) for reducing PM, SO<INF>2, or 
carbon monoxide (CO) emissions, burns only gaseous fuels or fuel oils 
that contain less than or equal to 0.5 weight percent sulfur, and is 
operated such that emissions of CO to the atmosphere from the affected 
facility are maintained at levels less than or equal to 0.15 lb/MMBtu on 
a boiler operating day average basis is not required to operate a COMS 
for measuring opacity. Owners and operators of affected facilities 
electing to comply with this paragraph must demonstrate compliance 
according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (4) 
of this section.
    (1) You must monitor CO emissions using a CEMS according to the 
procedures specified in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (iv) of this 
section.
    (i) The CO CEMS must be installed, certified, maintained, and 
operated according to the provisions in Sec. 60.58b(i)(3) of subpart Eb 
of this part.
    (ii) Each 1-hour CO emissions average is calculated using the data 
points generated by the CO CEMS expressed in parts per million by volume 
corrected to 3 percent oxygen (dry basis).
    (iii) At a minimum, valid 1-hour CO emissions averages must be 
obtained for at least 90 percent of the operating hours on a 30-day 
rolling average basis. At least two data points per hour must

[[Page 202]]

be used to calculate each 1-hour average.
    (iv) Quarterly accuracy determinations and daily calibration drift 
tests for the CO CEMS must be performed in accordance with procedure 1 
in appendix F of this part.
    (2) You must calculate the 1-hour average CO emissions levels for 
each steam generating unit operating day by multiplying the average 
hourly CO output concentration measured by the CO CEMS times the 
corresponding average hourly flue gas flow rate and divided by the 
corresponding average hourly heat input to the affected source. The 24-
hour average CO emission level is determined by calculating the 
arithmetic average of the hourly CO emission levels computed for each 
steam generating unit operating day.
    (3) You must evaluate the preceding 24-hour average CO emission 
level each steam generating unit operating day excluding periods of 
affected source startup, shutdown, or malfunction. If the 24-hour 
average CO emission level is greater than 0.15 lb/MMBtu, you must 
initiate investigation of the relevant equipment and control systems 
within 24 hours of the first discovery of the high emission incident 
and, take the appropriate corrective action as soon as practicable to 
adjust control settings or repair equipment to reduce the 24-hour 
average CO emission level to 0.15 lb/MMBtu or less.
    (4) You must record the CO measurements and calculations performed 
according to paragraph (e) of this section and any corrective actions 
taken. The record of corrective action taken must include the date and 
time during which the 24-hour average CO emission level was greater than 
0.15 lb/MMBtu, and the date, time, and description of the corrective 
action.
    (f) An affected facility that burns only gaseous fuels or fuel oils 
that contain less than or equal to 0.5 weight percent sulfur and 
operates according to a written site-specific monitoring plan approved 
by the appropriate delegated permitting authority is not required to 
operate a COMS for measuring opacity. This monitoring plan must include 
procedures and criteria for establishing and monitoring specific 
parameters for the affected facility indicative of compliance with the 
opacity standard.

<R05>
Sec. 60.53  Monitoring of operations.

    (a) The owner or operator of any incinerator subject to the 
provisions of this part shall record the daily charging rates and hours 
of operation.


<R05>
Sec. 60.54  Test methods and procedures.

    (a) In conducting the performance tests required in Sec. 60.8, the 
owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test 
methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as 
specified in this section, except as provided in Sec. 60.8(b).
    (b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
particulate matter standard in Sec. 60.52 as follows:
    (1) The concentration (c<INF>12) of particulate matter, 
corrected to 12 percent CO<INF>2, shall be computed for each run 
using the following equation:

c<INF>12 = c<INF>s (12/%CO<INF>2)

where:

c<INF>12=concentration of particulate matter, corrected to 12 
percent CO<INF>2, g/dscm (gr/dscf).
c<INF>s=concentration of particulate matter, g/dscm (gr/dscf).
%CO<INF>2=CO<INF>2 concentration, percent dry basis.

    (2) Method 5 shall be used to determine the particulate matter 
concentration (c<INF>s). The sampling time and sample volume for 
each run shall be at least 60 minutes and 0.85 dscm (30 dscf).
    (3) The emission rate correction factor, integrated or grab sampling 
and analysis procedure of Method 3B shall be used to determine 
CO<INF>2 concentration (%CO<INF>2).
    (i) The CO<INF>2 sample shall be obtained simultaneously with, 
and at the same traverse points as, the particulate run. If the 
particulate run has more than 12 traverse points, the CO<INF>2 
traverse points may be reduced to 12 if Method 1 is used to locate the 
12 CO<INF>2 traverse points. If individual CO<INF>2 samples 
are taken at each traverse point, the CO<INF>2 concentration 
(%CO<INF>2) used in the correction equation shall be the 
arithmetic mean of the sample CO<INF>2 concentrations at all 
traverse points.
    (ii) If sampling is conducted after a wet scrubber, an ``adjusted'' 
CO<INF>2 concentration [(%CO<INF>2)<INF>adj], which 
accounts for the effects of CO<INF>2 absorption and dilution air, 
may be used instead of the CO<INF>2 concentration determined in 
this paragraph. The adjusted CO<INF>2 concentration shall be 
determined by either of the procedures in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) The owner or operator may use either of the following procedures 
to determine the adjusted CO<INF>2 concentration.
    (1) The volumetric flow rates at the inlet and outlet of the wet 
scrubber and the inlet CO<INF>2 concentration may be used to 
determine the adjusted CO<INF>2 concentration 
[(%CO<INF>2)<INF>adj] using the following equation:

(%CO<INF>2)<INF>adj=(%CO<INF>2)<INF>di 
    (Q<INF>di/Q<INF>do)

where:

(%CO<INF>2)<INF>adj=adjusted outlet CO<INF>2 
concentration, percent dry basis.
(%CO<INF>2)<INF>di=CO<INF>2 concentration measured 
before the scrubber, percent dry basis.
Q<INF>di=volumetric flow rate of effluent gas before the wet 
scrubber, dscm/min (dscf/min).

[[Page 206]]

Q<INF>do=volumetric flow rate of effluent gas after the wet 
scrubber, dscm/min (dscf/min).

    (i) At the outlet, Method 5 is used to determine the volumetric flow 
rate (Q<INF>do) of the effluent gas.
    (ii) At the inlet, Method 2 is used to determine the volumetric flow 
rate (Q<INF>di) of the effluent gas as follows: Two full velocity 
traverses are conducted, one immediately before and one immediately 
after each particulate run conducted at the outlet, and the results are 
averaged.
    (iii) At the inlet, the emission rate correction factor, integrated 
sampling and analysis procedure of Method 3B is used to determine the 
CO<INF>2 concentration [(%CO<INF>2)<INF>di] as 
follows: At least nine sampling points are selected randomly from the 
velocity traverse points and are divided randomly into three sets, equal 
in number of points; the first set of three or more points is used for 
the first run, the second set for the second run, and the third set for 
the third run. The CO<INF>2 sample is taken simultaneously with 
each particulate run being conducted at the outlet, by traversing the 
three sampling points (or more) and sampling at each point for equal 
increments of time.
    (2) Excess air measurements may be used to determine the adjusted 
CO<INF>2 concentration [(%CO<INF>2)<INF>adj] using the 
following equation:

(%CO<INF>2)<INF>adj=(%CO<INF>2)<INF>di 
    [(100+%EA<INF>i)/(100+%EA<INF>o)]

where:

(%CO<INF>2)<INF>adj=adjusted outlet CO<INF>2 
concentration, percent dry basis.
(%CO<INF>2)<INF>di=CO<INF>2 concentration at the inlet 
of the wet scrubber, percent dry basis.
%EA<INF>i=excess air at the inlet of the scrubber, percent.
%EA<INF>o=excess air at the outlet of the scrubber, percent.

    (i) A gas sample is collected as in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this 
section and the gas samples at both the inlet and outlet locations are 
analyzed for CO<INF>2, O<INF>2, and N<INF>2.
    (ii) Equation 3B-3 of Method 3B is used to compute the percentages 
of excess air at the inlet and outlet of the wet scrubber.

chief facility operator and shift supervisor shall have completed full 
certification or shall have scheduled a full certification exam with 
either the American Society of Mechanical Engineers [QRO-1-1994 
(incorporated by reference--see Sec. 60.17 of subpart A of this part)] 
or a State certification program.
    (c) No owner or operator of an affected facility shall allow the 
facility to be operated at any time unless one of the following persons 
is on duty and at the affected facility: A fully certified chief 
facility operator, a provisionally certified chief facility operator who 
is scheduled to take the full certification exam according to the 
schedule specified in paragraph (b) of this section, a fully certified 
shift supervisor, or a provisionally certified shift supervisor who is 
scheduled to take the full certification exam according to the schedule 
specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (1) The requirement specified in paragraph (c) of this section shall 
take effect 6 months after the date of startup of the affected facility

may fulfill the certified operator requirement. Depending on the length 
of time that a certified chief facility operator and certified shift 
supervisor are away, the owner or operator of the affected facility must 
meet one of three criteria:
    (i) When the certified chief facility operator and certified shift 
supervisor are both off site for 12 hours or less, and no other 
certified operator is on site, the provisionally certified control room 
operator may perform the duties of the certified chief facility operator 
or certified shift supervisor.
    (ii) When the certified chief facility operator and certified shift 
supervisor are off site for more than 12 hours, but for two weeks or 
less, and no other certified operator is on site, the provisionally 
certified control room operator may perform the duties of the certified 
chief facility operator or certified shift supervisor without notice to, 
or approval by, the Administrator. However, the owner or operator of the 
affected facility must record the period when the certified chief 
facility operator and certified shift supervisor are off site and 
include that information in the annual report as specified under Sec. 
60.59b(g)(5).
    (iii) When the certified chief facility operator and certified shift 
supervisor are off site for more than two weeks, and no other certified 
operator is on site, the provisionally certified control room operator 
may perform the duties of the certified chief facility operator or 
certified shift supervisor without approval by the Administrator. 
However, the owner or operator of the affected facility must take two 
actions:
    (A) Notify the Administrator in writing. In the notice, state what 
caused the absence and what actions are being taken by the owner or 
operator of the facility to ensure that a certified chief facility 
operator or certified shift supervisor is on site as expeditiously as 
practicable.
    (B) Submit a status report and corrective action summary to the 
Administrator every four weeks following the initial notification. If 
the Administrator provides notice that the status report or corrective 
action summary is disapproved, the municipal waste combustion unit may 
continue operation for 90 days, but then must cease operation. If 
corrective actions are taken in the 90-day period such that the 
Administrator withdraws the disapproval, municipal waste combustion unit 
operation may continue.
    (3) A provisionally certified operator who is newly promoted or 
recently transferred to a shift supervisor position or a chief facility 
operator position at the municipal waste combustion unit may perform the 
duties of the certified chief facility operator or certified shift 
supervisor without notice to, or approval by, the Administrator for up 
to six months before taking the ASME QRO certification exam.
    (d) All chief facility operators, shift supervisors, and control 
room operators at affected facilities must complete the EPA or State 
municipal waste combustor operator training course no later than the 
date 6 months after the date of startup of the affected facility or by 
December 19, 1996, whichever is later.
    (e) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall develop and 
update on a yearly basis a site-specific operating manual that shall, at 
a minimum, address the elements of municipal waste combustor unit 
operation specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(11) of this

conditions;
    (8) Procedures for minimizing particulate matter carryover;
    (9) Procedures for handling ash;

[[Page 232]]

    (10) Procedures for monitoring municipal waste combustor unit 
emissions; and
    (11) Reporting and recordkeeping procedures.
    (f) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall establish a 
training program to review the operating manual according to the 
schedule specified in paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2) of this section with 
each person who has responsibilities affecting the operation of an 
affected facility including, but not limited to, chief facility 
operators, shift supervisors, control room operators, ash handlers, 
maintenance personnel, and crane/load handlers.
    (1) Each person specified in paragraph (f) of this section shall 
undergo initial training no later than the date specified in paragraph 
(f)(1)(i), (f)(1)(ii), or (f)(1)(iii) of this section whichever is 
later.
    (i) The date 6 months after the date of startup of the affected 
facility;

facility shall conduct performance tests for dioxin/furan emissions in 
accordance with paragraph (g)(3) of this section, according to one of 
the schedules specified in paragraphs (g)(5)(i) through (g)(5)(iii) of 
this section.
    (i) For affected facilities, performance tests shall be conducted on 
a calendar year basis (no less than 9 calendar months and no more than 
15 calendar months following the previous performance test; and must 
complete five performance tests in each 5-year calendar period).
    (ii) For the purpose of evaluating system performance to establish 
new operating parameter levels, testing new technology or control 
technologies, diagnostic testing, or related activities for the purpose 
of improving facility performance or advancing the state-of-the-art for 
controlling facility emissions, the owner or operator of an affected 
facility that qualifies for the performance testing schedule specified 
in paragraph (g)(5)(iii) of this section, may test one unit for dioxin/
furan and apply the dioxin/furan operating parameters to similarly 
designed and equipped units on site by meeting the requirements 
specified in paragraphs (g)(5)(ii)(A) through (g)(5)(ii)(D) of this 
section.
    (A) Follow the testing schedule established in paragraph (g)(5)(iii) 
of this section. For example, each year a different affected facility at 
the municipal waste combustor plant shall be tested, and the affected 
facilities at the plant shall be tested in sequence (e.g., unit 1, unit 
2, unit 3, as applicable).

[[Page 243]]

    (B) Upon meeting the requirements in paragraph (g)(5)(iii) of this 
section for one affected facility, the owner or operator may elect to 
apply the average carbon mass feed rate and associated carbon injection 
system operating parameter levels for dioxin/furan as established in 
paragraph (m) of this section to similarly designed and equipped units 
on site.
    (C) Upon testing each subsequent unit in accordance with the testing 
schedule established in paragraph (g)(5)(iii) of this section, the 
dioxin/furan and mercury emissions of the subsequent unit shall not 
exceed the dioxin/furan and mercury emissions measured in the most 
recent test of that unit prior to the revised operating parameter 
levels.
    (D) The owner or operator of an affected facility that selects to 
follow the performance testing schedule specified in paragraph 
(g)(5)(iii) of this section and apply the carbon injection system 
operating parameters to similarly designed and equipped units on site 
shall follow the procedures specified in Sec. 60.59b(g)(4) for 
reporting.
    (iii) Where all performance tests over a 2-year period indicate that 
dioxin/furan emissions are less than or equal to 7 nanograms per dry 
standard cubic meter (total mass) for all affected facilities located 
within a municipal waste combustor plant, the owner or operator of the 
municipal waste combustor plant may elect to conduct annual performance 
tests for one affected facility (i.e., unit) per year at the municipal 
waste combustor plant. At a minimum, a performance test for dioxin/furan 
emissions shall be conducted on a calendar year basis (no less than 9 
calendar months and no more than 15 months following the previous 
performance test; and must complete five performance tests in each 5-
year calendar period) for one affected facility at the municipal waste 
combustor plant. Each year a different affected facility at the 
municipal waste combustor plant shall be tested, and the affected 
facilities at the plant shall be tested in sequence (e.g., unit 1, unit 
2, unit 3, as applicable). If each annual performance test continues to 
indicate a dioxin/furan emission level less than or equal to 7 nanograms 
per dry standard cubic meter (total mass), the owner or operator may 
continue conducting a performance test on only one affected facility per 
calendar year. If any annual performance test indicates either a dioxin/
furan emission level greater than 7 nanograms per dry standard cubic 
meter (total mass), performance tests shall thereafter be conducted 
annually on all affected facilities at the plant until and unless all 
annual performance tests for all affected facilities at the plant over a 
2-year period indicate a dioxin/furan emission level less than or equal 
to 7 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass).
    (6) The owner or operator of an affected facility that selects to 
follow the performance testing schedule specified in paragraph 
(g)(5)(iii) of this section shall follow the procedures specified in 
Sec. 60.59b(g)(4) for reporting the selection of this schedule.
    (7) The owner or operator of an affected facility where activated 
carbon is used shall follow the procedures specified in paragraph (m) of 
this section for measuring and calculating the carbon usage rate.
    (8) The owner or operator of an affected facility may request that 
compliance with the dioxin/furan emission limit be determined using 
carbon dioxide measurements corrected to an equivalent of 7 percent 
oxygen. The relationship between oxygen and carbon dioxide levels for 
the affected facility shall be established as specified in paragraph 
(b)(6) of this section.
    (9) As specified under Sec. 60.8 of subpart A of this part, all 
performance tests shall consist of three test runs. The average of the 
dioxin/furan emission concentrations from the three test runs is used to 
determine compliance.
    (10) In place of dioxin/furan sampling and testing with EPA 
Reference Method 23, an owner or operator may elect to sample dioxin/
furan by installing, calibrating, maintaining, and operating a 
continuous automated sampling system for monitoring dioxin/furan 
emissions discharged to the atmosphere, recording the output of the 
system, and analyzing the sample using EPA Method 23. This option to use 
a continuous automated sampling system takes effect on the date a final 
performance specification applicable to

[[Page 244]]

dioxin/furan from monitors is published in the Federal Register or the 
date of approval of a site-specific monitoring plan. The owner or 
operator of an affected facility who elects to continuously sample 
dioxin/furan emissions instead of sampling and testing using EPA Method 
23 shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous 
automated sampling system and shall comply with the requirements 
specified in paragraphs (p) and (q) of this section.
    (h) The procedures and test methods specified in paragraphs (h)(1) 
through (h)(12) of this section shall be used to determine compliance

60.8 of subpart A of this part, compliance with the emission limit for 
nitrogen oxides required under Sec. 60.52b(d) shall be determined based 
on the 24-hour daily arithmetic average of the hourly emission 
concentrations using continuous emission monitoring system outlet data.
    (6) At a minimum, valid continuous emission monitoring system hourly 
averages shall be obtained as specified in paragraphs (h)(6)(i) and

basis) and used to calculate the 24-hour daily arithmetic average 
concentrations. The 1-hour arithmetic averages shall be calculated using 
the data points required under Sec. 60.13(e)(2) of subpart A of this 
part.
    (8) All valid continuous emission monitoring system data must be 
used in calculating emission averages even if the minimum continuous 
emission monitoring system data requirements of paragraph (h)(6) of this

[[Page 246]]

shall be calculated from 1-hour arithmetic averages expressed in parts 
per million by volume corrected to 7 percent oxygen (dry basis). The 1-
hour arithmetic averages shall be calculated using the data points

    (iv) All signal conversion elements associated with steam (or 
feedwater flow) measurements must be calibrated according to the 
manufacturer's instructions before each dioxin/furan performance test, 
and at least once per year.
    (7) To determine compliance with the maximum particulate matter 
control device temperature requirements under Sec. 60.53b(c), the owner 
or operator of an affected facility shall install, calibrate, maintain, 
and operate a device for measuring on a continuous basis the temperature 
of the flue gas stream at the inlet to each particulate matter control

with the dioxin/furan emission limit was achieved. If a subsequent 
dioxin/furan performance test is being performed on only one affected 
facility at the MWC plant, as provided in paragraph (g)(5)(iii) of this 
section, the owner or operator may elect to apply the same maximum 
municipal waste combustor unit load from the tested facility for all the 
similarly designed and operated affected facilities at the MWC plant.
    (9) For each particulate matter control device employed at the 
affected facility, the maximum demonstrated particulate matter control 
device temperature shall be determined during the initial performance 
test for dioxins/furans and each subsequent performance test during 
which compliance with the dioxin/furan emission limit specified in Sec.

    (1) For municipal waste combustor units capable of combusting 
municipal solid waste continuously for a 24-hour period, municipal waste 
combustor unit capacity shall be calculated based on 24 hours of 
operation at the maximum charging rate. The maximum charging rate shall 
be determined as specified in paragraphs (j)(1)(i) and (j)(1)(ii) of 
this section as applicable.
    (i) For combustors that are designed based on heat capacity, the 
maximum charging rate shall be calculated based on the maximum design 
heat input capacity of the unit and a heating value of 12,800 kilojoules 
per kilogram for combustors firing refuse-derived fuel and a heating 
value of 10,500 kilojoules per kilogram for combustors firing municipal 
solid waste that is not refuse-derived fuel.
    (ii) For combustors that are not designed based on heat capacity, 
the maximum charging rate shall be the maximum design charging rate.
    (2) For batch feed municipal waste combustor units, municipal waste 
combustor unit capacity shall be calculated as the maximum design amount 
of municipal solid waste that can be charged per batch multiplied by the 
maximum number of batches that could be processed in a 24-hour period. 
The maximum number of batches that could be processed in a 24-hour 
period is calculated as 24 hours divided by the design number of hours 
required to process one batch of municipal solid waste, and may include 
fractional batches (e.g., if one batch requires 16 hours, then 24/16, or 
1.5 batches, could be combusted in a 24-hour period). For batch 
combustors that are designed based on heat capacity, the design heating 
value of 12,800 kilojoules per kilogram for combustors firing refuse-
derived fuel and a heating value of 10,500 kilojoules per kilogram for 
combustors firing municipal solid waste that is not refuse-derived fuel 
shall be used in calculating the municipal waste combustor unit capacity 
in

Sec. 60.52b(a)(5), and/or the dioxin/furan emission limits under Sec. 
60.52(b)(c), or the dioxin/furan emission level specified in paragraph 
(g)(5)(iii) of this section shall follow the procedures specified in 
paragraphs (m)(1) through (m)(4) of this section.
    (1) During the performance tests for dioxins/furans and mercury, as 
applicable, the owner or operator shall estimate an average carbon mass 
feed rate based on carbon injection system operating parameters such as 
the screw feeder speed, hopper volume, hopper refill frequency, or other 
parameters appropriate to the feed system being employed, as specified 
in paragraphs (m)(1)(i) and (m)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (i) An average carbon mass feed rate in kilograms per hour or pounds 
per hour shall be estimated during the initial performance test for

exceed the level(s) documented during the performance tests specified 
under paragraphs (m)(1)(i) and (m)(1)(ii) of this section, except as 
specified in paragraphs (m)(2)(i) and (m)(2)(ii) of this section.

[[Page 249]]

    (i) During the annual dioxin/furan or mercury performance test and 
the 2 weeks preceding the annual dioxin/furan or mercury performance 
test, no limit is applicable for average mass carbon feed rate if the 
provisions of paragraph (m)(2)(ii) of this section are met.
    (ii) The limit for average mass carbon feed rate may be waived in 
accordance with permission granted by the Administrator for the purpose 
of evaluating system performance, testing new technology or control 
technologies, diagnostic testing, or related activities for the purpose 
of improving facility performance or advancing the state-of-the-art for 
controlling facility emissions.
    (3) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall estimate the

plant for the total number of hours of operation during the calendar 
quarter.
    (4) Pneumatic injection pressure or other carbon injection system 
operational indicator shall be used to provide additional verification 
of proper carbon injection system operation. The operational indicator 
shall provide an instantaneous visual and/or audible alarm to alert the 
operator of a potential interruption in the carbon feed that would not 
normally be indicated by direct monitoring of carbon mass feed rate 
(e.g., continuous weight loss feeder) or monitoring of the carbon system 
operating parameter(s) that are the indicator(s) of carbon mass feed 
rate (e.g., screw feeder speed). The carbon injection system operational 
indicator used to provide additional verification of carbon injection 
system operation, including basis for selecting the indicator and 
operator response to the indicator alarm, shall be included in section 
(e)(6) of the site-specific operating manual required under Sec. 
60.54b(e) of this subpart.
    (n) In place of periodic manual testing of mercury, cadmium, lead, 
or hydrogen chloride with EPA Reference Method 26, 26A, 29, or as an 
alternative ASTM D6784-02 (as applicable), the owner or operator of an 
affected facility may elect to install, calibrate, maintain, and operate 
a continuous emission monitoring system for monitoring emissions 
discharged to the atmosphere and record the output of the system. The 
option to use a continuous emission monitoring system for mercury takes 
effect on the date of approval of the site-specific monitoring plan 
required in paragraph (n)(13) and (o) of this section. The option to use 
a continuous emission monitoring system for cadmium, lead, or hydrogen 
chloride takes effect on the date a final performance specification 
applicable to cadmium, lead, or hydrogen chloride monitor is published 
in the Federal Register or the date of approval of the site-specific 
monitoring plan required in paragraphs (n)(13) and (o) of this section. 
The owner or operator of an affected facility who elects to continuously 
monitor emissions instead of conducting manual performance testing shall 
install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous emission 
monitoring system and shall comply with the requirements specified in 
paragraphs (n)(1) through (n)(13) of this section.
    (1) Notify the Administrator one month before starting use of the 
system.
    (2) Notify the Administrator one month before stopping use of the

Where:

%R<INF>metal=percentage reduction of metal emission (Pb, Cd, or 
Hg) achieved;
E<INF>i=metal emission concentration (Pb, Cd, or Hg) measured at 
the control device inlet, corrected to 7 percent oxygen (dry basis); and
E<INF>o=metal emission concentration (Pb, Cd, or Hg) measured at 
the control device outlet, corrected to 7 percent oxygen (dry basis).

    (12) The EPA Reference Method 22 of appendix A of this part shall be 
used to determine compliance with the fugitive ash emission limit under 
Sec. 60.52c(c). The minimum observation time shall be a series of three 
1-hour observations.
    (c) Following the date on which the initial performance test is 
completed or is required to be completed under Sec. 60.8, whichever 
date comes first, the owner or operator of an affected facility shall:
    (1) Determine compliance with the opacity limit by conducting an 
annual performance test (no more than 12 months following the previous 
performance test) using the applicable procedures and test methods 
listed in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) Determine compliance with the PM, CO, and HCl emission limits by 
conducting an annual performance test (no more than 12 months following 
the previous performance test) using the applicable procedures and test 
methods listed in paragraph (b) of this section. If all three 
performance tests over a 3-year period indicate compliance with the 
emission limit for a pollutant (PM, CO, or HCl), the owner or operator 
may forego a performance test for that pollutant for the subsequent 2 
years. At a minimum, a performance test for PM, CO, and HCl shall be 
conducted every third year (no more than 36 months following the 
previous performance test). If a performance test conducted every third 
year indicates compliance with the emission limit for a pollutant (PM, 
CO, or HCl), the owner or operator may forego a performance test for 
that pollutant for an additional 2 years. If any performance test 
indicates noncompliance with the respective emission limit, a 
performance test for that pollutant shall be conducted annually until 
all annual performance tests over a 3-year period indicate compliance 
with the emission limit. The use of the bypass stack during a 
performance test shall invalidate the performance test.
    (3) For large HMIWI, determine compliance with the visible emission 
limits for fugitive emissions from flyash/bottom ash storage and 
handling by conducting a performance test using EPA Reference Method 22 
on an annual basis (no more than 12 months following the previous 
performance test).
    (4) Facilities using a CEMS to demonstrate compliance with any of 
the emission limits under Sec. 60.52c shall:
    (i) Determine compliance with the appropriate emission limit(s) 
using a 12-hour rolling average, calculated each hour as the average of 
the previous 12 operating hours (not including startup, shutdown, or 
malfunction).
    (ii) Operate all CEMS in accordance with the applicable procedures 
under appendices B and F of this part.
    (d) The owner or operator of an affected facility equipped with a 
dry scrubber followed by a fabric filter, a wet scrubber, or a dry 
scrubber followed by a fabric filter and wet scrubber shall:
    (1) Establish the appropriate maximum and minimum operating 
parameters, indicated in Table 3 of this subpart for each control 
system, as site specific operating parameters during the initial 
performance test to determine compliance with the emission limits; and
    (2) Following the date on which the initial performance test is 
completed or is required to be completed under

temperature and above the maximum charge rate (each measured on a 3-hour 
rolling average) simultaneously shall constitute a violation of the Hg 
emission limit.
    (6) Use of the bypass stack (except during startup, shutdown, or 
malfunction) shall constitute a violation of the PM, dioxin/furan, HCl, 
Pb, Cd and Hg emission limits.
    (g) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, for 
affected facilities equipped with a dry scrubber followed by a fabric 
filter and a wet scrubber:

repeat performance test within 30 days of violation of applicable 
operating parameter(s) to demonstrate that the affected facility is not 
in violation of the applicable emission limit(s). Repeat performance 
tests conducted pursuant to this paragraph shall be conducted using the 
identical operating parameters that indicated a violation under 
paragraph (e), (f), or (g) of this section.
    (i) The owner or operator of an affected facility using an air 
pollution control device other than a dry scrubber followed by a fabric 
filter, a wet scrubber, or a dry scrubber followed by a fabric filter 
and a wet scrubber to comply with the emission limits under Sec. 60.52c 
shall petition the Administrator for other site-specific operating 
parameters to be established during the initial performance test and 
continuously monitored thereafter. The owner or operator shall not

<R05>
Sec. 60.61  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, all terms not defined herein shall have the 
meaning given them in the Act and in subpart A of this part.
    (a) Portland cement plant means any facility manufacturing portland 
cement by either the wet or dry process.
    (b) Bypass means any system that prevents all or a portion of the 
kiln or clinker cooler exhaust gases from entering the main control 
device and ducts the gases through a separate control device. This does 
not include emergency systems designed to duct exhaust gases directly to 
the atmosphere in the event of a malfunction of any control device 
controlling kiln or clinker cooler emissions.
    (c) Bypass stack means the stack that vents exhaust gases to the 
atmosphere from the bypass control device.
    (d) Monovent means an exhaust configuration of a building or 
emission control device (e.g., positive-pressure fabric filter) that 
extends the length of the structure and has a width very small in 
relation to its length (i.e., length to width ratio is typically greater 
than 5:1). The exhaust may be an open vent with or without a roof, 
louvered vents, or a combination of such features.

owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test 
methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as 
specified in this section, except as provided in Sec. 60.8(b). 
Acceptable alternative methods and procedures are given in paragraph (c) 
of this section.
    (b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
NO<INF>X standard in Sec. 60.72 as follows:
    (1) The emission rate (E) of NO<INF>X shall be computed for 
each run using the following equation:

E=(C<INF>s Q<INF>sd)/(P K)

where:

E=emission rate of NO<INF>X as NO<INF>2, kg/metric ton (lb/
ton) of 100 percent nitric acid.
C<INF>s=concentration of NO<INF>X as NO<INF>2, g/dscm 
(lb/dscf).
Q<INF>sd=volumetric flow rate of effluent gas, dscm/hr (dscf/hr).
P=acid production rate, metric ton/hr (ton/hr) or 100 percent nitric 
acid.
K=conversion factor, 1000 g/kg (1.0 lb/lb).

concentration of each grab sample. Method 1 shall be used to select the 
sampling site, and the sampling point shall be the centroid of the stack 
or duct or at a point no closer to the walls than 1 m (3.28 ft). Four 
grab samples shall be taken at approximately 15-minute intervals. The 
arithmetic mean of the four sample concentrations shall constitute the 
run value (C<INF>s).
    (3) Method 2 shall be used to determine the volumetric flow rate 
(Q<INF>sd) of the effluent gas. The measurement site shall be the 
same as for the NO<INF>X sample. A velocity traverse shall be made 
once per run within the hour that the NO<INF>X samples are taken.
    (4) The methods of Sec. 60.73(c) shall be used to determine the 
production rate (P) of 100 percent nitric acid for each

[[Page 282]]

run. Material balance over the production system shall be used to 
confirm the production rate.
    (c) The owner or operator may use the following as alternatives to 
the reference methods and procedures specified in this section:
    (1) For Method 7, Method 7A, 7B, 7C, or 7D may be used. If Method 7C 
or 7D is used, the sampling time shall be at least 1 hour.
    (d) The owner or operator shall use the procedure in Sec. 60.73(b) 
to determine the conversion factor for converting the monitoring data to

Sec. 60.84  Emission monitoring.

    (a) A continuous monitoring system for the measurement of sulfur 
dioxide shall be installed, calibrated, maintained, and operated by the 
owner or operator. The pollutant gas used to prepare calibration gas 
mixtures under Performance Specification 2 and for calibration checks 
under Sec. 60.13(d), shall be sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2). Method 8 
shall be used for conducting monitoring system performance evaluations 
under Sec. 60.13(c) except that only the sulfur dioxide portion of the 
Method 8 results shall be used. The span value shall be set at 1000 ppm 
of sulfur dioxide.
    (b) The owner or operator shall establish a conversion factor for 
the purpose of converting monitoring data into units of the applicable 
standard (kg/metric ton, lb/ton). The conversion factor shall be 
determined, as a minimum, three times daily by measuring the

[[Page 283]]

concentration of sulfur dioxide entering the converter using suitable 
methods (e.g., the Reich test, National Air Pollution Control 
Administration Publication No. 999-AP-13) and calculating the 
appropriate conversion factor for each eight-hour period as follows:

CF=k[(1.000-0.015r)/(r-s)]

where:

CF=conversion factor (kg/metric ton per ppm, lb/ton per ppm).
k=constant derived from material balance. For determining CF in metric 
units, k=0.0653. For determining CF in English units, k=0.1306.
r=percentage of sulfur dioxide by volume entering the gas converter. 
Appropriate corrections must be made for air injection plants subject to 
the Administrator's approval.
s=percentage of sulfur dioxide by volume in the emissions to the 
atmosphere determined by the continuous monitoring system required under 
paragraph (a) of this section.

    (c) The owner or operator shall record all conversion factors and 
values under paragraph (b) of this section from which they were computed 
(i.e., CF, r, and s).
    (d) Alternatively, a source that processes elemental sulfur or an 
ore that contains elemental sulfur and uses air to supply oxygen may use 
the following continuous emission monitoring approach and calculation 
procedures in determining SO<INF>2 emission rates in terms of the 
standard. This procedure is not required, but is an alternative that 
would alleviate problems encountered in the measurement of gas 
velocities or production rate. Continuous emission monitoring systems 
for measuring SO<INF>2, O<INF>2, and CO<INF>2 (if 
required) shall be installed, calibrated, maintained, and operated by 
the owner or operator and subjected to the certification procedures in 
Performance Specifications 2 and 3. The calibration procedure and span 
value for the SO<INF>2 monitor shall be as specified in paragraph 
(b) of this section. The span value for CO<INF>2 (if required) 
shall be 10 percent and for O<INF>2 shall be 20.9 percent (air). A 
conversion factor based on process rate data is not necessary. Calculate

specified in this section, except as provided in Sec. 60.8(b).
    (b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
particulate

[[Page 291]]

matter (PM) standards in Sec. 60.102(a) as follows:
    (1) The emission rate (E) of PM shall be computed for each run using 
the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.000

Where:

E = Emission rate of PM, kg/Mg (lb/ton) of coke burn-off.

Q<INF>sd = Volumetric flow rate of effluent gas, dscm/hr (dscf/
hr).
R<INF>c = Coke burn-off rate, Mg/hr (ton/hr) coke.
K=Conversion factor, 1,000 g/kg (7,000 gr/lb).

    (2) Method 5B or 5F is to be used to determine particulate matter 
emissions and associated moisture content from affected facilities 
without wet FGD systems; only Method 5B is to be used after wet FGD 
systems. The sampling time for each run shall be at least 60 minutes and 
the sampling rate shall be at least 0.015 dscm/min (0.53 dscf/min), 
except that shorter sampling times may be approved by the Administrator 
when process variables or other factors preclude sampling for at least 
60 minutes.
    (3) The coke burn-off rate (R<INF>c) shall be computed for 
each run using the following equation:

R<INF>c = K<INF>1Q<INF>r (%CO<INF>2 + %CO) + 
    K<INF>2Q<INF>a - K<INF>3Q<INF>r(%CO/2 + 
    %CO<INF>2 + %O<INF>2)

Where:

R<INF>c = Coke burn-off rate, Mg/hr (ton/hr).
Q<INF>r = Volumetric flow rate of exhaust gas from catalyst 
regenerator before entering the emission control system, dscm/min (dscf/
min).
Q<INF>a = Volumetric flow rate of air to FCCU regenerator, as 
determined from the fluid catalytic cracking unit control room 
instrumentation, dscm/min (dscf/min).
%CO<INF>2 = Carbon dioxide concentration, percent by volume (dry 
basis).
%CO = Carbon monoxide concentration, percent by volume (dry basis).
%O<INF>2 = Oxygen concentration, percent by volume (dry basis).
K<INF>1 = Material balance and conversion factor, 2.982 x 
10<SUP>-4</SUP> (Mg-min)/(hr-dscm-%) [9.31 x 10<SUP>-6</SUP> (ton-min)/
(hr-dscf-%)].
K<INF>2 = Material balance and conversion factor, 2.088 x 
10<SUP>-3</SUP> (Mg-min)/(hr-dscm-%) [6.52 x 10<SUP>-5</SUP> (ton-min)/
(hr-dscf-%)].
K<INF>3 = Material balance and conversion factor, 9.94 x 
10<SUP>-5</SUP> (Mg-min)/(hr-dscm-%) [3.1 x 10<SUP>-6</SUP> (ton-min)/
(hr-dscf-%)].

    (i) Method 2 shall be used to determine the volumetric flow rate 
(Q<INF>r).
    (ii) The emission correction factor, integrated sampling and 
analysis procedure of Method 3B shall be used to determine 
CO<INF>2, CO, and O<INF>2 concentrations.
    (4) Method 9 and the procedures of Sec. 60.11 shall be used to 
determine opacity.
    (c) If auxiliary liquid or solid fossil-fuels are burned in an 
incinerator-waste heat boiler, the owner or operator shall determine the 
emission rate of PM permitted in Sec. 60.102(b) as follows:

computed for each run using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.002

Where:

E<INF>s = Emission rate of PM allowed, kg/Mg (lb/ton) of coke 
burn-off in catalyst regenerator.
F=Emission standard, 1.0 kg/Mg (2.0 lb/ton) of coke burn-off in catalyst 
regenerator.
A = Allowable incremental rate of PM emissions, 7.5 x 10<SUP>-4</SUP> 
kg/million J (0.10 lb/million Btu).
H = Heat input rate from solid or liquid fossil fuel, million J/hr 
(million Btu/hr).
R<INF>c = Coke burn-off rate, Mg coke/hr (ton coke/hr).

    (2) Procedures subject to the approval of the Administrator shall be 
used to determine the heat input rate.
    (3) The procedure in paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall be used 
to determine the coke burn-off rate (R<INF>c).
    (d) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the CO 
standard in Sec. 60.103(a) by using the integrated sampling technique 
of Method 10 to determine the CO concentration (dry basis). The sampling 
time for each run shall be 60 minutes.
    (e)(1) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
H<INF>2S standard in Sec. 60.104(a)(1) as follows: Method 11, 15, 
15A, or 16 shall be used to determine the H<INF>2S concentration. 
The gases entering the sampling train should be at about atmospheric 
pressure. If the pressure in the refinery fuel gas lines is relatively 
high, a flow control valve may be used to reduce the pressure. If the 
line pressure is high enough to operate the sampling train

[[Page 292]]

without a vacuum pump, the pump may be eliminated from the sampling 
train. The sample shall be drawn from a point near the centroid of the 
fuel gas line.
    (i) For Method 11, the sampling time and sample volume shall be at 
least 10 minutes and 0.010 dscm (0.35 dscf). Two samples of equal 
sampling times shall be taken at about 1-hour intervals. The arithmetic 
average of these two samples shall constitute a run. For most fuel 
gases, sampling times exceeding 20 minutes may result in depletion of 
the collection solution, although fuel gases containing low 
concentrations of H<INF>2S may necessitate sampling for longer 
periods of time.
    (ii) For Method 15 or 16, at least three injects over a 1-hour 
period shall constitute a run.
    (iii) For Method 15A, a 1-hour sample shall constitute a run.
    (2) Where emissions are monitored by Sec. 60.105(a)(3), compliance 
with Sec. 60.105(a)(1) shall be determined using Method 6 or 6C and 
Method 3 or 3A. A 1-hour sample shall constitute a run. Method 6 samples 
shall be taken at a rate of approximately 2 liters/min. The ppm 
correction factor (Method 6) and the sampling location in paragraph 
(f)(1) of this section apply. Method 4 shall be used to determine the 
moisture content of the gases. The sampling point for Method 4 shall be 
adjacent to the sampling point for Method 6 or 6C.
    (f) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
SO<INF>2 and the H<INF>2S and reduced sulfur standards in 
Sec. 60.104(a)(2) as follows:
    (1) Method 6 shall be used to determine the SO<INF>2 
concentration. The concentration in mg/dscm obtained by Method 6 or 6C 
is multiplied by 0.3754 to obtain the concentration in ppm. The sampling 
point in the duct shall be the centroid of the cross section if the 
cross-sectional area is less than 5.00 m\2\ (53.8 ft\2\) or at a point 
no closer to the walls than 1.00 m (39.4 in.) if the cross-sectional 
area is 5.00 m\2\ or more and the centroid is more than 1 m from the 
wall. The sampling time and sample volume shall be at least 10 minutes 
and 0.010 dscm (0.35 dscf) for each sample. Eight samples of equal 
sampling times shall be taken at about 30-minute intervals. The 
arithmetic average of these eight samples shall constitute a run. For 
Method 6C, a run shall consist of the arithmetic average of four 1-hour 
samples. Method 4 shall be used to determine the moisture content of the 
gases. The sampling point for Method 4 shall be adjacent to the sampling 
point for Method 6 or 6C. The sampling time for each sample shall be 
equal to the time it takes for two Method 6 samples. The moisture 
content from this sample shall be used to correct the corresponding 
Method 6 samples for moisture. For documenting the oxidation efficiency 
of the control device for reduced sulfur compounds, Method 15 shall be 
used following the procedures of paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
    (2) Method 15 shall be used to determine the reduced sulfur and 
H<INF>2 S concentrations. Each run shall consist of 16 samples 
taken over a minimum of 3 hours. The sampling point shall be the same as 
that described for Method 6 in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. To 
ensure minimum residence time for the sample inside the sample lines, 
the sampling rate shall be at least 3.0 lpm (0.10 cfm). The 
SO<INF>2 equivalent for each run shall be calculated after being 
corrected for moisture and oxygen as the arithmetic average of the 
SO<INF>2 equivalent for each sample during the run. Method 4 shall 
be used to determine the moisture content of the gases as the paragraph 
(f)(1) of this section. The sampling time for each sample shall be equal 
to the time it takes for four Method 15 samples.
    (3) The oxygen concentration used to correct the emission rate for 
excess air shall be obtained by the integrated sampling and analysis 
procedure of Method 3 or 3A. The samples shall be taken simultaneously 
with the SO<INF>2, reduced sulfur and H<INF>2S, or moisture 
samples. The SO<INF>2, reduced sulfur, and H<INF>2S samples 
shall be corrected to zero percent excess air using the equation in 
paragraph (h)(6) of this section.
    (g) Each performance test conducted for the purpose of determining 
compliance under Sec. 60.104(b) shall consist of all testing performed 
over a 7-day period using Method 6 or 6C and Method 3 or 3A. To 
determine compliance, the arithmetic mean of the results of all the 
tests shall be compared with the applicable standard.

[[Page 293]]

    (h) For the purpose of determining compliance with Sec. 
60.104(b)(1), the following calculation procedures shall be used:
    (1) Calculate each 1-hour average concentration (dry, zero percent 
oxygen, ppmv) of sulfur dioxide at both the inlet and the outlet to the 
add-on control device as specified in Sec. 60.13(h). These calculations 
are made using the emission data collected under Sec. 60.105(a).
    (2) Calculate a 7-day average (arithmetic mean) concentration of 
sulfur dioxide for the inlet and for the outlet to the add-on control 
device using all of the 1-hour average concentration values obtained 
during seven successive 24-hour periods.
    (3) Calculate the 7-day average percent reduction using the 
following equation:


Rso<INF>2 = 100(Cso<INF>2(i)-Cso<INF>2(o))/
Cso<INF>2(i)

where:

Rso<INF>2 = 7-day average sulfur dioxide emission reduction, 
percent
Cso<INF>2(i) = sulfur dioxide emission concentration determined in 
Sec. 60.106(h)(2) at the inlet to the add-on control device, ppmv
Cso<INF>2(o) = sulfur dioxide emission concentration determined in 
Sec. 60.106(h)(2) at the outlet to the add-on control device, ppmv
100 = conversion factor, decimal to percent

    (4) Outlet concentrations of sulfur dioxide from the add-on control 
device for compliance with the 50 ppmv standard, reported on a dry, 
O<INF>2-free basis, shall be calculated using the procedures 
outlined in Sec. 60.106(h)(1) and (2) above, but for the outlet monitor 
only.
    (5) If supplemental sampling data are used for determining the 7-day 
averages under paragraph (h) of this section and such data are not 
hourly averages, then the value obtained for each supplemental sample 
shall be assumed to represent the hourly average for each hour over 
which the sample was obtained.
    (6) For the purpose of adjusting pollutant concentrations to zero 
percent oxygen, the following equation shall be used:


C<INF>adj = C<INF>meas [20.9<INF>c/(20.9-
%O<INF>2)]

where:

C<INF>adj = pollutant concentration adjusted to zero percent 
oxygen, ppm or g/dscm
C<INF>meas = pollutant concentration measured on a dry basis, ppm 
or g/dscm
20.9<INF>c = 20.9 percent oxygen-0.0 percent oxygen (defined 
oxygen correction basis), percent
20.9 = oxygen concentration in air, percent
%O<INF>2 = oxygen concentration measured on a dry basis, percent

    (i) For the purpose of determining compliance with Sec. 
60.104(b)(2), the following reference methods and calculation procedures 
shall be used except as provided in paragraph (i)(12) of this section:
    (1) One 3-hour test shall be performed each day.
    (2) For gases released to the atmosphere from the fluid catalytic 
cracking unit catalyst regenerator:
    (i) Method 8 as modified in Sec. 60.106(i)(3) for moisture content 
and for the concentration of sulfur oxides calculated as sulfur dioxide,
    (ii) Method 1 for sample and velocity traverses,
    (iii) Method 2 calculation procedures (data obtained from Methods 3 
and 8) for velocity and volumetric flow rate, and
    (iv) Method 3 for gas analysis.
    (3) Method 8 shall be modified by the insertion of a heated glass 
fiber filter between the probe and first impinger. The probe liner and 
glass fiber filter temperature shall be maintained above 160 [deg]C (320 
[deg]F). The isopropanol impinger shall be eliminated. Sample recovery 
procedures described in Method 8 for container No. 1 shall be 
eliminated. The heated glass fiber filter also shall be excluded; 
however, rinsing of all connecting glassware after the heated glass 
fiber filter shall be retained and included in container No. 2. Sampled 
volume shall be at least 1 dscm.
    (4) For Method 3, the integrated sampling technique shall be used.
    (5) Sampling time for each run shall be at least 3 hours.
    (6) All testing shall be performed at the same location. Where the 
gases discharged by the fluid catalytic cracking unit catalyst 
regenerator pass through an incinerator-waste heat boiler in which 
auxiliary or supplemental gaseous, liquid, or solid fossil fuel is 
burned, testing shall be conducted at a point between the regenerator 
outlet and the incinerator-waste heat boiler.

[[Page 294]]

An alternative sampling location after the waste heat boiler may be used 
if alternative coke burn-off rate equations, and, if requested, 
auxiliary/supplemental fuel SO<INF>X credits, have been submitted 
to and approved by the Administrator prior to sampling.
    (7) Coke burn-off rate shall be determined using the procedures 
specified under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, unless paragraph 
(i)(6) of this section applies.
    (8) Calculate the concentration of sulfur oxides as sulfur dioxide 
using equation 8-3 in Section 6.5 of Method 8 to calculate and report 
the total concentration of sulfur oxides as sulfur dioxide 
(Cso<INF> x).
    (9) Sulfur oxides emission rate calculated as sulfur dioxide shall 
be determined for each test run by the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.003

Where:

E<INF>SOx = sulfur oxides emission rate calculated as sulfur 
dioxide, kg/hr (lb/hr)
C<INF>SOx = sulfur oxides emission concentration calculated as 
sulfur dioxide, g/dscm (gr/dscf)
Q<INF>sd = dry volumetric stack gas flow rate corrected to 
standard conditions, dscm/hr (dscf/hr)
K=1,000 g/kg (7,000 gr/lb)

    (10) Sulfur oxides emissions calculated as sulfur dioxide shall be 
determined for each test run by the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.004

Where:

R<INF>SOx = Sulfur oxides emissions calculated as kg sulfur 
dioxide per Mg (lb/ton) coke burn-off.
E<INF>SOx = Sulfur oxides emission rate calculated as sulfur 
dioxide, kg/hr (lb/hr).
R<INF>c = Coke burn-off rate, Mg/hr (ton/hr).

    (11) Calculate the 7-day average sulfur oxides emission rate as 
sulfur dioxide per Mg (ton) of coke burn-off by dividing the sum of the 
individual daily rates by the number of daily rates summed.
    (12) An owner or operator may, upon approval by the Administrator, 
use an alternative method for determining compliance with Sec. 
60.104(b)(2), as provided in Sec. 60.8(b). Any requests for approval 
must include data to demonstrate to the Administrator that the 
alternative method would produce results adequate for the determination 
of compliance.
    (j) For the purpose of determining compliance with Sec. 
60.104(b)(3), the following analytical methods and calculation 
procedures shall be used:
    (1) One fresh feed sample shall be collected once per 8-hour period.
    (2) Fresh feed samples shall be analyzed separately by using any one 
of the following applicable analytical test methods: ASTM D129-64, 78, 
or 95, ASTM D1552-83 or 95, ASTM D2622-87, 94, or 98, or ASTM D1266-87, 
91, or 98. (These methods are incorporated by reference: see Sec. 
60.17.) The applicable range of some of these ASTM methods is not 
adequate to measure the levels of sulfur in some fresh feed samples. 
Dilution of samples prior to analysis with verification of the dilution 
ratio is acceptable upon prior approval of the Administrator.
    (3) If a fresh feed sample cannot be collected at a single location, 
then the fresh feed sulfur content shall be determined as follows:
    (i) Individual samples shall be collected once per 8-hour period for 
each separate fresh feed stream charged directly into the riser or 
reactor of the fluid catalytic cracking unit. For each sample location 
the fresh feed volumetric flow rate at the time of collecting the fresh 
feed sample shall be measured and recorded. The same method for 
measuring volumetric flow rate shall be used at all locations.
    (ii) Each fresh feed sample shall be analyzed separately using the 
methods specified under paragraph (j)(2) of this section.
    (iii) Fresh feed sulfur content shall be calculated for each 8-hour 
period using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.005

where:

S<INF>f = fresh feed sulfur content expressed in percent by weight 
of fresh feed.
n = number of separate fresh feed streams charged directly to the riser 
or reactor of the fluid catalytic cracking unit.

[[Page 295]]

Q<INF>f = total volumetric flow rate of fresh feed charged to the 
fluid catalytic cracking unit.
S<INF>i = fresh feed sulfur content expressed in percent by weight 
of fresh feed for the ``ith'' sampling location.

``ith'' sampling location.

    (4) Calculate a 7-day average (arithmetic mean) sulfur content of 
the fresh feed using all of the fresh feed sulfur content values 
obtained during seven successive 24-hour periods.
    (k) The test methods used to supplement continuous monitoring system 
data to meet the minimum data requirements in Sec. 60.104(d) will be 
used as described below or as otherwise approved by the Administrator.
    (1) Methods 6, 6B, or 8 are used. The sampling location(s) are the 
same as those specified for the monitor.
    (2) For Method 6, the minimum sampling time is 20 minutes and the 
minimum sampling volume is 0.02 dscm (0.71 dscf) for each sample. 
Samples are taken at approximately 60-minute intervals. Each sample 
represents a 1-hour average. A minimum of 18 valid samples is required 
to obtain one valid day of data.
    (3) For Method 6B, collection of a sample representing a minimum of 
18 hours is required to obtain one valid day of data.
    (4) For Method 8, the procedures as outlined in this section are 
used. The equivalent of 16 hours of sampling is required to obtain one 
valid day of data.

Sec. 60.113a  Testing and procedures.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 60.8(b) compliance with the standard 
prescribed in Sec. 60.112a shall be determined as follows or in 
accordance with an equivalent procedure as provided in Sec. 60.114a.
    (1) The owner or operator of each storage vessel to which this 
subpart applies which has an external floating roof shall meet the 
following requirements:
    (i) Determine the gap areas and maximum gap widths between the 
primary seal and the tank wall and between the secondary seal and the 
tank wall according to the following frequency:
    (A) For primary seals, gap measurements shall be performed within 60 
days of the initial fill with petroleum liquid and at least once every 
five years thereafter. All primary seal inspections or gap measurements 
which require the removal or dislodging of the secondary seal shall be 
accomplished as rapidly as possible and the secondary seal shall be 
replaced as soon as possible.
    (B) For secondary seals, gap measurements shall be performed within 
60 days of the initial fill with petroleum liquid and at least once 
every year thereafter.
    (C) If any storage vessel is out of service for a period of one year 
or more, subsequent refilling with petroleum liquid shall be considered 
initial fill for the purposes of paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A) and 
(a)(1)(i)(B) of this section.
    (D) Keep records of each gap measurement at the plant for a period 
of at least 2 years following the date of measurement. Each record shall 
identify the vessel on which the measurement was performed and shall 
contain the date of the seal gap measurement, the raw data obtained in 
the measurement process required by paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section 
and the calculation required by paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (E) If either the seal gap calculated in accord with paragraph 
(a)(1)(iii) of this section or the measured maximum seal gap exceeds the 
limitations specified by Sec. 60.112a of this subpart, a report shall 
be furnished to the Administrator within 60 days of the date of 
measurements. The report shall identify the vessel and list each reason 
why the vessel did not meet the specifications of Sec. 60.112a. The 
report shall also describe the actions necessary to bring the storage 
vessel into compliance with the specifications of Sec. 60.112a.
    (ii) Determine gap widths in the primary and secondary seals 
individually by the following procedures:
    (A) Measure seal gaps, if any, at one or more floating roof levels 
when the roof is floating off the roof leg supports.
    (B) Measure seal gaps around the entire circumference of the tank in 
each place where a \1/8\<gr-thn-eq> diameter uniform probe passes freely 
(without forcing or binding against seal) between the seal and the tank 
wall and measure the circumferential distance of each such location.
    (C) The total surface area of each gap described in paragraph 
(a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section shall be determined by using probes of 
various widths to accurately measure the actual distance from the tank 
wall to the seal and multiplying each such width by its respective 
circumferential distance.
    (iii) Add the gap surface area of each gap location for the primary 
seal and the secondary seal individually. Divide

[[Page 303]]

the sum for each seal by the nominal diameter of the tank and compare 
each ratio to the appropriate ratio in the standard in Sec. 
60.112a(a)(1)(i) and Sec. 60.112a(a)(1)(ii).
    (iv) Provide the Administrator 30 days prior notice of the gap 
measurement to afford the Administrator the opportunity to have an 
observer present.
    (2) The owner or operator of each storage vessel to which this 
subpart applies which has a vapor recovery and return or disposal system 
shall provide the following information to the Administrator on or 
before the date on which construction of the storage vessel commences:
    (i) Emission data, if available, for a similar vapor recovery and 
return or disposal system used on the same type of storage vessel, which 
can be used to determine the efficiency of the system. A complete 
description of the emission measurement method used must be included.
    (ii) The manufacturer's design specifications and estimated emission 
reduction capability of the system.
    (iii) The operation and maintenance plan for the system.
    (iv) Any other information which will be useful to the Administrator 
in evaluating the effectiveness of the system in reducing VOC emissions.

Sec. 60.114a  Alternative means of emission limitation.

    (a) If, in the Administrator's judgment, an alternative means of 
emission limitation will achieve a reduction in emissions at least 
equivalent to the reduction in emissions achieved by any requirement in 
Sec. 60.112a, the Administrator will publish in the Federal Register a 
notice permitting the use of the alternative means for purposes of 
compliance with that requirement.
    (b) Any notice under paragraph (a) of this section will be published 
only after notice and an opportunity for a hearing.
    (c) Any person seeking permission under this section shall submit to 
the Administrator a written application including:
    (1) An actual emissions test that uses a full-sized or scale-model 
storage vessel that accurately collects and measures all VOC emissions 
from a given control device and that accurately simulates wind and 
accounts for other emission variables such as temperature and barometric 
pressure.
    (2) An engineering evaluation that the Administrator determines is 
an accurate method of determining equivalence.
    (d) The Administrator may condition the permission on requirements 
that may be necessary to ensure operation and maintenance to achieve the 
same emissions reduction as specified in Sec. 60.112a.
    (e) The primary vapor-mounted seal in the ``Volume-Maximizing Seal'' 
manufactured by R.F.I. Services Corporation is approved as equivalent to 
the vapor-mounted seal required by Sec. 60.112a(a)(1)(i) and must meet 
the gap criteria specified in Sec. 60.112a(a)(1)(i)(B). There shall be 
no gaps between the tank wall and any secondary seal used in conjunction 
with the primary seal in the ``Volume-Maximizing Seal''.

opening in a noncontact external floating roof shall provide a 
projection below the liquid surface. Except for automatic bleeder vents, 
rim space vents, roof drains, and leg sleeves, each opening in the roof 
is to be equipped with a gasketed cover, seal, or lid that is to be 
maintained in a closed position at all times (i.e., no visible gap) 
except when the device is in actual use. Automatic bleeder vents are to 
be closed at all times when the roof is floating except when the roof is 
being floated off or is being landed on the roof leg supports. Rim vents 
are to be set to open when the roof is being floated off the roof legs 
supports or at the manufacturer's recommended setting. Automatic bleeder 
vents and rim space vents are to be gasketed. Each emergency roof drain

tears in the seal fabric, the owner or operator shall repair the items 
or empty and remove the storage vessel from service within 45 days. If a 
failure that is detected during inspections required in this paragraph 
cannot be repaired within 45 days and if the vessel cannot be emptied 
within 45 days, a 30-day extension may be requested from the 
Administrator in the inspection report required in Sec. 60.115b(a)(3). 
Such a request for an extension must document that alternate storage 
capacity is unavailable and specify a schedule of actions the company 
will take that will assure that the control equipment will be repaired 
or the vessel will be emptied as soon as possible.
    (3) For vessels equipped with a double-seal system as specified in 
Sec. 60.112b(a)(1)(ii)(B):
    (i) Visually inspect the vessel as specified in paragraph (a)(4) of 
this section at least every 5 years; or
    (ii) Visually inspect the vessel as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section.
    (4) Visually inspect the internal floating roof, the primary seal, 
the secondary seal (if one is in service), gaskets, slotted membranes

with VOL. In no event shall inspections conducted in accordance with 
this provision occur at intervals greater than 10 years in the case of 
vessels conducting the annual visual inspection as specified in 
paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3)(ii) of this section and at intervals no 
greater than 5 years in the case of vessels specified in paragraph 
(a)(3)(i) of this section.
    (5) Notify the Administrator in writing at least 30 days prior to 
the filling or refilling of each storage vessel for which an inspection 
is required by paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(4) of this section to afford 
the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present. If the 
inspection required by paragraph (a)(4) of this section is not planned 
and the owner or operator could not have known about the inspection 30 
days in advance or refilling the tank, the owner or operator shall 
notify the Administrator at least 7 days prior to the refilling of the 
storage vessel. Notification shall be made by telephone immediately 
followed by written documentation demonstrating why the inspection was 
unplanned. Alternatively, this notification including the written 
documentation may be made in writing and sent by express mail so that it 
is received by the Administrator at least 7 days prior to the refilling.
    (b) After installing the control equipment required to meet Sec. 
60.112b(a)(2) (external floating roof), the owner or operator shall:
    (1) Determine the gap areas and maximum gap widths, between the 
primary seal and the wall of the storage vessel and between the 
secondary seal and the wall of the storage vessel according to the 
following frequency.
    (i) Measurements of gaps between the tank wall and the primary seal 
(seal gaps) shall be performed during the hydrostatic testing of the 
vessel or within 60 days of the initial fill with VOL and at least once 
every 5 years thereafter.
    (ii) Measurements of gaps between the tank wall and the secondary 
seal shall be performed within 60 days of the initial fill with VOL and 
at least once per year thereafter.
    (iii) If any source ceases to store VOL for a period of 1 year or 
more, subsequent introduction of VOL into the vessel shall be considered 
an initial fill for the purposes of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(ii) 
of this section.
    (2) Determine gap widths and areas in the primary and secondary 
seals individually by the following procedures:
    (i) Measure seal gaps, if any, at one or more floating roof levels 
when the roof is floating off the roof leg supports.
    (ii) Measure seal gaps around the entire circumference of the tank 
in each place where a 0.32-cm diameter uniform probe passes freely 
(without forcing or binding against seal) between the seal and the wall 
of the storage vessel and measure the circumferential distance of each 
such location.
    (iii) The total surface area of each gap described in paragraph 
(b)(2)(ii) of this section shall be determined by using probes of 
various widths to measure accurately the actual distance from the tank 
wall to the seal and multiplying each such width by its respective 
circumferential distance.
    (3) Add the gap surface area of each gap location for the primary 
seal and the secondary seal individually and divide the sum for each 
seal by the nominal diameter of the tank and compare each ratio to the 
respective standards in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (4) Make necessary repairs or empty the storage vessel within 45 
days of identification in any inspection for seals not meeting the 
requirements listed in (b)(4) (i) and (ii) of this section:
    (i) The accumulated area of gaps between the tank wall and the 
mechanical shoe or liquid-mounted primary seal shall not exceed 212 
Cm\2\ per meter of tank diameter, and the width of any portion of any 
gap shall not exceed 3.81 cm.
    (A) One end of the mechanical shoe is to extend into the stored 
liquid, and the other end is to extend a minimum vertical distance of 61 
cm above the stored liquid surface.
    (B) There are to be no holes, tears, or other openings in the shoe, 
seal fabric, or seal envelope.
    (ii) The secondary seal is to meet the following requirements:
    (A) The secondary seal is to be installed above the primary seal so 
that it completely covers the space between

[[Page 310]]

the roof edge and the tank wall except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (B) The accumulated area of gaps between the tank wall and the 
secondary seal shall not exceed 21.2 cm\2\ per meter of tank diameter, 
and the width of any portion of any gap shall not exceed 1.27 cm.
    (C) There are to be no holes, tears, or other openings in the seal 
or seal fabric.
    (iii) If a failure that is detected during inspections required in 
paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 60.113b(b) cannot be repaired within 45 days 
and if the vessel cannot be emptied within 45 days, a 30-day extension 
may be requested from the Administrator in the inspection report 
required in Sec. 60.115b(b)(4). Such extension request must include a 
demonstration of unavailability of alternate storage capacity and a 
specification of a schedule that will assure that the control equipment 
will be repaired or the vessel will be emptied as soon as possible.
    (5) Notify the Administrator 30 days in advance of any gap 
measurements required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section to afford the 
Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present.
    (6) Visually inspect the external floating roof, the primary seal, 
secondary seal, and fittings each time the vessel is emptied and 
degassed.
    (i) If the external floating roof has defects, the primary seal has 
holes, tears, or other openings in the seal or the seal fabric, or the 
secondary seal has holes, tears, or other openings in the seal or the 
seal fabric, the owner or operator shall repair the items as necessary 
so that none of the conditions specified in this paragraph exist before 
filling or refilling the storage vessel with VOL.
    (ii) For all the inspections required by paragraph (b)(6) of this 
section, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in writing 
at least 30 days prior to the filling or refilling of each storage 
vessel to afford the Administrator the opportunity to inspect the 
storage vessel prior to refilling. If the inspection required by 
paragraph (b)(6) of this section is not planned and the owner or 
operator could not have known about the inspection 30 days in advance of 
refilling the tank, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator 
at least 7 days prior to the refilling of the storage vessel. 
Notification shall be made by telephone immediately followed by written 
documentation demonstrating why the inspection was unplanned. 
Alternatively, this notification including the written documentation may 
be made in writing and sent by express mail so that it is received by 
the Administrator at least 7 days prior to the refilling.
    (c) The owner or operator of each source that is equipped with a 
closed vent system and control device as required in Sec. 60.112b 
(a)(3) or (b)(2) (other than a flare) is exempt from Sec. 60.8 of the 
General Provisions and shall meet the following requirements.
    (1) Submit for approval by the Administrator as an attachment to the 
notification required by Sec. 60.7(a)(1) or, if the facility is exempt 
from Sec. 60.7(a)(1), as an attachment to the notification required by 
Sec. 60.7(a)(2), an operating plan containing the information listed 
below.
    (i) Documentation demonstrating that the control device will achieve 
the required control efficiency during maximum loading conditions. This 
documentation is to include a description of the gas stream which enters 
the control device, including flow and VOC content under varying liquid 
level conditions (dynamic and static) and manufacturer's design 
specifications for the control device. If the control device or the 
closed vent capture system receives vapors, gases, or liquids other than 
fuels from sources that are not designated sources under this subpart, 
the efficiency demonstration is to include consideration of all vapors, 
gases, and liquids received by the closed vent capture system and 
control device. If an enclosed combustion device with a minimum 
residence time of 0.75 seconds and a minimum temperature of 816 [deg]C 
is used to meet the 95 percent requirement, documentation that those 
conditions will exist is sufficient to meet the requirements of this 
paragraph.
    (ii) A description of the parameter or parameters to be monitored to 
ensure that the control device will be operated in conformance with its 
design and an

[[Page 311]]

explanation of the criteria used for selection of that parameter (or 
parameters).
    (2) Operate the closed vent system and control device and monitor 
the parameters of the closed vent system and control device in 
accordance with the operating plan submitted to the Administrator in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unless the plan was

expected storage temperature based on the highest expected calendar-
month average temperature of the stored product may be used to determine 
the maximum true vapor pressure from nomographs contained in API 
Bulletin 2517 (incorporated by reference--see Sec. 60.17), unless the 
Administrator specifically requests that the liquid be sampled, the 
actual storage temperature determined, and the Reid vapor pressure 
determined from the sample(s).
    (ii) The true vapor pressure of each type of crude oil with a Reid 
vapor pressure less than 13.8 kPa or with physical properties that 
preclude determination by the recommended method is to be determined 
from available data and recorded if the estimated maximum true vapor 
pressure is greater than 3.5 kPa.
    (3) For other liquids, the vapor pressure:
    (i) May be obtained from standard reference texts, or
    (ii) Determined by ASTM D2879-83, 96, or 97 (incorporated by 
reference--see Sec. 60.17); or
    (iii) Measured by an appropriate method approved by the 
Administrator; or
    (iv) Calculated by an appropriate method approved by the 
Administrator.
    (f) The owner or operator of each vessel storing a waste mixture of 
indeterminate or variable composition shall be subject to the following 
requirements.
    (1) Prior to the initial filling of the vessel, the highest maximum 
true vapor pressure for the range of anticipated liquid compositions to 
be stored will be determined using the methods described in paragraph 
(e) of this section.
    (2) For vessels in which the vapor pressure of the anticipated 
liquid composition is above the cutoff for monitoring but below the 
cutoff for controls as defined in Sec. 60.112b(a), an initial physical 
test of the vapor pressure is required; and a physical test at least 
once every 6 months thereafter is required as determined by the 
following methods:
    (i) ASTM D2879-83, 96, or 97 (incorporated by reference--see Sec. 
60.17); or
    (ii) ASTM D323-82 or 94 (incorporated by reference--see Sec. 
60.17); or
    (iii) As measured by an appropriate method as approved by the 
Administrator.
    (g) The owner or operator of each vessel equipped with a closed vent 
system and control device meeting the specification of Sec. 60.112b or 
with emissions reductions equipment as specified in 40 CFR 65.42(b)(4), 
(b)(5), (b)(6), or (c) is exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (c)

    Basic oxygen process furnace (BOPF) means any furnace with a 
refractory lining in which molten steel is produced by charging scrap 
metal, molten iron, and flux materials or alloy additions into a vessel 
and by introducing a high volume of oxygen-rich gas. Open hearth, blast, 
and reverberatory furnaces are not included in this definition.
    Bottom-blown furnace means any BOPF in which oxygen and other 
combustion gases are introduced to the bath of molten iron through 
tuyeres in the bottom of the vessel or through tuyeres in the bottom and 
sides of the vessel.
    Fume suppression system means the equipment comprising any system

ladle. This includes the transfer of molten iron from the torpedo car or 
hot metal car to a mixer (or other intermediate vessel) and from a mixer 
(or other intermediate vessel) to the ladle. This facility is also known 
as the reladling station or ladle transfer station.
    Primary emission control system means the combination of equipment 
used for the capture and collection of primary emissions (e.g., an open 
hood capture system used in conjunction with a particulate matter 
cleaning device such as an electrostatic precipitator or a closed hood 
capture system used in conjunction with a particulate matter cleaning

generated during the steel production cycle which are captured by, and 
do not thereafter escape from, the BOPF primary control system.
    Primary oxygen blow means the period in the steel production cycle 
of a BOPF during which a high volume of oxygen-rich gas is introduced to 
the bath of molten iron by means of a lance inserted from the top of the 
vessel. This definition does not include any additional, or secondary, 
oxygen blows made after the primary blow.
    Secondary emission control system means the combination of equipment 
used for the capture and collection of secondary emissions (e.g.,
    (1) An open hood system for the capture and collection of primary 
and secondary emissions from the BOPF, with local hooding ducted to a

capture and collection of emissions from hot metal transfer and skimming 
stations).
    Secondary emissions means particulate matter emissions that are not 
captured by the BOPF primary control system, including emissions from 
hot metal transfer and skimming stations. This definition also includes 
particulate matter emissions that escape from openings in the primary 
emission control system, such as from lance hole openings, gaps or tears 
in the ductwork of the primary emission control system, or leaks in 
hoods.
    Skimming station means the facility where slag is mechanically raked

Sec. 60.144a  Test methods and procedures.

    (a) In conducting the performance tests required in Sec. 60.8, the 
owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test 
methods in Appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as 
specified in this section, except as provided in Sec. 60.8(b).
    (b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
particulate matter standards in Sec. 60.142a as follows:
    (1) Start and end times of each steel production cycle during each 
run shall be recorded (see Sec. 60.145a (c) and (d) for the definitions 
of start and end times of a cycle).
    (2) Method 5 shall be used to determine the particulate matter 
concentration. Sampling shall be conducted only during the steel 
production cycle and for a sufficient number of steel production cycles 
to obtain a total sample volume of at least 5.67 dscm (200 dscf) for 
each run.
    (3) Method 9 and the procedures of Sec. 60.11 shall be used to 
determine opacity, except sections 2.4 and 2.5 of Method 9 shall be 
replaced with the following instructions for recording observations and 
reducing data:
    (i) Section 2.4. Opacity observations shall be recorded to the 
nearest 5 percent at 15-second intervals. During the initial performance 
test conducted pursuant to Sec. 60.8, observations shall be made and 
recorded in this manner for a minimum of three steel production cycles. 
During any subsequent compliance test, observations may be made for any 
number of steel production cycles, although, where conditions permit, 
observations will generally be made for a minimum of three steel 
production cycles.
    (ii) Section 2.5. Opacity shall be determined as an average of 12 
consecutive observations recorded at 15-second intervals. For each steel 
production cycle, divide the observations recorded into sets of 12 
consecutive observations. Sets need not be consecutive in time, and in 
no case shall two sets overlap. For each set of 12 observations, 
calculate the average by summing the opacity of 12 consecutive 
observations and dividing this sum by 12.

[[Page 321]]

    (c) In complying with the requirements of Sec. 60.143a(c), the 
owner or operator shall conduct an initial test as follows:
    (1) For devices that monitor and record the exhaust ventilation 
rate, compare velocity readings recorded by the monitoring device 
against the velocity readings obtained by Method 2. Take Method 2 
readings at a point or points that would properly characterize the 
monitoring device's performance and that would adequately reflect the 
various rates of exhaust ventilation. Obtain readings at sufficient 
intervals to obtain 12 pairs of readings for each duct of the secondary 
emission capture system. Compare the averages of the two sets to 
determine whether the monitoring device velocity is within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>10 percent of the Method 2 average.
    (2) For devices that monitor the level of exhaust ventilation and 
record only step changes when a set point rate is reached, compare step 
changes recorded by the monitoring device against the velocity readings 
obtained by Method 2. Take Method 2 readings at a point or points that 
would properly characterize the performance of the monitoring device and 
that would adequately reflect the various rates of exhaust ventilation. 
Obtain readings at sufficient intervals to obtain 12 pairs of readings 
for each duct of the secondary emission capture system. Compare the 
averages of the two sets to determine whether the monitoring device step 
change is within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>10 percent of the setpoint rate.
    (d) To comply with Sec. 60.143a(d) or (e), the owner or operator 
shall use the monitoring device of Sec. 60.143a(a) to determine the 
exhaust ventilation rates or levels during the particulate matter runs. 
Each owner or operator shall then use these rates or levels to determine 
the 3-hour averages required by Sec. 60.143a(d) and (e).

<R05>
Sec. 60.145a  Compliance provisions.

    (a) When determining compliance with mass and visible emission 
limits specified in Sec. 60.142a(a) (2) and (3), the owner or operator 
of a BOPF shop that normally operates two furnaces with overlapping 
cycles may elect to operate only one furnace. If an owner or operator 
chooses to shut down one furnace, he shall be allowed a reasonable time 
period to adjust his production schedule before the compliance tests are 
conducted. The owner or operator of an affected facility may also elect 
to suspend shop operations not subject to this subpart during compliance 
testing.
    (b) During compliance testing for mass and visible emission 
standards, if an owner or operator elects to shut down one furnace in a 
shop that normally operates two furnaces with overlapping cycles, the 
owner or operator shall operate the secondary emission control system 
for the furnace being tested at exhaust ventilation rates or levels for 
each duct of the secondary emission control system that are appropriate 
for single-furnace operation. Following the compliance test, the owner 
or operator shall operate the secondary emission control system at 
exhaust ventilation rates or levels for each duct of the system that are 
no lower than 90 percent of the exhaust ventilation values established 
during the most recent compliance test.
    (c) For the purpose of determining compliance with visible and mass 
emission standards, a steel production cycle begins when the scrap or 
hot metal is charged to the vessel (whichever operation occurs first) 
and terminates 3 minutes after slag is emptied from the vessel into the 
slag pot. Consecutive steel production cycles are not required for the 
purpose of determining compliance. Where a hot metal transfer or 
skimming station is an affected facility, the steel production cycle 
also includes the hot metal transfer or skimming operation for the next 
steel production cycle for the affected vessel. Visible emission 
observations for both hot metal transfer and skimming operations begin 
with the start of the operation and terminate 3 minutes after completion 
of the operation.
    (d) For the purpose of determining compliance with visible emission 
standards specified in Sec. 60.142a(a) (1) and (3), the starting and 
stopping times of regulated process operations shall be determined and 
the starting and stopping times of visible emissions data sets shall be 
determined accordingly.

[[Page 322]]

    (e) To determine compliance with Sec. 60.142a(a)(1), select the 
data sets yielding the highest and second highest 3-minute average 
opacities for each steel production cycle. Compliance is achieved if the 
highest 3-minute average for each cycle observed is less than 20 percent 
and the second highest 3-minute average is 10 percent or less.
    (f) To determine compliance with Sec. 60.142(a)(2), determine the 
concentration of particulate matter in exhaust gases exiting the 
secondary emission collection device with Method 5. Compliance is

continuously record the furnace power input. The furnace power input may 
be measured at the output or input side of the transformer. The device 
must have an accuracy of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent over its 
operating range.
    (c) The owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart 
shall install, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring device that 
continuously measures and records the volumetric flow rate through each 
separately ducted hood of the capture system, except as provided under 
paragraph (e) of this section. The owner or operator of an electric 
submerged arc furnace that is equipped with a water cooled cover which 
is designed to contain and prevent escape of the generated gas and 
particulate matter shall monitor only the volumetric flow rate through 
the capture system for control of emissions from the tapping station. 
The owner or operator may install the monitoring device(s) in any 
appropriate location in the exhaust duct such that reproducible flow 
rate monitoring will result. The flow rate monitoring device must have 
an accuracy of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>10 percent over its normal 
operating range and must be calibrated according to the manufacturer's 
instructions. The Administrator may require the owner or operator to 
demonstrate the accuracy of the monitoring device relative to Methods 1

    (d) When performance tests are conducted under the provisions of 
Sec. 60.8 of this part to demonstrate compliance with the standards 
under Sec. Sec. 60.262(a) (4) and (5), the volumetric flow rate through 
each separately ducted hood of the capture system must be determined 
using the monitoring device required under paragraph (c) of this 
section. The volumetric flow rates must be determined for furnace power 
input levels at 50 and 100 percent of the nominal rated capacity of the 
electric submerged arc furnace. At all times the electric submerged arc 
furnace is operated, the owner or operator shall maintain the volumetric 
flow rate at or above the appropriate levels for that furnace power 
input level determined during the most recent performance test. If 
emissions due to tapping are captured and ducted separately from 
emissions of the electric submerged arc furnace, during each tapping 
period the owner or operator shall maintain the exhaust flow rates 
through the capture system over the tapping station at or above the 
levels established during the most recent performance test. Operation at 
lower flow rates may be considered by the Administrator to be 
unacceptable operation and maintenance of the affected facility. The 
owner or operator may request that these flow rates be reestablished by 
conducting new performance tests under Sec. 60.8 of this part.
    (e) The owner or operator may as an alternative to paragraph (c) of 
this section determine the volumetric flow rate through each fan of the 
capture system from the fan power consumption, pressure drop across the 
fan and the fan performance curve. Only data specific to the operation 
of the affected electric submerged arc furnace are acceptable for 
demonstration of compliance with the requirements of this paragraph. The 
owner or operator shall maintain on file a permanent record of the fan 
performance curve (prepared for a specific temperature) and shall:
    (1) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a device to 
continuously measure and record the power consumption of the fan motor 
(measured in kilowatts), and
    (2) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a device to 
continuously measure and record the pressure drop across

[[Page 347]]

the fan. The fan power consumption and pressure drop measurements must 
be synchronized to allow real time comparisions of the data. The 
monitoring devices must have an accuracy of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 
percent over their normal operating ranges.
    (f) The volumetric flow rate through each fan of the capture system 
must be determined from the fan power consumption, fan pressure drop, 
and fan performance curve specified under paragraph (e) of this section, 
during any performance test required under Sec. 60.8 to demonstrate 
compliance with the standards under Sec. Sec. 60.262(a)(4) and (5). The 
owner or operator shall determine the volumetric flow rate at a 
representative temperature for furnace power input levels of 50 and 100 
percent of the nominal rated capacity of the electric submerged arc 
furnace. At all times the electric submerged arc furnace is operated, 
the owner or operator shall maintain the fan power consumption and fan 
pressure drop at levels such that the volumetric flow rate is at or 
above the levels established during the most recent performance test for 
that furnace power input level. If emissions due to tapping are captured 
and ducted separately from emissions of the electric submerged arc 
furnace, during each tapping period the owner or operator shall maintain 
the fan power consumption and fan pressure drop at levels such that the 
volumetric flow rate is at or above the levels established during the 
most recent performance test. Operation at lower flow rates may be 
considered by the Administrator to be unacceptable operation and 
maintenance of the affected facility. The owner or operator may request 
that these flow rates be reestablished by conducting new performance 
tests under Sec. 60.8. The Administrator may require the owner or 
operator to verify the fan performance curve by monitoring necessary fan 
operating parameters and determining the gas volume moved relative to 
Methods 1 and 2 of appendix A to this part.
    (g) All monitoring devices required under paragraphs (c) and (e) of 
this section are to be checked for calibration annually in accordance 
with the procedures under Sec. 60.13(b).

Sec. 60.272  Standard for particulate matter.

    (a) On and after the date on which the performance test required to 
be conducted by Sec. 60.8 is completed, no owner or operator subject to 
the provisions of this subpart shall cause to be discharged into the 
atmosphere from an electric arc furnace any gases which:
    (1) Exit from a control device and contain particulate matter in 
excess of 12 mg/dscm (0.0052 gr/dscf).
    (2) Exit from a control device and exhibit three percent opacity or

Sec. 60.273  Emission monitoring.

    (a) A continuous monitoring system for the measurement of the 
opacity of emissions discharged into the atmosphere from the control 
device(s) shall be installed, calibrated, maintained, and operated by 
the owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart.
    (b) For the purpose of reports under Sec. 60.7(c), all six-minute 
periods during which the average opacity is three percent or greater 
shall indicate a period of excess emission, and shall be reported to the 
Administrator semi-annually.
    (c) A continuous monitoring system for the measurement of the 
opacity of emissions discharged into the atmosphere from the control 
device(s) is not

[[Page 350]]

required on any modular, multi-stack, negative-pressure or positive-
pressure fabric filter if observations of the opacity of the visible 
emissions from the control device are performed by a certified visible 
emission observer; or on any single-stack fabric filter if visible 
emissions from the control device are performed by a certified visible 
emission observer and the owner installs and continuously operates a bag 
leak detection system according to paragraph (e) of this section. 
Visible emission observations shall be conducted at least once per day 
for at least three 6-minute periods when the furnace is operating in the 
melting and refining period. All visible emissions observations shall be 
conducted in accordance with Method 9 of appendix A to this part. If 
visible emissions occur from more than one point, the opacity shall be 
recorded for any points where visible emissions are observed. Where it 
is possible to determine that a number of visible emission sites relate 
to only one incident of the visible emission, only one set of three 6-
minute observations will be required. In that case, the Method 9 
observations must be made for the site of highest opacity that directly 
relates to the cause (or location) of visible emissions observed during 
a single incident. Records shall be maintained of any 6-minute average 
that is in excess of the emission limit specified in Sec. 60.272(a).
    (d) A furnace static pressure monitoring device is not required on 
any EAF equipped with a DEC system if observations of shop opacity are 
performed by a certified visible emission observer as follows: Shop 
opacity observations shall be conducted at least once per day when the 
furnace is operating in the meltdown and refining period. Shop opacity 
shall be determined as the arithmetic average of 24 or more consecutive 
15-second opacity observations of emissions from the shop taken in 
accordance with Method 9. Shop opacity shall be recorded for any 
point(s) where visible emissions are observed in proximity to an 
affected EAF. Where it is possible to determine that a number of visible 
emission sites relate to only one incident of visible emissions, only 
one observation of shop opacity will be required. In this case, the shop 
opacity observations must be made for the site of highest opacity that 
directly relates to the cause (or location) of visible emissions 
observed during a single incident.
    (e) A bag leak detection system must be installed and continuously 
operated on all single-stack fabric filters if the owner or operator 
elects not to install and operate a continuous opacity monitoring system 
as provided for under paragraph (c) of this section. In addition, the 
owner or operator shall meet the visible emissions observation 
requirements in paragraph (c) of this section. The bag leak detection 
system must meet the specifications and requirements of paragraphs 
(e)(1) through (8) of this section.
    (1) The bag leak detection system must be certified by the 
manufacturer to be capable of detecting particulate matter emissions at 
concentrations of 1 milligram per actual cubic meter (0.00044 grains per 
actual cubic foot) or less.
    (2) The bag leak detection system sensor must provide output of 
relative particulate matter loadings and the owner or operator shall 
continuously record the output from the bag leak detection system using 
electronic or other means (e.g., using a strip chart recorder or a data 
logger.)
    (3) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an alarm 
system that will sound when an increase in relative particulate loading 
is detected over the alarm set point established according to paragraph 
(e)(4) of this section, and the alarm must be located such that it can 
be heard by the appropriate plant personnel.
    (4) For each bag leak detection system required by paragraph (e) of 
this section, the owner or operator shall develop and submit to the 
Administrator or delegated authority, for approval, a site-specific 
monitoring plan that addresses the items identified in paragraphs (i) 
through (v) of this paragraph (e)(4). For each bag leak detection system 
that operates based on the triboelectric effect, the monitoring plan 
shall be consistent with the recommendations contained in the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency guidance document ``Fabric Filter Bag 
Leak Detection Guidance'' (EPA-454/R-

[[Page 351]]

98-015). The owner or operator shall operate and maintain the bag leak 
detection system according to the site-specific monitoring plan at all 
times. The plan shall describe:
    (i) Installation of the bag leak detection system;
    (ii) Initial and periodic adjustment of the bag leak detection 
system including how the alarm set-point will be established;
    (iii) Operation of the bag leak detection system including quality 
assurance procedures;
    (iv) How the bag leak detection system will be maintained including 
a routine maintenance schedule and spare parts inventory list; and
    (v) How the bag leak detection system output shall be recorded and 
stored.
    (5) The initial adjustment of the system shall, at a minimum, 
consist of establishing the baseline output by adjusting the sensitivity 
(range) and the averaging period of the device, and establishing the 
alarm set points and the alarm delay time (if applicable).
    (6) Following initial adjustment, the owner or operator shall not 
adjust the averaging period, alarm set point, or alarm delay time 
without approval from the Administrator or delegated authority except as 
provided for in paragraphs (e)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (i) Once per quarter, the owner or operator may adjust the 
sensitivity of the bag leak detection system to account for seasonal 
effects including temperature and humidity according to the procedures 
identified in the site-specific monitoring plan required under 
paragraphs (e)(4) of this section.
    (ii) If opacities greater than zero percent are observed over four 
consecutive 15-second observations during the daily opacity observations 
required under paragraph (c) of this section and the alarm on the bag 
leak detection system does not sound, the owner or operator shall lower 
the alarm set point on the bag leak detection system to a point where 
the alarm would have sounded during the period when the opacity 
observations were made.
    (7) For negative pressure, induced air baghouses, and positive 
pressure baghouses that are discharged to the atmosphere through a 
stack, the bag leak detection sensor must be installed downstream of the 
baghouse and upstream of any wet scrubber.
    (8) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's 
instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.
    (f) For each bag leak detection system installed according to 
paragraph (e) of this section, the owner or operator shall initiate 
procedures to determine the cause of all alarms within 1 hour of an 
alarm. Except as provided for in paragraph (g) of this section, the 
cause of the alarm must be alleviated within 3 hours of the time the 
alarm occurred by taking whatever corrective action(s) are necessary. 
Corrective actions may include, but are not limited to the following:
    (1) Inspecting the baghouse for air leaks, torn or broken bags or 
filter media, or any other condition that may cause an increase in 
particulate emissions;
    (2) Sealing off defective bags or filter media;
    (3) Replacing defective bags or filter media or otherwise repairing 
the control device;
    (4) Sealing off a defective baghouse compartment;
    (5) Cleaning the bag leak detection system probe or otherwise 
repairing the bag leak detection system; or
    (6) Shutting down the process producing the particulate emissions.
    (g) In approving the site-specific monitoring plan required in 
paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the Administrator or delegated 
authority may allow owners or operators more than 3 hours to alleviate 
specific conditions that cause an alarm if the owner or operator 
identifies the condition that could lead to an alarm in the monitoring 
plan, adequately explains why it is not feasible to alleviate the 
condition within 3 hours of the time the alarm occurred, and 
demonstrates that the requested additional time will ensure alleviation 
of the condition as expeditiously as practicable.

Sec. 60.274  Monitoring of operations.

    (a) The owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart 
shall maintain records daily of the following information:
    (1) Time and duration of each charge;
    (2) Time and duration of each tap;
    (3) All flow rate data obtained under paragraph (b) of this section, 
or equivalent obtained under paragraph (d) of this section; and
    (4) All pressure data obtained under paragraph (f) of this section.
    (b) Except as provided under paragraph (d) of this section, the 
owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall check 
and record on a once-per-shift basis furnace static pressure (if a DEC 
system is in use, and a furnace static pressure gauge is installed 
according to paragraph (f) of this section) and either: check and record 
the control system fan motor amperes and damper positions on a once-per-
shift basis; install, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring device that 
continuously records the volumetric flow rate through each separately 
ducted hood; or install, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring device 
that continuously records the volumetric flow rate at the control device 
inlet and check and record damper positions on a once-per-shift basis. 
The monitoring device(s) may be installed in any appropriate location in 
the exhaust duct such that reproducible flow rate monitoring will 
result. The flow rate monitoring device(s) shall have an accuracy of 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>10 percent over its normal operating range and 
shall be calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 
Administrator may require the owner or operator to demonstrate the 
accuracy of the monitoring device(s) relative to Methods 1 and 2 of 
appendix A of this part.
    (c) When the owner or operator of an affected facility is required 
to demonstrate compliance with the standards under Sec. 60.272(a)(3) 
and at any other time that the Administrator may require (under section 
114 of the CAA, as amended) either: the control system fan motor amperes 
and all damper positions, the volumetric flow rate through each 
separately ducted hood, or the volumetric flow rate at the control 
device inlet and all damper positions shall be determined during all 
periods in which a hood is operated for the purpose of capturing 
emissions from the affected facility subject to paragraph (b) of this 
section. The owner or operator may petition the Administrator for 
reestablishment of these parameters whenever the owner or operator can 
demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that the EAF operating 
conditions upon which the parameters were previously established are no 
longer applicable. The values of these parameters as determined during 
the most recent demonstration of compliance shall be maintained at the 
appropriate level for each applicable period. Operation at other than 
baseline values may be subject to the requirements of Sec. 60.276(a).
    (d) The owner or operator may petition the Administrator to approve 
any alternative method that will provide a continuous record of 
operation of each emission capture system.
    (e) The owner or operator shall perform monthly operational status 
inspections of the equipment that is important to the performance of the 
total capture system (i.e., pressure sensors, dampers, and damper 
switches). This inspection shall include observations of the physical 
appearance of the equipment (e.g., presence of hole in ductwork or 
hoods, flow constrictions caused by dents or accumulated dust in 
ductwork, and fan erosion). Any deficiencies shall be noted and proper 
maintenance performed.
    (f) Except as provided for under Sec. 60.273(d), where emissions 
during any phase of the heat time are controlled by use of a direct 
shell evacuation system, the owner or operator shall install, calibrate, 
and maintain a monitoring device that continuously records the pressure 
in the free space inside the EAF. The pressure shall be recorded as 15-
minute integrated averages. The monitoring device may be installed in 
any appropriate location in the EAF or DEC duct prior to the 
introduction of ambient air such that reproducible results will be 
obtained. The pressure monitoring device shall have an accuracy of 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>5 mm of water gauge over its normal operating 
range and shall be calibrated according to the manufacturer's 
instructions.

[[Page 353]]

    (g) Except as provided for under Sec. 60.273(d), when the owner or 
operator of an EAF is required to demonstrate compliance with the 
standard under Sec. 60.272(a)(3) and at any other time the 
Administrator may require (under section 114 of the Act, as amended), 
the pressure in the free space inside the furnace shall be determined 
during the meltdown and refining period(s) using the monitoring device 
under paragraph (f) of this section. The owner or operator may petition 
the Administrator for reestablishment of the 15-minute integrated 
average pressure whenever the owner or operator can demonstrate to the 
Administrator's satisfaction that the EAF operating conditions upon 
which the pressures were previously established are no longer 
applicable. The pressure determined during the most recent demonstration 
of compliance shall be maintained at all times the EAF is operating in a 
meltdown and refining period. Operation at higher pressures may be 
considered by the Administrator to be unacceptable operation and 
maintenance of the affected facility.
    (h) Where the capture system is designed and operated such that all 
emissions are captured and ducted to a control device, the owner or 
operator shall not be subject to the requirements of this section.
    (i) During any performance test required under Sec. 60.8, and for 
any report thereof required by Sec. 60.276(c) of this subpart or to 
determine compliance with Sec. 60.272(a)(3) of this subpart, the owner 
or operator shall monitor the following information for all heats 
covered by the test:
    (1) Charge weights and materials, and tap weights and materials;
    (2) Heat times, including start and stop times, and a log of process 
operation, including periods of no operation during testing and the 
pressure inside the furnace where direct-shell evacuation systems are 
used;
    (3) Control device operation log; and
    (4) Continuous opacity monitor or Method 9 data.

emissions.
    (b) When emissions from any EAF(s) are combined with emissions from 
facilities not subject to the provisions of this subpart but controlled 
by a common capture system and control device, the owner or operator 
shall use either or both of the following procedures during a 
performance test (see also Sec. 60.276(b)):

owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test 
methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as 
specified in this section, except as provided in Sec. 60.8(b).
    (e) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
particulate matter standards in Sec. 60.272 as follows:
    (1) Method 5 shall be used for negative-pressure fabric filters and 
other types of control devices and Method 5D shall be used for positive-
pressure fabric filters to determine the particular matter concentration 
and, if applicable, the volumetric flow rate of the effluent gas. The 
sampling time and sample volume for each run shall be at least 4 hours 
and 4.5 dscm (160 dscf) and, when a single EAF is sampled, the

[[Page 354]]

sampling time shall include an integral number of heats.
    (2) When more than one control device serves the EAF(s) being 
tested, the concentration of particulate matter shall be determined 
using the following equation:

particulate matter test runs, unless inclement weather interferes.
    (f) To comply with Sec. 60.274 (c), (f), (g), and (i), the owner or 
operator shall obtain the information in these paragraphs during the 
particulate matter runs.
    (g) Where emissions from any EAF(s) are combined with emissions from 
facilities not subject to the provisions of this subpart but controlled 
by a common capture system and control device, the owner or operator may 
use any of the following procedures during a performance test:
    (1) Base compliance on control of the combined emissions.
    (2) Utilize a method acceptable to the Administrator which 
compensates for the emissions from the facilities not subject to the 
provisions of this subpart.
    (3) Any combination of the criteria of paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) 
of this section.
    (h) Where emissions from any EAF(s) are combined with emissions from

continuous opacity monitoring system, as allowed for by Sec. 60.273(c), 
visible emission observations shall be conducted at least once per day 
for at least three 6-minute periods when the furnace is operating in the 
melting and refining period. All visible emissions observations shall be 
conducted in accordance with Method 9. If visible emissions occur from 
more than one point, the opacity shall be recorded for any points where 
visible emissions are observed. Where it is possible to determine that a 
number of visible emission sites relate to only one incident of the 
visible emission, only one set of three 6-minute observations will be 
required. In that case, the Method 9 observations must be made for the 
site of highest opacity that directly relates to the cause (or location) 
of visible emissions observed during a single incident. Records shall be 
maintained of any 6-minute average that is in excess of the emission 
limit specified in Sec. 60.272(a).
    (j) Unless the presence of inclement weather makes concurrent 
testing infeasible, the owner or operator shall conduct concurrently the 
performance tests required under Sec. 60.8 to demonstrate compliance 
with Sec. 60.272(a) (1), (2), and (3) of this subpart.

Sec. 60.272a  Standard for particulate matter.

    (a) On and after the date of which the performance test required to 
be conducted by Sec. 60.8 is completed, no owner or operator subject to 
the provisions of this subpart shall cause to be discharged into the 
atmosphere from an EAF or an AOD vessel any gases which:
    (1) Exit from a control device and contain particulate matter in 
excess of 12 mg/dscm (0.0052 gr/dscf);
    (2) Exit from a control device and exhibit 3 percent opacity or 
greater; and
    (3) Exit from a shop and, due solely to the operations of any 
affected EAF(s) or AOD vessel(s), exhibit 6 percent opacity or greater.
    (b) On and after the date on which the performance test required to 
be conducted by Sec. 60.8 is completed, no owner or operator subject to 
the provisions of this subpart shall cause to be discharged into the 
atmosphere from the dust-handling system any gases that exhibit 10 
percent opacity or greater.


<R05>
Sec. 60.273a  Emission monitoring.

    (a) Except as provided under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, 
a continuous monitoring system for the measurement of the opacity of 
emissions discharged into the atmosphere from the control device(s) 
shall be installed, calibrated, maintained, and operated by the owner or 
operator subject to the provisions of this subpart.
    (b) No continuous monitoring system shall be required on any control 
device serving the dust-handling system.
    (c) A continuous monitoring system for the measurement of the 
opacity of emissions discharged into the atmosphere from the control 
device(s) is not required on any modular, multi-stack, negative-pressure 
or positive-pressure fabric filter if observations of the opacity of the 
visible emissions from the control device are performed by a certified 
visible emission observer; or on any single-stack fabric filter if 
visible emissions from the control device are performed by a certified 
visible emission observer and the owner installs and continuously 
operates a bag leak detection system according to paragraph (e) of this 
section. Visible emission observations shall be conducted at least once 
per day for at least three 6-minute periods when the furnace is 
operating in the melting and refining period. All visible emissions 
observations shall be conducted in accordance with Method 9. If visible 
emissions occur from more than one point, the opacity shall be recorded 
for any points where visible emissions are observed. Where it is 
possible to determine that a number of visible emission sites relate to 
only one incident of the visible emission, only one set of three 6-
minute observations will be required. In that case, the Method 9 
observations must be made for the site of highest opacity that directly 
relates to the cause (or location) of visible emissions observed during 
a single incident. Records shall be maintained of any 6-minute average 
that is in excess of the emission limit specified in Sec. 60.272a(a).
    (d) A furnace static pressure monitoring device is not required on 
any EAF equipped with a DEC system if observations of shop opacity are 
performed by a certified visible emission observer as follows: Shop 
opacity observations shall be conducted at least once per day when the 
furnace is operating in the meltdown and refining period. Shop opacity 
shall be determined as the arithmetic average of 24 consecutive 15-
second opacity observations of emissions from the shop taken in 
accordance with Method 9. Shop opacity shall be recorded for any 
point(s) where visible emissions are observed. Where

[[Page 358]]

it is possible to determine that a number of visible emission sites 
relate to only one incident of visible emissions, only one observation 
of shop opacity will be required. In this case, the shop opacity 
observations must be made for the site of highest opacity that directly 
relates to the cause (or location) of visible emissions observed during 
a single incident.
    (e) A bag leak detection system must be installed and continuously 
operated on all single-stack fabric filters if the owner or operator 
elects not to install and operate a continuous opacity monitoring system 
as provided for under paragraph (c) of this section. In addition, the 
owner or operator shall meet the visible emissions observation 
requirements in paragraph (c) of this section. The bag leak detection 
system must meet the specifications and requirements of paragraphs 
(e)(1) through (8) of this section.
    (1) The bag leak detection system must be certified by the 
manufacturer to be capable of detecting particulate matter emissions at 
concentrations of 1 milligram per actual cubic meter (0.00044 grains per 
actual cubic foot) or less.
    (2) The bag leak detection system sensor must provide output of 
relative particulate matter loadings and the owner or operator shall 
continuously record the output from the bag leak detection system using 
electronic or other means (e.g., using a strip chart recorder or a data 
logger.)
    (3) The bag leak detection system must be equipped with an alarm 
system that will sound when an increase in relative particulate loading 
is detected over the alarm set point established according to paragraph 
(e)(4) of this section, and the alarm must be located such that it can 
be heard by the appropriate plant personnel.
    (4) For each bag leak detection system required by paragraph (e) of 
this section, the owner or operator shall develop and submit to the 
Administrator or delegated authority, for approval, a site-specific 
monitoring plan that addresses the items identified in paragraphs (i) 
through (v) of this paragraph (e)(4). For each bag leak detection system 
that operates based on the triboelectric effect, the monitoring plan 
shall be consistent with the recommendations contained in the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency guidance document ``Fabric Filter Bag 
Leak Detection Guidance'' (EPA-454/R-98-015). The owner or operator 
shall operate and maintain the bag leak detection system according to 
the site-specific monitoring plan at all times. The plan shall describe 
the following:
    (i) Installation of the bag leak detection system;
    (ii) Initial and periodic adjustment of the bag leak detection 
system including how the alarm set-point will be established;
    (iii) Operation of the bag leak detection system including quality 
assurance procedures;
    (iv) How the bag leak detection system will be maintained including 
a routine maintenance schedule and spare parts inventory list; and
    (v) How the bag leak detection system output shall be recorded and 
stored.
    (5) The initial adjustment of the system shall, at a minimum, 
consist of establishing the baseline output by adjusting the sensitivity 
(range) and the averaging period of the device, and establishing the 
alarm set points and the alarm delay time (if applicable).
    (6) Following initial adjustment, the owner or operator shall not 
adjust the averaging period, alarm set point, or alarm delay time 
without approval from the Administrator or delegated authority except as 
provided for in paragraphs (e)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (i) Once per quarter, the owner or operator may adjust the 
sensitivity of the bag leak detection system to account for seasonal 
effects including temperature and humidity according to the procedures 
identified in the site-specific monitoring plan required under 
paragraphs (e)(4) of this section.
    (ii) If opacities greater than zero percent are observed over four 
consecutive 15-second observations during the daily opacity observations 
required under paragraph (c) of this section and the alarm on the bag 
leak detection system does not sound, the owner or operator shall lower 
the alarm set point on the bag leak detection system to a point where 
the alarm would have sounded

[[Page 359]]

during the period when the opacity observations were made.
    (7) For negative pressure, induced air baghouses, and positive 
pressure baghouses that are discharged to the atmosphere through a 
stack, the bag leak detection sensor must be installed downstream of the 
baghouse and upstream of any wet scrubber.
    (8) Where multiple detectors are required, the system's 
instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.
    (f) For each bag leak detection system installed according to 
paragraph (e) of this section, the owner or operator shall initiate 
procedures to determine the cause of all alarms within 1 hour of an 
alarm. Except as provided for under paragraph (g) of this section, the 
cause of the alarm must be alleviated within 3 hours of the time the 
alarm occurred by taking whatever corrective action(s) are necessary. 
Corrective actions may include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (1) Inspecting the baghouse for air leaks, torn or broken bags or 
filter media, or any other condition that may cause an increase in 
particulate emissions;
    (2) Sealing off defective bags or filter media;
    (3) Replacing defective bags or filter media or otherwise repairing 
the control device;
    (4) Sealing off a defective baghouse compartment;
    (5) Cleaning the bag leak detection system probe or otherwise 
repairing the bag leak detection system; and
    (6) Shutting down the process producing the particulate emissions.
    (g) In approving the site-specific monitoring plan required in 
paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the Administrator or delegated 
authority may allow owners or operators more than 3 hours to alleviate 
specific conditions that cause an alarm if the owner or operator 
identifies the condition that could lead to an alarm in the monitoring 
plan, adequately explains why it is not feasible to alleviate the 
condition within 3 hours of the time the alarm occurred, and 
demonstrates that the requested additional time will ensure alleviation 
of the condition as expeditiously as practicable.

    (a) The owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart 
shall maintain records of the following information:
    (1) All data obtained under paragraph (b) of this section; and
    (2) All monthly operational status inspections performed under 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) Except as provided under paragraph (e) of this section, the 
owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall check 
and record on a once-per-shift basis the furnace static pressure (if DEC 
system is in use, and a furnace static pressure gauge is installed 
according to paragraph (f) of this section) and either: check and record 
the control system fan motor amperes and damper position on a once-per-
shift basis; install, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring device that 
continuously records the volumetric flow rate through each separately 
ducted hood; or install, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring device 
that continuously records the volumetric flow rate at the control device 
inlet and check and record damper positions on a once-per-shift basis. 
The monitoring device(s) may be installed in any appropriate location in 
the exhaust duct such that reproducible flow rate monitoring will 
result. The flow rate monitoring device(s) shall have an accuracy of 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>10 percent over its normal operating range and 
shall be calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 
Administrator may require the owner or operator to demonstrate the 
accuracy of the monitoring device(s) relative to Methods 1 and 2 of 
appendix A of this part.
    (c) When the owner or operator of an affected facility is required 
to demonstrate compliance with the standards under Sec. 60.272a(a)(3) 
and at any other time that the Administrator may require (under section 
114 of the CAA, as amended) either: the control system fan motor amperes 
and all damper positions, the volumetric flow rate through

[[Page 360]]

each separately ducted hood, or the volumetric flow rate at the control 
device inlet and all damper positions shall be determined during all 
periods in which a hood is operated for the purpose of capturing 
emissions from the affected facility subject to paragraph (b) of this 
section. The owner or operator may petition the Administrator for 
reestablishment of these parameters whenever the owner or operator can 
demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that the affected 
facility operating conditions upon which the parameters were previously 
established are no longer applicable. The values of these parameters as 
determined during the most recent demonstration of compliance shall be 
maintained at the appropriate level for each applicable period. 
Operation at other than baseline values may be subject to the 
requirements of Sec. 60.276a(c).
    (d) Except as provided under paragraph (e) of this section, the 
owner or operator shall perform monthly operational status inspections 
of the equipment that is important to the performance of the total 
capture system (i.e., pressure sensors, dampers, and damper switches). 
This inspection shall include observations of the physical appearance of 
the equipment (e.g., presence of holes in ductwork or hoods, flow 
constrictions caused by dents or accumulated dust in ductwork, and fan 
erosion). Any deficiencies shall be noted and proper maintenance 
performed.
    (e) The owner or operator may petition the Administrator to approve 
any alternative to either the monitoring requirements specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section or the monthly operational status 
inspections specified in paragraph (d) of this section if the 
alternative will provide a continuous record of operation of each 
emission capture system.
    (f) Except as provided for under Sec. 60.273a(d), if emissions 
during any phase of the heat time are controlled by the use of a DEC 
system, the owner or operator shall install, calibrate, and maintain a 
monitoring device that allows the pressure in the free space inside the 
EAF to be monitored. The pressure shall be recorded as 15-minute 
integrated averages. The monitoring device may be installed in any 
appropriate location in the EAF or DEC duct prior to the introduction of 
ambient air such that reproducible results will be obtained. The 
pressure monitoring device shall have an accuracy of <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>5 mm of water gauge over its normal operating range and 
shall be calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions.
    (g) Except as provided for under Sec. 60.273a(d), when the owner or 
operator of an EAF controlled by a DEC is required to demonstrate 
compliance with the standard under Sec. 60.272a(a)(3), and at any other 
time the Administrator may require (under section 114 of the Clean Air 
Act, as amended), the pressure in the free space inside the furnace 
shall be determined during the meltdown and refining period(s) using the 
monitoring device required under paragraph (f) of this section. The 
owner or operator may petition the Administrator for reestablishment of 
the pressure whenever the owner or operator can demonstrate to the 
Administrator's satisfaction that the EAF operating conditions upon 
which the pressures were previously established are no longer 
applicable. The pressure determined during the most recent demonstration 
of compliance shall be maintained at all times when the EAF is operating 
in a meltdown and refining period. Operation at higher pressures may be 
considered by the Administrator to be unacceptable operation and 
maintenance of the affected facility.
    (h) During any performance test required under Sec. 60.8, and for 
any report thereof required by Sec. 60.276a(f) of this subpart, or to 
determine compliance with Sec. 60.272a(a)(3) of this subpart, the owner 
or operator shall monitor the following information for all heats 
covered by the test:
    (1) Charge weights and materials, and tap weights and materials;
    (2) Heat times, including start and stop times, and a log of process 
operation, including periods of no operation during testing and the

    (iv) If the volume-weighted average mass of VOC's emitted to the 
atmosphere for each calendar month (N) is less than or equal to 0.90 
kilogram per liter of coating solids applied, the affected facility is 
in compliance. Each monthly calculation is a performance test.

provisions of this subpart as specified in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) 
of this section shall comply with one of the following, except as 
provided in paragraphs (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), and (l) of 
this section.
    (1) No owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart 
shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from any stationary gas 
turbine, any gases which contain nitrogen oxides in excess of:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.020

where:

STD = allowable ISO corrected (if required as given in Sec. 
60.335(b)(1)) NO<INF>X emission concentration (percent by volume 
at 15 percent oxygen and on a dry basis),
Y = manufacturer's rated heat rate at manufacturer's rated load 
(kilojoules per watt hour) or, actual measured heat rate based on lower 
heating value of fuel as measured at actual peak load for the facility. 
The value of Y shall not exceed 14.4 kilojoules per watt hour, and
F = NO<INF>X emission allowance for fuel-bound nitrogen as defined 
in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

    (2) No owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart 
shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from any stationary gas 
turbine, any gases which contain nitrogen oxides in excess of:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.021

where:

STD = allowable ISO corrected (if required as given in Sec. 
60.335(b)(1)) NO<INF>X emission concentration (percent by volume 
at 15 percent oxygen and on a dry basis),
Y = manufacturer's rated heat rate at manufacturer's rated peak load 
(kilojoules per watt hour), or actual measured heat rate based on lower 
heating value of fuel as measured at actual peak load for the facility. 
The value of Y shall not exceed 14.4 kilojoules per watt hour, and
F = NO<INF>X emission allowance for fuel-bound nitrogen as defined 
in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

    (3) The use of F in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section is 
optional. That is, the owner or operator may choose to apply a 
NO<INF>X allowance for fuel-bound nitrogen and determine the 
appropriate F-value in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section 
or may accept an F-value of zero.
    (4) If the owner or operator elects to apply a NO<INF>X 
emission allowance for fuel-bound nitrogen, F shall be defined according 
to the nitrogen content of the fuel during the most recent performance 
test required under Sec. 60.8 as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Fuel-bound nitrogen (percent by
             weight)                     F (NOX percent by volume)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
N <= 0.015.......................  0
0.015 < N<= 0.1..................  0.04(N)
0.1 < N <= 0.25..................  0.004+0.0067(N-0.1)
N <ls-thn-eq> 0.25...............  0.005
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where:

N = the nitrogen content of the fuel (percent by weight).


or:


Manufacturers may develop and submit to EPA custom fuel-bound nitrogen 
allowances for each gas turbine model they manufacture. These fuel-bound 
nitrogen allowances shall be substantiated with data and must be 
approved for use by the Administrator before the initial performance 
test required by Sec. 60.8. Notices of approval of custom fuel-bound 
nitrogen allowances will be published in the Federal Register.
    (b) Electric utility stationary gas turbines with a heat input at

on the lower heating value of the fuel fired and that have commenced 
construction prior to October 3, 1982 are exempt from paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (f) Stationary gas turbines using water or steam injection for 
control of NO<INF>X emissions are exempt from paragraph (a) when

than a garrison facility, military gas turbines installed for use as 
military training facilities, and fire fighting gas turbines are exempt 
from paragraph (a) of this section.
    (h) Stationary gas turbines engaged by manufacturers in research and 
development of equipment for both gas turbine emission control 
techniques and gas turbine efficiency improvements are exempt from 
paragraph (a) on a case-by-case basis as determined by the 
Administrator.
    (i) Exemptions from the requirements of paragraph (a) of this 
section will be granted on a case-by-case basis as determined by the 
Administrator in specific geographical areas where mandatory water 
restrictions are required by governmental agencies because of drought 
conditions. These exemptions will be allowed only while the mandatory 
water restrictions are in effect.
    (j) Stationary gas turbines with a heat input at peak load greater 
than 107.2 gigajoules per hour that commenced construction, 
modification, or reconstruction between the dates of October 3, 1977,

the provision of this subpart shall comply with one or the other of the 
following conditions:
    (a) No owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart 
shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from any stationary gas 
turbine any gases which contain sulfur dioxide in excess of 0.015 
percent by volume at 15 percent oxygen and on a dry basis.
    (b) No owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart 
shall burn in any stationary gas turbine any fuel which contains total

[44 FR 52798, Sept. 10, 1979, as amended at 69 FR 41360, July 8, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 60.334  Monitoring of operations.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the owner 
or operator of any stationary gas turbine subject to the provisions of 
this subpart and using water or steam injection to control 
NO<INF>X emissions shall install, calibrate, maintain and operate 
a continuous monitoring system to monitor and record the fuel 
consumption and the ratio of water or steam to fuel being fired in the 
turbine.
    (b) The owner or operator of any stationary gas turbine that 
commenced construction, reconstruction or modification after October 3, 
1977, but before July 8, 2004, and which uses water or steam injection 
to control NO<INF>X

[[Page 384]]

emissions may, as an alternative to operating the continuous monitoring 
system described in paragraph (a) of this section, install, certify, 
maintain, operate, and quality-assure a continuous emission monitoring 
system (CEMS) consisting of NO<INF>X and O<INF>2 monitors. 
As an alternative, a CO<INF>2 monitor may be used to adjust the 
measured NO<INF>X concentrations to 15 percent O<INF>2 by 
either converting the CO<INF>2 hourly averages to equivalent 
O<INF>2 concentrations using Equation F-14a or F-14b in appendix F 
to part 75 of this chapter and making the adjustments to 15 percent 
O<INF>2, or by using the CO<INF>2 readings directly to make 
the adjustments, as described in Method 20. If the option to use a CEMS 
is chosen, the CEMS shall be installed, certified, maintained and 
operated as follows:
    (1) Each CEMS must be installed and certified according to PS 2 and 
3 (for diluent) of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, except the 7-day 
calibration drift is based on unit operating days, not calendar days. 
Appendix F, Procedure 1 is not required. The relative accuracy test 
audit (RATA) of the NO<INF>X and diluent monitors may be performed 
individually or on a combined basis, i.e., the relative accuracy tests 
of the CEMS may be performed either:
    (i) On a ppm basis (for NO<INF>X) and a percent O<INF>2 
basis for oxygen; or
    (ii) On a ppm at 15 percent O<INF>2 basis; or
    (iii) On a ppm basis (for NO<INF>X) and a percent 
CO<INF>2 basis (for a CO<INF>2 monitor that uses the 
procedures in Method 20 to correct the NO<INF>X data to 15 percent 
O<INF>2).
    (2) As specified in Sec. 60.13(e)(2), during each full unit 
operating hour, each monitor must complete a minimum of one cycle of 
operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each 15-minute 
quadrant of the hour, to validate the hour. For partial unit operating 
hours, at least one valid data point must be obtained for each quadrant 
of the hour in which the unit operates. For unit operating hours in 
which required quality assurance and maintenance activities are 
performed on the CEMS, a minimum of two valid data points (one in each 
of two quadrants) are required to validate the hour.
    (3) For purposes of identifying excess emissions, CEMS data must be 
reduced to hourly averages as specified in Sec. 60.13(h).
    (i) For each unit operating hour in which a valid hourly average, as 
described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, is obtained for both 
NO<INF>X and diluent, the data acquisition and handling system 
must calculate and record the hourly NO<INF>X emissions in the 
units of the applicable NO<INF>X emission standard under Sec. 
60.332(a), i.e., percent NO<INF>X by volume, dry basis, corrected 
to 15 percent O<INF>2 and International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) standard conditions (if required as given in Sec. 
60.335(b)(1)). For any hour in which the hourly average O<INF>2 
concentration exceeds 19.0 percent O<INF>2, a diluent cap value of 
19.0 percent O<INF>2 may be used in the emission calculations.
    (ii) A worst case ISO correction factor may be calculated and 
applied using historical ambient data. For the purpose of this 
calculation, substitute the maximum humidity of ambient air (Ho), 
minimum ambient temperature (T<INF>a), and minimum combustor inlet 
absolute pressure (P<INF>o) into the ISO correction equation.
    (iii) If the owner or operator has installed a NO<INF>X CEMS 
to meet the requirements of part 75 of this chapter, and is continuing 
to meet the ongoing requirements of part 75 of this chapter, the CEMS 
may be used to meet the requirements of this section, except that the 
missing data substitution methodology provided for at 40 CFR part 75, 
subpart D, is not required for purposes of identifying excess emissions. 
Instead, periods of missing CEMS data are to be reported as monitor 
downtime in the excess emissions and monitoring performance report 
required in Sec. 60.7(c).
    (c) For any turbine that commenced construction, reconstruction or 
modification after October 3, 1977, but before July 8, 2004, and which 
does not use steam or water injection to control NO<INF>X 
emissions, the owner or operator may, but is not required to, for 
purposes of determining excess emissions, use a CEMS that meets the 
requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. Also, if the owner or 
operator has previously submitted and received EPA,

[[Page 385]]

State, or local permitting authority approval of a procedure for 
monitoring compliance with the applicable NO<INF>X emission limit 
under Sec. 60.332, that approved procedure may continue to be used.
    (d) The owner or operator of any new turbine constructed after July 
8, 2004, and which uses water or steam injection to control 
NO<INF>X emissions may elect to use either the requirements in 
paragraph (a) of this section for continuous water or steam to fuel 
ratio monitoring or may use a NO<INF>X CEMS installed, certified, 
operated, maintained, and quality-assured as described in paragraph (b) 
of this section.
    (e) The owner or operator of any new turbine that commences 
construction after July 8, 2004, and which does not use water or steam 
injection to control NO<INF>X emissions, may, but is not required 
to, elect to use a NO<INF>X CEMS installed, certified, operated, 
maintained, and quality-assured as described in paragraph (b) of this 
section. Other acceptable monitoring approaches include periodic testing 
approved by EPA or the State or local permitting authority or continuous 
parameter monitoring as described in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (f) The owner or operator of a new turbine that commences 
construction after July 8, 2004, which does not use water or steam 
injection to control NO<INF>X emissions may, but is not required 
to, perform continuous parameter monitoring as follows:
    (1) For a diffusion flame turbine without add-on selective catalytic 
reduction controls (SCR), the owner or operator shall define at least 
four parameters indicative of the unit's NO<INF>X formation 
characteristics and shall monitor these parameters continuously.
    (2) For any lean premix stationary combustion turbine, the owner or 
operator shall continuously monitor the appropriate parameters to 
determine whether the unit is operating in low-NO<INF>X mode.
    (3) For any turbine that uses SCR to reduce NO<INF>X 
emissions, the owner or operator shall continuously monitor appropriate 
parameters to verify the proper operation of the emission controls.
    (4) For affected units that are also regulated under part 75 of this 
chapter, if the owner or operator elects to monitor NO<INF>X 
emission rate using the methodology in appendix E to part 75 of this 
chapter, or the low mass emissions methodology in Sec. 75.19 of this 
chapter, the requirements of this paragraph (f) may be met by performing 
the parametric monitoring described in section 2.3 of appendix E or in 
Sec. 75.19(c)(1)(iv)(H) of this chapter.
    (g) The steam or water to fuel ratio or other parameters that are 
continuously monitored as described in paragraphs (a), (d) or (f) of 
this section shall be monitored during the performance test required 
under Sec. 60.8, to establish acceptable values and ranges. The owner 
or operator may supplement the performance test data with engineering 
analyses, design specifications, manufacturer's recommendations and 
other relevant information to define the acceptable parametric ranges 
more precisely. The owner or operator shall develop and keep on-site a 
parameter monitoring plan which explains the procedures used to document 
proper operation of the NO<INF>X emission controls. The plan shall 
include the parameter(s) monitored and the acceptable range(s) of the 
parameter(s) as well as the basis for designating the parameter(s) and 
acceptable range(s). Any supplemental data such as engineering analyses, 
design specifications, manufacturer's recommendations and other relevant 
information shall be included in the monitoring plan. For affected units 
that are also subject to part 75 of this chapter and that use the low 
mass emissions methodology in Sec. 75.19 of this chapter or the 
NO<INF>X emission measurement methodology in appendix E to part 
75, the owner or operator may meet the requirements of this paragraph by 
developing and keeping on-site (or at a central location for unmanned 
facilities) a quality-assurance plan, as described in Sec. 75.19 (e)(5) 
or in section 2.3 of appendix E and section 1.3.6 of appendix B to part 
75 of this chapter.
    (h) The owner or operator of any stationary gas turbine subject to 
the provisions of this subpart:
    (1) Shall monitor the total sulfur content of the fuel being fired 
in the

[[Page 386]]

turbine, except as provided in paragraph (h)(3) of this section. The 
sulfur content of the fuel must be determined using total sulfur methods 
described in Sec. 60.335(b)(10). Alternatively, if the total sulfur 
content of the gaseous fuel during the most recent performance test was 
less than 0.4 weight percent (4000 ppmw), ASTM D4084-82, 94, D5504-01, 
D6228-98, or Gas Processors Association Standard 2377-86 (all of which 
are incorporated by reference-see Sec. 60.17), which measure the major 
sulfur compounds may be used; and
    (2) Shall monitor the nitrogen content of the fuel combusted in the 
turbine, if the owner or operator claims an allowance for fuel bound 
nitrogen (i.e., if an F-value greater than zero is being or will be used 
by the owner or operator to calculate STD in Sec. 60.332). The nitrogen 
content of the fuel shall be determined using methods described in Sec. 
60.335(b)(9) or an approved alternative.
    (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (h)(1) of this 
section, the owner or operator may elect not to monitor the total sulfur 
content of the gaseous fuel combusted in the turbine, if the gaseous 
fuel is demonstrated to meet the definition of natural gas in Sec. 
60.331(u), regardless of whether an existing custom schedule approved by 
the administrator for subpart GG requires such monitoring. The owner or 
operator shall use one of the following sources of information to make 
the required demonstration:
    (i) The gas quality characteristics in a current, valid purchase 
contract, tariff sheet or transportation contract for the gaseous fuel, 
specifying that the maximum total sulfur content of the fuel is 20.0 
grains/100 scf or less; or
    (ii) Representative fuel sampling data which show that the sulfur 
content of the gaseous fuel does not exceed 20 grains/100 scf. At a 
minimum, the amount of fuel sampling data specified in section 2.3.1.4 
or 2.3.2.4 of appendix D to part 75 of this chapter is required.
    (4) For any turbine that commenced construction, reconstruction or 
modification after October 3, 1977, but before July 8, 2004, and for 
which a custom fuel monitoring schedule has previously been approved, 
the owner or operator may, without submitting a special petition to the 
Administrator, continue monitoring on this schedule.
    (i) The frequency of determining the sulfur and nitrogen content of 
the fuel shall be as follows:
    (1) Fuel oil. For fuel oil, use one of the total sulfur sampling 
options and the associated sampling frequency described in sections 
2.2.3, 2.2.4.1, 2.2.4.2, and 2.2.4.3 of appendix D to part 75 of this 
chapter (i.e., flow proportional sampling, daily sampling, sampling from 
the unit's storage tank after each addition of fuel to the tank, or 
sampling each delivery prior to combining it with fuel oil already in 
the intended storage tank). If an emission allowance is being claimed 
for fuel-bound nitrogen, the nitrogen content of the oil shall be 
determined and recorded once per unit operating day.
    (2) Gaseous fuel. Any applicable nitrogen content value of the 
gaseous fuel shall be determined and recorded once per unit operating 
day. For owners and operators that elect not to demonstrate sulfur 
content using options in paragraph (h)(3) of this section, and for which 
the fuel is supplied without intermediate bulk storage, the sulfur 
content value of the gaseous fuel shall be determined and recorded once 
per unit operating day.
    (3) Custom schedules. Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph 
(i)(2) of this section, operators or fuel vendors may develop custom 
schedules for determination of the total sulfur content of gaseous 
fuels, based on the design and operation of the affected facility and 
the characteristics of the fuel supply. Except as provided in paragraphs 
(i)(3)(i) and (i)(3)(ii) of this section, custom schedules shall be 
substantiated with data and shall be approved by the Administrator 
before they can be used to comply with the standard in Sec. 60.333.
    (i) The two custom sulfur monitoring schedules set forth in 
paragraphs (i)(3)(i)(A) through (D) and in paragraph (i)(3)(ii) of this 
section are acceptable, without prior Administrative approval:
    (A) The owner or operator shall obtain daily total sulfur content 
measurements for 30 consecutive unit operating days, using the 
applicable methods specified in this subpart. Based on the results of 
the 30 daily samples, the

[[Page 387]]

required frequency for subsequent monitoring of the fuel's total sulfur 
content shall be as specified in paragraph (i)(3)(i)(B), (C), or (D) of 
this section, as applicable.
    (B) If none of the 30 daily measurements of the fuel's total sulfur 
content exceeds 0.4 weight percent (4000 ppmw), subsequent sulfur 
content monitoring may be performed at 12 month intervals. If any of the 
samples taken at 12-month intervals has a total sulfur content between 
0.4 and 0.8 weight percent (4000 and 8000 ppmw), follow the procedures 
in paragraph (i)(3)(i)(C) of this section. If any measurement exceeds 
0.8 weight percent (8000 ppmw), follow the procedures in paragraph 
(i)(3)(i)(D) of this section.
    (C) If at least one of the 30 daily measurements of the fuel's total 
sulfur content is between 0.4 and 0.8 weight percent (4000 and 8000 
ppmw), but none exceeds 0.8 weight percent (8000 ppmw), then:
    (1) Collect and analyze a sample every 30 days for three months. If 
any sulfur content measurement exceeds 0.8 weight percent (8000 ppmw), 
follow the procedures in paragraph (i)(3)(i)(D) of this section. 
Otherwise, follow the procedures in paragraph (i)(3)(i)(C)(2) of this 
section.
    (2) Begin monitoring at 6-month intervals for 12 months. If any 
sulfur content measurement exceeds 0.8 weight percent (8000 ppmw), 
follow the procedures in paragraph (i)(3)(i)(D) of this section. 
Otherwise, follow the procedures in paragraph (i)(3)(i)(C)(3) of this 
section.
    (3) Begin monitoring at 12-month intervals. If any sulfur content 
measurement exceeds 0.8 weight percent (8000 ppmw), follow the 
procedures in paragraph (i)(3)(i)(D) of this section. Otherwise, 
continue to monitor at this frequency.
    (D) If a sulfur content measurement exceeds 0.8 weight percent (8000 
ppmw), immediately begin daily monitoring according to paragraph 
(i)(3)(i)(A) of this section. Daily monitoring shall continue until 30 
consecutive daily samples, each having a sulfur content no greater than 
0.8 weight percent (8000 ppmw), are obtained. At that point, the 
applicable procedures of paragraph (i)(3)(i)(B) or (C) of this section 
shall be followed.
    (ii) The owner or operator may use the data collected from the 720-
hour sulfur sampling demonstration described in section 2.3.6 of 
appendix D to part 75 of this chapter to determine a custom sulfur 
sampling schedule, as follows:
    (A) If the maximum fuel sulfur content obtained from the 720 hourly 
samples does not exceed 20 grains/100 scf (i.e., the maximum total 
sulfur content of natural gas as defined in Sec. 60.331(u)), no 
additional monitoring of the sulfur content of the gas is required, for 
the purposes of this subpart.
    (B) If the maximum fuel sulfur content obtained from any of the 720 
hourly samples exceeds 20 grains/100 scf, but none of the sulfur content 
values (when converted to weight percent sulfur) exceeds 0.4 weight 
percent (4000 ppmw), then the minimum required sampling frequency shall 
be one sample at 12 month intervals.
    (C) If any sample result exceeds 0.4 weight percent sulfur (4000 
ppmw), but none exceeds 0.8 weight percent sulfur (8000 ppmw), follow 
the provisions of paragraph (i)(3)(i)(C) of this section.
    (D) If the sulfur content of any of the 720 hourly samples exceeds 
0.8 weight percent (8000 ppmw), follow the provisions of paragraph 
(i)(3)(i)(D) of this section.
    (j) For each affected unit that elects to continuously monitor 
parameters or emissions, or to periodically determine the fuel sulfur 
content or fuel nitrogen content under this subpart, the owner or 
operator shall submit reports of excess emissions and monitor downtime, 
in accordance with Sec. 60.7(c). Excess emissions shall be reported for 
all periods of unit operation, including startup, shutdown and 
malfunction. For the purpose of reports required under Sec. 60.7(c), 
periods of excess emissions and monitor downtime that shall be reported 
are defined as follows:
    (1) Nitrogen oxides.
    (i) For turbines using water or steam to fuel ratio monitoring:
    (A) An excess emission shall be any unit operating hour for which 
the average steam or water to fuel ratio, as

[[Page 388]]

measured by the continuous monitoring system, falls below the acceptable 
steam or water to fuel ratio needed to demonstrate compliance with Sec. 
60.332, as established during the performance test required in Sec. 
60.8. Any unit operating hour in which no water or steam is injected 
into the turbine shall also be considered an excess emission.
    (B) A period of monitor downtime shall be any unit operating hour in 
which water or steam is injected into the turbine, but the essential 
parametric data needed to determine the steam or water to fuel ratio are 
unavailable or invalid.
    (C) Each report shall include the average steam or water to fuel 
ratio, average fuel consumption, ambient conditions (temperature, 
pressure, and humidity), gas turbine load, and (if applicable) the 
nitrogen content of the fuel during each excess emission. You do not 
have to report ambient conditions if you opt to use the worst case ISO 
correction factor as specified in Sec. 60.334(b)(3)(ii), or if you are 
not using the ISO correction equation under the provisions of Sec. 
60.335(b)(1).
    (ii) If the owner or operator elects to take an emission allowance 
for fuel bound nitrogen, then excess emissions and periods of monitor 
downtime are as described in paragraphs (j)(1)(ii)(A) and (B) of this 
section.
    (A) An excess emission shall be the period of time during which the 
fuel-bound nitrogen (N) is greater than the value measured during the 
performance test required in Sec. 60.8 and used to determine the 
allowance. The excess emission begins on the date and hour of the sample 
which shows that N is greater than the performance test value, and ends 
with the date and hour of a subsequent sample which shows a fuel 
nitrogen content less than or equal to the performance test value.
    (B) A period of monitor downtime begins when a required sample is 
not taken by its due date. A period of monitor downtime also begins on 
the date and hour that a required sample is taken, if invalid results 
are obtained. The period of monitor downtime ends on the date and hour 
of the next valid sample.
    (iii) For turbines using NO<INF>X and diluent CEMS:
    (A) An hour of excess emissions shall be any unit operating hour in 
which the 4-hour rolling average NO<INF>X concentration exceeds 
the applicable emission limit in Sec. 60.332(a)(1) or (2). For the 
purposes of this subpart, a ``4-hour rolling average NO<INF>X 
concentration'' is the arithmetic average of the average NO<INF>X 
concentration measured by the CEMS for a given hour (corrected to 15 
percent O<INF>2 and, if required under Sec. 60.335(b)(1), to ISO 
standard conditions) and the three unit operating hour average 
NO<INF>X concentrations immediately preceding that unit operating 
hour.
    (B) A period of monitor downtime shall be any unit operating hour in 
which sufficient data are not obtained to validate the hour, for either 
NO<INF>X concentration or diluent (or both).
    (C) Each report shall include the ambient conditions (temperature, 
pressure, and humidity) at the time of the excess emission period and 
(if the owner or operator has claimed an emission allowance for fuel 
bound nitrogen) the nitrogen content of the fuel during the period of 
excess emissions. You do not have to report ambient conditions if you 
opt to use the worst case ISO correction factor as specified in Sec. 
60.334(b)(3)(ii), or if you are not using the ISO correction equation 
under the provisions of Sec. 60.335(b)(1).
    (iv) For owners or operators that elect, under paragraph (f) of this 
section, to monitor combustion parameters or parameters that document 
proper operation of the NO<INF>X emission controls:
    (A) An excess emission shall be a 4-hour rolling unit operating hour 
average in which any monitored parameter does not achieve the target 
value or is outside the acceptable range defined in the parameter 
monitoring plan for the unit.
    (B) A period of monitor downtime shall be a unit operating hour in 
which any of the required parametric data are either not recorded or are 
invalid.
    (2) Sulfur dioxide. If the owner or operator is required to monitor 
the sulfur content of the fuel under paragraph (h) of this section:

[[Page 389]]

    (i) For samples of gaseous fuel and for oil samples obtained using 
daily sampling, flow proportional sampling, or sampling from the unit's 
storage tank, an excess emission occurs each unit operating hour 
included in the period beginning on the date and hour of any sample for 
which the sulfur content of the fuel being fired in the gas turbine 
exceeds 0.8 weight percent and ending on the date and hour that a 
subsequent sample is taken that demonstrates compliance with the sulfur 
limit.
    (ii) If the option to sample each delivery of fuel oil has been 
selected, the owner or operator shall immediately switch to one of the 
other oil sampling options (i.e., daily sampling, flow proportional 
sampling, or sampling from the unit's storage tank) if the sulfur 
content of a delivery exceeds 0.8 weight percent. The owner or operator 
shall continue to use one of the other sampling options until all of the 
oil from the delivery has been combusted, and shall evaluate excess 
emissions according to paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section. When all of 
the fuel from the delivery has been burned, the owner or operator may 
resume using the as-delivered sampling option.
    (iii) A period of monitor downtime begins when a required sample is 
not taken by its due date. A period of monitor downtime also begins on 
the date and hour of a required sample, if invalid results are obtained. 
The period of monitor downtime shall include only unit operating hours, 
and ends on the date and hour of the next valid sample.
    (3) Ice fog. Each period during which an exemption provided in Sec. 
60.332(f) is in effect shall be reported in writing to the Administrator 
quarterly. For each period the ambient conditions existing during the 
period, the date and time the air pollution control system was 
deactivated, and the date and time the air pollution control system was 
reactivated shall be reported. All quarterly reports shall be postmarked 
by the 30th day following the end of each calendar quarter.
    (4) Emergency fuel. Each period during which an exemption provided 
in Sec. 60.332(k) is in effect shall be included in the report required 
in Sec. 60.7(c). For each period, the type, reasons, and duration of 
the firing of the emergency fuel shall be reported.
    (5) All reports required under Sec. 60.7(c) shall be postmarked by 
the 30th day following the end of each 6-month period.

<R05>
Sec. 60.335  Test methods and procedures.

    (a) The owner or operator shall conduct the performance tests 
required in Sec. 60.8, using either
    (1) EPA Method 20,
    (2) ASTM D6522-00 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 60.17), or
    (3) EPA Method 7E and either EPA Method 3 or 3A in appendix A to 
this part, to determine NO<INF>X and diluent concentration.
    (4) Sampling traverse points are to be selected following Method 20 
or Method 1, (non-particulate procedures) and sampled for equal time 
intervals. The sampling shall be performed with a traversing single-hole 
probe or, if feasible, with a stationary multi-hole probe that samples 
each of the points sequentially. Alternatively, a multi-hole probe 
designed and documented to sample equal volumes from each hole may be 
used to sample simultaneously at the required points.
    (5) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the owner or 
operator may test at few points than are specified in Method 1 or Method 
20 if the following conditions are met:
    (i) You may perform a stratification test for NO<INF>X and 
diluent pursuant to
    (A) [Reserved]
    (B) The procedures specified in section 6.5.6.1(a) through (e) 
appendix A to part 75 of this chapter.
    (ii) Once the stratification sampling is completed, the owner or 
operator may use the following alternative sample point selection 
criteria for the performance test:
    (A) If each of the individual traverse point NO<INF>X 
concentrations, normalized to 15 percent O<INF>2, is within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq> 10 percent of the mean normalized concentration for all 
traverse points, then you may use 3 points (located either 16.7, 50.0, 
and 83.3 percent of the way across the stack or duct, or, for circular 
stacks or

[[Page 390]]

ducts greater than 2.4 meters (7.8 feet) in diameter, at 0.4, 1.2, and 
2.0 meters from the wall). The 3 points shall be located along the 
measurement line that exhibited the highest average normalized 
NO<INF>X concentration during the stratification test; or
    (B) If each of the individual traverse point NO<INF>X 
concentrations, normalized to 15 percent O<INF>2, is within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq> 5 percent of the mean normalized concentration for all 
traverse points, then you may sample at a single point, located at least 
1 meter from the stack wall or at the stack centroid.
    (6) Other acceptable alternative reference methods and procedures 
are given in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
applicable nitrogen oxides emission limitation in Sec. 60.332 and shall 
meet the performance test requirements of Sec. 60.8 as follows:
    (1) For each run of the performance test, the mean nitrogen oxides 
emission concentration (NO<INF>Xo) corrected to 15 percent 
O<INF>2 shall be corrected to ISO standard conditions using the 
following equation. Notwithstanding this requirement, use of the ISO 
correction equation is optional for: Lean premix stationary combustion 
turbines; units used in association with heat recovery steam generators 
(HRSG) equipped with duct burners; and units equipped with add-on 
emission control devices:

NO<INF>X=(NO<INF>Xo)(P<INF>r/P<INF>o)\0.5\ 
    e<SUP>19 (Ho-0.00633)</SUP> (288[deg]K/T<INF>a)\1.53\

Where:

NO<INF>X = emission concentration of NO<INF>X at 15 percent 
O<INF>2 and ISO standard ambient conditions, ppm by volume, dry 
basis,
NO<INF>Xo = mean observed NO<INF>X concentration, ppm by 
volume, dry basis, at 15 percent O<INF>2,
P<INF>r = reference combustor inlet absolute pressure at 101.3 
kilopascals ambient pressure, mm Hg,
P<INF>o = observed combustor inlet absolute pressure at test, mm 
Hg,
H<INF>o = observed humidity of ambient air, g H<INF>2O/g 
air,
e = transcendental constant, 2.718, and
T<INF>a = ambient temperature, [deg]K.

    (2) The 3-run performance test required by Sec. 60.8 must be 
performed within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq> 5 percent at 30, 50, 75, and 90-
to-100 percent of peak load or at four evenly-spaced load points in the 
normal operating range of the gas turbine, including the minimum point 
in the operating range and 90-to-100 percent of peak load, or at the 
highest achievable load point if 90-to-100 percent of peak load cannot 
be physically achieved in practice. If the turbine combusts both oil and 
gas as primary or backup fuels, separate performance testing is required 
for each fuel. Notwithstanding these requirements, performance testing 
is not required for any emergency fuel (as defined in Sec. 60.331).
    (3) For a combined cycle turbine system with supplemental heat (duct 
burner), the owner or operator may elect to measure the turbine 
NO<INF>X emissions after the duct burner rather than directly 
after the turbine. If the owner or operator elects to use this 
alternative sampling location, the applicable NO<INF>X emission 
limit in Sec. 60.332 for the combustion turbine must still be met.
    (4) If water or steam injection is used to control NO<INF>X 
with no additional post-combustion NO<INF>X control and the owner 
or operator chooses to monitor the steam or water to fuel ratio in 
accordance with Sec. 60.334(a), then that monitoring system must be 
operated concurrently with each EPA Method 20, ASTM D6522-00 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 60.17), or EPA Method 7E run and 
shall be used to determine the fuel consumption and the steam or water 
to fuel ratio necessary to comply with the applicable Sec. 60.332 
NO<INF>X emission limit.
    (5) If the owner operator elects to claim an emission allowance for 
fuel bound nitrogen as described in Sec. 60.332, then concurrently with 
each reference method run, a representative sample of the fuel used 
shall be collected and analyzed, following the applicable procedures 
described in Sec. 60.335(b)(9). These data shall be used to determine 
the maximum fuel nitrogen content for which the established water (or 
steam) to fuel ratio will be valid.
    (6) If the owner or operator elects to install a CEMS, the 
performance evaluation of the CEMS may either be conducted separately 
(as described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section) or as part of the 
initial performance test of the affected unit.
    (7) If the owner or operator elects to install and certify a 
NO<INF>X CEMS under

[[Page 391]]

Sec. 60.334(e), then the initial performance test required under Sec. 
60.8 may be done in the following alternative manner:
    (i) Perform a minimum of 9 reference method runs, with a minimum 
time per run of 21 minutes, at a single load level, between 90 and 100 
percent of peak (or the highest physically achievable) load.
    (ii) Use the test data both to demonstrate compliance with the 
applicable NO<INF>X emission limit under Sec. 60.332 and to 
provide the required reference method data for the RATA of the CEMS 
described under Sec. 60.334(b).
    (iii) The requirement to test at three additional load levels is 
waived.
    (8) If the owner or operator elects under Sec. 60.334(f) to monitor 
combustion parameters or parameters indicative of proper operation of 
NO<INF>X emission controls, the appropriate parameters shall be 
continuously monitored and recorded during each run of the initial 
performance test, to establish acceptable operating ranges, for purposes 
of the parameter monitoring plan for the affected unit, as specified in 
Sec. 60.334(g).
    (9) To determine the fuel bound nitrogen content of fuel being fired 
(if an emission allowance is claimed for fuel bound nitrogen), the owner 
or operator may use equipment and procedures meeting the requirements 
of:
    (i) For liquid fuels, ASTM D2597-94 (Reapproved 1999), D6366-99, 
D4629-02, D5762-02 (all of which are incorporated by reference, see 
Sec. 60.17); or
    (ii) For gaseous fuels, shall use analytical methods and procedures 
that are accurate to within 5 percent of the instrument range and are 
approved by the Administrator.
    (10) If the owner or operator is required under Sec. 60.334(i)(1) 
or (3) to periodically determine the sulfur content of the fuel 
combusted in the turbine, a minimum of three fuel samples shall be 
collected during the performance test. Analyze the samples for the total 
sulfur content of the fuel using:
    (i) For liquid fuels, ASTM D129-00, D2622-98, D4294-02, D1266-98, 
D5453-00 or D1552-01 (all of which are incorporated by reference, see 
Sec. 60.17); or
    (ii) For gaseous fuels, ASTM D1072-80, 90 (Reapproved 1994); D3246-
81, 92, 96; D4468-85 (Reapproved 2000); or D6667-01 (all of which are 
incorporated by reference, see Sec. 60.17). The applicable ranges of 
some ASTM methods mentioned above are not adequate to measure the levels 
of sulfur in some fuel gases. Dilution of samples before analysis (with 
verification of the dilution ratio) may be used, subject to the prior 
approval of the Administrator.
    (11) The fuel analyses required under paragraphs (b)(9) and (b)(10) 
of this section may be performed by the owner or operator, a service 
contractor retained by the owner or operator, the fuel vendor, or any 
other qualified agency.
    (c) The owner or operator may use the following as alternatives to 
the reference methods and procedures specified in this section:
    (1) Instead of using the equation in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, manufacturers may develop ambient condition correction factors 
to adjust the nitrogen oxides emission level measured by the performance 
test as provided in Sec. 60.8 to ISO standard day conditions.

    (1) The owner or operator shall use the following procedures for 
each affected facility which does not use a capture system and a control 
device to comply with the applicable emission limit specified under 
Sec. 60.392.
    (i) Calculate the volume weighted average mass of VOC per volume of 
applied coating solids for each calendar month for each affected 
facility. The owner or operator shall determine the composition of the 
coatings by formulation data supplied by the manufacturer of the coating 
or from data determined by an analysis of each coating, as received, by 
Method 24. The Administrator may require the owner or operator who uses

    (A) Calculate the mass of VOC used in each calendar month for each 
affected facility by the following equation where ``n'' is the total 
number of coatings used and ``m'' is the total number of VOC solvents 
used:

                     Application method                       efficiency
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Air Atomized Spray (waterborne coating).....................        0.39
Air Atomized Spray (solvent-borne coating)..................        0.50
Manual Electrostatic Spray..................................        0.75
Automatic Electrostatic Spray...............................        0.95
Electrodeposition...........................................        1.00
------------------------------------------------------------------------


The values in the table above represent an overall system efficiency 
which includes a total capture of purge. If a spray system uses line 
purging after each vehicle and does not collect any of the purge 
material, the following table shall be used:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               Transfer

Manual Electrostatic Spray..................................        0.62
Automatic Electrostatic Spray...............................        0.75
------------------------------------------------------------------------


If the owner or operator can justify to the Administrator's satisfaction 
that other values for transfer efficiencies are appropriate, the 
Administrator will approve their use on a case-by-case basis.
    (1) When more than one application method (l) is used on an

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11OC94.000


Then calculate or select the appropriate limit according to Sec. 
60.392(a).
    (ii) If the volume weighted average mass of VOC per volume of 
applied coating solids (G), calculated on a calendar month basis, is 
less than or equal to the applicable emission limit specified in Sec. 
60.392, the affected facility is in compliance. Each monthly calculation 
is a performance test for the purpose of this subpart.
    (2) The owner or operator shall use the following procedures for 
each affected facility which uses a capture system and a control device 
that destroys VOC (e.g., incinerator) to comply with the applicable 
emission limit specified under Sec. 60.392.

affected facility that enters the control device by using the following 
equation where ``n'' is the total number of stacks entering the control 
device and ``p'' is the total number of stacks not connected to the 
control device:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.011


If the owner can justify to the Administrator's satisfaction that 
another method will give comparable results, the Administrator will 
approve its use on a case-by-case basis.
    (1) In subsequent months, the owner or operator shall use the most 
recently determined capture fraction for the performance test.
    (B) Determines the destruction efficiency of the control device 
using values of the volumetric flow rate of the gas streams and the VOC 
content (as carbon) of each of the gas streams in and out of the device 
by the following equation where ``n'' is the total number of stacks 
entering the control device and ``m'' is the total number of stacks 
leaving the control device:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.014

    (1) In subsequent months, the owner or operator shall use the most 
recently determined VOC destruction efficiency for the performance test.
    (C) If an emission control device controls the emissions from more 
than one affected facility, the owner or operator shall measure the VOC 
concentration (C<INF>bi) in the effluent gas entering the control 
device (in parts per million by volume) and the volumetric flow rate 
(Q<INF>bi) of the effluent gas (in dry standard cubic meters per 
hour) entering the device through each stack. The destruction or removal 
efficiency determined using these data shall be applied to each affected 
facility served by the control device.
    (iii) If the volume weighted average mass of VOC per volume of 
applied solids emitted after the control device (N) calculated on a 
calendar month basis is less than or equal to the applicable emission 
limit specified in Sec. 60.392, the affected facility is in compliance. 
Each monthly calculation is a performance test for the purposes of this 
subpart.

[[Page 403]]

    (3) The owner or operator shall use the following procedures for 
each affected facility which uses a capture system and a control device 
that recovers the VOC (e.g., carbon adsorber) to comply with the 
applicable emission limit specified under Sec. 60.392.
    (i) Calculate the mass of VOC (M<INF>o+M<INF>d) used 
during each calendar month for each affected facility as described under 
Sec. 60.393(c)(1)(i).
    (ii) Calculate the total volume of coating solids (L<INF>s) 
used in each calendar month for each affected facility as described 
under Sec. 60.393(c)(1)(i).
    (iii) Calculate the mass of VOC recovered (M<INF>r) each 
calendar month for each affected facility by the following equation: 
M<INF>r=L<INF>r D<INF>r
    (iv) Calculate the volume weighted average mass of VOC per volume of 
applied coating solids emitted after the control device during a 
calendar month by the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.031

solids emitted after the control device (N) calculated on a calendar 
month basis is less than or equal to the applicable emission limit 
specified in Sec. 60.392, the affected facility is in compliance. Each 
monthly calculation is a performance test for the purposes of this 
subpart.

Sec. 60.432  Standard for volatile organic compounds.

    During the period of the performance test required to be conducted 
by Sec. 60.8 and after the date required for completion of the test, no 
owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall cause 
to be discharged into the atmosphere from any affected facility VOC 
equal to more than 16 percent of the total mass of VOC solvent and water 
used at that facility during any one performance averaging period. The 
water used includes only that water contained in the waterborne raw inks 
and related coatings and the water added for dilution with waterborne 
ink systems.


<R05>
Sec. 60.433  Performance test and compliance provisions.

    (a) The owner or operator of any affected facility (or facilities) 
shall conduct performance tests in accordance with Sec. 60.8, under the 
following conditions:
    (1) The performance averaging period for each test is 30 consecutive 
calendar days and not an average of three separate runs as prescribed 
under Sec. 60.8(f).
    (2) Except as provided under paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, 
if affected facilities routinely share the same raw ink storage/handling 
system with existing facilities, then temporary measurement procedures 
for segregating the raw inks, related coatings, VOC solvent, and water 
used at the affected facilities must be employed during the test. For 
this case, an overall emission percentage for the combined facilities as 
well as for only the affected facilities must be calculated during the 
test.
    (3) For the purpose of measuring bulk storage tank quantities of 
each color of

[[Page 418]]

raw ink and each related coating used, the owner or operator of any 
affected facility shall install, calibrate, maintain, and continuously 
operate during the test one or more:
    (i) Non-resettable totalizer metering device(s) for indicating the 
cumulative liquid volumes used at each affected facility; or
    (ii) Segregated storage tanks for each affected facility to allow 
determination of the liquid quantities used by measuring devices other 
than the press meters required under item (i) of this article; or
    (iii) Storage tanks to serve more than one facility with the liquid 
quantities used determined by measuring devices other than press meters, 
if facilities are combined as decribed under paragraph (d), (f), or (g) 
of this section.
    (4) The owner or operator may choose to install an automatic 
temperature compensator with any liquid metering device used to measure 
the raw inks, related coatings, water, or VOC solvent used, or VOC 
solvent recovered.
    (5) Records of the measured amounts used at the affected facility 
and the liquid temperature at which the amounts were measured are 
maintained for each shipment of all purchased material on at least a 
weekly basis for:
    (i) The raw inks and related coatings used;

coatings, VOC solvents used, and VOC solvent recovered are determined by 
the methods stipulated in Sec. 60.435(d).
    (7) The calculated emission percentage may be reported as rounded-
off to the nearest whole number.
    (8) Printing press startups and shutdowns are not included in the 
exemption provisions under Sec. 60.8(c). Frequent periods of press 
startups and shutdowns are normal operations and constitute 
representative conditions for the purpose of a performance test.
    (b) If an affected facility uses waterborne ink systems or a 
combination of waterborne and solvent-borne ink systems with a solvent 
recovery system, compliance is determined by the following procedures, 
except as provided in paragraphs (d), (e), (f), and (g) of this section:

solvent recovery system, compliance is determined by the procedures 
specified in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, whichever applies, 
except that (L<INF>t)<INF>a and (L<INF>r)<INF>a, 
(M<INF>t)<INF>a, (M<INF>r)<INF>a, and 
(M<INF>v)<INF>a, are the collective amounts of VOC solvent 
and water corresponding to all the affected facilities controlled by 
that solvent recovery system. The average VOC emission percentage for 
each of the affected facilities controlled by that same solvent recovery 
system is assumed to be equal.
    (e) Except as provided under paragraph (f) of this section, if an 
existing facility (or facilities) and an affected facility (or 
facilities) are controlled in common by the same solvent recovery 
system, the owner or operator shall determine compliance by conducting a 
separate emission test on the existing facility (or facilities) and then 
conducting a performance test on the combined facilities as follows:
    (1) Before the initial startup of the affected facility (or 
facilities) and at any other time as requested by the Administrator, the 
owner or operator shall conduct emission test(s) on the existing 
facility (or facilities) controlled by the subject solvent recovery 
system. The solvent recovery system must handle VOC emissions from only 
the subject existing facility (or facilities), not from affected 
facilities, during the emission test.
    (2) During the emission test, the affected facilities are subject to 
the standard stated in Sec. 60.432.
    (3) The emission test is conducted over a 30 consecutive calendar 
day averaging period according to the conditions stipulated in 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section, except that the 
conditions pertain to only existing facilities instead of affected 
facilities.
    (4) The owner or operator of the existing facility (or facilities) 
shall provide the Administrator at least 30 days prior notice of the 
emission test to afford the Administrator the opportunity to have an 
observer present.
    (5) The emission percentage for the existing facility (or 
facilities) during the emission test is determined by one of the 
following procedures:
    (i) If the existing facility (or facilities) uses a combination of 
waterborne and solvent-borne ink systems, the average VOC emission 
percentage must be determined on a direct mass basis according to 
paragraph (b) or (d) of this section, whichever applies, with the 
following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.025

where the water and VOC solvent amounts pertain to only existing 
facilities.

    (ii) If the existing facility (or facilities) uses only solvent-
borne ink systems, the owner or operator may choose to determine the 
emission percentage either on a direct mass basis or a density-corrected 
liquid volume basis according to paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, 
whichever applies. On a direct mass basis, the average VOC emission 
percentage is determined by the equation presented in article (i) of 
this paragraph. On a density-corrected liquid volume basis, the average 
VOC emission percentage is determined by the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.026

where the VOC solvent amounts pertain to only existing facilities.

    (6) The owner or operator of the existing facility (or facilities) 
shall furnish the Administrator a written report of the results of the 
emission test.

[[Page 421]]

    (7) After completion of the separate emission test on the existing 
facility (or facilities), the owner or operator shall conduct 
performance test(s) on the combined facilities with the solvent recovery 
system handling VOC emissions from both the existing and affected 
facilities.
    (8) During performance test(s), the emission percentage for the 
existing facility (or facilities), P<INF>e, is assumed to be equal 
to that determined in the latest emission test. The administrator may 
request additional emission tests if any physical or operational changes 
occur to any of the subject existing facilities.
    (9) The emission percentage for the affected facility (or 
facilities) during performance test(s) with both existing and affected 
facilities connected to the solvent recovery system is determined by one 
of the following procedures:
    (i) If any of the combined facilities uses both waterborne and 
solvent-borne ink systems, the average VOC emission percentage must be 
determined on a direct mass basis according to paragraph (b) or (d) of 
this section, whichever applies, with the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.027

where (M<INF>t)<INF>b and (M<INF>r)<INF>b are 
the collective VOC solvent amounts pertaining to all the combined 
facilities.

    (ii) If all of the combined facilities use only solvent-borne ink 
systems, the owner or operator may choose to determine performance of 
the affected facility (or facilities) either on a direct mass basis or a 
density-corrected liquid volume basis according to paragraph (c) or (d) 
of this section, whichever applies. On a direct mass basis, the average 
VOC emission percentage is determined by the equation presented in 
article (i) of this paragraph. On a density-corrected liquid volume 
basis, the average VOC emission percentage is determined by the 
following equation:

the collective VOC solvent amounts pertaining to all the combined 
facilities.

    (f) The owner or operator may choose to show compliance of the 
combined performance of existing and affected facilities controlled in

existing facilities is not required for this option. The combined 
performance is determined by one of the following procedures:
    (1) If any of the combined facilities uses both waterborne and 
solvent-borne ink systems, the combined average VOC emission percentage 
must be determined on a direct mass basis according to paragraph (b) or 
(d) of this section, whichever applies, with the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.308

    (2) If all of the combined facilities use only solvent-borne ink 
systems, the owner or operator may choose to determine performance 
either on a direct mass basis or a density-corrected liquid volume basis 
according to paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, whichever applies. On 
a direct mass basis, the average VOC emission percentage is determined 
by the equation presented in article (i) of this paragraph. On a 
density-corrected liquid volume basis, the average VOC emission 
percentage is determined by the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.029

plant boundary use waterborne ink systems or solvent-borne ink systems 
with solvent recovery systems, the owner or operator may choose to show 
compliance on a plantwide basis for all the existing and affected 
facilities together. No separate emission tests on existing facilities 
and no temporary segregated liquid measurement procedures for affected 
facilities are required for this option. The plantwide performance is 
determined by one of the following procedures:

[[Page 422]]

    (1) If any of the facilities use waterborne ink systems, the total 
plant average VOC emission percentage must be determined on a direct 
mass basis according to paragraph (b) of this section with the following 
equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.030

Where (M<INF>t)<INF>f and (M<INF>v)<INF>f are 
the collective VOC solvent and water amounts used at all the subject 
plant facilities during the performance test.

    (2) If all of the plant facilities use only solvent-borne ink 
systems, the owner or operator may choose to determine performance 
either on a direct mass basis or a density-corrected liquid volume basis 
according to paragraph (c) of this section. On a direct mass basis, the 
total plant average VOC emission percentage is determined by the 
equation presented in article (i) of this paragraph. On a density-
corrected liquid volume basis, the total plant average VOC emission 
percentage is determined by the following equation:

Sec. 60.434  Monitoring of operations and recordkeeping.

    (a) After completion of the performance test required under Sec. 
60.8, the owner or operator of any affected facility using waterborne 
ink systems or solvent-borne ink systems with solvent recovery systems 
shall record the amount of solvent and water used, solvent recovered, 
and estimated emission percentage for each performance averaging period 
and shall maintain these records for 2 years. The emission percentage is 
estimated as follows:
    (1) The performance averaging period for monitoring of proper 
operation and maintenance is a calendar month or 4 consecutive weeks, at 
the option of the owner or operator.
    (2) If affected facilities share the same raw ink storage/handling 
system with existing facilities, solvent and water used, solvent 
recovered, and emission percentages for the combined facilities may be 
documented. Separate emission percentages for only the affected 
facilities are not required in this case. The combined emission 
percentage is compared to the overall average for the existing and 
affected facilities' emission percentage determined during the most 
recent performance test.
    (3) Except as provided in article (4) of this paragraph, 
temperatures and liquid densities determined during the most recent 
performance test are used to calculate corrected volumes and mass 
quantities.
    (4) The owner or operator may choose to measure temperatures for 
determination of actual liquid densities during each performance 
averaging period. A different base temperature may be used for each 
performance averaging period if desired by the owner or operator.
    (5) The emission percentage is calculated according to the 
procedures under Sec. 60.433 (b) through (g), whichever applies, or by 
a comparable calculation which compares the total solvent recovered to 
the total solvent used at the affected facility.

Sec. 60.442  Standard for volatile organic compounds.

    (a) On and after the date on which the performance test required by 
Sec. 60.8 has been completed each owner or operator subject to this 
subpart shall:
    (1) Cause the discharge into the atmosphere from an affected 
facility not more than 0.20 kg VOC/kg of coating solids applied as 
calculated on a weighted average basis for one calendar month; or

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.032

    (3) For each affected facility where the value of G is less than or 
equal to 0.20 kg VOC per kg of coating solids applied, the affected 
facility is in compliance with Sec. 60.442(a)(1).
    (b) To determine compliance with Sec. 60.442(a)(2), the owner or 
operator shall calculate the required overall VOC emission reduction 
according to the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.033


If R<INF>q is less than or equal to 90 percent, then the required 
overall VOC emission reduction is R<INF>q. If R<INF>q is 
greater than 90 percent, then the required overall VOC emission 
reduction is 90 percent.
    (c) Where compliance with the emission limits specified in Sec. 
60.442(a)(2) is achieved through the use of a solvent recovery system, 
the owner or operator shall determine the overall VOC emission reduction 
for a one calendar month period by the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.034


If the R value is equal to or greater than the R<INF>q value 
specified in paragraph (b) of this section, then compliance with Sec. 
60.442(a)(2) is demonstrated.
    (d) Where compliance with the emission limit specified in Sec. 
60.442(a)(2) is achieved through the use of a solvent destruction 
device, the owner or operator shall determine calendar monthly 
compliance by comparing the monthly required overall VOC emission 
reduction specified in paragraph (b) of this section to the overall VOC 
emission reduction demonstrated in the most recent performance test 
which complied with Sec. 60.442(a)(2). If the monthly required overall 
VOC emission reduction is less than or equal to the overall VOC 
reduction of the most recent performance test, the affected facility is 
in compliance with Sec. 60.442(a)(2).
    (e) Where compliance with Sec. 60.442(a)(2) is achieved through the 
use of a solvent destruction device, the owner or operator shall 
continuously record the destruction device combustion temperature during 
coating operations for thermal incineration destruction devices or the 
gas temperature upstream and downstream of the incinerator catalyst bed 
during coating operations for catalytic incineration destruction 
devices. For thermal incineration destruction devices the owner or 
operator shall record all 3-hour periods (during actual coating 
operations) during which the average temperature of the device is more 
than 28 [deg]C (50 [deg]F) below the average temperature of the device 
during the most recent performance test complying with Sec. 
60.442(a)(2). For catalytic incineration destruction devices, the owner 
or operator shall record all 3-hour periods (during actual coating 
operations) during which the average temperature of the device 
immediately before the catalyst bed is more than 28 [deg]C (50 [deg]F) 
below the average temperature of the device during the most recent 
performance test complying with Sec. 60.442(a)(2), and all 3-hour 
periods (during actual coating operations) during which the average 
temperature difference across the catalyst bed is less than 80 percent 
of the average temperature difference of the device during the most 
recent performance test complying with Sec. 60.442(a)(2).
    (f) After the initial performance test required for all affected 
facilities under Sec. 60.8, compliance with the VOC emission limitation 
and percentage reduction requirements under Sec. 60.442 is based on the 
average emission reduction for one calendar month. A separate compliance 
test is completed at the end of each calendar month after the initial 
performance test, and a new calendar month's average VOC emission 
reduction is calculated to show compliance with the standard.
    (g) If a common emission control device is used to recover or 
destroy solvent from more than one affected facility, the performance of 
that control device is assumed to be equal for each of the affected 
facilities. Compliance with

[[Page 426]]

Sec. 60.442(a)(2) is determined by the methods specified in paragraphs 
(c) and (d) of this section and is performed simultaneously on all 
affected facilities.
    (h) If a common emission control device is used to recover solvent 
from an existing facility (or facilities) as well as from an affected 
facility (or facilities), the overall VOC emission reduction for the 
affected facility (or facilities), for the purpose of compliance, shall 
be determined by the following procedures:
    (1) The owner or operator of the existing facility (or facilities) 
shall determine the mass of solvent recovered for a calendar month 
period from the existing facility (or facilities) prior to the 
connection of the affected facility (or facilities) to the emission 
control device.
    (2) The affected facility (or facilities) shall then be connected to 
the emission control device.
    (3) The owner or operator shall determine the total mass of solvent 
recovered from both the existing and affected facilities over a calendar 
month period. The mass of solvent determined in paragraph (h)(1) of this 
section from the existing facility shall be subtracted from the total 
mass of recovered solvent to obtain the mass of solvent recovered from 
the affected facility (or facilities). The overall VOC emission 
reduction of the affected facility (or facilities) can then be 
determined as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (i) If a common emission control device(s) is used to destruct 
solvent from an existing facility (or facilities) as well as from an 
affected facility (or facilities), the overall VOC emission reduction 
for the affected facility (or facilities), for the purpose of 
compliance, shall be determined by the following procedures:
    (1) The owner or operator shall operate the emission control device 
with both the existing and affected facilities connected.
    (2) The concentration of VOC (in parts per million by volume) after 
the common emission control device shall be determined as specified in 
Sec. 60.444(c). This concentration is used in the calculation of 
compliance for both the existing and affected facilities.
    (3) The volumetric flow out of the common control device 
attributable to the affected facility (or facilities) shall be 
calculated by first determining the ratio of the volumetric flow 
entering the common control device attributable to the affected facility 
(facilities) to the total volumetric flow entering the common control 
device from both existing and affected facilities. The multiplication of 
this ratio by the total volumetric flow out of the common control device 
yields the flow attributable to the affected facility (facilities). 
Compliance is determined by the use of the equation specified in Sec. 
60.444(c).
    (j) Startups and shutdowns are normal operation for this source 
category. Emissions from these operations are to be included when 
determining if the standard specified at Sec. 60.442(a)(2) is being 
attained.

    (iii) For each affected facility where the value of R is greater 
than or equal to the value of R<INF>q calculated in Sec. 
60.443(b), compliance with Sec. 60.442(a)(2) is demonstrated.

compliance with Sec. 60.422(a)(1) shall be determined by either Method 
24 and the equations specified in Sec. 60.443 or by manufacturers' 
formulation data. In the event of any inconsistency between a Method 24 
test and manufacturers' formulation data, the Method 24 test will 
govern. The Administrator may require an owner or operator to perform 
Method 24 tests during such months as he deems appropriate. For Method

exiting the solvent destruction device or its equivalent, and each 
effluent gas stream emitted directly to the atmosphere. Methods 1, 2, 3, 
and 4 shall be used to determine the sampling location, volumetric 
flowrate, molecular weight, and moisture of all sampled gas streams. For 
Method 25, the sampling time for each of three runs must be at least 1 
hour. The minimum sampling volume must be 0.003 dscm except that shorter 
sampling times or smaller volumes, when necessitated by process 
variables or other factors, may be approved by the Administrator.
    (c) If the owner or operator can demonstrate to the Administrator's 
satisfaction that testing of representative stacks yields results 
comparable to those that would be obtained by testing all stacks, the 
Administrator will approve testing of representative stacks on a case-
by-case basis.

Sec. 60.453  Performance test and compliance provisions.

    (a) Sections 60.8 (d) and (f) do not apply to the performance test 
procedures required by this subpart.
    (b) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall conduct an 
initial performance test as required under Sec. 60.8(a) and thereafter

according to the procedures in this paragraph.
    (1) An owner or operator shall use the following procedures for any 
affected facility that does not use a capture system and control device 
to comply with the emissions limit specified under Sec. 60.452. The

Method 24. The owner or operator shall determine the volume of coating 
and the mass of VOC-solvent used for thinning purposes from company 
records on a monthly basis. If a common coating distribution system 
serves more than one affected facility or serves both affected and 
existing facilities, the owner or operator shall estimate the volume of 
coatings used at each facility, by using the average dry weight of 
coating and the surface area coated by each affected and existing 
facility or by other procedures acceptable to the Administrator.
    (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section, the 
weighted average of the total mass of VOC's consumed per unit volume of 
coating solids applied each calendar month will be determined as

Administrator that transfer efficiencies other than those shown are 
appropriate, the Administrator will approve their use on a case-by-case 
basis. Transfer efficiencies for application methods not listed shall be 
determined by the Administrator on a case-by-case basis. An owner or 
operator must submit sufficient data for the Administrator to judge the 
accuracy of the transfer efficiency claims.

atmosphere for each calendar month (N) is equal to or less than 0.90 
kilogram per liter of applied coating solids, the affected facility is 
in compliance.
    (3) An owner or operator shall use the following procedure for any 
affected facility that uses a control device for VOC recovery (e.g., 
carbon adsorber) to comply with the applicable emission limit specified 
under Sec. 60.452.

Administrator or when the owner or operator elects to operate the 
control device or capture system at conditions different from the 
initial performance test.
    (A) Determine the fraction (F) of total VOC's emitted by an affected 
facility that enters the control device using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.035

                                                              Equation 5

Where:

l is the number of gas streams entering the control device, and
p is the number of gas streams emitted directly to the atmosphere.

    (B) Determine the destruction efficiency of the control device (E) 
using values of the volumetric flow rate of each of the gas streams and 
the VOC content (as carbon) of each of the gas streams in and out of the 
device by the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.036

                                                              Equation 6

Where:

n is the number of gas streams entering the control device, and
m is the number of gas streams leaving the control device and entering 
the atmosphere.


The owner or operator of the affected facility shall construct the VOC 
emission reduction system so that all volumetric flow rates and total 
VOC emissions can be accurately determined by the applicable test 
methods and procedures specified in Sec. 60.466. The owner or operator 
of the affected facility shall

[[Page 438]]

construct a temporary enclosure around the coating applicator and 
flashoff area during the performance test for the purpose of evaluating 
the capture efficiency of the system. The enclosure must be maintained 
at a negative pressure to ensure that all VOC emissions are measurable. 
If a permanent enclosure exists in the affected facility prior to the 
performance test and the Administrator is satisfied that the enclosure 
is adequately containing VOC emissions, no additional enclosure is 
required for the performance test.
    (C) Determine overall reduction efficiency (R) using the following 
equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.045


If the overall reduction efficiency (R) is equal to or greater than 
0.90, the affected facility is in compliance and no further computations 
are necessary. If the overall reduction efficiency (R) is less than 
0.90, the average total VOC emissions to the atmosphere per unit volume 
of coating solids applied (N) shall be computed as follows.
    (ii) Calculate the volume-weighted average of the total mass of 
VOC's per unit volume of coating solids applied (G) during each calendar 
month for each affected facility using equations in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) 
(A), (B), and (C) of this section.
    (iii) Calculate the volume-weighted average of VOC emissions to the 
atmosphere (N) during each calendar month by the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.046

    (iv) If the volume-weighted average mass of VOC's emitted to the 
atmosphere for each calendar month (N) is less than or equal to 0.14 kg/
l of coating solids applied, the affected facility is in compliance. 
Each monthly calculation is a performance test.
    (3) An owner or operator shall use the following procedure for each 
affected facility that uses a control device that recovers the VOC's 
(e.g., carbon adsorber) to comply with the applicable emission limit 
specified under Sec. 60.462(a) (2) or (3).
    (i) Calculate the total mass of VOC's consumed 
(M<INF>o+M<INF>d) during each calendar month for each 
affected facility using equation (1).
    (ii) Calculate the total mass of VOC's recovered (M<INF>r) 
during each calendar month using the following equation:

    (iii) Calculate the overall reduction efficiency of the control 
device (R) for each calendar month for each affected facility using the 
following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.048


If the overall reduction efficiency (R) is equal to or greater than 
0.90, the affected facility is in compliance and no further computations 
are necessary. If the overall reduction efficiency (R) is less than 
0.90, the average total VOC emissions to the atmosphere per unit volume 
of coating solids applied (N) must be computed as follows.
    (iv) Calculate the total volume of coating solids consumed 
(L<INF>s) and the volume-weighted average of the total mass of 
VOC's per unit volume of coating solids applied (G) during each calendar 
month for each affected facility using equations in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) 
(B) and (C) of this section.
    (v) Calculate the volume-weighted average mass of VOC's emitted to 
the atmosphere (N) for each calendar month for each affected facility 
using equation (8).
    (vi) If the weighted average mass of VOC's emitted to the atmosphere 
for each calendar month (N) is less than or equal to 0.14 kg/l of 
coating solids applied, the affected facility is in compliance. Each 
monthly calculation is a performance test.
    (4) An owner or operator shall use the following procedures for each 
affected facility that intermittently uses a capture system and a 
control device to comply with the emission limit specified in Sec. 
60.462(a)(4).
    (i) Calculate the total volume of coating solids applied without the 
control device in operation (L<INF>sn) during each calendar month 
for each affected facility using the following equation:

K=conversion factor, 1000 g/kg [7000 (gr/lb)].

    (2) Method 5A shall be used to determine the particulate matter 
concentration (c<INF>s) and volumetric flow rate (Q<INF>sd) 
of the effluent gas. For a saturator, the sampling time and sample 
volume for each run shall be at least 120 minutes and 3.00 dscm (106 
dscf), and for the blowing still, at least 90 minutes or the duration of 
the coating blow or non-coating blow, whichever is greater, and 2.25 
dscm (79.4 dscf).
    (3) For the saturator, the asphalt roofing production rate (P) for 
each run shall be determined as follows: The amount of asphalt roofing 
produced on the shingle or saturated felt process lines shall be 
obtained by direct measurement. The asphalt roofing production rate is 
the amount produced divided by the time taken for the run.
    (4) For the blowing still, the asphalt charging rate (P) shall be 
computed for each run using the following equation:

P=(Vd)/(K' [thetas])


[[Page 445]]


where:

P=asphalt charging rate to blowing still, Mg/hr (ton/hr).
V=volume of asphalt charged, m\3\ (ft\3\).
d=density of asphalt, kg/m\3\ (lb/ft\3\).
K'=conversion factor, 1000 kg/Mg (2000 lb/ton).
[thetas]=duration of test run, hr.

    (i) The volume (V) of asphalt charged shall be measured by any means 
accurate to within 10 percent.
    (ii) The density (d) of the asphalt shall be computed using the 
following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.015

Where:

d = Density of the asphalt, kg/m\3\ (lb/ft\3\)
K<INF>1 = 1056.1 kg/m\3\ (metric units)
    = 64.70 lb/ft\3\ (English Units)
K<INF>2 = 0.6176 kg/(m\3\ [deg]C) (metric units)
    = 0.0694 lb/(ft\3\ [deg]F) (English Units)
T<INF>i = temperature at the start of the blow, [deg]C ( [deg]F)

    (5) Method 9 and the procedures in Sec. 60.11 shall be used to 
determine opacity.
    (d) The Administrator will determine compliance with the standards 
in Sec. 60.472(a)(3) by using Method 22, modified so that readings are 
recorded every 15 seconds for a period of consecutive observations 
during representative conditions (in accordance with Sec. 60.8(c)) 
totaling 60 minutes. A performance test shall consist of one run.
    (e) The owner or operator shall use the monitoring device in Sec. 
60.473 (a) or (b) to monitor and record continuously the temperature 
during the particulate matter run and shall report the results to the 
Administrator with the performance test results.
    (f) If at a later date the owner or operator believes that the 
emission limits in Sec. 60.472(a) and (b) are being met even though one 
of the conditions listed in this paragraph exist, he may submit a 
written request to the Administrator to repeat the performance test and 
procedure outlined in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (1) The temperature measured in accordance with Sec. 60.473(a) is 
exceeding that measured during the performance test.
    (2) The temperature measured in accordance with Sec. 60.473(b) is 
lower than that measured during the performance test.
    (g) If fuel oil is to be used to fire an afterburner used to control 
emissions from a blowing still, the owner or operator may petition the 
Administrator in accordance with Sec. 60.11(e) of the General 
Provisions to establish an opacity standard for the blowing still that 
will be the opacity standard when fuel oil is used to fire the 
afterburner. To obtain this opacity standard, the owner or operator must 
request the Administrator to determine opacity during an initial, or 
subsequent, performance test when fuel oil is used to fire the 
afterburner. Upon receipt of the results of the performance test, the 
Administrator will make a finding concerning compliance with the mass 
standard for the blowing still. If the Administrator finds that the 
facility was in compliance with the mass standard during the performance 
test but failed to meet the zero opacity standard, the Administrator 
will establish and promulgate in the Federal Register an opacity 
standard for the blowing still that will be the opacity standard when 
fuel oil is used to fire the afterburner. When the afterburner is fired 
with natural gas, the zero percent opacity remains the applicable 
opacity standard.

    (a) In conducting the performance tests required in Sec. 60.8, the 
owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test 
methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as 
specified in this section, except as provided in Sec. 60.8(b).
    (b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
standards in Sec. Sec. 60.482, 60.483, and 60.484 as follows:

[[Page 457]]

    (1) Method 21 shall be used to determine the presence of leaking 
sources. The instrument shall be calibrated before use each day of its 
use by the procedures specified in Method 21. The following calibration 
gases shall be used:
    (i) Zero air (less than 10 ppm of hydrocarbon in air); and
    (ii) A mixture of methane or n-hexane and air at a concentration of 
about, but less than, 10,000 ppm methane or n-hexane.
    (c) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the no 
detectable emission standards in Sec. Sec. 60.482-2(e), 60.482-3(i), 
60.482-4, 60.482-7(f), and 60.482-10(e) as follows:
    (1) The requirements of paragraph (b) shall apply.
    (2) Method 21 shall be used to determine the background level. All 
potential leak interfaces shall be traversed as close to the interface 
as possible. The arithmetic difference between the maximum concentration 
indicated by the instrument and the background level is compared with 
500 ppm for determining compliance.
    (d) The owner or operator shall test each piece of equipment unless 
he demonstrates that a process unit is not in VOC service, i.e., that 
the VOC content would never be reasonably expected to exceed 10 percent 
by weight. For purposes of this demonstration, the following methods and 
procedures shall be used:
    (1) Procedures that conform to the general methods in ASTM E260-73, 
91, or 96, E168-67, 77, or 92, E169-63, 77, or 93 (incorporated by 
reference--see Sec. 60.17) shall be used to determine the percent VOC 
content in the process fluid that is contained in or contacts a piece of 
equipment.
    (2) Organic compounds that are considered by the Administrator to 
have negligible photochemical reactivity may be excluded from the total 
quantity of organic compounds in determining the VOC content of the 
process fluid.
    (3) Engineering judgment may be used to estimate the VOC content, if 
a piece of equipment had not been shown previously to be in service. If 
the Administrator disagrees with the judgment, paragraphs (d) (1) and 
(2) of this section shall be used to resolve the disagreement.
    (e) The owner or operator shall demonstrate that an equipment is in

    Source: 48 FR 38737, Aug. 25, 1983, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 60.490  Applicability and designation of affected facility.

    (a) The provisions of this subpart apply to the following affected 
facilities in beverage can surface coating lines: each exterior base 
coat operation, each overvarnish coating operation, and each inside 
spray coating operation.
    (b) The provisions of this subpart apply to each affected facility 
which is identified in paragraph (a) of this section and commences 
construction, modification, or reconstruction after November 26, 1980.

[[Page 464]]


<R05>
Sec. 60.491  Definitions.

    (a) All terms which are used in this subpart and are not defined 
below are given the same meaning as in the Act and subpart A of this 
part.
    (1) Beverage can means any two-piece steel or aluminum container in 
which soft drinks or beer, including malt liquor, are packaged. The 
definition does not include containers in which fruit or vegetable 
juices are packaged.
    (2) Exterior base coating operation means the system on each 
beverage can surface coating line used to apply a coating to the 
exterior of a two-piece beverage can body. The exterior base coat 
provides corrosion resistance and a background for lithography or 
printing operations. The exterior base coat operation consists of the 
coating application station, flashoff area, and curing oven. The 
exterior base coat may be pigmented or clear (unpigmented).
    (3) Inside spray coating operation means the system on each beverage 
can surface coating line used to apply a coating to the interior of a 
two-piece beverage can body. This coating provides a protective film 
between the contents of the beverage can and the metal can body. The 
inside spray coating operation consists of the coating application 
station, flashoff area, and curing oven. Multiple applications of an 
inside spray coating are considered to be a single coating operation.
    (4) Overvarnish coating operation means the system on each beverage 
can surface coating line used to apply a coating over ink which reduces 
friction for automated beverage can filling equipment, provides gloss, 
and protects the finished beverage can body from abrasion and corrosion. 
The overvarnish coating is applied to two-piece beverage can bodies. The 
overvarnish coating operation consists of the coating application 
station, flashoff area, and curing oven.
    (5) Two-piece can means any beverage can that consists of a body 
manufactured from a single piece of steel or aluminum and a top. 
Coatings for a two-piece can are usually applied after fabrication of 
the can body.
    (6) VOC content means all volatile organic compounds (VOC) that are 
in a coating. VOC content is expressed in terms of kilograms of VOC per 
liter of coating solids.
    (b) Notations used under Sec. 60.493 of this subpart are defined 
below:

M<INF>r=the mass of VOC-solvent recovered by emission control 
device (kilograms)
N=the volume-weighted average mass of VOC emissions to atmosphere per 
unit volume of coating solids applied (kilograms per liter of coating 
solids)
Q<INF>a=the volumetric flow rate of each gas stream leaving the 
control device and entering the atmosphere (dry standard cubic meters 
per hour)
Q<INF>b=the volumetric flow of each gas stream entering the 
control device (dry standard cubic meters per hour)
R=the overall emission reduction efficiency for an affected facility 
(fraction)
S<INF>e=the fraction of VOC in coating and diluent VOC-solvent 
emitted at the coater and flashoff area for a coating operation
S<INF>h=the fraction of VOC in coating and diluent solvent emitted 
at the cure oven for a coating operation

Sec. 60.492  Standards for volatile organic compounds.

    On or after the date on which the initial performance test required 
by Sec. 60.8(a) is completed, no owner or operator subject to the 
provisions of this subpart shall discharge or cause the discharge of VOC 
emissions to the atmoshpere that exceed the following volume-weighted 
calendar-month average emissions:
    (a) 0.29 kilogram of VOC per litre of coating solids from each two-
piece can exterior base coating operation, except clear base coat;
    (b) 0.46 kilogram of VOC per litre of coating solids from each two-
piece can clear base coating operation and from each overvarnish coating 
operation; and
    (c) 0.89 kilogram of VOC per litre of coating solids from each two-
piece can inside spray coating operation.


<R05>
Sec. 60.493  Performance test and compliance provisions.

    (a) Section 60.8(d) does not apply to monthly performance tests and 
Sec. 60.8(f) does not apply to the performance test procedures required 
by this subpart.
    (b) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall conduct an 
initial performance test as required under Sec. 60.8(a) and thereafter 
a performance test each calendar month for each affected facility.
    (1) The owner or operator shall use the following procedures for 
each affected facility that does not use a capture system and a control 
device to comply with the emission limit specified under Sec. 60.492. 
The owner or operator shall determine the VOC-content of the coatings 
from formulation data supplied by the manufacturer of the coating or by 
an analysis of each coating, as received, using Method 24. The 
Administrator may require the owner or operator who uses formulation 
data supplied by the manufacturer of the coating to determine the VOC 
content of coatings using Method 24 or an equivalent or alternative 
method. The owner or operator shall determine from company records the 
volume of coating and the mass of VOC-solvent added to coatings. If a 
common coating distribution system serves more than one affected 
facility or serves both affected and exiting facilities, the owner or 
operator shall estimate the volume of coating used at each facility by 
using the average dry weight of coating, number of cans, and size of 
cans being processed by each affected and existing facility or by other 
procedures acceptable to the Administrator.
    (i) Calculate the volume-weighted average of the total mass of VOC 
per volume of coating solids used during the calendar month for each 
affected facility, except as provided under paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this 
section. The volume-weighted average of the total mass of VOC per volume 
of coating solids used each calendar month will be determined by the 
following procedures.
    (A) Calculate the mass of VOC used (M<INF>o+M<INF>d) 
during the calendar month for the affected facility by the following 
equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.058

[[Sigma]L<INF>djD<INF>dj will be 0 if no VOC solvent is 
added to the coatings, as received.] where n is the number of different 
coatings used during the calendar month and m is the number of different 
diluent VOC-solvents used during the calendar month.

    (B) Calculate the total volume of coating solids used 
(L<INF>s) in the calendar month for the affected facility by the 
following equation:

[[Page 466]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.059

where n is the number of different coatings used during the calendar 
month.

    (C) Calculate the volume-weighted average mass of VOC per volume of 
solids used (G) during the calendar month for the affected facility by 
the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.018

    (ii) Calculate the volume-weighted average of VOC emissions 
discharged to the atmosphere (N) during the calendar month for the 
affected facility by the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.061

    (iii) Where the value of the volume-weighted average mass of VOC per 
volume of solids discharged to the atmosphere (N) is equal to or less 
than the applicable emission limit specified under Sec. 60.492, the 
affected facility is in compliance.
    (iv) If each individual coating used by an affected facility has a 
VOC content equal to or less than the limit specified under Sec. 
60.492, the affected facility is in compliance provided no VOC-solvents 
are added to the coating during distribution or application.
    (2) An owner or operator shall use the following procedures for each 
affected facility that uses a capture system and a control device that 
destroys VOC (e.g., incinerator) to comply with the emission limit 
specified under Sec. 60.492.
    (i) Determine the overall reduction efficiency (R) for the capture 
system and control device.

For the initial performance test, the overall reduction efficiency (R) 
shall be determined as prescribed in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) (A), (B), and 
(C) of this section. In subsequent months, the owner or operator may use 
the most recently determined overall reduction efficiency for the 
performance test providing control device and capture system operating 
conditions have not changed. The procedure in paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (A), 
(B), and (C) of this section, shall be repeated when directed by the 
Administrator or when the owner or operator elects to operate the 
control device or capture system at conditions different from the 
initial performance test.
    (A) Determine the fraction (F) of total VOC used by the affected 
facility that enters the control device using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.062

where H<INF>e an H<INF>h shall be determined by a method 
that has been previously approved by the Administrator. The owner or 
operator may use the values of S<INF>e and S<INF>h specified 
in Table 1 or other values determined by a method that has been 
previously approved by the Administrator.

<R05>
Sec. 60.503  Test methods and procedures.

    (a) In conducting the performance tests required in Sec. 60.8, the 
owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test 
methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as 
specified in this section, except as provided in Sec. 60.8(b). The 
three-run requirement of Sec. 60.8(f) does not apply to this subpart.
    (b) Immediately before the performance test required to determine 
compliance with Sec. 60.502 (b), (c), and (h), the owner or operator 
shall use Method 21 to monitor for leakage of vapor all potential 
sources in the terminal's vapor collection system equipment while a 
gasoline tank truck is being loaded. The owner or operator shall repair 
all leaks with readings of 10,000 ppm (as methane) or greater before 
conducting the performance test.

[[Page 472]]

    (c) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
standards in Sec. 60.502 (b) and (c) as follows:
    (1) The performance test shall be 6 hours long during which at least 
300,000 liters of gasoline is loaded. If this is not possible, the test 
may be continued the same day until 300,000 liters of gasoline is loaded 
or the test may be resumed the next day with another complete 6-hour 
period. In the latter case, the 300,000-liter criterion need not be met. 
However, as much as possible, testing should be conducted during the 6-
hour period in which the highest throughput normally occurs.
    (2) If the vapor processing system is intermittent in operation, the 
performance test shall begin at a reference vapor holder level and shall 
end at the same reference point. The test shall include at least two 
startups and shutdowns of the vapor processor. If this does not occur 
under automatically controlled operations, the system shall be manually 
controlled.
    (3) The emission rate (E) of total organic compounds shall be 
computed using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.063

where:

E=emission rate of total organic compounds, mg/liter of gasoline loaded.
V<INF>esi=volume of air-vapor mixture exhausted at each interval 
``i'', scm.
C<INF>ei=concentration of total organic compounds at each interval 
``i'', ppm.
L=total volume of gasoline loaded, liters.
n=number of testing intervals.
i=emission testing interval of 5 minutes.
K=density of calibration gas, 1.83x10\6\ for propane and 2.41x10\6\ for 
butane, mg/scm.

    (4) The performance test shall be conducted in intervals of 5 
minutes. For each interval ``i'', readings from each measurement shall 
be recorded, and the volume exhausted (V<INF>esi) and the 
corresponding average total organic compounds concentration 
(C<INF>ei) shall be determined. The sampling system response time 
shall be considered in determining the average total organic compounds 
concentration corresponding to the volume exhausted.
    (5) The following methods shall be used to determine the volume 
(V<INF>esi) air-vapor mixture exhausted at each interval:
    (i) Method 2B shall be used for combustion vapor processing systems.
    (ii) Method 2A shall be used for all other vapor processing systems.
    (6) Method 25A or 25B shall be used for determining the total 
organic compounds concentration (C<INF>ei) at each interval. The 
calibration gas shall be either propane or butane. The owner or operator 
may exclude the methane and ethane content in the exhaust vent by any 
method (e.g., Method 18) approved by the Administrator.
    (7) To determine the volume (L) of gasoline dispensed during the 
performance test period at all loading racks whose vapor emissions are 
controlled by the processing system being tested, terminal records or 
readings from gasoline dispensing meters at each loading rack shall be 
used.
    (d) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
standard in Sec. 60.502(h) as follows:
    (1) A pressure measurement device (liquid manometer, magnehelic 
gauge, or equivalent instrument), capable of measuring up to 500 mm of 
water gauge pressure with <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.5 mm of water 
precision, shall be calibrated and installed on the terminal's vapor 
collection system at a pressure tap located as close as possible to the 
connection with the gasoline tank truck.
    (2) During the performance test, the pressure shall be recorded 
every 5 minutes while a gasoline truck is being loaded; the highest 
instantaneous pressure that occurs during each loading shall also be 
recorded. Every loading position must be tested at least once during the 
performance test.
    (e) The performance test requirements of paragraph (c) of this 
section do not apply to flares defined in Sec. 60.501 and meeting the 
requirements in Sec. 60.18(b) through (f). The owner or operator shall 
demonstrate that the flare and associated vapor collection system is in 
compliance with the requirements in Sec. Sec. 60.18(b) through (f) and 
60.503(a), (b), and (d).
    (f) The owner or operator shall use alternative test methods and 
procedures in accordance with the alternative test method provisions in

[[Page 473]]

Sec. 60.8(b) for flares that do not meet the requirements in Sec. 
60.18(b).

this section, the Administrator shall give written notice to the 
manufacturer setting forth the basis for his determination.
    (k)(1) A model line must be recertified whenever any change is made 
in the design submitted pursuant to Sec. 60.533(b)(3) that is presumed 
to affect the particulate emission rate for that model line. The 
Administrator may waive this requirement upon written request by the 
manufacturer, if he determines that the change may not reasonably be 
anticipated to cause wood heaters in the model line to exceed the 
applicable emission limits. The granting of such a waiver does not 
relieve the manufacturer of any compliance obligations under this 
subpart.
    (2) Any change in the indicated tolerances of any of the following 
components (where such components are applicable) is presumed to affect 
particulate emissions if that change exceeds <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.64

    (ii) Door and catalyst bypass gaskets.

[[Page 479]]

    (4) A change in the make, model, or composition of a catalyst is 
presumed to affect emissions, unless the change has been approved in 
advance by the Administrator, based on test data that demonstrate that 
the replacement catalyst is equivalent to or better than the original 
catalyst in terms of particulate emission reduction.
    (l)(1) The Administrator may revoke certification if he determines 
that the wood heaters being produced in that model line do not comply 
with the requirements of this section or Sec. 60.532. Such a 
determination shall be based on all available evidence, including:

paragraph (o) (2) or (3), as applicable, if a test failure results 
during any test conducted under a modified schedule.
    (6) If emissions tests under paragraph (o) of this section are 
conducted at an altitude different from the altitude at which 
certification tests were conducted, and are not conducted under 
pressurized conditions, the results shall be adjusted for altitude in 
accordance with paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section.
    (p)(1)(i) The Administrator shall after July 1, 1990, select for 
random compliance audit testing certified wood heater model lines that 
have not already been subject to a random compliance audit under this 
paragraph. The Administrator shall not select more than one model line 
under this program for every five model lines for which certification is 
granted under Sec. 60.533(e) to meet the emission limits in Sec. 
60.532(b). No accredited laboratory shall test or bear the expense of 
testing, as provided in the contract described in paragraph (g) of this 
section, more than one model line from every five model lines tested by 
the laboratory for which certification was granted. The Administrator 
shall use a procedure that ensures that the selection process is random.
    (ii) The Administrator may, by means of a neutral selection scheme, 
select model lines certified under Sec. 60.533(e) or Sec. 60.533(h) 
for selective enforcement audit testing under this paragraph. Prior to 
July 1, 1990, the Administrator shall only select a model line for a 
selective enforcement audit on the basis of information indicating that 
affected facilities within the model line may exceed the applicable 
emission limit in Sec. 60.532.
    (2) The Administrator shall randomly select for audit testing five 
production wood heaters from each model line selected under paragraph 
(p)(1) of this section. These wood heaters shall be selected from 
completed units ready for shipment from the manufacturer's facility 
(whether or not the units are in a package or container). The wood 
heaters shall be sealed upon selection and remain sealed until they are 
tested or until the audit is completed. The wood heaters shall be 
numbered in the order that they were selected.
    (3)(i) The Administrator shall test, or direct the manufacturer to 
test, the first of the five wood heaters selected under paragraph (p)(2) 
of this section in a laboratory accredited under Sec. 60.535 that is 
selected pursuant to paragraph (p)(4) of this section.
    (ii) The expense of the random compliance audit test shall be the 
responsibility of the wood heater manufacturer. A manufacturer may 
require the laboratory that performed the certification test to bear the 
expense of a random compliance audit test by means of the contract 
required under paragraph (g) of this section. If the laboratory with 
which the manufacturer had a contract has ceased business due

[[Page 481]]

to bankruptcy or is otherwise legally unable to honor the contract, the 
Administrator will not select any of that manufacturer's model lines for 
which certification testing has been conducted by that laboratory for a 
random compliance audit test.
    (iii) The test shall be conducted using the same test method and 
procedure used to obtain certification. If the certification test 
consisted of more than one particulate sampling test method, the 
Adminstrator may use either one of these methods for the purpose of 
audit testing. If the test is performed in a pressure vessel, air 
pressure in the pressure vessel shall be maintained within 1 percent of 
the average of the barometric pressures recorded for each individual 
test run used to calculate the weighted average emission rate for the 
certification test. The Administrator shall notify the manufacturer at 
least one week prior to any test under this paragraph, and allow the 
manufacturer and/or his authorized representatives to observe the test.
    (4)(i) Except as provided in this paragraph, the Administrator may 
select any accredited laboratory for audit testing.
    (ii)(A) The Administrator shall select the accredited laboratory 
that performed the test used to obtain certification for audit testing, 
until the Administrator has amended this subpart, based upon a 
determination pursuant to paragraph (p)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, to 
allow testing at another laboratory. If another laboratory is selected 
pursuant to this paragraph, and the overall precision of the test method 
and procedure is greater than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 gram per hour 
(<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.0022 lb per hour) of the weighted average at 
laboratories below 304 meters (1,000 feet) elevation (or equivalent), 
the interlaboratory component of the precision shall be added to the 
applicable emissions standard for the purposes of this paragraph.
    (B) [Reserved]
    (iii) The Administrator shall not select an accredited laboratory 
that is located at an elevation more than 152 meters (500 feet) higher 
than the elevation of the laboratory which performed the test used to 
obtain certification, unless the audit test is performed in a pressure 
vessel.
    (5)(i) If emissions from a wood heater tested under paragraph (p)(3) 
of this section exceed the applicable weighted average emission limit by 
more than 50 percent, the Administrator shall so notify the manufacturer 
that certification for that model line is suspended effective 72 hours 
from the receipt of the notice, unless the suspension notice is 
withdrawn by the Administrator. The suspension shall remain in effect 
until withdrawn by the Administrator, or 30 days from its effective date 
(if a revocation notice under paragraph (p)(5)(ii) of this section is 
not issued within that period), or the date of final agency action on 
revocation, whichever occurs earlier.
    (ii)(A) If emissions from a wood heater tested under paragraph 
(p)(3) of this section exceed the applicable weighted average emission 
limit, the Administrator shall notify the manufacturer that 
certification is revoked for that model line.
    (B) A revocation notice under paragraph (p)(5)(ii)(A) shall become 
final and effective 60 days after receipt by the manufacturer, unless it 
is withdrawn, a hearing is requested under Sec. 60.539, or the deadline 
for requesting a hearing is extended.
    (C) The Administrator may extend the deadline for requesting a 
hearing for up to 60 days for good cause.
    (D) A manufacturer may extend the deadline for requesting a hearing 
for up to six months, by agreeing to a voluntary suspension of 
certification.
    (iii) Any notification under paragraph (p)(5)(i) or (p)(5)(ii) of 
this section shall include a copy of a preliminary test report from the 
accredited laboratory. The accredited laboratory shall provide a 
preliminary test report to the Administrator within 10 days of the 
completion of testing, if a wood heater exceeds the applicable emission 
limit in Sec. 60.532. The laboratory shall provide the Administrator 
and the manufacturer, within 30 days of the completion of testing, all 
documentation pertaining to the test, including the complete test report 
and raw data sheets, laboratory technician notes, and test results for 
all test runs.
    (iv) Upon receiving notification of a test failure under paragraph 
(p)(5)(ii) of this section, the manufacturer may

[[Page 482]]

submit some or all of the remaining four wood heaters selected under 
paragraph (p)(2) of this section for testing at his own expense, in the 
order they were selected by the Administrator, at the laboratory that 
performed the emissions test for the Administrator.
    (v) Whether or not the manufacturer proceeds under paragraph 
(p)(5)(iv) of this section, the manufacturer may submit any relevant 
information to the Administrator, including any other test data 
generated pursuant to this subpart. The manufacturer shall pay the 
expense of any testing performed for him.
    (vi) The Administrator shall withdraw any notice issued under 
paragraph (p)(5)(ii) of this section if tests under paragraph (p)(5)(iv) 
of this section show either--
    (A) That all four wood heaters tested for the manufacturer met the 
applicable weighted average emission limits, or
    (B) That the second and third wood heaters selected met the 
applicable weighted average emission limits and the average of all three 
weighted averages (including the original audit test) was below the 
applicable weighted average emission limits.
    (vii) The Administrator may withdraw any proposed revocation, if the 
Administrator finds that an audit test failure has been rebutted by 
information submitted by the manufacturer under paragraph (p)(5)(iv) of 
this section and/or (p)(5)(v) of this section or by any other relevant 
information available to him.
    (viii) Any withdrawal of a proposed revocation shall be accompanied 
by a document setting forth its basis.

Sec. 60.534  Test methods and procedures.

    Test methods and procedures in appendix A of this part, except as 
provided under Sec. 60.8(b), shall be used to determine compliance with 
the standards and requirements for certification under Sec. Sec. 60.532 
and 60.533 as follows:
    (a) Method 28 shall be used to establish the certification test 
conditions and the particulate matter weighted emission values.
    (b) Emission concentrations may be measured with either:
    (1) Method 5G, if a dilution tunnel sampling location is used, or
    (2) Method 5H, if a stack location is used.
    (c) Method 28A shall be used to determine that a wood combustion 
unit qualifies under the definition of wood heater in Sec. 60.531(a). 
If such a determination is necessary, this test shall be conducted by an 
accredited laboratory.
    (d) Appendix J is used as an optional procedure in establishing the 
overall thermal efficiency of wood heaters. (To be proposed separately.)
    (e)(1) The manufacturer of an affected facility shall notify the 
Administrator of the date that certification testing is scheduled to 
begin. (A notice from the testing lab containing the information 
required in Sec. 60.533(f)(1) may be used to satisfy this requirement.) 
This notice shall be at least 30 days before the start of testing. The 
notification of testing shall be in writing, and include the 
manufacturer's name and address, the testing laboratory's name, the 
model name and number (or, if unavailable, some other way to distinguish 
between models), and the dates of testing.
    (2) Any emission testing conducted on the wood heater for which 
notice was delivered shall be presumed to be certification testing if 
such testing occurs on or after the scheduled date of testing and before 
a test report is submitted to the Administrator. If certification 
testing is interrupted for more than 24 hours, the laboratory shall 
notify the Administrator by telephone, as soon as practicable, and also 
by letter, stating why the testing was interrupted and when it is 
expected to be resumed.
    (3) A manufacturer or laboratory may change the date that testing is 
scheduled to begin by notifying the Administrator at least 14 days 
before the start of testing. Notification of schedule change shall be 
made at least two working days prior to the originally scheduled test 
date. This notice of rescheduling shall be made by telephone or other 
expeditious means and shall be

[[Page 483]]

documented in writing and sent concurrently.
    (4) A model line may be withdrawn from testing before the 
certification test is complete, provided the wood heater is sealed in 
accordance with Sec. 60.535(g). The manufacturer shall notify the 
Administrator 30 days before the resumption of testing.
    (5) The manufacturer or laboratory shall notify the Administrator if 
a test is not completed within the time allotted as set forth in the 
notice of testing. The notification shall be made by the end of the 
allotted testing period by telephone or other expeditious means, and 
documented in writing sent concurrently, and shall contain the dates 
when the test will be resumed. Unless otherwise approved by the 
Administrator, failure to conduct a certification test as scheduled 
without notifying the Administrator of any schedule change 14 days prior 
to the schedule or revised test dates will result in voiding the 
notification. In the case of a voided notification, the manufacturer 
shall provide the Administrator with a second notification at least 30 
days prior to the new test dates. The Administrator may waive the 
requirement for advance notice for test resumptions.
    (f) The testing laboratory shall allow the manufacturer to observe 
certification testing. However, manufacturers shall not involve 
themselves in the conduct of the test after the pretest burn (as defined 
by EPA Method 28) has begun. Communications between the manufacturer and 
laboratory personnel regarding operation of the wood heater shall be 
limited to written communications transmitted prior to the first pretest 
burn of the certification series. Written communications between the 
manufacturer and laboratory personnel may be exchanged during the 
certification test only if deviations from the test procedures are 
observed that constitute improper conduct of the test. All 
communications shall be included in the test documentation required to 
be submitted under Sec. 60.533(b)(4) and shall be consistent with 
instructions provided in the owner's manual required under Sec. 
60.536(k), except to the extent that they address details of the 
certification tests that would not be relevant to owners.

authority to the Environmental Appeals Board does not preclude the 
Environmental Appeals Board from referring an appeal or a motion filed 
under this part to the Administrator for decision when the Environmental 
Appeals Board, in its discretion, deems it appropriate to do so. When an 
appeal or motion is referred to the Administrator, all parties shall be 
so notified and the rules in this section referring to the Environmental 
Appeals Board shall be interpreted as referring to the Administrator. On 
appeal from or review of the initial decision, the Environmental Appeals 
Board shall have all the powers that it would have in making the initial 
decision including the discretion to require or allow briefs, oral 
argument, the taking of additional evidence or the remanding to the 
Presiding Officer for additional proceedings. The decision by the 
Environmental Appeals Board shall include written findings and 
conclusions and the reasons or basis therefor on all the material issues 
of fact, law, or discretion presented on the appeal or considered in the 
review.
    (3) In any hearing requested under paragraph (a)(2) of this section 
the Presiding Officer shall render his initial decision within 60 days 
of that request. Any appeal to the Environmental Appeals Board shall be 
taken within 10 days of the initial decision, and the Environmental 
Appeals Board shall render its decision in the appeal within 30 days of 
the filing of the appeal.

mechanical means, to provide access for permanent mechanical or 
electrical equipment, or to direct air flow into the enclosure. A 
permanent opening is not equipped with a door or other means of 
obstruction of air flow.
    Sidewall cementing operation means the system used to apply cement 
to a continuous strip of sidewall component or any other continuous 
strip component (except combined tread/sidewall component) that is 
incorporated into the sidewall of a finished tire. A sidewall cementing 
operation consists of a cement application station and all other 
equipment, such as the cement supply system and feed and takeaway 
conveyors, necessary to apply cement to sidewall strips or other 
continuous strip component (except combined tread/sidewall component) 
and to allow evaporation of solvent from the cemented rubber.
    Temporary opening means an opening into an enclosure that is 
equipped with a means of obstruction, such as a door, window, or port, 
that is normally closed.
    Tire means any agricultural, airplane, industrial, mobile home, 
light-duty truck and/or passenger vehicle tire that has a bead diameter 
less than or equal to 0.5 meter (m) (19.7 inches) and a cross section 
dimension less than or equal to 0.325 m (12.8 in.), and that is mass 
produced in an assembly-line fashion.
    Tread end cementing operation means the system used to apply cement 
to one or both ends of the tread or combined tread/sidewall component. A 
tread end cementing operation consists of a cement application station

Sec. 60.543  Performance test and compliance provisions.

    (a) Section 60.8(d) does not apply to the monthly performance test 
procedures required by this subpart. Section 60.8(d) does apply to 
initial performance tests and to the performance tests specified under 
paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section. Section 60.8(f) does not 
apply when Method 24 is used.
    (b) Performance tests shall be conducted as follows:
    (1) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall conduct an 
initial performance test, as required under Sec. 60.8(a), except as 
described under paragraph (j) of this section. The owner or operator of 
an affected facility shall thereafter conduct a performance test each 
month, except as described under paragraphs (b)(4), (g)(1), and (j) of 
this section. Initial and monthly performance tests shall be conducted 
according to the procedures in this section.
    (2) The owner or operator of an affected facility who elects to use 
a VOC emission reduction system with a control device that destroys VOC 
(e.g., incinerator), as described under paragraphs (f) and (g) of this 
section, shall repeat the performance test when directed by the 
Administrator or when the owner or operator elects to operate the 
capture system or control device at conditions different from the most 
recent determination of overall reduction efficiency. The performance 
test shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures described 
under paragraphs (f)(2) (i) through (iv) of this section.
    (3) The owner or operator of an affected facility who seeks to 
comply with the equipment design and performance specifications, as 
described under paragraph (j) of this section, shall repeat the 
performance test when directed by the Administrator or when the owner or 
operator elects to operate the capture system or control device at 
conditions different from the most recent determination of control 
device efficiency or measurement of capture system retention time or 
face velocity. The performance test shall be conducted in accordance 
with the procedures described under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this 
section.
    (4) The owner or operator of each tread end cementing operation and 
each green tire spraying operation using only water-based sprays (inside 
and/or outside) containing less than 1.0 percent, by weight, of VOC is 
not required to conduct a monthly performance test as described in 
paragraph (d) of this section. In lieu of conducting a monthly 
performance test, the owner or operator of each tread end cementing 
operation and each green tire spraying operation shall submit 
formulation data or the results of Method 24 analysis annually to verify 
the VOC content of each tread end cement and each green tire spray 
material, provided the spraying formulation has not changed during the 
previous 12 months. If the spray material formulation changes, 
formulation data or Method 24 analysis of the new spray shall be 
conducted to determine the VOC content of the spray and reported within 
30 days as required under Sec. 60.546(j).

[[Page 497]]

    (c) For each undertread cementing operation, each sidewall cementing 
operation, each green tire spraying operation where organic solvent-
based sprays are used, each Michelin-A operation, each Michelin-B 
operation, and each Michelin-C-automatic operation where the owner or 
operator seeks to comply with the uncontrolled monthly VOC use limits, 
the owner or operator shall use the following procedure to determine 
compliance with the applicable (depending upon duration of compliance 
period) uncontrolled monthly VOC use limit specified under Sec. 
60.542(a) (1)(ii), (2)(ii), (6)(ii), (7)(iv), (8)(ii), (9)(ii), and 
(10)(ii). If both undertread cementing and sidewall cementing are 
performed at the same affected facility during a month, then the kg/mo 
limit specified under Sec. 60.542(a)(1)(ii) shall apply for that month.
    (1) Determine the density and weight fraction VOC (including 
dilution VOC) of each cement or green tire spray from its formulation or 
by analysis of the cement or green tire spray using Method 24. If a

material cemented or sprayed at all other facilities served by the 
common distribution system for the month or by another procedure 
acceptable to the Administrator.
    (C) Calculate the total monthly mass of VOC used at the affected 
facility for the month (M<INF>o):

inside

[[Page 498]]

green tire sprays, T<INF>o equals the number of green tires that 
receive an application of water-based inside green tire spray for the 
month.
    (iii) For a green tire spraying operation that uses water-based 
outside green tire sprays, T<INF>o equals the number of green 
tires that receive an application of water-based outside green tire

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.065

    (5) Calculate the mass of VOC emitted per bead cemented at the 
affected facility for the month (N<INF>b):

    (1) Calculate the mass of VOC used per tire cemented at the affected 
facility for the month (G), as specified under paragraphs (d) (1) 
through (4) of this section, or mass of VOC used per bead cemented at 
the affected facility for the month (G<INF>b), as specified under 
paragraphs (e) (1) through (4) of this section.
    (2) Calculate the mass of VOC emitted per tire cemented at the 
affected facility for the month (N) or mass of VOC emitted per bead 
cemented for the affected facility for the month (N<INF>b):

N = G (1-R)
N<INF>b = G<INF>b (1-R)


For the initial performance test, the overall reduction efficiency (R) 
shall be determined as prescribed under paragraphs (f)(2) (i) through 
(iv) of this section. After the initial performance test, the owner or 
operator may use the most recently determined overall reduction 
efficiency (R) for the performance test. No monthly performance tests 
are required. The performance test shall be repeated during conditions 
described under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (i) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall construct a 
temporary enclosure around the application and drying areas during the 
performance test for the purpose of capturing fugitive VOC emissions. 
The enclosure must be maintained at a negative pressure to ensure that 
all evaporated VOC are measurable. Determine the fraction 
(F<INF>c) of total VOC used at the affected facility that enters 
the control device:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.040

Where:

``m'' is the number of vents from the affected facility to the control 
device, and ``n'' is the number of vents from the affected facility to 
the atmosphere and from the temporary enclosure.

[[Page 499]]

using values of the volumetric flow rate of each of the gas streams and 
the VOC content (as carbon) of each of the gas streams in and out of the 
control device:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.041

Where:

``m'' is the number of vents from the affected facility to the control 
device, and ``p'' is the number of vents after the control device.

    (iii) Determine the overall reduction efficiency (R):

R = EF<INF>c

    (iv) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall have the 
option of substituting the following procedure as an acceptable 
alternative to the requirements prescribed under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of 
this section. This alternative procedure is acceptable only in cases 
where a single VOC is used and is present in the capture system. The 
average capture efficiency value derived from a minimum of three runs 
shall constitute a test.
    (A) For each run, ``i,'' measure the mass of the material containing 
a single VOC used. This measurement shall be made using a scale that has 
both a calibration and a readability to within 1 percent of the mass 
used during the run. This measurement may be made by filling the direct 
supply reservoir (e.g., trough, tray, or drum that is integral to the 
operation) and related application equipment (e.g., rollers, pumps, 
hoses) to a marked level at the start of the run and then refilling to 
the same mark from a more easily weighed container (e.g., separate 
supply drum) at the end of the run. The change in mass of the supply 
drum would equal the mass of material used from the direct supply 
reservoir. Alternatively, this measurement may be made by weighing the 
direct supply reservoir at the start and end of the run or by weighing 
the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the 
start and end of the run. The change in mass would equal the mass of the 
material used in the run. If only the direct supply reservoir is 
weighed, the amount of material in or on the related application 
equipment must be the same at the start and end of the run. All 
additions of VOC containing material made to the direct supply reservoir 
during a run must be properly accounted for in determining the mass of 
material used during that run.
    (B) For each run, ``i,'' measure the mass of the material containing 
a single VOC which is present in the direct supply reservoir and related 
application equipment at the start of the run, unless the ending weight 
fraction VOC in the material is greater than or equal to 98.5 percent of 
the starting weight fraction VOC in the material, in which case, this 
measurement is not required. This measurement may be made directly by 
emptying the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment 
and then filling them to a marked level from an easily weighed container 
(e.g. separate supply drum). The change in mass of the supply drum would 
equal the mass of material in the filled direct supply reservoir and 
related application equipment. Alternatively, this measurement may be 
made by weighing the direct supply reservoir and related application 
equipment at the start of the run and subtracting the mass of the empty 
direct supply reservoir and related application equipment (tare weight).
    (C) For each run, ``i,'' the starting weight fraction VOC in the 
material shall be determined by Method 24 analysis of a sample taken 
from the direct supply reservoir at the beginning of the run.
    (D) For each run, ``i,'' the ending weight fraction VOC in the 
material shall be determined by Method 24 analysis of a sample taken 
from the direct supply reservoir at the end of the run.
    (E) For each run, ``i,'' in which the ending weight fraction VOC in 
the material is greater than or equal to 98.5 percent of the starting 
weight fraction VOC in the material, calculate the mass of the single 
VOC used (Mi) by multiplying the mass of the material used in the run by 
the starting weight fraction VOC of the material used in the run.

[[Page 500]]

    (F) For each run, ``i,'' in which the ending weight fraction VOC in 
the material is less than 98.5 percent of the starting weight fraction 
VOC in the material, calculate the mass of the single VOC used 
(M<INF>i) as follows:
    (1) Calculate the mass of VOC present in the direct supply reservoir 
and related application equipment at the start of the run by multiplying 
the mass of material in the direct supply reservoir and related 
application equipment at the start of the run by the starting weight 
fraction VOC in the material for that run.
    (2) Calculate the mass of VOC present in the direct supply reservoir 
and related application equipment at the end of the run by multiplying 
the mass of material in the direct supply reservoir and related 
application equipment at the end of the run by the ending weight 
fraction VOC in the material for that run. The mass of material in the 
direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the end of 
the run shall be calculated by subtracting the mass of material used in 
the run from the mass of material in the direct supply reservoir and 
related application equipment at the start of the run.
    (3) The mass of the single VOC used (M<INF>i) equals the mass 
of VOC present in the direct supply reservoir and related application 
equipment at the start of the run minus the mass of VOC present in the 
direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the end of 
the run.
    (G) If Method 25A is used to determine the concentration of the 
single VOC in the capture system, then calculate the capture efficiency 
(FC<INF>i) for each run, ``i,'' as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.042

Where:

C<INF>i = Average concentration of the single VOC in the capture 
system during run ``i'' (parts per million by volume) corrected for 
background VOC (see Sec. 60.547(a)(5)).
W = Molecular weight of the single VOC, mg/mg-mole (lb/lb-mole).
V = The volume occupied by one mole of ideal gas at standard conditions 
[20 [deg]C, 760 mm Hg] on a wet basis, 2.405 x 10<SUP>-5</SUP> m\3\/mg-
mole (385.3 ft\3\/lb-mole).
Q<INF>i = Volumetric flow in the capture system during run i, on a 
wet basis, adjusted to standard conditions, m\3\ (ft\3\) (see Sec. 
60.547(a)(5)).
10\6\ = ppm per unity.
M<INF>i = Mass of the single VOC used during run i, mg (lb).

    (H) If Method 25 is used to determine the concentration of the 
single VOC in the capture system, then calculate the capture efficiency 
(FC<INF>i) for each run, ``i,'' as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.043

Where: C<INF>i = Average concentration of the single VOC in the 
capture system during run ``i'' (parts per million, as carbon, by 
volume) corrected for background VOC (see Sec. 60.547(a)(5)).
W = Molecular weight of the single VOC, mg/mg-mole (lb/lb-mole).
V = The volume occupied by one mole of ideal gas at standard conditions 
[20 [deg]C, 760 mm Hg] on a wet basis, 2.405 x 10<SUP>-5</SUP> m\3\/mg-
mole (385.3 ft\3\/lb-mole).
Q<INF>i = Volumetric flow in the capture system during run i, on a 
wet basis, adjusted to standard conditions, m\3\ (ft\3\) (see Sec. 
60.547(a)(5)).
10\6\ = ppm per unity.
M<INF>i = Mass of the single VOC used during run i, mg (lb).
NC = Number of carbon atoms in one molecule of the single VOC.

    (I) Calculate the average capture efficiency value, F<INF>c as 
follows:

[[Page 501]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.044

Where:

``n'' equals the number of runs made in the test (n <ls-thn-eq>= 3). In 
cases where an alternative procedure in this paragraph is used, the 
requirements in paragraphs (f)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section remain 
unchanged.

    (g) For each undertread cementing operation, each sidewall cementing 
operation, each green tire spraying operation where organic solvent-
based sprays are used, each Michelin-A operation, each Michelin-B 
operation, and each Michelin-C-automatic operation that uses a VOC 
emission reduction system with a control device that destroys VOC (e.g., 
incinerator), the owner or operator shall use the following procedure to 
determine compliance with the percent emission reduction requirement 
specified under Sec. 60.542 (a) (1)(i), (2)(i), (6)(i), (7)(iii), 
(8)(i), (9)(i), and (10)(i).
    (1) For the initial performance test, the overall reduction 
efficiency (R) shall be determined as prescribed under paragraphs (f)(2) 
(i) through (iii) of this section. The performance test shall be 
repeated during conditions described under paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section. No monthly performance tests are required.
    (h) For each tread end cementing operation and each bead cementing 
operation that uses a VOC emission reduction system with a control 
device that recovers VOC (e.g., carbon adsorber), the owner or operator 
shall use the following procedure to determine compliance with the 
emission limit specified under Sec. 60.542(a) (3) and (4).
    (1) Calculate the mass of VOC used per tire cemented at the affected 
facility for the month (G), as specified under paragraphs (d) (1) 
through (4) of this section, or mass of VOC used per bead cemented at 
the affected facility for the month (G<INF>b), as specified under 
paragraphs (e) (1) through (4) of this section.
    (2) Calculate the total mass of VOC recovered from the affected 
facility for the month (M<INF>r):

M<INF>r = L<INF>r D<INF>r

    (3) Calculate the overall reduction efficiency for the VOC emission 
reduction system (R) for the month:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.066

    (4) Calculate the mass of VOC emitted per tire cemented at the 
affected facility for the month (N) or mass of VOC emitted per bead 
cemeted at the affected facility for the month (N<INF>b):

N = G (1-R)
N<INF>b = G<INF>b (1-R)

    (i) For each undertread cementing operation, each sidewall cemeting 
operation, each green tire spraying operation where organic solvent-
based sprays are used, each Michelin-A operation, each Michelin-B 
operation, and each Michelin-C-automatic operation that uses a VOC 
emission reduction system with a control device that recovers (VOC) 
(e.g., carbon adsorber), the owner or operator shall use the following 
procedure to determine compliance with the percent reduction requirement 
specified under Sec. 60.542(a) (1)(i), (2)(i), (6)(i), (7)(iii), 
(8)(i), (9)(i), and (10)(i).

    (j) Rather than seeking to demonstrate compliance with the 
provisions of Sec. 60.542(a) (1)(i), (2)(i), (6)(i), (7)(iii), or 
(9)(i) using the performance test procedures described under paragraphs 
(g) and (i) of this section, an owner or operator of an undertread 
cementing operation, sidewall cementing operation, green tire spraying 
operation where organic solvent-based

[[Page 502]]

sprays are used, or Michelin-B operation that use a VOC emission 
reduction system may seek to demonstrate compliance by meeting the 
equipment design and performance specifications listed under paragraphs 
(j)(1), (2), and (4) through (6) or under paragraphs (j)(1) and (3) 
through (6) of this section, and by conducting a control device 
efficiency performance test to determine compliance as described under 
paragraph (j)(7) of this section. The owner or operator shall conduct 
this performance test of the control device efficiency no later than 180 
days after initial startup of the affected facility, as specified under 
Sec. 60.8(a). Meeting the capture system design and performance 
specifications, in conjunction with operating a 95 percent efficient 
control device, is an acceptable means of demonstrating compliance with 
the standard. Therefore, the requirement for the initial performance 
test on the enclosure, as specified under Sec. 60.8(a), is waived. No 
monthly performance tests are required.
    (1) For each undertread cementing operation, each sidewall cementing 
operation, and each Michelin-B operation, the cement application and 
drying area shall be contained in an enclosure that meets the criteria 
specified under paragraphs (j) (2), (4), and (5) of this section; for 
each green tire spraying operation where organic solvent-based sprays 
are used, the spray application and drying area shall be contained in an 
enclosure that meets the criteria specified under paragraphs (j) (3), 
(4), and (5) of this section.
    (2) The drying area shall be enclosed between the application area 
and the water bath or to the extent necessary to contain all tire 
components for at least 30 seconds after cement application, whichever 
distance is less.
    (3) Sprayed green tires shall remain in the enclosure for a minimum 
of 30 seconds after spray application.
    (4) A minimum face velocity of 30.5 meters (100 feet) per minute 
shall be maintained continuously through each permanent opening into the 
enclosure when all temporary enclosure openings are closed. The cross-
sectional area of each permanent opening shall be divided into at least 
12 equal areas, and a velocity measurement shall be performed at the 
centroid of each equal area with an anemometer or similar velocity 
monitoring device; the face velocity of each permanent opening is the 
average value of the velocity measurements taken. The monitoring device 
shall be calibrated and operated according to the manufacturer's 
instructions.

Temporary enclosure openings shall remain closed at all times except 
when worker access is necessary.
    (5) The total area of all permanent openings into the enclosure 
shall not exceed the area that would be necessary to maintain the VOC 
concentration of the exhaust gas stream at 25 percent of the lower 
explosive limit (LEL) under the following conditions:
    (i) The facility is operating at the maximum solvent use rate;
    (ii) The face velocity through each permanent opening is 30.5 meters 
(100 feet) per minute; and
    (iii) All temporary openings are closed.
    (6) All captured VOC are ducted to a VOC emission control device 
that is operated on a continuous basis and that achieves at least a 95 
percent destruction or recovery efficiency.
    (7) The efficiency of the control device (E) for the initial 
performance test is determined by using values of the volumetric flow 
rate of each of the gas streams and the VOC content (as carbon) of each 
of the gas streams in and out of the control device as described under 
paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section. The control device efficiency 
shall be redetermined during conditions specified under paragraph (b)(3) 
of this section.
    (k) Each owner or operator of an affected facility who initially 
elected to be subject to the applicable percent emission reduction 
requirement specified under Sec. 60.542(a)(1)(i), (2)(i), (6)(i), 
(7)(iii), (8)(i), (9)(i), or (10)(i) and who later seeks to comply with 
the applicable total (uncontrolled) monthly VOC use limit specified 
under Sec. 60.542(a)(1)(ii), (2)(ii), (6)(ii), (7)(iv), (8)(ii), 
(9)(ii), or (10)(ii) shall demonstrate, using the procedures described 
under paragraph (c) of this section, that the total VOC use at the 
affected facility has not exceeded the applicable total (uncontrolled) 
monthly

[[Page 503]]

VOC use limit during each of the last 6 months of operation. The owner 
or operator shall be subject to the applicable percent emission 
reduction requirement until the conditions of this paragraph and Sec. 
60.546(h) are satisfied.
    (l) In determining compliance for each undertread cementing 
operation, each sidewall cementing operation, each green tire spraying 
operation, each Michelin-A operation, each Michelin-B operation, and 
each Michelin-C-automatic operation, the owner or operator shall include 
all the VOC used, recovered, or destroyed from cements and organic 
solvent-based green tire sprays including those cements or sprays used 
for tires other than those defined under Sec. 60.541(a).
    (m) In determining compliance for each tread end cementing 
operation, each bead cementing operation, and each green tire spraying 
operation, the owner or operator shall include only those tires defined 
under Sec. 60.541(a) when determining T<INF>o and B<INF>o.
    (n) For each undertread cementing operation and each sidewall 
cementing operation that does not use a VOC emission reduction system, 
the owner or operator shall use the following procedure to determine 
compliance with the VOC emission per tire limit specified in Sec. 
60.542a:
    (1) Calculate the total mass of VOC (M<INF>o) used at the 
affected facility for the month by the following procedure.
    (i) For each affected facility for which cement is delivered in 
batch or via a distribution system which serves only that affected 
facility:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.045

Where: ``n'' equals the number of different cements or sprays used 
during the month.

    (ii) For each affected facility for which cement is delivered via a 
common distribution system which also serves other affected or existing 
facilities.
    (A) Calculate the total mass (M) of VOC used for all of the 
facilities served by the common distribution system for the month:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.046

Where: ``n'' equals the number of different cements or sprays used 
during the month.

    (B) Determine the fraction (F<INF>o) of ``M'' used by the 
affected facility by comparing the production records and process 
specifications for the material cemented at the affected facility for 
the month to the production records and process specifications for the 
material cemented at all other facilities served by the common 
distribution system for the month or by another procedure acceptable to 
the Administrator.
    (C) Calculate the total monthly mass of VOC(M<INF>o) used at 
the affected facility:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.067

    (2) Determine the total number of tires (T<INF>o) processed at 
the affected facility for the month by the following procedure.
    (i) For undertread cementing, T<INF>o equals the number of 
tread or combined tread/sidewall components which receive an application 
of undertread cement.
    (ii) For sidewall cementing, T<INF>o equals the number of 
sidewall components which receive an application of sidewall cement, 
divided by 2.
    (3) Calculate the mass of VOC used per tire processed (G) by the 
affected facility for the month:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.068

    (4) Calculate the mass of VOC emitted per tire processed (N) for the 
affected facility for the month:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.069

    (5) Where the value of the mass of VOC emitted per tire processed 
(N) is less than or equal to the VOC emission per tire limit specified 
under Sec. 60.542a, the affected facility is in compliance.

    (a) The test methods in appendix A to this part, except as provided 
under Sec. 60.8(b), shall be used to determine compliance with Sec. 
60.542(a) as follows:

sampling time for each of three runs shall be at least 1 hour. Method 1 
shall be used to select the sampling site, and the sampling point shall 
be the centroid of the duct or at a point no closer to the walls than 
1.0 meter (3.3 feet). The minimum sample volume shall be 0.003 dry 
standard cubic meter (dscm) (0.11 dry standard cubic feet (dscf)) except 
that shorter sampling times or smaller volumes, when necessitated by 
process variables or other factors, may be approved by the 
Administrator.
    (3) Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D, as appropriate, as the reference method 
for determination of the flow rate of the stack gas. The measurement 
site shall be the same as for the Method 25 sampling. A velocity 
traverse shall be made once per run within the hour that the Method 25 
sample is taken.
    (4) Method 4 for determination of stack gas moisture.
    (5) Method 25 or Method 25A for determination of the VOC 
concentration in a capture system prior to a control device when only a 
single VOC is present (see Sec. 60.543 (f)(2)(iv)(G) and 
(f)(2)(iv)(H)). The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator at 
least 30 days in advance of any test by either Method 25 or Method 25A. 
Method 1 shall be used to select the sampling site and the sampling 
point shall be the centroid of the duct or at a point no closer to the 
walls than 1.0 meter (3.3 feet). Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D, as 
appropriate, shall be used as the test method for the concurrent 
determination of gas flow rate in the capture system.
    (i) For Method 25, the sampling time for each run shall be at least 
1 hour. For each run, a concurrent sample shall be taken immediately 
upwind of the application area to determine the background VOC 
concentration of air drawn into the capture system. Subtract this 
reading from the reading obtained in the capture system for that run. 
The minimum sample volume shall be 0.003 dry standard cubic meter (dscm) 
(0.11 dry standard cubic feet (dscf)) except that shorter sampling times 
or smaller volumes, when necessitated by process variable or other 
factors, may be approved by the Administrator. Use Method 3 to determine 
the moisture content of the stack gas.
    (ii) For Method 25A, the sampling time for each run shall be at 
least 1 hour. Instrument calibration shall be performed by the procedure 
given in Method 25A using the single VOC present in the capture system. 
A different calibration gas may be used if the results are corrected 
using an experimentally determined response factor comparing the 
alternative calibration gas to the single VOC used in the process. After 
the instrument has been calibrated, determine the background VOC 
concentration of the air drawn into the capture system immediately 
upwind of the application area for each run. The instrument does not 
need to be recalibrated for the background measurement. Subtract this 
reading from the reading obtained in the capture system for that run. 
The Method 25A results shall only be used in the alternative procedure 
for determination of capture efficiency described under Sec. 
60.543(f)(2)(iv)(G).

            Emissions from the Polymer Manufacturing Industry

    Source: 55 FR 51035, Dec. 11, 1990, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 60.560  Applicability and designation of affected facilities.

    (a) Affected facilities. The provisions of this subpart apply to 
affected facilities involved in the manufacture of polypropylene, 
polyethylene, polystyrene, or poly (ethylene terephthalate) as defined 
in Sec. 60.561 of this subpart. The affected facilities designated 
below for polypropylene and polyethylene are inclusive of all equipment 
used in the manufacture of these polymers, beginning with raw materials 
preparation and ending with product storage, and cover all emissions 
emanating from such equipment.
    (1) For process emissions from any polypropylene and polyethylene 
manufacturing process that uses a continuous process, the affected 
facilities are each of the following process sections: each raw 
materials preparation section, each polymerization reaction section, 
each material recovery section, each product finishing section, and each 
product storage section. These process sections are affected facilities 
for process emissions that are emitted continuously and for process 
emissions that are emitted intermittently.
    (2) For process emissions from polystyrene manufacturing processes 
that use a continuous process, the affected facilities are each material 
recovery section. These process sections are affected facilities for 
only those process emissions that are emitted continuously.
    (3) For process emissions from poly(ethylene terephthalate) 
manufacturing processes that use a continuous process, the affected 
facilities are each polymerization reaction section. If the process uses 
dimethyl terephthalate, then each material recovery section is also an 
affected facility. If the process uses terephthalic acid, then each raw 
materials preparation section is also an affected facility. These 
process sections are affected facilities for only those process 
emissions that are emitted continuously.
    (4) For VOC emissions from equipment leaks from polypropylene, 
polyethylene, and polystyrene (including expandable polystyrene) 
manufacturing processes, the affected facilities are each group of 
fugitive emissions equipment (as defined in Sec. 60.561) within any 
process unit (as defined in Sec. 60.561). This subpart does not apply 
to VOC emissions from equipment leaks from poly(ethylene terephthalate) 
manufacturing processes.
    (i) Affected facilities with a design capacity to produce less than 
1,000 Mg/yr (1,102 ton/yr) shall be exempt from Sec. 60.562-2.
    (ii) Addition or replacement of equipment for the purposes of 
improvement which is accomplished without a capital expenditure shall 
not by itself be considered a modification under Sec. 60.562-2.
    (b) Applicability dates. The applicability date identifies when an 
affected facility becomes subject to a standard. Usually, a standard has 
a single applicability date. However, some polypropylene and 
polyethylene affected facilities have a September 30, 1987, 
applicability date and others have a January 10, 1989, applicability 
date. The following paragraphs identify the applicability dates for all 
affected facilities subject to this subpart.
    (1) Polypropylene and polyethylene. Each process section in a 
polypropylene or polyethylene production process is a potential affected 
facility for both continuous and intermittent emissions. The 
applicability date depends on when the process section was constructed, 
modified, or reconstructed and, in some instances, on the type of 
production process.
    (i) The applicability date for any polypropylene or polyethylene 
affected facility that is constructed, modified, or reconstructed after 
January 10, 1989, regardless of the type of production process being 
used, is January 10, 1989.
    (ii) Only some polypropylene or polyethylene process sections that 
are constructed, modified, or reconstructed on or before January 10, 
1989, but after September 30, 1987, are affected facilities. These 
process sections (and the

[[Page 510]]

type of emissions to be controlled) are identified by an ``x'' in Table 
1. The applicability date for the process sections (and the emissions to 
be controlled) that are identified by an ``x'' in Table 1 is September 
30, 1987. Since the affected facilities that have a September 30, 1987, 
applicability date are determined by the type of production process 
(e.g., liquid phase, gas phase), each owner or operator shall identify 
the particular production process that applies to his or her particular 
process.

a ``Uncontrolled emission rate'' refers to the emission rate of a vent
  stream that vents directly to the atmosphere and to the emission rate
  of a vent stream to the atmosphere that would occur in the absence of
  any add-on control devices but after any material recovery devices
  that constitute part of the normal material recovery operations in a
  process line where potential emissions are recovered for recycle or
  resale.
b Emission rate applies to continuous emissions only.
c Emission rate applies to intermittent emissions only.
d Total emission rate for non-emergency intermittent emissions from raw
  materials preparation, polymerization reaction, material recovery,
  product finishing, and product storage process sections.
e See footnote d.
f Emission rate applies to both continuous and intermittent emissions.
 g Emission rate applies to non-emergency intermittent emissions only.
 h Applies to modified or reconstructed affected facilities only.
 i Includes emissions from the cooling water tower.
 j Applies to a process line producing low viscosity poly(ethylene
  terephthlalate).
 k Applies to a process line producing high viscosity poly(ethylene
  terephathalate).
 l See footnote m.
 m Applies to the sum of emissions to the atmosphere from the
  polymerization reaction section (including emissions from the cooling
  tower) and the raw materials preparation section (i.e., the
  esterifiers).

    (e)(1) Modified or reconstructed affected facilities at polystyrene 
and poly(ethylene terephthalate) plants with uncontrolled emission rates 
at or below those identified in Table 2 are exempt from the requirements 
of Sec. 60.562-1 unless and until its uncontrolled emission rate 
exceeds that rate listed for it in Table 2. This exemption does not 
apply to new polystyrene or poly(ethylene terephthalate) affected 
facilities.
    (2) Emissions from modified or reconstructed affected facilities 
that are controlled by an existing control device and that have 
uncontrolled emission rates greater than the uncontrolled threshold 
emission rates identified in Table 2 are exempt from the requirements of 
Sec. 60.562-1 unless and until the existing control device is modified, 
reconstructed, or replaced.

uncontrolled annual emissions of less than 1.6 Mg/yr (1.76 ton/yr) or 
with a weight percent TOC of less than 0.10 percent from a new, 
modified, or reconstructed polypropylene or polyethylene affected 
facility are exempt from the requirements of Sec. 60.562-1(a)(1). If at 
a later date, an individual stream's uncontrolled annual emissions 
become 1.6 Mg/yr (1.76 ton/yr) or greater (if the stream was exempted on 
the basis of the uncontrolled annual emissions exemption) or VOC 
concentration becomes 0.10 weight percent or higher (if the stream was 
exempted on the basis of the VOC concentration exemption), then the 
stream is subject to the requirements of Sec. 60.562-1.
    (h) Emergency vent streams, as defined in Sec. 60.561, from a new, 
modified, or reconstructed polypropylene or polyethylene affected 
facility are exempt from the requirements of Sec. 60.562-1(a)(2).
    (i) An owner or operator of a polypropylene or polyethylene affected 
facility that commenced construction, modification, or reconstruction 
after September 30, 1987, and on or before January 10, 1989, and that is 
in a process line in which more than one type of polyolefin (i.e., 
polypropylene, low density polyethylene, high density polyethylene, or 
their copolymers) is produced shall select one of the polymer/production 
process combinations in Table 1 for purposes of determining applicable 
affected facilities and uncontrolled threshold emissions rates.
    (j) Alternative means of compliance--(1) Option to comply with part 
65. Owners or operators may choose to comply with 40 CFR part 65, 
subpart G, for continuous process vents that are subject to this 
subpart, that choose to comply with Sec. 60.562-1(a)(1)(i)(A), (B), or 
(C) as allowed in Sec. 60.562-1(a)(1) and (b)(1)(iii). The requirements 
of 40 CFR part 65, subpart G, satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c) 
of this section and Sec. Sec. 60.563 through 60.566, except for Sec. 
60.565(g)(1). Other provisions applying to owners or operators who 
choose to comply with 40 CFR part 65 are provided in 40 CFR 65.1.
    (2) Part 60, subpart A. Owners or operators who choose to comply 
with 40 CFR part 65, subpart G, must also comply with Sec. Sec. 60.1, 
60.2, 60.5, 60.6, 60.7(a)(1) and (4), 60.14, 60.15, and 60.16 for those 
process vents. All sections and paragraphs of subpart A of this part 
that are not mentioned in this paragraph (j)(2) do not apply to owners 
or operators of process vents complying with 40 CFR part 65, subpart G, 
except that provisions required to be met prior to implementing 40 CFR 
part 65 still apply. Owners and operators who choose to comply with 40 
CFR part 65, subpart G, must comply with 40 CFR part 65, subpart A.
    (3) Initial startup notification. Each owner or operator subject to 
the provisions of this subpart that chooses to comply with 40 CFR part 
65, subpart G, at initial startup shall notify the Administrator of the 
specific provisions of 40 CFR part 65, subpart G, with which the owner 
or operator has elected to comply. Notification shall be submitted with 
the notification of initial startup required by 40 CFR 65.5(b).

    (Note: The numerical emission limits in these standards are 
expressed in terms of total organic compounds, measured as total organic 
compounds less methane and ethane.)

Sec. 60.561  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, all terms not defined herein shall have the 
meaning given them in the Act, in subpart A of part 60, or in subpart VV 
of part 60, and the following terms shall have the specific meanings 
given them.
    Boiler means any enclosed combustion device that extracts useful 
energy in the form of steam.
    Capital expenditure means, in addition to the definition in 40 CFR 
60.2, an expenditure for a physical or operational change to an existing 
facility that exceeds P, the product of the facility's replacement cost, 
R, and an adjusted annual asset guideline repair allowance, A, as 
reflected by the following equation: P = R x A, where

[[Page 513]]

    (a) The adjusted annual asset guideline repair allowance, A, is the 
product of the percent of the replacement cost, Y, and the applicable 
basic annual asset guideline repair allowance, B, as reflected by the 
following equation: A = Y x (B / 100);
    (b) The percent Y is determined from the following equation: Y = 1.0 
- 0.57 log X, where X is 1986 minus the year of construction; and
    (c) The applicable basic annual asset guideline repair allowance, B, 
is equal to 12.5.
    Car-sealed means, for purposes of these standards, a seal that is 
placed on the device used to change the position of a valve (e.g., from 
opened to closed) such that the position of the valve cannot be changed 
without breaking the seal and requiring the replacement of the old seal 
once broken with a new seal.
    Closed vent system means a system that is not open to the atmosphere 
and that is composed of piping, connections, and, if necessary, flow 
inducing devices that transport gas or vapor from a piece or pieces of 
equipment to a control device.
    Continuous emissions means any gas stream containing VOC that is 
generated essentially continuously when the process line or any piece of 
equipment in the process line is operating.
    Continuous process means a polymerization process in which reactants 
are introduced in a continuous manner and products are removed either 
continuously or intermittently at regular intervals so that the process 
can be operated and polymers produced essentially continuously.
    Control device means an enclosed combustion device, vapor recovery 
system, or flare.
    Copolymer means a polymer that has two different repeat units in its 
chain.
    Decomposition means, for the purposes of these standards, an event 
in a polymerization reactor that advances to the point where the 
polymerization reaction becomes uncontrollable, the polymer begins to 
break down (decompose), and it becomes necessary to relieve the reactor 
instantaneously in order to avoid catastrophic equipment damage or 
serious adverse personnel safety consequences.
    Decomposition emissions refers to those emissions released from a 
polymer production process as the result of a decomposition or during 
attempts to prevent a decomposition.
    Emergency vent stream means, for the purposes of these standards, an 
intermittent emission that results from a decomposition, attempts to 
prevent decompositions, power failure, equipment failure, or other 
unexpected cause that requires immediate venting of gases from process 
equipment in order to avoid safety hazards or equipment damage. This 
includes intermittent vents that occur from process equipment where 
normal operating parameters (e.g., pressure or temperature) are exceeded 
such that the process equipment can not be returned to normal operating 
conditions using the design features of the system and venting must 
occur to avoid equipment failure or adverse safety personnel 
consequences and to minimize adverse effects of the runaway reaction. 
This does not include intermittent vents that are designed into the 
process to maintain normal operating conditions of process vessels 
including those vents that regulate normal process vessel pressure.
    End finisher means a polymerization reaction vessel operated under 
very low pressures, typically at pressures of 2 mm Hg (1 in. 
H<INF>2O) or less, in order to produce high viscosity 
poly(ethylene terephthalate). An end finisher is preceded in a high 
viscosity poly(ethylene terephthalate) process line by one or more 
polymerization vessels operated under less severe vacuums, typically 
between 5 and 10 mm Hg (3 and 5 in. H<INF>2O). A high viscosity 
poly(ethylene terephthalate) process line may have one or more end 
finishers.
    Existing control device means, for the purposes of these standards, 
an air pollution control device that has been in operation on or before 
September 30, 1987, or that has been in operation between September 30, 
1987, and January 10, 1989, on those continuous or intermittent 
emissions from a process section that is marked by an ``--'' in Table 1 
of this subpart.
    Existing control device is reconstructed means, for the purposes of 
these standards, the capital expenditure of at least

[[Page 514]]

50 percent of the replacement cost of the existing control device.
    Existing control device is replaced means, for the purposes of these 
standards, the replacement of an existing control device with another 
control device.
    Expandable polystyrene means a polystyrene bead to which a blowing 
agent has been added using either an in-situ suspension process or a 
post-impregnation suspension process.
    Experimental process line means a polymer or copolymer manufacturing 
process line with the sole purpose of operating to evaluate polymer 
manufacturing processes, technologies, or products. An experimental 
process line does not produce a polymer or resin that is sold or that is 
used as a raw material for nonexperimental process lines.
    Flame zone means that portion of the combustion chamber in a boiler 
occupied by the flame envelope.
    Fugitive emissions equipment means each pump, compressor, pressure 
relief device, sampling connection system, open-ended valve or line, 
valve, and flange or other connector in VOC service and any devices or 
systems required by subpart VV of this part.
    Gas phase process means a polymerization process in which the 
polymerization reaction is carried out in the gas phase; i.e., the 
monomer(s) are gases in a fluidized bed of catalyst particles and 
granular polymer.
    High density polyethylene (HDPE) means a thermoplastic polymer or 
copolymer comprised of at least 50 percent ethylene by weight and having 
a density of greater than 0.940 gm/cm\3\3 (58.7 lb/ft\3\).
    High pressure process means the conventional production process for 
the manufacture of low density polyethylene in which a reaction pressure 
of about 15,000 psig (103,000 kPa gauge) or greater is used.
    High viscosity poly(ethylene terephthalate) means poly(ethylene 
terephthalate) that has an intrinsic viscosity of 0.9 or higher and is 
used in such applications as tire cord and seat belts.
    Incinerator means an enclosed combustion device that is used for 
destroying VOC.
    In-situ suspension process means a manufacturing process in which 
styrene, blowing agent, and other raw materials are added together 
within a reactor for the production of expandable polystyrene.
    Intermittent emissions means those gas streams containing VOC that 
are generated at intervals during process line operation and includes 
both planned and emergency releases.
    Liquid phase process means a polymerization process in which the 
polymerization reaction is carried out in the liquid phase; i.e., the 
monomer(s) and any catalyst are dissolved, or suspended in a liquid 
solvent.
    Liquid phase slurry process means a liquid phase polymerization 
process in which the monomer(s) are in solution (completely dissolved) 
in a liquid solvent, but the polymer is in the form of solid particles 
suspended in the liquid reaction mixture during the polymerization 
reaction; sometimes called a particle form process.
    Liquid phase solution process means a liquid phase polymerization 
process in which both the monomer(s) and polymer are in solution 
(completely dissolved) in the liquid reaction mixture.
    Low density polyethylene (LDPE) means a thermoplastic polymer or 
copolymer comprised of at least 50 percent ethylene by weight and having 
a density of 0.940 g/cm\3\ (58.7 lb/ft\3\) or less.
    Low pressure process means a production process for the manufacture 
of low density polyethylene in which a reaction pressure markedly below 
that used in a high pressure process is used. Reaction pressure of 
current low pressure processes typically go up to about 300 psig (2,070 
kPa gauge).
    Low viscosity poly(ethylene terephthalate) means a poly(ethylene 
terephthalate) that has an intrinsic viscosity of less than 0.75 and is 
used in such applications as clothing, bottle, and film production.
    Material recovery section means the equipment that recovers 
unreacted or by-product materials from any process section for return to 
the process line, off-site purification or treatment, or sale. Equipment 
designed to separate unreacted or by-product material from the polymer 
product are to be included

[[Page 515]]

in this process section, provided at least some of the material is 
recovered for reuse in the process, off-site purification or treatment, 
or sale, at the time the process section becomes an affected facility. 
Otherwise such equipment are to be assigned to one of the other process 
sections, as appropriate. Equipment that treats recovered materials are 
to be included in this process section, but equipment that also treats 
raw materials are not to be included in this process section. The latter 
equipment are to be included in the raw materials preparation section. 
If equipment is used to return unreacted or by-product material directly 
to the same piece of process equipment from which it was emitted, then 
that equipment is considered part of the process section that contains 
the process equipment. If equipment is used to recover unreacted or by-
product material from a process section and return it to another process 
section or a different piece of process equipment in the same process 
section or sends it off-site for purification, treatment, or sale, then 
such equipment are considered part of a material recovery section. 
Equipment used for the on-site recovery of ethylene glycol from 
poly(ethylene terephthalate) plants, however, are not included in the 
material recovery section, but are covered under the standards 
applicable to the polymerization reaction section (Sec. 60.562-
1(c)(1)(ii)(A) or (2)(ii)(A)).
    Operating day means, for the purposes of these standards, any 
calendar day during which equipment used in the manufacture of polymer 
was operating for at least 8 hours or one labor shift, whichever is 
shorter. Only operating days shall be used in determining compliance 
with the standards specified in Sec. 60.562-1(c)(1)(ii)(B), (1)(ii)(C), 
(2)(ii)(B), and (2)(ii)(C). Any calendar day in which equipment is used 
for less than 8 hours or one labor shift, whichever is less, is not an 
``operating day'' and shall not be used as part of the rolling 14-day 
period for determining compliance with the standards specified in Sec. 
60.562-1(c)(1)(ii)(B), (1)(ii)(C), (2)(ii)(B), and (2)(ii)(C).
    Polyethylene means a thermoplastic polymer or copolymer comprised of 
at least 50 percent ethylene by weight; see low density polyethylene and 
high density polyethylene.
    Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) means a polymer or copolymer 
comprised of at least 50 percent bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-terephthalate 
(BHET) by weight.
    Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) manufacture using dimethyl 
terephthalate means the manufacturing of poly(ethylene terephthalate) 
based on the esterification of dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) with 
ethylene glycol to form the intermediate monomer bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-
terephthalate (BHET) that is subsequently polymerized to form PET.
    Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) manufacture using terephthalic 
acid means the manufacturing of poly(ethylene terephthalate) based on 
the esterification reaction of terephthalic acid (TPA) with ethylene 
glycol to form the intermediate monomer bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-
terephthalate (BHET) that is subsequently polymerized to form PET.
    Polymerization reaction section means the equipment designed to 
cause monomer(s) to react to form polymers, including equipment designed 
primarily to cause the formation of short polymer chains (oligomers or 
low polymers), but not including equipment designed to prepare raw 
materials for polymerization, e.g., esterification vessels. For the 
purposes of these standards, the polymerization reaction section begins 
with the equipment used to transfer the materials from the raw materials 
preparation section and ends with the last vessel in which 
polymerization occurs. Equipment used for the on-site recovery of 
ethylene glycol from poly(ethylene terephthalate) plants, however, are 
included in this process section, rather than in the material recovery 
process section.
    Polypropylene (PP) means a thermoplastic polymer or copolymer 
comprised of at least 50 percent propylene by weight.
    Polystyrene (PS) means a thermoplastic polymer or copolymer 
comprised of at least 80 percent styrene or para-methylstyrene by 
weight.
    Post-impregnation suspension process means a manufacturing process 
in which polystyrene beads are first

[[Page 516]]

formed in a suspension process, washed, dried, or otherwise finished and 
then added with a blowing agent to another reactor in which the beads 
and blowing agent are reacted to produce expandable polystyrene.
    Process heater means a device that transfers heat liberated by 
burning fuel to fluids contained in tubular coils, including all fluids 
except water that is heated to produce steam.
    Process line means a group of equipment assembled that can operate 
independently if supplied with sufficient raw materials to produce 
polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene, (general purpose, crystal, or 
expandable) or poly(ethylene terephthalate) or one of their copolymers. 
A process line consists of the equipment in the following process 
sections (to the extent that these process sections are present at a 
plant): raw materials preparation, polymerization reaction, product 
finishing, product storage, and material recovery.
    Process section means the equipment designed to accomplish a general 
but well-defined task in polymer production. Process sections include 
raw materials preparation, polymerization reaction, material recovery, 
product finishing, and product storage and may be dedicated to a single 
process line or common to more than one process line.
    Process unit means equipment assembled to perform any of the 
physical and chemical operations in the production of polypropylene, 
polyethylene, polystyrene, (general purpose, crystal, or expandable), or 
poly(ethylene terephthalate) or one of their copolymers. A process unit 
can operate independently if supplied with sufficient feed or raw 
materials and sufficient storage facilities for the product. Examples of 
process units are raw materials handling and monomer recovery.
    Product finishing section means the equipment that treats, shapes, 
or modifies the polymer or resin to produce the finished end product of 
the particular facility, including equipment that prepares the product 
for product finishing. For the purposes of these standards, the product 
finishing section begins with the equipment used to transfer the 
polymerized product from the polymerization reaction section and ends 
with the last piece of equipment that modifies the characteristics of 
the polymer. Product finishing equipment may accomplish product 
separation, extruding and pelletizing, cooling and drying, blending, 
additives introduction, curing, or annealing. Equipment used to separate 
unreacted or by-product material from the product are to be included in 
this process section, provided the material separated from the polymer 
product is not recovered at the time the process section becomes an 
affected facility. If the material is being recovered, then the 
separation equipment are to be included in the material recovery 
section. Product finishing does not include polymerization, the physical 
mixing of the pellets to obtain a homogenous mixture of the polymer 
(except as noted below), or the shaping (such as fiber spinning, 
molding, or fabricating) or modification (such as fiber stretching and 
crimping) of the finished end product. If physical mixing occurs in 
equipment located between product finishing equipment (i.e., before all 
the chemical and physical characteristics have been ``set'' by virtue of 
having passed through the last piece of equipment in the product 
finishing section), then such equipment are to be included in this 
process section. Equipment used to physically mix the finished product 
that are located after the last piece of equipment in the product 
finishing section are part of the product storage section.
    Product storage section means the equipment that is designed to 
store the finished polymer or resin end product of the particular 
facility. For the purposes of these standards, the product storage 
section begins with the equipment used to transfer the finished product 
out of the product finishing section and ends with the containers used 
to store the final product. Any equipment used after the product 
finishing section to recover unreacted or by-product material are to be 
considered part of a material recovery section. Product storage does not 
include any intentional modification of the characteristics of any 
polymer or resin product, but does include equipment that provide a 
uniform mixture of product, provided such equipment are used after the 
last product finishing

[[Page 517]]

piece of equipment. This process section also does not include the 
shipment of a finished polymer or resin product to another facility for 
further finishing or fabrication.
    Raw materials preparation section means the equipment located at a 
polymer manufacturing plant designed to prepare raw materials, such as 
monomers and solvents, for polymerization. For the purposes of these 
standards, this process section begins with the equipment used to 
transfer raw materials from storage and recovered material from material 
recovery process sections, and ends with the last piece of equipment 
that prepares the material for polymerization. The raw materials 
preparation section may include equipment that accomplishes 
purification, drying, or other treatment of raw materials or of raw and 
recovered materials together, activation of catalysts, and 
esterification including the formation of some short polymer chains 
(oligomers), but does not include equipment that is designed primarily 
to accomplish the formation of oligomers, the treatment of recovered 
materials alone, or the storage of raw materials.
    Recovery system means an individual unit or series of material 
recovery units, such as absorbers, condensers, and carbon adsorbers, 
used for recovering volatile organic compounds.
    Total organic compounds (TOC) means those compounds measured 
according to the procedures specified in Sec. 60.564.
    Vent stream means any gas stream released to the atmosphere directly 
from an emission source or indirectly either through another piece of 
process equipment or a material recovery device that constitutes part of 
the normal recovery operations in a polymer process line where potential 
emissions are recovered for recycle or resale, and any gas stream 
directed to an air pollution control device. The emissions released from 
an air pollution control device are not considered a vent stream unless, 
as noted above, the control device is part of the normal material 
recovery operations in a polymer process line where potential emissions 
are recovered for recycle or resale.
    Volatile organic compounds (VOC) means, for the purposes of these 
standards, any reactive organic compounds as defined in Sec. 60.2 
Definitions.

Sec. 60.562-1  Standards: Process emissions.

    (a) Polypropylene, low density polyethylene, and high density 
polyethylene. Each owner or operator of a polypropylene, low density 
polyethylene, or high density polyethylene process line containing a 
process section subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply 
with the provisions in this section on and after the date on which the 
initial performance test required by Sec. 60.8 is completed, but not 
later than 60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which 
the affected facility will be operated, or 180 days after initial 
startup whichever comes first.
    (1) Continuous emissions. For each vent stream that emits continuous 
emissions from an affected facility as defined in Sec. 60.560(a)(1), 
the owner or operator shall use the procedures identified in paragraphs 
(a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section for determining which continuous 
emissions are to be controlled and which level of control listed in 
paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is to be met. The owner or operator 
shall use the procedures identified in paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) 
of this section each time a process section is constructed, modified, or 
reconstructed at the plant site.
    (i) Level of control Continuous emission streams determined to be 
subject to control pursuant to the procedures identified in paragraphs 
(a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section, as applicable, shall meet one of 
the control levels identified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) (A) through (D) of 
this section. The procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this 
section identify which level of control may be met. The level of control 
identified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(D) of this section is limited to 
certain continuous emission streams, which are identified through the 
procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section.
    (A) Reduce emissions of total organic compounds (minus methane and 
ethane) (TOC) by 98 weight percent, or to

[[Page 518]]

a concentration of 20 parts per million by volume (ppmv) on a dry basis, 
whichever is less stringent. The TOC is expressed as the sum of the 
actual compounds, not carbon equivalents. If an owner or operator elects 
to comply with the 20 ppmv standard, the concentration shall include a 
correction to 3 percent oxygen only when supplemental combustion air is 
used to combust the vent stream.
    (B) Combust the emissions in a boiler or process heater with a 
design heat input capacity of 150 million Btu/hour or greater by 
introducing the vent stream into the flame zone of the boiler or process 
heater. (Note: A boiler or process heater of lesser design heat capacity 
may be used, but must demonstrate compliance with paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) 
of this section.)
    (C) Combust the emissions in a flare that meets the conditions 
specified in Sec. 60.18. If the flare is used to control both 
continuous and intermittent emissions, the flare shall meet the 
conditions specified in Sec. 60.18 at all times (i.e., which 
controlling continuous emissions alone or when controlling both 
continuous and intermittent emissions).
    (D) Vent the emissions to a control device located on the plant 
site.
    (ii) Uncontrolled Continuous Emissions. For each vent stream that 
emits continuous emissions from an affected facility as defined in Sec. 
60.560(a)(1) and that is not controlled in an existing control device, 
the owner or operator shall use the procedures identified in Table 3 to 
identify those continuous emissions from each constructed, modified, or 
reconstructed affected facility that are to be controlled. The owner 
shall include in the procedure all uncontrolled continuous vent streams 
from previously constructed, modified, or reconstructed affected 
facilities at the plant site each time a process section is constructed, 
modified, or reconstructed at the plant site. In applying the procedures 
shown in Table 3, the stream characteristics may be either measured or 
calculated as specified in Sec. 60.564(d). For modified or 
reconstructed affected facilities, these stream characteristics are to 
be determined after a modification or reconstruction determination has 
been made by the Administrator, but before any actual changes have been 
undertaken, and then again after the actual changes have been made. 
Figure 1 provides a summary overview of the control determination 
procedure described in Table 3.

    (iii) Controlled Continuous Emissions. For each vent stream that 
emits continuous emissions from an affected facility as defined in Sec. 
60.560(a)(1) and that is controlled in an existing control device, each 
owner or operator shall determine whether the emissions entering the 
control device are greater

[[Page 521]]

than or equal to the calculated threshold emissions (CTE) level, which 
is to be calculated using the TOC concentration of the inlet vent stream 
and the equations in footnote b of Table 3. If the inlet stream's TOC 
concentration is equal to or greater than 20 weight percent, the 
calculated threshold emissions level is 18.2 Mg/yr (20.1 ton/yr). If 
multiple emission streams are vented to the control device, the 
individual streams are not to be separated into individual weight 
percent ranges for calculation purposes as would be done for 
uncontrolled emission streams. Emissions vented to an existing control 
device are required to be controlled as described in paragraphs 
(a)(1)(iii) (A) and (B) of this section. Figure 2 illustrates the 
control determination procedure for controlled continuous emissions.

[[Page 522]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.049

    (A) If the annual emissions of the stream entering the control 
device are equal to or greater than the CTE levels, then compliance with 
one of the requirements identified in Sec. 60.562-1(a)(1)(i) (A), (B), 
or (C) is required at such time the control device is reconstructed or 
replaced or has its operating conditions modified as a result of State 
or local regulations (including changes in the operating permit) 
including those instances where the control device is reconstructed, 
replaced, or modified in its operation at the same time the existing 
process section

[[Page 523]]

is modified or reconstructed and becomes an affected facility. If the 
existing control device already complies with one of the requirements 
identified in Sec. 60.562-1(a)(1)(i) (A), (B), or (C), no further 
control is required.
    (B) If the annual emissions of the stream entering the control 
device are less than the CTE level, then the requirements of Sec. 
60.562-1(a)(1)(i) (A), (B), or (C) are not applicable at that time. 
However, if the control device is replaced, reconstructed, or modified 
at a later date, each owner or operator shall reevaluate the 
applicability of these standards. This is done by combining with the 
vent stream entering the control device any uncontrolled vent streams in 
the same weight percent range as the controlled vent stream and 
determining whether the annual emissions of the stream entering the 
control device plus the applicable uncontrolled vent streams are greater 
than or equal to the CTE level, which is based on the weighted TOC 
concentration of the controlled vent stream and the uncontrolled vent 
streams. If the annual emissions entering the control device (including 
the applicable uncontrolled vent streams) are greater than or equal to 
the CTE level, then compliance with one of the requirements identified 
in Sec. 60.562-1(a)(1)(i) (A), (B), or (C) is required at that time for 
both the controlled and uncontrolled vent streams. If the annual 
emissions are less than the CTE level, compliance with these standards 
is again not required at such time. However, if the control device is 
again replaced, reconstructed, or modified, each owner or operator shall 
repeat this determination procedure.
    (2) Intermittent emissions. The owner or operator shall control each 
vent stream that emits intermittent emissions from an affected facility 
as defined in Sec. 60.560-1(a)(1) by meeting one of the control 
requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii) of this 
section. If a vent stream that emits intermittent emissions is 
controlled in an existing flare, incinerator, boiler, or process heater, 
the requirements of this paragraph are waived until such time the 
control device is reconstructed or replaced or is modified in its 
operating conditions as a result of State or local regulation, including 
changes in the operating permit. This paragraph does not apply to 
emergency vent streams exempted by Sec. 60.560(h) and as defined in 
Sec. 60.561.
    (i) Combust the emissions in a flare that is:
    (A) Designed for and operated with no visible emissions, except for 
periods not to exceed a total of 5 minutes during any 2 consecutive 
hours,
    (B) Operated with a flame present at all times, and
    (C) Designed to maintain a stable flame.
    (ii) Combust the emissions in an incinerator, boiler, or process 
heater. Such emissions shall be introduced into the flame zone of a 
boiler or process heater.
    (b) Polystyrene. Each owner or operator of a polystyrene process 
line containing process sections subject to the provisions of this 
subpart shall comply with the provisions in this section on and after 
the date on which the initial performance test required by Sec. 60.8 is 
completed, but not later than 60 days after achieving the maximum 
production rate at which the affected facility will be operated, or 180 
days after initial startup, whichever comes first. Each owner or 
operator of a polystyrene process line using a continuous process shall:
    (1) Limit the continuous TOC emissions from the material recovery 
section by complying with one of the following:
    (i) Not allow continuous TOC emissions to be greater than 0.0036 kg 
TOC/Mg (0.0072 lb TOC/ton) product; or
    (ii) Not allow the outlet gas stream temperature from each final 
condenser in the material recovery section to exceed -25 [deg]C (-13 
[deg]F). For purposes of this standard, temperature excursions above 
this limit shall not be considered a violation when such excursions 
occur during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction; or
    (iii) Comply with Sec. 60.562-1(a)(1)(i) (A), (B), or (C).
    (2) If continuous TOC emissions from the material recovery section 
are routed through an existing emergency vapor recovery system, then 
compliance with these standards is required when the emergency vapor 
recovery

[[Page 524]]

system undergoes modification, reconstruction, or replacement. In such 
instances, compliance with these standards shall be achieved no later 
than 180 days after completion of the modification, reconstruction, or 
replacement.
    (c) Poly(ethylene terephthalate). Each owner or operator of a 
poly(ethylene terephthalate) process line containing process sections 
subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with the 
provisions in this section on and after the date on which the initial 
performance test required by Sec. 60.8 is completed, but not later than 
60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which the 
affected facility will be operated, or 180 days after initial startup, 
whichever comes first.
    (1) Each owner or operator of a PET process line using a dimethyl 
terephthalate process shall:
    (i) Limit the continuous TOC emissions from the material recovery 
section (i.e., methanol recovery) by complying with one of the 
following:
    (A) Not allow the continuous TOC emissions to be greater than 0.018 
kg TOC/Mg (0.036 lb TOC/ton) product; or
    (B) Not allow the outlet gas stream temperature from each final 
condenser in the material recovery section (i.e., methanol recovery) to 
exceed +3 [deg]C (+37 [deg]F). For purposes of this standard, 
temperature excursions above this limit shall not be considered a 
violation when such excursions occur during periods of startup, 
shutdown, or malfunction.
    (ii) Limit the continuous TOC emissions and, if steam-jet ejectors 
are used to provide vacuum to the polymerization reactors, the ethylene 
glycol concentration from the polymerization reaction section by 
complying with the appropriate standard set forth below. The ethylene 
glycol concentration limits specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) (B) and 
(C) of this section shall be determined by the procedures specified in 
Sec. 60.564(j).
    (A) Not allow continuous TOC emissions from the polymerization 
reaction section (including emissions from any equipment used to further 
recover the ethylene glycol, but excluding those emissions from the 
cooling tower) to be greater than 0.02 kg TOC/Mg (0.04 lb TOC/ton) 
product; and
    (B) If steam-jet ejectors are used as vacuum producers and a low 
viscosity product is being produced using single or multiple end 
finishers or a high viscosity product is being produced using a single 
end finisher, maintain the concentration of ethylene glycol in the 
liquid effluent exiting the vacuum system servicing the polymerization 
reaction section at or below 0.35 percent by weight, averaged on a daily 
basis over a rolling 14-day period of operating days; or
    (C) If steam-jet ejectors are used as vacuum producers and a high 
viscosity product is being produced using multiple end finishers, 
maintain an ethylene glycol concentration in the cooling tower at or 
below 6.0 percent by weight, averaged on a daily basis over a rolling 
14-day period of operating days.
    (2) Each owner or operator of a PET process line using a 
terephthalic acid process shall:
    (i) Not allow the continuous TOC emissions from the esterification 
vessels in the raw materials preparation section to be greater than 0.04 
kg TOC/Mg (0.08 lb TOC/ton) product.
    (ii) Limit the continuous TOC emissions and, if steam-jet ejectors 
are used to provide vaccum to the polymerization reactors, the ethylene 
glycol concentration from the polymerization reaction section by 
complying with the appropriate standard set forth below. The ethylene 
glycol concentration limits specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) (B) and 
(C) of this section shall be determined by the procedures specified in 
Sec. 60.564(j).
    (A) Not allow continuous TOC emissions from the polymerization 
reaction section (including emissions from any equipment used to further 
recover the ethylene glycol, but excluding those emissions from the 
cooling tower) to be greater than 0.02 kg TOC/Mg (0.04 lb TOC/ton) 
product; and
    (B) If steam-jet ejectors are used as vacuum producers and a low 
viscosity product is being produced using single or multiple end 
finishers or a high viscosity product is being produced using a single 
end finisher, maintain the concentration of ethylene glycol in the

[[Page 525]]

liquid effluent exiting the vacuum system servicing the polymerization 
reaction section at or below 0.35 percent by weight, averaged on a daily 
basis over a rolling 14-day period of operating days; or
    (C) If steam-jet ejectors are used as vacuum producers and a high 
viscosity product is being produced using multiple end finishers, 
maintain an ethylene glycol concentration in the cooling tower at or 
below 6.0 percent by weight, averaged on a daily basis over a rolling 
14-day period of operating days.
    (d) Closed vent systems and control devices used to comply with this 
subpart shall be operated at all times when emissions may be vented to 
them.
    (e) Vent systems that contain valves that could divert a vent stream 
from a control device shall have car-sealed opened all valves in the 
vent system from the emission source to the control device and car-
sealed closed all valves in vent system that would lead the vent stream 
to the atmosphere, either directly or indirectly, bypassing the control 
device.

Sec. 60.562-2  Standards: Equipment leaks of VOC.

    (a) Each owner or operator of an affected facility subject to the 
provisions of this subpart shall comply with the requirements specified 
in Sec. 60.482-1 through Sec. 60.482-10 as soon as practicable, but no 
later than 180 days after initial startup, except that indications of 
liquids dripping from bleed ports in existing pumps in light liquid 
service are not considered to be a leak as defined in Sec. 60.482-
2(b)(2). For purposes of this standard, a ``bleed port'' is a 
technologically-required feature of the pump whereby polymer fluid used 
to provide lubrication and/or cooling of the pump shaft exits the pump, 
thereby resulting in a visible leak of fluid. This exemption expires 
when the existing pump is replaced or reconstructed.
    (b) An owner or operator may elect to comply with the requirements 
specified in Sec. 60.483-1 and Sec. 60.483-2.
    (c) An owner or operator may apply to the Administrator for a 
determination of equivalency for any means of emission limitation that 
achieves a reduction in emissions of VOC at least equivalent to the 
reduction in emissions of VOC achieved by the controls required in this 
subpart. In doing so, the owner or operator shall comply with 
requirements specified in Sec. 60.484.
    (d) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart 
shall comply with the provisions specified in Sec. 60.485 except an 
owner or operator may use the following provision in addition to Sec. 
60.485(e): Equipment is in light liquid service if the percent 
evaporated is greater than 10 percent at 150 [deg]C (302 [deg]F) as 
determined by ASTM Method D86-78, 82, 90, 95, or 96 (incorporated by 
reference as specified in Sec. 60.17).
    (e) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart 
shall comply with Sec. 60.486 and Sec. 60.487.

Sec. 60.564  Test methods and procedures.

    (a) In conducting the performance tests required in Sec. 60.8, the 
owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test 
methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures 
specified in this section, except as provided under Sec. 60.8(b). 
Owners or operators complying with Sec. 60.562-1(a)(1)(i)(D) need not 
perform a performance test on the control device, provided the control 
device is not used to comply with any other requirement of Sec. 60.562-
1(a).
    (1) Whenever changes are made in production capacity, feedstock type 
or catalyst type, or whenever there is replacement, removal, or addition 
of a control device, each owner or operator shall conduct a performance 
test according to the procedures in this section as appropriate, in 
order to determine compliance with Sec. 60.562-1.
    (2) Where a boiler or process heater with a design heat input 
capacity of 150 million Btu/hour or greater is used, the requirement for 
an initial performance test is waived, in accordance with Sec. 60.8(b). 
However, the Administrator reserves the option to require testing at 
such other times as may be required, as provided for in Sec. 114 of the 
Act.
    (3) The owner or operator shall determine the average organic 
concentration for each performance test run using the equipment 
described in Sec. 60.563(a)(4). The average organic concentration shall 
be determined from measurements taken at least every 15 minutes during 
each performance test run. The average of the three runs shall be the 
base value for the monitoring program.
    (4) When an absorber is the final unit in the system, the owner or 
operator shall determine the average specific gravity for each 
performance test run using specific gravity monitoring equipment 
described in Sec. 60.563(a)(5). An average specific gravity shall be 
determined from measurements taken at least every 15 minutes during each 
performance test run. The average of the three runs shall be the base 
value for the monitoring program.
    (5) When a condenser is the final unit in the system, the owner or

performance test run using the temperature monitoring equipment 
described in Sec. 60.563(a)(1). An average temperature shall be 
determined from measurements taken at least every 15 minutes during each

constituted. The average of the three runs shall be the base value for 
the monitoring program.
    (b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
emission concentration standard in Sec. 60.562-1 (a)(1)(i)(A) or 
(b)(1)(iii) if applicable [if not, see paragraph (c) of this section] as 
follows:

the outlet of the control device. Method 4 shall be used to determine 
the moisture content, if necessary.
    (ii) The sampling time for each run shall be 1 hour in which either 
an integrated sample or four grab samples shall be taken. If grab 
sampling is used, then the samples shall be taken at 15 minute 
intervals.

basis, ppm by volume, as calculated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
%O<INF>2d = Concentration of O<INF>2, dry basis, percent by 
volume.


The emission rate correction factor, integrated sampling and analysis 
procedure of Method 3 shall be used to determine the oxygen 
concentration (%O<INF>2d). The sampling site shall be the same as 
that of the TOC sample and the samples shall be taken during the same 
time that the TOC samples are taken.
    (c) If paragraph (b) of this section is not applicable, then the 
owner or operator shall determine compliance with the percent emission 
reduction standard in Sec. 60.562-1 (a)(1)(i)(A) or (b)(1)(iii) as 
follows:
    (1) The emission reduction of TOC (minus methane and ethane) shall 
be determined using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.075

where:

P = Percent emission reduction, by weight.
E<INF>inlet = Mass rate of TOC entering the control device, kg 
TOC/hr (lb TOC/hr).

TOC/hr (lb TOC/hr).

    (2) The mass rates of TOC (E<INF>i, E<INF>o) shall be 
computed using the following equations:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.076

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.074

where:

of the gas stream at the inlet and outlet of the control device, 
respectively, dry basis, ppmv.

inlet of the control device and after all product recovery units.
    (ii) Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D, as appropriate, shall be used to 
determine the volumetric flow rates (Q<INF>i, Q<INF>o). If 
necessary, Method 4 shall be used to determine the moisture content. 
Both determinations shall be compatible with the Method 18 
determinations.
    (iii) Inlet and outlet samples shall be taken simultaneously. The 
sampling time for each run shall be 1 hour in which either an integrated 
sample or four grab samples shall be taken. If grab sampling is used, 
then the samples shall be taken at 15 minute intervals.
    (d) An owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
individual stream exemptions in Sec. 60.560(g) and the procedures 
specified in Table 3 for compliance with Sec. 60.562-1(a)(1) as 
identified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section. An owner or 
operator using the procedures specified in Sec. 60.562-1(a)(1) for 
determining which continuous process emissions are to be controlled may 
use calculations demonstrated to be sufficiently accurate as to preclude 
the necessity of actual testing for purposes of calculating the 
uncontrolled annual emissions and weight percent of TOC. Owners or 
operators seeking to exempt streams under Sec. 60.560(g) must use the 
appropriate test procedures specified in this section.
    (1) The uncontrolled annual emissions of the individual vent stream 
shall be determined using the following equation:

(metric units)
= 1.298 x 10<SUP>-12</SUP> [(ton)(lb-mole)]/[(lb)(ppm)(dscf)] (English 
units)
8,600 = operating hours per year

    (i) Method 18 shall be used to determine the concentration of each 
individual organic component (C<INF>j) in the gas stream. Method 1 
or 1A, as appropriate, shall be used to determine the sampling site. If 
the gas stream is controlled in an existing control device, the sampling 
site shall be before the inlet of the control device and after all 
product recovery units.
    (ii) Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D, as appropriate, shall be used to 
determine the volumetric flow rate (Q). If necessary, Method 4 shall be 
used to determine the moisture content. Both determinations shall be 
compatible with the Method 18 determinations.
    (iii) The sampling time for each run shall be 1 hour in which either 
an integrated sample or four grab samples shall be taken. If grab 
sampling is used, then the samples shall be taken at 15 minute 
intervals.
    (2) The weight percent VOC of the uncontrolled individual vent 
stream shall be determined using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.078

where:

C<INF>j=concentration of sample TOC component ``j'' of the gas 
stream, dry basis, ppmv.
M<INF>j=Molecular weight of sample TOC component ``j'' of the gas 
stream, g/g-mole (1b/1b-mole).

mole (1b/1b-mole).

    (i) Method 18 shall be used to determine the concentration of each 
individual organic component (C<INF>j) in the gas stream. Method 1 
or 1A, as appropriate, shall be used to determine the sampling site. If 
the gas stream is controlled in an existing control device, the sampling 
site shall be before the inlet of the control device and after all 
product recovery units. If necessary, Method 4 shall be used to 
determine the moisture content. This determination shall be compatible 
with the Method 18 determinations.
    (ii) The average molecular weight of the gas stream shall be 
determined using methods approved by the Administrator. If the carrier 
component of the gas stream is nitrogen, then an average molecular 
weight of 28 g/g-mole (lb/lb-mole) may be used in lieu of testing. If 
the carrier component of the gas stream is air, then an average 
molecular weight of 29 g/g-mole (lb/lb-mole) may be used in lieu of 
testing.
    (iii) The sampling time for each run shall be 1 hour in which either 
an integrated sample or four grab samples shall be taken. If grab 
sampling is used, then the samples shall be taken at 15 minute 
intervals.
    (e) The owner or operator shall determine compliance of flares with 
the visible emission and flare provisions in Sec. 60.562-1 as follows:

combusted in a flare shall be computed as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.021

Where:

H<INF>T = Vent stream net heating value, MJ/scm (Btu/scf), where 
the net enthalpy per mole of offgas is based on combustion at 25 [deg]C 
and 760 mm Hg (68 [deg]F and 30 in. Hg), but the standard temperature 
for determining the volume corresponding to one mole is 20 [deg]C (68 
[deg]F).
K<INF>3 = 1.74 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> (1/ppm)(g-mole/scm)(MJ/kcal) 
(metric units), where standard temperature for (g-mole/scm) is 20 
[deg]C.
= 4.67 x 10<SUP>-6</SUP> (1/ppm)(lb-mole/scf)(Btu/kcal) (English units) 
where standard temperature for (lb/mole/scf) is 68 [deg]F.
C<INF>j = Concentration on a wet basis of compound j in ppm.

(kcal/(lb-mole)), based on combustion at 25 [deg]C and 760 mm Hg (77 
[deg]F and 30 in. Hg).

    (1) Method 18 shall be used to determine the concentration of each 
individual organic component (C<INF>j) in the gas stream. Method 1 
or 1A, as appropriate, shall be used to determine the sampling site to 
the inlet of the flare. Using this same sample, ASTM D1946-77 or 90 
(Reapproved 1994) (incorporated by reference--see Sec. 60.17) shall be 
used to determine the hydrogen and carbon monoxide content.
    (2) The sampling time for each run shall be 1 hour in which either 
an integrated sample or four grab samples shall be taken. If grab 
sampling is used, then the samples shall be taken at 15 minute 
intervals.
    (3) Published or calculated values shall be used for the net heats 
of combustion of the sample components. If values are not published or 
cannot be calculated, ASTM D2382-76 or 88 or D4809-95 (incorporated by 
reference--see Sec. 60.17) may be used to determine the net heat of 
combustion of component ``j.''
    (g) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the exit 
velocity provisions in Sec. 60.18 as referenced by Sec. 60.562-
1(a)(1)(i)(C) as follows:
    (1) If applicable, the net heating value (H<INF>T) of the 
process vent shall be determined according to the procedures in 
paragraph (f) of this section to determine the applicable velocity 
requirements.
    (2) If applicable, the maximum permitted velocity (V<INF>max) 
for steam-assisted and nonassisted flares shall be computed using the 
following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.022

Where:

V<INF>max = Maximum permitted velocity, m/sec (ft/sec)

this section, MJ/scm (Btu/scf).

    (3) The maximum permitted velocity, V<INF>max, for air-
assisted flares shall be determined by the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.023

Where:

V<INF>max = Maximum permitted velocity, m/sec (ft/sec).
K<INF>6 = 8.706 m/sec (metric units)
     = 28.56 ft/sec (English units)
K<INF>7 = 0.7084 [(m/sec)/MJ/scm)] (metric units)
     = 0.00245 [(ft/sec)/Btu/scf)] (English units)
H<INF>T = The net heating value as determined in paragraph (f) of 
this section, MJ/scm (Btu/scf).

    (4) The actual exit velocity of a flare shall be determined by 
dividing the volumetric flow rate (in units of standard temperature and 
pressure), as determined by Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D as appropriate, by 
the unobstructed (free) cross sectional area of the flare tip.
    (h) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the mass 
emission per mass product standards in Sec. Sec. 60.560(d) and (e) and 
in Sec. Sec. 60.562-1(b)(1)(i), (c)(1)(i)(A), (c)(1)(ii)(A), (c)(2)(i), 
and (c)(2)(ii)(A).
    (1) The emission rate of TOC shall be computed using the following 
equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.024

Where:

ER<INF>TOC = Emission rate of total organic compounds (minus 
methane and ethane), kg TOC/Mg (lb TOC/ton) product
E<INF>TOC = Emission rate of total organic compounds (minus 
methane and ethane) in the sample, kg/hr (lb/hr)
P<INF>p = The rate of polymer production, kg/hr (lb/hr)
K<INF>5 = 1,000 kg/Mg (metric units)
     = 2,000 lb/ton (English units)

    (2) The mass rate of TOC, E<INF>TOC, shall be determined 
according to the procedures, as appropriate, in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section. The sampling site for determining compliance with Sec. Sec. 
60.560 (d) and (e) shall be before any add-on control devices and after 
all product recovery devices. Otherwise, the sampling site shall be at 
the outlet of the control device.
    (3) The rate of polymer production, P<INF>p, shall be 
determined by dividing the weight of polymer pulled (in kg (lb)) from 
the process line during the performance test by the number of hours 
taken to perform the performance test. The weight of polymer pulled 
shall be determined by direct measurement or,

[[Page 531]]

subject to prior approval by the Administrator, computed from materials 
balance by good engineering practice.
    (i) The owner or operator shall determine continuous compliance with 
the temperature requirements in Sec. Sec. 60.562-1(b)(1)(ii) and 
60.562-1(c)(1)(i)(B) by using the temperature monitoring equipment 
described in Sec. 60.563(a)(1). An average temperature shall be 
determined from measurements taken at least every 15 minutes every three 
hours while the vent stream is normally routed and constituted. Each 
three-hour period constitutes a performance test.
    (j) For purposes of determining compliance with Sec. 60.562-1(c) 
(1)(ii)(B), (1)(ii)(C), (2)(ii)(B), or (2)(ii)(C), the ethylene glycol 
concentration in either the cooling tower or the liquid effluent from 
steam-jet ejectors used to produce a vacuum in the polymerization 
reactors, whichever is applicable, shall be determined:
    (1) Using procedures that conform to the methods described in ASTM 
D2908-74 or 91, ``Standard Practice for Measuring Volatile Organic 
Matter in Water by Aqueous-Injection Gas Chromatography'' (incorporated 
by reference--see Sec. 60.17), except as provided in paragraph (j)(2) 
of this section:
    (i) At least one sample per operating day shall be collected using 
the grab sampling procedures of ASTM D3370-76 or 96a, ``Standard 
Practices for Sampling Water'' (incorporated by reference--see Sec. 
60.17). An average ethylene glycol concentration by weight shall be 
calculated on a daily basis over a rolling 14-day period of operating 
days, except as provided in paragraphs (j)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this 
section. Each daily average ethylene glycol concentration so calculated 
constitutes a performance test. Exceedance of the standard during the 
reduced testing program specified in paragraphs (j)(1) (ii) and (iii) of 
this section is a violation of these standards.
    (ii) For those determining compliance with Sec. 60.562-1(c) 
(1)(ii)(B) or (2)(ii)(B), the owner or operator may elect to reduce the 
sampling program to any 14 consecutive day period once every two 
calendar months, if at least seventeen consecutive 14-day rolling 
average concentrations immediately preceding the reduced sampling 
program are each less than 0.10 weight percent ethylene glycol. If the 
average concentration obtained over the 14 day sampling during the 
reduced testing period exceeds the upper 95 percent confidence interval 
calculated from the most recent test results in which no one 14-day 
average exceeded 0.10 weight percent ethylene glycol, then the owner or 
operator shall reinstitute a daily sampling program. A reduced sampling 
program can be reinstituted if the requirements specified in this 
paragraph are met.
    (iii) For those determining compliance with Sec. 60.562-
1(c)(1)(ii)(C) or (c)(2)(ii)(C), the owner or operator may elect to 
reduce the sampling program to any 14 consecutive day period once every 
two calendar months, if at least seventeen consecutive 14-day rolling 
average concentrations immediately preceding the reduced sampling 
program are each less than 1.8 weight percent ethylene glycol. If the 
average concentration obtained over the 14 day sampling during the 
reduced test period exceeds the upper 95 percent confidence interval 
calculated from the most recent test results in which no one 14-day 
average exceeded 1.8 weight percent ethylene glycol, then the owner or 
operator shall reinstitute a daily sampling program. A reduced program 
can be reinstituted if the requirements specified in this paragraph are 
met.
    (iv) The upper 95 percent confidence interval shall be calculated 
using the equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.025

Where:

X<INF>i = daily ethylene glycol concentration for each day used to 
calculate the 14-day rolling average used in test results to justify 
implementing the reduced testing program.
n = number of ethylene glycol concentrations.

    (2) Measuring an alternative parameter, such as carbon oxygen demand 
or biological oxygen demand, that is demonstrated to be directly 
proportional to

[[Page 532]]

the ethylene glycol concentration. Such parameter shall be measured 
during the initial 14-day performance test during which the facility is 
shown to be in compliance with the ethylene glycol concentration 
standard whereby the ethylene glycol concentration is determined using 
the procedures described in paragraph (j)(1) of this section. The 
alternative parameter shall be measured on a daily basis and the average 
value of the alternative parameter shall be calculated on a daily basis 
over a rolling 14-day period of operating days. Each daily average value 
of the alternative parameter constitutes a performance test.

Sec. 60.582  Standard for volatile organic compounds.

    (a) On and after the date on which the performance test required by 
Sec. 60.8 has been completed, each owner or operator subject to this 
subpart shall either:
    (1) Use inks with a weighted average VOC content less than 1.0

<R05>
Sec. 60.583  Test methods and procedures.

    (a) Methods in appendix A of this part, except as provided under 
Sec. 60.8(b), shall be used to determine compliance with Sec. 
60.582(a) as follows:
    (1) Method 24 for analysis of inks. If nonphotochemically reactive 
solvents are used in the inks, standard gas

[[Page 538]]

chromatographic techniques may be used to identify and quantify these 
solvents. The results of Method 24 may be adjusted to subtract these 
solvents from the measured VOC content.
    (2) Method 25A for VOC concentration (the calibration gas shall be 
propane);
    (3) Method 1 for sample and velocity traverses;
    (4) Method 2 for velocity and volumetric flow rates;
    (5) Method 3 for gas analysis;
    (6) Method 4 for stack gas moisture.
    (b) To demonstrate compliance with Sec. 60.582(a)(1), the owner or 
operator of an affected facility shall determine the weighted average 
VOC content of the inks according to the following procedures:
    (1) Determine and record the VOC content and amount of each ink used 
at the print head, including the VOC content and amount of diluent 
solvent, for any time periods when VOC emission control equipment is not 
used.
    (2) Compute the weighted average VOC content by the following 
equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.050

    (3) The weighted average VOC content of the inks shall be calculated 
over a period that does not exceed one calendar month, or four 
consecutive weeks. A facility that uses an accounting system based on 
quarters consisting of two 28 calendar day periods and one 35 calendar 
day period may use an averaging period of 35 calendar days four times 
per year, provided the use of such an accounting system is documented in 
the initial performance test.
    (4) Each determination of the weighted average VOC content shall 
constitute a performance test for any period when VOC emission control 
equipment is not used. Results of the initial performance test must be 
reported to the Administrator. Method 24 or ink manufacturers' 
formulation data along with plant blending records (if plant blending is 
done) may be used to determine VOC content. The Administrator may 
require the use of Method 24 if there is a question concerning the 
accuracy of the ink manufacturer's data or plant blending records.
    (5) If, during the time periods when emission control equipment is 
not used, all inks used contain less than 1.0 kilogram VOC per kilogram 
ink solids, the owner or operator is not required to calculate the 
weighted average VOC content, but must verify and record the VOC content 
of each ink (including any added dilution solvent) used as determined by 
Method 24, ink manufacturers' formulation data, or plant blending 
records.
    (c) To demonstrate compliance with Sec. 60.582(a)(1), the owner or 
operator may determine the weighted average VOC content using an 
inventory system.
    (1) The inventory system shall accurately account to the nearest 
kilogram for the VOC content of all inks and dilution solvent used, 
recycled, and discarded for each affected facility during the averaging 
period. Separate records must be kept for each affected facility.
    (2) To determine VOC content of inks and dilution solvent used or 
recycled, Method 24 or ink manufacturers' formulation data must be used 
in combination with plant blending records (if plant blending is done) 
or inventory records or purchase records for new inks or dilution 
solvent.
    (3) For inks to be discarded, only Method 24 shall be used to 
determine the VOC content. Inks to be discarded may be combined prior to 
measurement of volume or weight and testing by Method 24.
    (4) The Administrator may require the use of Method 24 if there is a 
question concerning the accuracy of the ink manufacturer's data or plant 
records.

[[Page 539]]

    (5) The Administrator shall approve the inventory system of 
accounting for VOC content prior to the initial performance test.
    (d) To demonstrate compliance with Sec. 60.582(a)(2), the owner or 
operator of an affected facility controlled by a solvent recovery 
emission control device or an incineration control device shall conduct 
a performance test to determine overall VOC emission control efficiency 
according to the following procedures:
    (1) The performance test shall consist of three runs. Each test run 
must last a minimum of 30 minutes and shall continue until the printing 
operation is interrupted or until 180 minutes of continuous operation 
occurs. During each test run, the print line shall be printing 
continuously and operating normally. The VOC emission reduction 
efficiency achieved for each test run is averaged over the entire test 
run period.
    (2) VOC concentration values at each site shall be measured 
simultaneously.
    (3) The volumetric flow rate shall be determined from one Method 2 
measurement for each test run conducted immediately prior to, during, or 
after that test run. Volumetric flow rates at each site do not need to 
be measured simultaneously.
    (4) In order to determine capture efficiency from an affected 
facility, all fugitive VOC emissions from the affected facility shall be 
captured and vented through stacks suitable for measurement. During a 
performance test, the owner or operator of an affected facility located 
in an area with other sources of VOC shall isolate the affected facility 
from other sources of VOC. These two requirements shall be accomplished 
using one of the following methods:
    (i) Build a permanent enclosure around the affected facility;
    (ii) Build a temporary enclosure around the affected facility and 
duplicate, to an extent that is reasonably feasible, the ventilation 
conditions that are in effect when the affected facility is not enclosed 
(one way to do this is to divide the room exhaust rate by the volume of 
the room and then duplicate that quotient or 20 air changes per hour, 
whichever is smaller, in the temporary enclosure); or
    (iii) Shut down all other sources of VOC and continue to exhaust 
fugitive emissions from the affected facility through any building 
ventilation system and other room exhausts such as print line ovens and 
embossers.
    (5) For each affected facility, compliance with Sec. 60.582(a)(2) 
has been demonstrated if the average value of the overall control 
efficiency (EF) for the three runs is equal to or greater than 85 
percent. An overall control efficiency is calculated for each run as 
follows:
    (i) For efficiency of the emission control device,

    (2) During the performance test, the owner or operator shall 
determine and record the average gas temperature both upstream and 
downstream of the catalyst bed. After the performance test, the owner or 
operator shall determine and record, in addition to the record made by

compressor is in hydrogen service.
    (2) Each compressor is presumed not be be in hydrogen service unless 
an owner or operator demonstrates that the piece of equipment is in 
hydrogen service. For a piece of equipment to be considered in hydrogen 
service, it must be determined that the percent hydrogen content can be 
reasonably expected always to exceed 50 percent by volume. For purposes 
of determining the percent hydrogen content in the process fluid that is 
contained in or contacts a compressor, procedures that conform to the 
general method described in ASTM E260-73, 91, or 96, E168-67, 77, or 92, 
or E169-63, 77, or 93 (incorporated by reference as specified in Sec. 
60.17) shall be used.
    (3)(i) An owner or operator may use engineering judgment rather than 
procedures in paragraph (b)(2) of this section to demonstrate that the 
percent content exceeds 50 percent by volume, provided the engineering 
judgment demonstrates that the content clearly exceeds 50 percent by 
volume. When an owner or operator and the Administrator do not agree on 
whether a piece of equipment is in hydrogen service, however, the 
procedures in paragraph (b)(2) shall be used to resolve the 
disagreement.
    (ii) If an owner or operator determines that a piece of equipment is 
in hydrogen service, the determination can be revised only after 
following the procedures in paragraph (b)(2).
    (c) Any existing reciprocating compressor that becomes an affected 
facility under provisions of Sec. 60.14 or Sec. 60.15 is exempt from 
Sec. 60.482 (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (h) provided the owner or 
operator demonstrates that recasting the distance piece or replacing the 
compressor are the only options available to bring the compressor into 
compliance with the provisions of Sec. 60.482 (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), 
and (h).
    (d) An owner or operator may use the following provision in addition 
to Sec. 60.485(e): Equipment is in light liquid service if the percent 
evaporated is greater than 10 percent at 150 [deg]C as determined by 
ASTM Method D86-78, 82, 90, 95, or 96 (incorporated by reference as 
specified in Sec. 60.18).
    (e) Pumps in light liquid service and valves in gas/vapor and light 
liquid service within a process unit that is located in the Alaskan 
North Slope are exempt from the requirements of Sec. 60.482-2 and Sec. 
60.482-7.

<R05>
Sec. 60.603  Performance test and compliance provisions.

    (a) Section 60.8(f) does not apply to the performance test 
procedures required by this subpart.
    (b) Each owner or operator of an affected facility shall determine 
compliance with the applicable standard in Sec. 60.602(a) by 
determining and recording monthly the VOC emissions per unit mass 
solvent feed from each affected facility for the current and preceding 5 
consecutive calendar months and using these values to calculate the 6-
month average emissions. Each calculation is considered a performance 
test. The owner or operator of an affected facility shall use the 
following procedure to determine VOC emissions for each calendar month;
    (1) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate monitoring devices 
that continuously measure and permanently record for each calendar month 
the amount of makeup solvent and solvent feed. These values shall be 
used in calculating VOC emissions according to paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section. All monitoring devices, meters, and peripheral equipment shall 
be calibrated and any error recorded. Total compounded error of the flow 
measuring and recording devices shall not exceed 1 percent accuracy over 
the operating range. As an alternative to measuring solvent feed, the 
owner or operator may:
    (i) Measure the amount of recovered solvent returned to the solvent 
feed storage tanks, and use the following equation to determine the 
amount of solvent feed:

Solvent Feed=Makeup Solvent+Recovered
Solvent+Change in the Amount of Solvent
Contained in the Solvent Feed Holding Tank.

    (ii) Measure and record the amount of polymer introduced into the 
affected facility and the solvent-to-polymer ratio of the spinning 
solutions, and use the following equation to determine the amount of 
solvent feed:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.083

where subscript ``i'' denotes each particular spinning solution used 
during the test period; values of ``i'' vary from one to the total 
number of spinning solutions, ``n,'' used during the calendar month.

    (2) VOC emissions shall be determined each calendar month by use of 
the following equations:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.084

where all values are for the calendar month only and where
E = VOC Emissions, in kg/Mg (lb/ton) solvent;
S<INF>V = Measured or calculated volume of solvent feed, in liters 
(gallons);
S<INF>W = Weight of solvent feed, in Mg (ton);
M<INF>V = Measured volume of makeup solvent, in liters (gallons);
M<INF>W = Weight of makeup, in kg (lb);
N = Allowance for nongaseous losses, 13 kg/Mg (26 lb/ton) solvent feed;
S<INF>P = Fraction of measured volume that is actual solvent 
(excludes water);

[[Page 545]]

D = Density of the solvent, in kg/liter (lb/gallon);
K = Conversion factor, 1,000 kg/Mg (2,000 lb/ton);
I = Allowance for solvent inventory variation or changes in the amount 
of solvent contained in the affected facility, in kg/Mg (lb/ton) solvent 
feed (may be positive or negative);
I<INF>S = Amount of solvent contained in the affected facility at 
the beginning of the test period, as determined by the owner or 
operator, in kg (lb);
I<INF>E = Amount of solvent contained in the affected facility at 
the close of the test period, as determined by the owner or operator, in 
kg (lb).

    (3) N, as used in the equation in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, 
equals 13 kg/Mg (26 lb/ton) solvent feed to the spinning solution 
preparation system and precipitation bath. This value shall be used in 
all cases unless an owner or operator demonstrates to the satisfaction 
of the Administrator that greater nongaseous losses occur at the 
affected facility. In this case, the greater value may be substituted in 
the equation.

Sec. 60.604  Reporting requirements.

    (a) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall submit a 
written report to the Administrator of the following:
    (1) The results of the initial performance test; and
    (2) The results of subsequent performance tests that indicate that 
VOC emissions exceed the standards in Sec. 60.602. These reports shall 
be submitted quarterly at 3-month intervals after the initial 
performance test. If no exceedances occur during a particular quarter, a 
report stating this shall be submitted to the Administrator 
semiannually.
    (b) Solvent-spun synthetic fiber producing facilities exempted from 
these standards in Sec. 60.600(a) (those producing less than 500 Mg 
(551 ton) annually) shall report to the Administrator within 30 days 
whenever extruded fiber for the preceding 12 calendar months exceeds 500 
Mg (551 ton).
    (c) The requirements of this section remain in force until and 
unless EPA, in delegating enforcement authority to a State under section 
111(c) of the Act, approves reporting requirements or an alternate means 
of compliance surveillance adopted by such State. In that event, 
affected sources within the State will be relieved of the obligation to 
comply with this section, provided that they comply with the 
requirements established by the State.

provided under Sec. 60.8(b) shall be used as reference methods to 
determine compliance with the emission limit or percent reduction 
efficiency specified under Sec. 60.612(a).

as that of the TOC samples and the samples shall be taken during the 
same time that the TOC samples are taken. The TOC concentration 
corrected to 3 percent O<INF>2 (C<INF>c) shall be computed

    (c) When a boiler or process heater with a design heat input 
capacity of 44 MW (150 million Btu/hour) or greater is used to seek to 
comply with Sec. 60.612(a), the requirement for an initial performance 
test is waived, in accordance with Sec. 60.8(b). However, the 
Administrator reserves the option to require testing at such other times

vent stream and at the outlet of the final recovery device.
    (C) This efficiency is applied to the TOC concentration measured 
prior to the final recovery device and prior to the introduction of the 
nonair oxidation stream to determine the concentration of TOC in the air 
oxidation stream from the final recovery device. This concentration of 
TOC is then used to perform the calculations outlined in Sec.

Sec. 60.624  Test methods and procedures.

    Each owner or operator of an affected facility subject to the 
provisions of Sec. 60.622(a) shall perform an initial test to verify 
that the flow rate of recovered solvent from the solvent recovery dryer 
at the termination of the recovery cycle is no greater than 0.05 liters 
per minute. This test shall be conducted for a duration of no less than 
2 weeks during which no less than 50 percent of the dryer loads shall be 
monitored for their final recovered solvent flow rate. The suggested 
point for measuring the flow rate of recovered solvent is the outlet of 
the solvent-water separator. Near the end of the recovery cycle, the 
entire flow of recovered solvent should be diverted to a graduated 
cylinder. As the recovered solvent collects in the graduated cylinder, 
the elapsed time is monitored and recorded in periods of greater than or 
equal to 1 minute. At the same time, the volume of solvent in the 
graduated cylinder is monitored and recorded to determine the volume of 
recovered solvent that is collected during each time period. The 
recovered solvent flow rate is calculated by dividing the volume of 
solvent collected per period by the length of time elapsed during the 
period and converting the result with appropriate factors into units of 
liters per minute. The recovery cycle and the monitoring procedure 
should continue until the flow rate of solvent is less than or equal to 
0.05 liter per minute. The type of articles cleaned and the total length 
of the cycle should then be recorded.

Sec. 60.644  Test methods and procedures.

    (a) In conducting the performance tests required in Sec. 60.8, the 
owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test 
methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as 
specified in this section, except as provided in paragraph Sec. 
60.8(b).
    (b) During a performance test required by Sec. 60.8, the owner or 
operator shall determine the minimum required reduction efficiencies (Z) 
of SO<INF>2 emissions as required in Sec. 60.642 (a) and (b) as 
follows:
    (1) The average sulfur feed rate (X) shall be computed as follows:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.030
    
Where:

X = average sulfur feed rate, Mg/D (LT/D).
Q<INF>a = average volumetric flow rate of acid gas from sweetening 
unit, dscm/day (dscf/day).
Y = average H<INF>2S concentration in acid gas feed from 
sweetening unit, percent by volume, expressed as a decimal.
K = (32 kg S/kg-mole)/((24.04 dscm/kg-mole)(1000 kg S/ Mg)) = 1.331 x 
10<SUP>-3</SUP> Mg/dscm, for metric units
    = (32 lb S/lb-mole)/((385.36 dscf/lb-mole)(2240 lb S/long ton))
    = 3.707 x 10<SUP>-5</SUP> long ton/dscf, for English units.

    (2) The continuous readings from the process flowmeter shall be used 
to determine the average volumetric flow rate (Q<INF>a) in dscm/
day (dscf/day) of the acid gas from the sweetening unit for each run.
    (3) The Tutwiler procedure in Sec. 60.648 or a chromatographic 
procedure following ASTM E-260 (incorporated by reference--see Sec. 
60.17) shall be used to determine the H<INF>2S concentration in 
the acid gas feed from the sweetening unit. At least one sample per hour 
(at equally spaced intervals) shall be taken during each 4-hour run. The 
arithmetic mean of all samples shall be the average H<INF>2S 
concentration (Y) on a dry basis for the run. By multiplying the result 
from the Tutwiler procedure by 1.62 x 10<SUP>-3</SUP>, the units gr/100 
scf are converted to volume percent.
    (4) Using the information from paragraphs (b) (1) and (3), Tables 1 
and 2 shall be used to determine the required initial (Z<INF>i) 
and continuous (Z<INF>c) reduction efficiencies of SO<INF>2 
emissions.
    (c) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
SO<INF>2 standards in Sec. 60.642 (a) or (b) as follows:
    (1) The emission reduction efficiency (R) achieved by the sulfur 
recovery technology shall be computed for each run using the following 
equation:

R=(100 S)/(S+E)

    (2) The level indicators or manual soundings shall be used to 
measure the liquid sulfur accumulation rate in the product storage 
tanks. Readings taken at the beginning and end of each run, the tank 
geometry, sulfur density at the storage temperature, and sample duration 
shall be used to determine the sulfur production rate (S) in kg/hr (lb/
hr) for each run.
    (3) The emission rate of sulfur shall be computed for each run as 
follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.031

Where:

E = emission rate of sulfur per run, kg/hr.
C<INF>e = concentration of sulfur equivalent (SO<INF>2 + 
reduced sulfur), g/dscm (lb/dscf).
Q<INF>sd = volumetric flow rate of effluent gas, dscm/hr (dscf/
hr).
K<INF>1 = conversion factor, 1000 g/kg (7000 gr/lb).

    (4) The concentration (C<INF>e) of sulfur equivalent shall be 
the sum of the SO<INF>2 and TRS concentrations, after being 
converted to sulfur equivalents. For each run and each of the test 
methods specified in this paragraph (c) of this section, the sampling 
time shall be at

[[Page 568]]

least 4 hours. Method 1 shall be used to select the sampling site. The 
sampling point in the duct shall be at the centroid of the cross-section 
if the area is less than 5 m\2\ (54 ft\2\) or at a point no closer to 
the walls than 1 m (39 in.) if the cross-sectional area is 5 m\2\ or 
more, and the centroid is more than 1 m (39 in.) from the wall.
    (i) Method 6 shall be used to determine the SO<INF>2 
concentration. Eight samples of 20 minutes each shall be taken at 30-
minute intervals. The arithmetic average shall be the concentration for 
the run. The concentration shall be multiplied by 0.5 x 10<SUP>-3</SUP> 
to convert the results to sulfur equivalent.
    (ii) Method 15 shall be used to determine the TRS concentration from 
reduction-type devices or where the oxygen content of the effluent gas 
is less than 1.0 percent by volume. The sampling rate shall be at least 
3 liters/min (0.1 ft\3\/min) to insure minimum residence time in the 
sample line. Sixteen samples shall be taken at 15-minute intervals. The 
arithmetic average of all the samples shall be the concentration for the 
run. The concentration in ppm reduced sulfur as sulfur shall be 
multiplied by 1.333 x 10<SUP>-3</SUP> to convert the results to sulfur 
equivalent.
    (iii) Method 16A or 15 shall be used to determine the reduced sulfur 
concentration from oxidation-type devices or where the oxygen content of 
the effluent gas is greater than 1.0 percent by volume. Eight samples of 
20 minutes each shall be taken at 30-minute intervals. The arithmetic 
average shall be the concentration for the run. The concentration in ppm 
reduced sulfur as sulfur shall be multiplied by 1.333 x 10<SUP>-3</SUP> 
to convert the results to sulfur equivalent.
    (iv) Method 2 shall be used to determine the volumetric flow rate of 
the effluent gas. A velocity traverse shall be conducted at the 
beginning and end of each run. The arithmetic average of the two 
measurements shall be used to calculate the volumetric flow rate 
(Q<INF>sd) for the run. For the determination of the effluent gas 
molecular weight, a single integrated sample over the 4-hour period may 
be taken and analyzed or grab samples at 1-hour intervals may be taken, 
analyzed, and averaged. For the moisture content, two samples of at 
least 0.10 dscm (3.5 dscf) and 10 minutes shall be taken at the 
beginning of the 4-hour run and near the end of the time period. The 
arithmetic average of the two runs shall be the moisture content for the 
run.
    (d) To comply with Sec. 60.646(d), the owner or operator shall 
obtain the information required by using the monitoring devices in 
paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 60.646  Monitoring of emissions and operations.

    (a) The owner or operator subject to the provisions of Sec. 60.642 
(a) or (b) shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate monitoring 
devices or perform measurements to determine the following operations 
information on a daily basis:
    (1) The accumulation of sulfur product over each 24-hour period: The 
monitoring method may incorporate the use of an instrument to measure 
and record the liquid sulfur production rate, or may be a procedure for 
measuring and recording the sulfur liquid levels in the storage tanks 
with a level indicator or by manual soundings, with subsequent 
calculation of the sulfur production rate based on the tank geometry, 
stored sulfur density, and elapsed time between readings. The method 
shall be designed to be accurate within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2 percent 
of the 24-hour sulfur accumulation.
    (2) The H<INF>2S concentration in the acid gas from the 
sweetening unit for each 24-hour period: At least one sample per 24-hour 
period shall be collected and analyzed using the method specified in 
Sec. 60.644(b)(1). The Administrator may require the owner or operator 
to demonstrate that the H<INF>2S concentration obtained from one 
or more samples over a 24-hour period is within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>20 
percent of the average of 12 samples collected at equally spaced 
intervals during the 24-hour period. In instances where the 
H<INF>2S concentration of a single sample is not within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>20 percent of the

[[Page 569]]

average of the 12 equally spaced samples, the Administrator may require 
a more frequent sampling schedule.
    (3) The average acid gas flow rate from the sweetening unit: The 
owner or operator shall install and operate a monitoring device to 
continuously measure the flow rate of acid gas. The monitoring device 
reading shall be recorded at least once per hour during each 24-hour 
period. The average acid gas flow rate shall be computed from the 
individual readings.
    (4) The sulfur feed rate (X): For each 24-hour period, X shall be 
computed using the equation in Sec. 60.644(b)(3).
    (5) The required sulfur dioxide emission reduction efficiency for 
the 24-hour period: The sulfur feed rate and the H<INF>2S 
concentration in the acid gas for the 24-hour period as applicable, 
shall be used to determine the required reduction efficiency in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 60.642(b).
    (b) Where compliance is achieved through the use of an oxidation 
control system or a reduction control system followed by a continually 
operated incineration device, the owner or operator shall install, 
calibrate, maintain, and operate monitoring devices and continuous 
emission monitors as follows:
    (1) A continuous monitoring system to measure the total sulfur 
emission rate (E) of SO<INF>2 in the gases discharged to the 
atmosphere. The SO<INF>2 emission rate shall be expressed in terms 
of equivalent sulfur mass flow rates (kg/hr (lb/hr)). The span of this 
monitoring system shall be set so that the equivalent emission limit of 
Sec. 60.642(b) will be between 30 percent and 70 percent of the 
measurement range of the instrument system.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section: A 
monitoring device to measure the temperature of the gas leaving the 
combustion zone of the incinerator, if compliance with Sec. 60.642(a) 
is achieved through the use of an oxidation control system or a 
reduction control system followed by a continually operated incineration 
device. The monitoring device shall be certified by the manufacturer to 
be accurate to within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 percent of the temperature 
being measured.

When performance tests are conducted under the provision of Sec. 60.8 
to demonstrate compliance with the standards under Sec. 60.642, the 
temperature of the gas leaving the incinerator combustion zone shall be 
determined using the monitoring device. If the volumetric ratio of 
sulfur dioxide to sulfur dioxide plus total reduced sulfur (expressed as 
SO<INF>2) in the gas leaving the incinerator is <=0.98, then 
temperature monitoring may be used to demonstrate that sulfur dioxide 
emission monitoring is sufficient to determine total sulfur emissions. 
At all times during the operation of the facility, the owner or operator 
shall maintain the average temperature of the gas leaving the combustion 
zone of the incinerator at or above the appropriate level determined 
during the most recent performance test to ensure the sulfur compound 
oxidation criteria are met. Operation at lower average temperatures may 
be considered by the Administrator to be unacceptable operation and 
maintenance of the affected facility. The owner or operator may request 
that the minimum incinerator temperature be reestablished by conducting 
new performance tests under Sec. 60.8.
    (3) Upon promulgation of a performance specification of continuous 
monitoring systems for total reduced sulfur compounds at sulfur recovery 
plants, the owner or operator may, as an alternative to paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section, install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous 
emission monitoring system for total reduced sulfur compounds as 
required in paragraph (d) of this section in addition to a sulfur 
dioxide emission monitoring system. The sum of the equivalent sulfur 
mass emission rates from the two monitoring systems shall be used to 
compute the total sulfur emission rate (E).
    (c) Where compliance is achieved through the use of a reduction 
control system not followed by a continually operated incineration 
device, the owner or operator shall install, calibrate, maintain, and 
operate a continuous monitoring system to measure the emission rate of 
reduced sulfur compounds as SO<INF>2 equivalent in the gases 
discharged to the atmosphere. The SO<INF>2 equivalent compound 
emission

[[Page 570]]

rate shall be expressed in terms of equivalent sulfur mass flow rates 
(kg/hr (lb/hr)). The span of this monitoring system shall be set so that 
the equivalent emission limit of Sec. 60.642(b) will be between 30 and 
70 percent of the measurement range of the system. This requirement 
becomes effective upon promulgation of a performance specification for 
continuous monitoring systems for total reduced sulfur compounds at 
sulfur recovery plants.
    (d) For those sources required to comply with paragraph (b) or (c) 
of this section, the average sulfur emission reduction efficiency 
achieved (R) shall be calculated for each 24-hour clock internal. The 
24-hour interval may begin and end at any selected clock time, but must 
be consistent. The 24-hour average reduction efficiency (R) shall be 
computed based on the 24-hour average sulfur production rate (S) and 
sulfur emission rate (E), using the equation in Sec. 60.644(c)(1).
    (1) Data obtained from the sulfur production rate monitoring device 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section shall be used to determine S.
    (2) Data obtained from the sulfur emission rate monitoring systems 
specified in paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section shall be used to 
calculate a 24-hour average for the sulfur emission rate (E). The 
monitoring system must provide at least one data point in each 
successive 15-minute interval. At least two data points must be used to

Sec. 60.648  Optional procedure for measuring hydrogen sulfide in 

acid gas--Tutwiler Procedure. \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Gas Engineers Handbook, Fuel Gas Engineering Practices, The 
Industrial Press, 93 Worth Street, New York, NY, 1966, First Edition, 
Second Printing, page 6/25 (Docket A-80-20-A, Entry II-I-67).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (a) When an instantaneous sample is desired and H<INF>2S 
concentration is ten grains per 1000 cubic foot or more, a 100 ml 
Tutwiler burette is used. For concentrations less than ten grains, a 500 
ml Tutwiler burette and more dilute solutions are used. In principle, 
this method consists of titrating hydrogen sulfide in a gas sample 
directly with a standard solution of iodine.
    (b) Apparatus. (See Figure 1.) A 100 or 500 ml capacity Tutwiler 
burette, with two-way glass stopcock at bottom and three-way stopcock at 
top which connect either with inlet tubulature or glass-stoppered 
cylinder, 10 ml capacity, graduated in 0.1 ml subdivision; rubber tubing 
connecting burette with leveling bottle.
    (c) Reagents. (1) Iodine stock solution, 0.1N. Weight 12.7 g iodine, 
and 20 to 25 g cp potassium iodide for each liter of solution. Dissolve 
KI in as little water as necessary; dissolve iodine in concentrated KI 
solution, make up to proper volume, and store in glass-stoppered brown 
glass bottle.
    (2) Standard iodine solution, 1 ml=0.001771 g I. Transfer 33.7 ml of 
above 0.1N stock solution into a 250 ml volumetric flask; add water to 
mark and mix well. Then, for 100 ml sample of gas, 1 ml of standard 
iodine solution is equivalent to 100 grains H<INF>2S per cubic 
feet of gas.
    (3) Starch solution. Rub into a thin paste about one teaspoonful of 
wheat starch with a little water; pour into about a pint of boiling 
water; stir; let cool and decant off clear solution. Make fresh solution 
every few days.
    (d) Procedure. Fill leveling bulb with starch solution. Raise (L), 
open cock (G), open (F) to (A), and close (F) when solutions starts to 
run out of gas inlet. Close (G). Purge gas sampling line and connect 
with (A). Lower (L) and open (F) and (G). When liquid level is several 
ml past the 100 ml mark, close (G) and (F), and disconnect sampling 
tube. Open (G) and bring starch solution to 100 ml mark by raising (L); 
then close (G). Open (F) momentarily, to bring gas in burette to 
atmospheric pressure, and close (F). Open (G), bring liquid level down 
to 10 ml mark by lowering (L). Close (G), clamp rubber tubing near (E) 
and disconnect it from burette. Rinse graduated cylinder with a standard 
iodine solution (0.00171 g I per ml); fill cylinder and record reading. 
Introduce successive small amounts of iodine thru (F); shake well after 
each addition; continue until a faint permanent blue color is obtained. 
Record reading; subtract from previous reading, and call difference D.
    (e) With every fresh stock of starch solution perform a blank test 
as follows: introduce fresh starch solution into burette up to 100 ml 
mark. Close (F) and (G). Lower (L) and open (G). When liquid level 
reaches the 10 ml mark, close (G). With air in burette, titrate as 
during a test and up to same end point. Call ml of iodine used C. Then,

Grains H<INF>2S per 100 cubic foot of gas=100 (D--C)


[[Page 572]]


    (f) Greater sensitivity can be attained if a 500 ml capacity 
Tutwiler burette is used with a more dilute (0.001N) iodine solution. 
Concentrations less than 1.0 grains per 100 cubic foot can be determined 
in this way. Usually, the starch-iodine end point is much less distinct, 
and a blank determination of end point, with H<INF>2S-free gas or 
air, is required.

Sec. 60.661  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, all terms not defined here shall have the 
meaning given them in the Act and in subpart A of part 60, and the 
following terms shall have the specific meanings given them.
    Batch distillation operation means a noncontinuous distillation 
operation in which a discrete quantity or batch of liquid feed is 
charged into a distillation unit and distilled at one time. After the 
initial charging of the liquid feed, no additional liquid is added 
during the distillation operation.
    Boiler means any enclosed combustion device that extracts useful 
energy in the form of steam.
    By compound means by individual stream components, not carbon 
equivalents.
    Continuous recorder means a data recording device recording an 
instantaneous data value at least once every 15 minutes.
    Distillation operation means an operation separating one or more 
feed stream(s) into two or more exit stream(s), each exit stream having 
component concentrations different from those in the feed stream(s). The 
separation is achieved by the redistribution of the components between 
the liquid and vapor-phase as they approach equilibrium within the 
distillation unit.
    Distillation unit means a device or vessel in which distillation 
operations occur, including all associated internals (such as trays or 
packing) and accessories (such as reboiler, condenser, vacuum pump, 
steam jet, etc.), plus any associated recovery system.
    Flame zone means the portion of the combustion chamber in a boiler 
occupied by the flame envelope.
    Flow indicator means a device which indicates whether gas flow is 
present in a vent stream.
    Halogenated vent stream means any vent stream determined to have a 
total

[[Page 574]]

concentration (by volume) of compounds containing halogens of 20 ppmv 
(by compound) or greater.
    Incinerator means any enclosed combustion device that is used for 
destroying organic compounds and does not extract energy in the form of

burning fuel to fluids contained in tubes, including all fluids except 
water that is heated to produce steam.
    Process unit means equipment assembled and connected by pipes or 
ducts to produce, as intermediates or final products, one or more of the 
chemicals in Sec. 60.667. A process unit can operate independently if 
supplied with sufficient fuel or raw materials and sufficient product 
storage facilities.
    Product means any compound or chemical listed in Sec. 60.667 that 
is produced for sale as a final product as that chemical, or for use in 
the production of other chemicals or compounds. By-products, co-
products, and intermediates are considered to be products.
    Recovery device means an individual unit of equipment, such as an 
absorber, carbon adsorber, or condenser, capable of and used for the 
purpose of recovering chemicals for use, reuse, or sale.
    Recovery system means an individual recovery device or series of 
such devices applied to the same vent stream.
    Total organic compounds (TOC) means those compounds measured 
according to the procedures in Sec. 60.664(b)(4). For the purposes of 
measuring molar composition as required in Sec. 60.664(d)(2)(i); hourly 
emissions rate as required in Sec. 60.664(d)(5) and Sec. 60.664(e);

not contribute appreciably to the formation of ozone are to be excluded. 
The compounds to be excluded are identified in Environmental Protection 
Agency's statements on ozone abatement policy for State Implementation 
Plans (SIP) revisions (42 FR 35314; 44 FR 32042; 45 FR 32424; 45 FR 
48942).
    TRE index value means a measure of the supplemental total resource 
requirement per unit reduction of TOC associated with an individual 
distillation vent stream, based on vent stream flow rate, emission rate 
of TOC net heating value, and corrosion properties (whether or not the 
vent stream is halogenated), as quantified by the equation given under 
Sec. 60.664(e).
    Vent stream means any gas stream discharged directly from a 
distillation facility to the atmosphere or indirectly to the atmosphere 
after diversion through other process equipment. The vent stream 
excludes relief valve discharges and equipment leaks including, but not 
limited to, pumps, compressors, and valves.


<R05>
Sec. 60.662  Standards.

    Each owner or operator of any affected facility shall comply with

capacity of 44 MW (150 million Btu/hour) or greater is used to seek to 
comply with Sec. 60.662(a), the requirement for an initial performance 
test is waived, in accordance with Sec. 60.8(b). However, the 
Administrator reserves the option to require testing at such other times 
as may be required, as provided for in section 114 of the Act.

provided under Sec. 60.8(b), shall be used for determining the net 
heating value of the gas combusted to determine compliance under Sec. 
60.662(b) and for determining the process vent stream TRE index value to 
determine compliance under Sec. 60.662(c).
    (1)(i) Method 1 or 1A, as appropriate, for selection of the sampling

section, prior to the inlet of any control device, prior to any post-
distillation dilution of the stream with air, and prior to any post-
distillation introduction of halogenated compounds into the process vent 
stream. No transverse site selection method is needed for vents smaller 
than 10 centimeters (4 inches) in diameter.
    (ii) If any gas stream other than the distillation vent stream from 
the affected facility is normally conducted through the final recovery 
device.
    (A) The sampling site for vent stream flow rate and molar 
composition shall be prior to the final recovery device and prior to the 
point at which the nondistillation stream is introduced.
    (B) The efficiency of the final recovery device is determined by 
measuring the TOC concentration using Method 18 at the inlet to the 
final recovery device after the introduction of any nondistillation vent 
stream and at the outlet of the final recovery device.
    (C) This efficiency is applied to the TOC concentration measured 
prior to the final recovery device and prior to the introduction of the 
nondistillation stream to determine the concentration of TOC in the 
distillation vent stream from the final recovery device. This 
concentration of TOC is then used to perform the calculations outlined 
in Sec. 60.664(e)(4) and (5).

[kcal/(lb-mole)], based on combustion at 25 [deg]C and 760 mm Hg (77 
[deg]F and 30 in. Hg).

of the recalculation and shall conduct a performance test according to 
the methods and procedures required by Sec. 60.664 in order to 
determine compliance with Sec. 60.662(a). Performance tests must be 
conducted as soon as possible after the process change but no later than 
180 days from the time of the process change.

Sec. 60.7(c) of the General Provisions.

[[Page 586]]

    (l) Each owner or operator that seeks to comply with the 
requirements of this subpart by complying with the requirements of Sec. 
60.660 (c)(4), (c)(5), or (c)(6) or Sec. 60.662 shall submit to the 
Administrator semiannual reports of the following recorded information. 
The initial report shall be submitted within 6 months after the initial 
start-up date.
    (1) Exceedances of monitored parameters recorded under Sec. 60.665 
(c) and (g).
    (2) All periods recorded under Sec. 60.665(d) when the vent stream 
is diverted from the control device or has no flow rate.
    (3) All periods recorded under Sec. 60.665(e) when the boiler or 
process heater was not operating.
    (4) All periods recorded under Sec. 60.665(f) in which the pilot 
flame of the flare was absent.
    (5) Any change in equipment or process operation that increases the 
operating vent stream flow rate above the low flow exemption level in 
Sec. 60.660(c)(6), including a measurement of the new vent stream flow 
rate, as recorded under Sec. 60.665(i). These must be reported as soon 
as possible after the change and no later than 180 days after the 
change. These reports may be submitted either in conjunction with 
semiannual reports or as a single separate report. A performance test 
must be completed with the same time period to verify the recalculated 
flow value and to obtain the vent stream characteristics of heating 
value and E<INF>TOC. The performance test is subject to the 
requirements of Sec. 60.8 of the General Provisions. Unless the 
facility qualifies for an exemption under the low capacity exemption 
status in Sec. 60.660(c)(5), the facility must begin compliance with 
the requirements set forth in Sec. 60.662.
    (6) Any change in equipment or process operation, as recorded under 
paragraph (j) of this section, that increases the design production 
capacity above the low capacity exemption level in Sec. 60.660(c)(5) 
and the new capacity resulting from the change for the distillation 
process unit containing the affected facility. These must be reported as 
soon as possible after the change and no later than 180 days after the 
change. These reports may be submitted either in conjunction with 
semiannual reports or as a single separate report. A performance test 
must be completed within the same time period to obtain the vent stream 
flow rate, heating value, and E<INF>TOC. The performance test is 
subject to the requirements of Sec. 60.8. The facility must begin 
compliance with the requirements set forth in Sec. 60.660(d) or Sec. 
60.662. If the facility chooses to comply with Sec. 60.662, the 
facility may qualify for an exemption in Sec. 60.660(c)(4) or (6).
    (7) Any recalculation of the TRE index value, as recorded under 
Sec. 60.665(h).
    (m) The requirements of Sec. 60.665(l) remain in force until and 
unless EPA, in delegating enforcement authority to a State under section 
111(c) of the Act, approves reporting requirements or an alternative 
means of compliance surveillance adopted by such State. In that event, 
affected sources within the State will be relieved of the obligation to 
comply with Sec. 60.665(l), provided that they comply with the 
requirements established by the State.
    (n) Each owner or operator that seeks to demonstrate compliance with 
Sec. 60.660(c)(5) must submit to the Administrator an initial report 
detailing the design production capacity of the process unit.
    (o) Each owner or operator that seeks to demonstrate compliance with 
Sec. 60.660(c)(6) must submit to the Administrator an initial report 
including a flow rate measurement using the test methods specified in 
Sec. 60.664.
    (p) The Administrator will specify appropriate reporting and 
recordkeeping requirements where the owner or operator of an affected 
facility complies with the standards specified under Sec. 60.662 other 
than as provided under Sec. 60.663(a), (b), (c) and (d).

an annual basis in accordance with manufacturer's instructions.


<R05>
Sec. 60.675  Test methods and procedures.

    (a) In conducting the performance tests required in Sec. 60.8, the 
owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test 
methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as 
specified in this section, except as provided in Sec. 60.8(b). 
Acceptable alternative methods and procedures are given in paragraph (e) 
of this section.
    (b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
particulate matter standards in Sec. 60.672(a) as follows:
    (1) Method 5 or Method 17 shall be used to determine the particulate 
matter concentration. The sample volume shall be at least 1.70 dscm (60 
dscf). For Method 5, if the gas stream being sampled is at ambient 
temperature, the sampling probe and filter may be operated without 
heaters. If the gas stream is above ambient temperature, the sampling 
probe and filter may be operated at a temperature high enough, but no 
higher than 121 [deg]C (250 [deg]F), to prevent water condensation on 
the filter.
    (2) Method 9 and the procedures in Sec. 60.11 shall be used to 
determine opacity.
    (c)(1) In determining compliance with the particulate matter 
standards in Sec. 60.672 (b) and (c), the owner or operator shall use 
Method 9 and the procedures in Sec. 60.11, with the following 
additions:
    (i) The minimum distance between the observer and the emission 
source shall be 4.57 meters (15 feet).
    (ii) The observer shall, when possible, select a position that 
minimizes interference from other fugitive emission sources (e.g., road 
dust). The required observer position relative to the sun (Method 9, 
Section 2.1) must be followed.
    (iii) For affected facilities using wet dust suppression for 
particulate matter control, a visible mist is sometimes generated by the 
spray. The water mist must not be confused with particulate matter 
emissions and is not to be considered a visible emission. When a water 
mist of this nature is present, the observation of emissions is to be 
made at a point in the plume where the mist is no longer visible.
    (2) In determining compliance with the opacity of stack emissions 
from any baghouse that controls emissions only from an individual 
enclosed storage bin under Sec. 60.672(f) of this subpart, using Method 
9, the duration of the Method 9 observations shall be 1 hour (ten 6-
minute averages).
    (3) When determining compliance with the fugitive emissions standard 
for any affected facility described under Sec. 60.672(b) of this 
subpart, the duration of the Method 9 observations may be reduced from 3 
hours (thirty 6-minute averages) to 1 hour (ten 6-minute averages) only 
if the following conditions apply:
    (i) There are no individual readings greater than 10 percent 
opacity; and
    (ii) There are no more than 3 readings of 10 percent for the 1-hour 
period.
    (4) When determining compliance with the fugitive emissions standard 
for any crusher at which a capture system is not used as described under 
Sec. 60.672(c) of this subpart, the duration of the Method 9 
observations may be reduced from 3 hours (thirty 6-minute averages) to 1 
hour (ten 6-minute averages) only if the following conditions apply:
    (i) There are no individual readings greater than 15 percent 
opacity; and
    (ii) There are no more than 3 readings of 15 percent for the 1-hour 
period.
    (d) In determining compliance with Sec. 60.672(e), the owner or 
operator shall use Method 22 to determine fugitive emissions. The 
performance test shall be conducted while all affected facilities inside 
the building are operating. The performance test for each building shall 
be at least 75 minutes in duration, with each side of the building and 
the roof being observed for at least 15 minutes.

[[Page 594]]

    (e) The owner or operator may use the following as alternatives to 
the reference methods and procedures specified in this section:
    (1) For the method and procedure of paragraph (c) of this section, 
if emissions from two or more facilities continuously interfere so that 
the opacity of fugitive emissions from an individual affected facility 
cannot be read, either of the following procedures may be used:
    (i) Use for the combined emission stream the highest fugitive 
opacity standard applicable to any of the individual affected facilities 
contributing to the emissions stream.
    (ii) Separate the emissions so that the opacity of emissions from 
each affected facility can be read.
    (f) To comply with Sec. 60.676(d), the owner or operator shall 
record the measurements as required in Sec. 60.676(c) using the 
monitoring devices in Sec. 60.674 (a) and (b) during each particulate 
matter run and shall determine the averages.
    (g) If, after 30 days notice for an initially scheduled performance 
test, there is a delay (due to operational problems, etc.) in conducting 
any rescheduled performance test required in this section, the owner or 
operator of an affected facility shall submit a notice to the 
Administrator at least 7 days prior to any rescheduled performance test.
    (h) Initial Method 9 performance tests under Sec. 60.11 of this 
part and Sec. 60.675 of this subpart are not required for:
    (1) Wet screening operations and subsequent screening operations, 
bucket elevators, and belt conveyors that process saturated material in 
the production line up to, but not including the next crusher, grinding 
mill or storage bin.
    (2) Screening operations, bucket elevators, and belt conveyors in 
the production line downstream of wet mining operations, that process 
saturated materials up to the first crusher, grinding mill, or storage 
bin in the production line.

a screening operation, bucket elevator, or belt conveyor that processes 
unsaturated material but subsequently processes saturated material shall 
submit a report of this change within 30 days following such change. 
This screening operation, bucket elevator, or belt conveyor is then 
subject to the no visible emission limit in Sec. 60.672(h).
    (h) The subpart A requirement under Sec. 60.7(a)(2) for 
notification of the anticipated date of initial startup of an affected 
facility shall be waived for owners or operators of affected facilities 
regulated under this subpart.
    (i) A notification of the actual date of initial startup of each

(Q<INF>sd) of the effluent gas. The sampling time and sample 
volume shall be at least 120 minutes and 2.55 dscm (90.1 dscf).
    (3) The average glass pull rate (P<INF>avg) for the 
manufacturing line shall be the arithmetic average of three glass pull 
rate (P<INF>i) determinations taken at intervals of at least 30 
minutes during each run.

The individual glass pull rates (P<INF>i) shall be computed using 
the following equation:

P<INF>i=K' L<INF>s W<INF>m M [1.0-(LOI/100)]

where:

P<INF>i=glass pull rate at interval ``i'', Mg/hr (ton/hr).
L<INF>s=line speed, m/min (ft/min).
W<INF>m=trimmed mat width, m (ft).
M=mat gram weight, g/m\2\ (lb/ft\2\).
LOI=loss on ignition, weight percent.
K'=conversion factor, 6x10<SUP>-5</SUP> (min-Mg)/(hr-g) 
[3x10<SUP>-2</SUP> (min-ton)/(hr-lb)].

    (i) ASTM D2584-68 (Reapproved 1985) or 94 (incorporated by 
reference--see Sec. 60.17), shall be used to determine the LOI for each 
run.
    (ii) Line speed (L<INF>s), trimmed mat width (W<INF>m), 
and mat gram weight (M) shall be determined for each run from the 
process information or from direct measurements.
    (d) To comply with Sec. 60.684(d), the owner or operator shall 
record measurements as required in Sec. 60.684 (a) and (b) using the 
monitoring devices in Sec. 60.683 (a) and (b) during the particulate

Sec. 60.694  Permission to use alternative means of emission limitation.

    (a) If, in the Administrator's judgment, an alternative means of 
emission limitation will achieve a reduction in VOC emissions at least 
equivalent to the reduction in VOC emissions achieved by the applicable 
requirement in Sec. 60.692, the Administrator will publish in the 
Federal Register a notice permitting the use of the alternative means 
for purposes of compliance with that requirement. The notice may 
condition the permission on requirements related to the operation and 
maintenance of the alternative means.
    (b) Any notice under paragraph (a) of this section shall be 
published only after notice and an opportunity for a hearing.
    (c) Any person seeking permission under this section shall collect, 
verify, and submit to the Administrator information showing that the 
alternative means achieves equivalent emission reductions.


<R05>
Sec. 60.695  Monitoring of operations.

    (a) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart 
shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate according to 
manufacturer's specifications the following equipment, unless 
alternative monitoring procedures or requirements are approved for that 
facility by the Administrator.
    (1) Where a thermal incinerator is used for VOC emission reduction, 
a temperature monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder 
shall be used to measure the temperature of the gas stream in the 
combustion zone of the incinerator. The temperature monitoring device 
shall have an accuracy of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 percent of the 
temperature being measured, expressed in [deg]C, or <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 [deg]C (0.9 [deg]F), whichever is greater.
    (2) Where a catalytic incinerator is used for VOC emission 
reduction, temperature monitoring devices, each equipped with a 
continuous recorder shall be used to measure the temperature in the gas 
stream immediately before and after the catalyst bed of the incinerator. 
The temperature monitoring devices shall have an accuracy of <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>1 percent of the temperature being measured, expressed 
in [deg]C, or <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 [deg]C (0.9 [deg]F), whichever 
is greater.
    (3) Where a carbon adsorber is used for VOC emissions reduction, a 
monitoring device that continuously indicates and records the VOC 
concentration level or reading of organics in the exhaust gases of the 
control device outlet gas stream or inlet and outlet gas stream shall be 
used.
    (i) For a carbon adsorption system that regenerates the carbon bed 
directly onsite, a monitoring device that continuously indicates and 
records the volatile organic compound concentration level or reading of 
organics in the exhaust gases of the control device outlet gas stream or 
inlet and outlet gas stream shall be used.
    (ii) For a carbon adsorption system that does not regenerate the 
carbon bed directly onsite in the control device (e.g., a carbon 
canister), the concentration level of the organic compounds in the 
exhaust vent stream from the carbon adsorption system shall be monitored 
on a regular schedule, and the existing carbon shall be replaced with 
fresh carbon immediately when carbon breakthrough is indicated. The 
device shall be monitored on a daily basis or at intervals no greater 
than 20 percent of the design carbon replacement interval, whichever is 
greater. As an alternative to

[[Page 604]]

conducting this monitoring, an owner or operator may replace the carbon 
in the carbon adsorption system with fresh carbon at a regular 
predetermined time interval that is less than the carbon replacement 
interval that is determined by the maximum design flow rate and organic 
concentration in the gas stream vented to the carbon adsorption system.
    (4) Where a flare is used for VOC emission reduction, the owner or 
operator shall comply with the monitoring requirements of 40 CFR 
60.18(f)(2).
    (b) Where a VOC recovery device other than a carbon adsorber is used 
to meet the requirements specified in Sec. 60.692-5(a), the owner or 
operator shall provide to the Administrator information describing the 
operation of the control device and the process parameter(s) that would 
indicate proper operation and maintenance of the device. The 
Administrator may request further information and will specify 
appropriate monitoring procedures or requirements.
    (c) An alternative operational or process parameter may be monitored 
if it can be demonstrated that another parameter will ensure that the 
control device is operated in conformance with these standards and the 
control device's design specifications.

in each place where a 0.32 cm (0.125 in.) diameter uniform probe passes 
freely (without forcing or binding against seal) between the seal and 
the wall of the separator and measure the gap width and perimetrical 
distance of each such location.
    (ii) The total surface area of each gap described in (d)(1)(i) of 
this section shall be determined by using probes of various widths to 
measure accurately the actual distance from the wall to the seal and 
multiplying each such width by its respective perimetrical distance.
    (iii) Add the gap surface area of each gap location for the primary 
seal and the secondary seal individually, divide

[[Page 605]]

the sum for each seal by the nominal perimeter of the separator basin 
and compare each to the maximum gap area as specified in Sec. 60.693-2.
    (2) The gap widths and total gap area shall be determined using the 
procedure in paragraph (d)(1) of this section according to the following 
frequency:

Sec. 60.701  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, all terms not defined here shall have the 
meaning given them in the Act and in subpart A of part 60, and the 
following terms shall have the specific meanings given them.
    Batch operation means any noncontinuous reactor process that is not 
characterized by steady-state conditions and in which reactants are not 
added and products are not removed simultaneously.
    Boiler means any enclosed combustion device that extracts useful 
energy in the form of steam and is not an incinerator.

[[Page 610]]

    By compound means by individual stream components, not carbon 
equivalents.
    Car-seal means a seal that is placed on a device that is used to 
change the position of a valve (e.g., from opened to closed) in such a 
way that the position of the valve cannot be changed without breaking 
the seal.
    Combustion device means an individual unit of equipment, such as an 
incinerator, flare, boiler, or process heater, used for combustion of a 
vent stream discharged from the process vent.
    Continuous recorder means a data recording device recording an 
instantaneous data value at least once every 15 minutes.
    Flame zone means the portion of the combustion chamber in a boiler 
occupied by the flame envelope.
    Flow indicator means a device which indicates whether gas flow is 
present in a line.
    Halogenated vent stream means any vent stream determined to have a 
total concentration (by volume) of compounds containing halogens of 20 
ppmv (by compound) or greater.
    Incinerator means an enclosed combustion device that is used for 
destroying organic compounds. If there is energy recovery, the energy 
recovery section and the combustion chambers are not of integral design. 
That is, the energy recovery section and the combustion section are not 
physically formed into one manufactured or assembled unit but are joined 
by ducts or connections carrying flue gas.
    Primary fuel means the fuel fired through a burner or a number of 
similar burners. The primary fuel provides the principal heat input to 
the device, and the amount of fuel is sufficient to sustain operation 
without the addition of other fuels.
    Process heater means a device that transfers heat liberated by 
burning fuel directly to process streams or to heat transfer liquids 
other than water.
    Process unit means equipment assembled and connected by pipes or 
ducts to produce, as intermediates or final products, one or more of the 
chemicals in Sec. 60.707. A process unit can operate independently if 
supplied with sufficient feed or raw materials and sufficient product 
storage facilities.
    Product means any compound or chemical listed in Sec. 60.707 which 
is produced for sale as a final product as that chemical, or for use in 
the production of other chemicals or compounds. By-products, co-
products, and intermediates are considered to be products.
    Reactor processes are unit operations in which one or more 
chemicals, or reactants other than air, are combined or decomposed in 
such a way that their molecular structures are altered and one or more 
new organic compounds are formed.
    Recovery device means an individual unit of equipment, such as an 
absorber, carbon adsorber, or condenser, capable of and used for the 
purpose of recovering chemicals for use, reuse, or sale.
    Recovery system means an individual recovery device or series of 
such devices applied to the same vent stream.
    Relief valve means a valve used only to release an unplanned, 
nonroutine discharge. A relief valve discharge results from an operator 
error, a malfunction such as a power failure or equipment failure, or 
other unexpected cause that requires immediate venting of gas from 
process equipment in order to avoid safety hazards or equipment damage.
    Secondary fuel means a fuel fired through a burner other than a 
primary fuel burner. The secondary fuel may provide supplementary heat 
in addition to the heat provided by the primary fuel.
    Total organic compounds or TOC means those compounds measured 
according to the procedures in Sec. 60.704(b)(4). For the purposes of 
measuring molar composition as required in Sec. 60.704(d)(2)(i) and 
Sec. 60.704(d)(2)(ii), hourly emission rate as required in Sec. 
60.704(d)(5) and Sec. 60.704(e), and TOC concentration as required in 
Sec. 60.705(b)(4) and Sec. 60.705(f)(4), those compounds which the 
Administrator has determined do not contribute appreciably to the 
formation of ozone are to be excluded.
    Total resource effectiveness or TRE index value means a measure of 
the supplemental total resource requirement per unit reduction of TOC 
associated

[[Page 611]]

with a vent stream from an affected reactor process facility, based on 
vent stream flow rate, emission rate of TOC, net heating value, and 
corrosion properties (whether or not the vent stream contains 
halogenated compounds), as quantified by the equation given under Sec. 
60.704(e).
    Vent stream means any gas stream discharged directly from a reactor 
process to the atmosphere or indirectly to the atmosphere after 
diversion through other process equipment. The vent stream excludes 
relief valve discharges and equipment leaks.

basis, ppm by volume.
C<INF>j=Concentration of sample components ``j'', dry basis, ppm 
by volume.
n=Number of components in the sample.
    (5) The requirement for an initial performance test is waived, in 
accordance with Sec. 60.8(b), for the following:
    (i) When a boiler or process heater with a design heat input 
capacity of 44 MW (150 million Btu/hour) or greater is used to seek 
compliance with Sec. 60.702(a).
    (ii) When a vent stream is introduced into a boiler or process 
heater with the primary fuel.
    (iii) The Administrator reserves the option to require testing at 
such other times as may be required, as provided for in section 114 of 
the Act.
    (6) For purposes of complying with the 98 weight-percent reduction 
in Sec. 60.702(a), if the vent stream entering a boiler or process 
heater with a design capacity less than 44 MW (150 million Btu/hour) is 
introduced with the combustion air or as secondary fuel, the weight-

normally conducted through the final recovery device:
    (A) The sampling site for vent stream flow rate and molar 
composition shall be prior to the final recovery device and prior to the 
point at which any nonreactor stream or stream from a nonaffected

measuring the TOC concentration using Method 18 at the inlet to the 
final recovery device after the introduction of any vent stream and at 
the outlet of the final recovery device.
    (C) This efficiency of the final recovery device shall be applied to 
the TOC concentration measured prior to the final recovery device and 
prior to the introduction of any nonreactor stream or stream from a 
nonaffected reactor process to determine the concentration of TOC in the 
reactor process vent stream from the final recovery device. This 
concentration of TOC is then used to perform the calculations outlined 
in Sec. 60.704(d) (4) and (5).
    (2) The molar composition of the process vent stream shall be 
determined as follows:
    (i) Method 18 to measure the concentration of TOC including those 
containing halogens.
    (ii) ASTM D1946-77 or 90 (Reapproved 1994) (incorporation by

specified in Sec. 60.17 of this part) to measure the concentration of 
carbon monoxide and hydrogen.

where:

H<INF>T=Net heating value of the sample, MJ/scm, where the net 
enthalpy per mole of vent stream is based on combustion at 25 [deg]C and 
760 mm Hg, but the standard temperature for determining the volume 
corresponding to one mole is 20 [deg]C, as in the definition of

Sec. 60.704(d)(2).
H<INF>j=Net heat of combustion of compound j, kcal/g-mole, based 
on combustion at 25 [deg]C and 760 mm Hg. The heats of combustion of 
vent stream components would be required to be determined using ASTM 
D2382-76 or 88 or D4809-95 (incorporation by reference as specified in 
Sec. 60.17 of this part) if published values are not available or 
cannot be calculated.

60.702(c), the owner or operator of a facility affected by this subpart 
shall calculate the TRE index value of the vent stream using the 
equation for incineration in paragraph (e)(1) of this section for 
halogenated vent streams. The owner or operator of an affected facility 
with a nonhalogenated vent stream shall determine the TRE index value by 
calculating values using both the incinerator equation in (e)(1) of this 
section and the flare equation in (e)(2) of this section and selecting 
the lower of the two values.
    (1) The equation for calculating the TRE index value of a vent 
stream controlled by an incinerator is as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27NO95.000

    (i) Where for a vent stream flow rate (scm/min) at a standard 
temperature of 20 [deg]C that is greater than or equal to 14.2 scm/min:

Table 1 except for Category E vent streams where 
Y<INF>s=(Q<INF>s)(H<INF>T)/3.6.
E<INF>TOC=Hourly emissions of TOC reported in kg/hr.

    (f) Each owner or operator of an affected facility seeking to comply 
with Sec. 60.700(c)(2) or Sec. 60.702(c) shall recalculate the TRE 
index value for that affected facility whenever process changes are 
made. Examples of process changes include changes in production 
capacity, feedstock type, or catalyst type, or whenever there is 
replacement, removal, or addition of recovery equipment. The TRE index 
value shall be recalculated based on test data, or on best engineering 
estimates of the effects of the change on the recovery system.
    (1) Where the recalculated TRE index value is less than or equal to 
1.0, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator within 1 week 
of the recalculation and shall conduct a performance test according to 
the methods and procedures required by Sec. 60.704 in order to 
determine compliance with Sec. 60.702 (a) or (b). Performance tests 
must be conducted as soon as possible after the process change but no 
later than 180 days from the time of the process change.
    (2) Where the recalculated TRE index value is less than or equal to 
8.0 but greater than 1.0, the owner or operator shall conduct a 
performance test in accordance with Sec. 60.8 and Sec. 60.704 and 
shall comply with Sec. 60.703, Sec. 60.704 and Sec. 60.705. 
Performance tests must be conducted as soon as possible after the 
process change but no later than 180 days from the time of the process 
change.
    (g) Any owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart 
seeking to demonstrate compliance with Sec. 60.700(c)(4) shall use 
Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, 
for determination of volumetric flow rate.
    (h) Each owner or operator seeking to demonstrate that a reactor 
process vent stream has a TOC concentration for compliance with the low 
concentration exemption in Sec. 60.700(c)(8) shall conduct an initial 
test to measure TOC concentration.
    (1) The sampling site shall be selected as specified in paragraph 
(d)(1)(i) of this section.
    (2) Method 18 or Method 25A of part 60, appendix A shall be used to 
measure concentration.

[[Page 618]]

    (3) Where Method 18 is used to qualify for the low concentration 
exclusion in Sec. 60.700(c)(8), the procedures in Sec. 60.704(b)(4) 
(i) and (iv) shall be used to measure TOC concentration, and the 
procedures of Sec. 60.704(b)(3) shall be used to correct the TOC 
concentration to 3 percent oxygen. To qualify for the exclusion, the 
results must demonstrate that the concentration of TOC, corrected to 3 
percent oxygen, is below 300 ppm by volume.
    (4) Where Method 25A is used, the following procedures shall be used 
to calculate ppm by volume TOC concentration, corrected to 3 percent 
oxygen:
    (i) Method 25A shall be used only if a single organic compound is 
greater than 50 percent of total TOC, by volume, in the reactor process 
vent stream. This compound shall be the principal organic compound.
    (ii) The principal organic compound may be determined by either 
process knowledge or test data collected using an appropriate EPA 
Reference Method. Examples of information that could constitute process 
knowledge include calculations based on material balances, process 
stoichiometry, or previous test results provided the results are still 
relevant to the current reactor process vent stream conditions.
    (iii) The principal organic compound shall be used as the 
calibration gas for Method 25A.
    (iv) The span value for Method 25A shall be 300 ppmv.
    (v) Use of Method 25A is acceptable if the response from the high-
level calibration gas is at least 20 times the standard deviation of the 
response from the zero calibration gas when the instrument is zeroed on 
the most sensitive scale.
    (vi) The owner or operator shall demonstrate that the concentration 
of TOC including methane and ethane measured by Method 25A, corrected to 
3 percent oxygen, is below 150 ppm by volume to qualify for the low 
concentration exclusion in Sec. 60.700(c)(8).
    (vii) The concentration of TOC shall be corrected to 3 percent 
oxygen using the procedures and equation in paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section.

Administrator of the specific provisions of Sec. 60.702 (Sec. 60.702 
(a), (b), or (c)) with which the owner or operator has elected to 
comply. Notification shall be submitted with the notification of initial 
start-up required by Sec. 60.7(a)(3). If an owner or operator elects at 
a later date to use an alternative provision of Sec. 60.702 with which 
he or she will comply, then the Administrator shall be notified by the

period of the performance testing while the vent stream is normally 
routed and constituted.
    (v) All measurements and calculations performed to determine the TRE 
index value of the vent stream.
    (c) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart

equipment operating parameters specified to be monitored under Sec. 
60.703 (a) and (c) as well as up-to-date, readily accessible records of 
periods of operation during which the parameter boundaries established 
during the most recent performance test are exceeded. The Administrator 
may at any time require a report of these data. Where a combustion 
device is used to comply with Sec. 60.702(a), periods of operation 
during which the parameter boundaries established during the most recent 
performance tests are exceeded are defined as follows:
    (1) For thermal incinerators, all 3-hour periods of operation during

compliance with Sec. 60.702(a) was determined.
    (3) All 3-hour periods of operation during which the average 
combustion temperature was more than 28 [deg]C (50 [deg]F) below the

combustion air or as a secondary fuel.
    (4) For boilers or process heaters, whenever there is a change in 
the location at which the vent stream is introduced into the flame zone 
as required under Sec. 60.702(a).
    (d) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart 
shall keep records of the following:

record of continuous flow is not required. In such cases, the owner or 
operator shall keep up-to-date, readily accessible records of all 
monthly visual inspections of the seals as well as readily accessible 
records of all periods and the duration when the seal mechanism is 
broken, the bypass line valve position has changed, the serial number of

than 0.1 unit below, the average absorbing liquid specific gravity 
during the most recent performance test (unless monitoring of an 
alternative parameter, which is a measure of the degree of absorbing 
liquid saturation, is approved by the Administrator, in which case he 
will define appropriate parameter boundaries and periods of operation 
during which they are exceeded).
    (2) Where a condenser is the final recovery device in a system, and

recovery device in the recovery system and where an organic compound 
monitoring device is used, all 3-hour periods of operation during which 
the average organic compound concentration level or reading of organic 
compounds in the exhaust gases is more than 20 percent greater than the 
exhaust gas organic compound concentration level or reading measured by 
the monitoring device during the most recent performance test.

comply with the requirements of this subpart by complying with the low 
concentration exemption in Sec. 60.700(c)(8) shall keep up-to-date, 
readily accessible records of any change in equipment or process 
operation that increases the concentration of the vent stream of the 
affected facility.
    (k) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart 
is exempt from the quarterly reporting requirements contained in Sec. 
60.7(c) of the General Provisions.
    (l) Each owner or operator that seeks to comply with the 
requirements of this subpart by complying with the requirements of Sec. 
60.700 (c)(2), (c)(3), or (c)(4) or Sec. 60.702 shall submit to the 
Administrator semiannual reports of the following recorded information. 
The initial report shall be submitted within 6 months after the initial 
start-up date.
    (1) Exceedances of monitored parameters recorded under Sec. 60.705 
(c), (f), and (g).
    (2) All periods and duration recorded under Sec. 60.705(d) when the 
vent stream is diverted from the control device to the atmosphere.
    (3) All periods recorded under Sec. 60.705(f) in which the pilot 
flame of the flare was absent.
    (4) Any change in equipment or process operation that increases the 
operating vent stream flow rate above the low flow exemption level in 
Sec. 60.700(c)(4), including a measurement of the new vent stream flow 
rate, as recorded under Sec. 60.705(i). These must be reported as soon 
as possible after the change and no later than 180 days after

[[Page 622]]

the change. These reports may be submitted either in conjunction with 
semiannual reports or as a single separate report. A performance test 
must be completed within the same time period to verify the recalculated 
flow value and to obtain the vent stream characteristics of heating 
value and E<INF>TOC. The performance test is subject to the 
requirements of Sec. 60.8 of the General Provisions. Unless the 
facility qualifies for an exemption under any of the exemption 
provisions listed in Sec. 60.700(c), except for the total resource 
effectiveness index greater than 8.0 exemption in Sec. 60.700(c)(2), 
the facility must begin compliance with the requirements set forth in 
Sec. 60.702.
    (5) Any change in equipment or process operation, as recorded under 
paragraph (i) of this section, that increases the design production 
capacity above the low capacity exemption level in Sec. 60.700(c)(3) 
and the new capacity resulting from the change for the reactor process 
unit containing the affected facility. These must be reported as soon as 
possible after the change and no later than 180 days after the change. 
These reports may be submitted either in conjunction with semiannual 
reports or as a single separate report. A performance test must be 
completed within the same time period to obtain the vent stream flow 
rate, heating value, and E<INF>TOC. The performance test is 
subject to the requirements of Sec. 60.8. The facility must begin 
compliance with the requirements set forth in Sec. 60.702 or Sec. 
60.700(d). If the facility chooses to comply with Sec. 60.702, the 
facility may qualify for an exemption under Sec. 60.700(c)(2), (4), or 
(8).
    (6) Any recalculation of the TRE index value, as recorded under 
Sec. 60.705(g).
    (7) All periods recorded under Sec. 60.705(d) in which the seal 
mechanism is broken or the by-pass line valve position has changed. A 
record of the serial number of the car-seal or a record to show that the 
key to unlock the bypass line valve was checked out must be maintained 
to demonstrate the period, the duration, and frequency in which the 
bypass line was operated.
    (8) Any change in equipment or process operation that increases the 
vent stream concentration above the low concentration exemption level in 
Sec. 60.700(c)(8), including a measurement of the new vent stream 
concentration, as recorded under Sec. 60.705(j). These must be reported 
as soon as possible after the change and no later than 180 days after 
the change. These reports may be submitted either in conjunction with 
semiannual reports or as a single separate report. If the vent stream 
concentration is above 300 ppmv as measured using Method 18 or above 150 
ppmv as measured using Method 25A, a performance test must be completed 
within the same time period to obtain the vent stream flow rate, heating 
value, and E<INF>TOC. The performance test is subject to the 
requirements of Sec. 60.8 of the General Provisions. Unless the 
facility qualifies for an exemption under any of the exemption 
provisions listed in Sec. 60.700(c), except for the TRE index greater 
than 8.0 exemption in Sec. 60.700(c)(2), the facility must begin 
compliance with the requirements set forth in Sec. 60.702.
    (m) The requirements of Sec. 60.705(l) remain in force until and 
unless EPA, in delegating enforcement authority to a State under section 
111(c) of the Act, approves reporting requirements or an alternative 
means of compliance surveillance adopted by such State. In that event, 
affected sources within the State will be relieved of the obligation to 
comply with Sec. 60.705(l), provided that they comply with the 
requirements established by the State.
    (n) Each owner or operator that seeks to demonstrate compliance with 
Sec. 60.700(c)(3) must submit to the Administrator an initial report 
detailing the design production capacity of the process unit.
    (o) Each owner or operator that seeks to demonstrate compliance with 
Sec. 60.700(c)(4) must submit to the Administrator an initial report 
including a flow rate measurement using the test methods specified in 
Sec. 60.704.
    (p) Each owner or operator that seeks to demonstrate compliance with 
Sec. 60.700(c)(8) must submit to the Administrator an initial report 
including a concentration measurement using the test method specified in 
Sec. 60.704.
    (q) The Administrator will specify appropriate reporting and 
recordkeeping requirements where the owner

[[Page 623]]

or operator of an affected facility complies with the standards 
specified under Sec. 60.702 other than as provided under Sec. 60.703 
(a), (b), (c), and (d).
    (r) Each owner or operator whose reactor process vent stream is 
routed to a distillation unit subject to subpart NNN and who seeks to 
demonstrate compliance with Sec. 60.700(c)(5) shall submit to the 
Administrator a process design description as part of the initial 
report. This process design description must be retained for the life of 
the process. No other records or reports would be required unless 
process changes are made.
    (s) Each owner or operator who seeks to demonstrate compliance with 
Sec. 60.702 (a) or (b) using a control device must maintain on file a 
schematic diagram of the affected vent streams, collection system(s), 
fuel systems, control devices, and bypass systems as part of the initial 
report. This schematic diagram must be retained for the life of the 
system.
    (t) Each owner or operator that seeks to demonstrate compliance with 
Sec. 60.700(c)(2) must maintain a record of the initial test for 
determining the total resource effectiveness index and the results of 
the initial total resource effectiveness index calculation.

Sec. 60.710  Applicability and designation of affected facility.

    (a) The affected facilities to which the provisions of this subpart 
apply are:
    (1) Each coating operation; and
    (2) Each piece of coating mix preparation equipment.
    (b) Any new coating operation that utilizes less than 38 m\3\ of 
solvent or any modified or reconstructed coating operation that utilizes 
less than 370 m\3\ of solvent for the manufacture of magnetic tape per 
calendar year is subject only to the requirements of Sec. Sec. 
60.714(a), 60.717(b), and 60.717(c). If the amount of solvent utilized 
for the manufacture of magnetic tape equals or exceeds these amounts in 
any calendar year, the facility is subject to Sec. 60.712 and all other 
sections of this subpart. Once a facility has become subject to Sec. 
60.712 and all other sections of this subpart, it will remain subject to 
those requirements regardless of changes in annual solvent utilization.
    (c) This subpart applies to any affected facility for which 
construction, modification, or reconstruction begins after January 22, 
1986.

cure, polymerize, or dry a surface coating.
    (11) Equivalent diameter means four times the area of an opening 
divided by its perimeter.
    (12) Flashoff area means the portion of a coating operation between 
the coating applicator and the drying oven where solvent begins to 
evaporate from the coated base film.
    (13) Magnetic tape means any flexible substrate that is covered on 
one or both sides with a coating containing magnetic particles and that 
is used for audio or video recording or information storage.
    (14) Natural draft opening means any opening in a room, building, or 
total enclosure that remains open during operation of the facility and 
that is not connected to a duct in which a fan is installed. The rate 
and direction of the natural draft across such an opening is a 
consequence of the difference in pressures on either side of the wall 
containing the opening.
    (15) Nominal 1-month period means a calendar month or, if 
established prior to the performance test in a statement submitted with 
notification of anticipated startup pursuant to 40 CFR

[[Page 626]]

60.7(a)(2), a similar monthly time period (e.g., 30-day month or 
accounting month).
    (16) Temporary enclosure means a total enclosure that is constructed 
for the sole purpose of measuring the fugitive emissions from an 
affected facility. A temporary enclosure must be constructed and 
ventilated (through stacks suitable for testing) so that it has minimal 
impact on the performance of the permanent capture system. A temporary 
enclosure will be assumed to achieve total capture of fugitive VOC 
emissions if it conforms to the requirements found in Sec. 
60.713(b)(5)(i) and if all natural draft openings are at least four duct 
or hood equivalent diameters away from each exhaust duct or hood. 
Alternatively, the owner or operator may apply to the Administrator for 
approval of a temporary enclosure on a case-by-case basis.
    (17) Total enclosure means a structure that is constructed around a 
source of emissions so that all VOC emissions are collected and 
exhausted through a stack or duct. With a total enclosure, there will be 
no fugitive emissions, only stack emissions. The only openings in a 
total enclosure are forced makeup air and exhaust ducts and any natural 
draft openings such as those that allow raw materials to enter and exit 
the enclosure for processing. All access doors or windows are closed 
during routine operation of the enclosed source. Brief, occasional 
openings of such doors or windows to accommodate process equipment 
adjustments are acceptable, but, if such openings are routine or if an 
access door remains open during the entire operation, the access door 
must be considered a natural draft opening. The average inward face 
velocity across the natural draft openings of the enclosure must be 
calculated including the area of such access doors. The drying oven 
itself may be part of the total enclosure. A permanent enclosure that 
meets the requirements found in Sec. 60.713(b)(5)(i) is assumed to be a 
total enclosure. The owner or operator of a permanent enclosure that 
does not meet the requirements may apply to the Administrator for 
approval of the enclosure as a total enclosure on a case-by-case basis. 
Such approval shall be granted upon a demonstration to the satisfaction 
of the Administrator that all VOC emissions are contained and vented to 
the control device.
    (18) Utilize refers to the use of solvent that is delivered to 
coating mix preparation equipment for the purpose of formulating 
coatings to be applied on an affected coating operation and any other 
solvent (e.g., dilution solvent) that is added at any point in the 
manufacturing process.
    (19) VOC content of the coating applied means the product of Method 
24 VOC analyses or formulation data (if the data are demonstrated to be 
equivalent to Method 24 results) and the total volume of coating fed to 
the coating applicator. This quantity is intended to include all VOC 
that actually are emitted from the coating operation in the gaseous 
phase. Thus, for purposes of the liquid-liquid VOC material balance in 
Sec. 60.713(b)(1), any VOC (including dilution solvent) added to the 
coatings must be accounted for, and any VOC contained in waste coatings 
or retained in the final product may be measured and subtracted from the 
total. (These adjustments are not necessary for the gaseous emission 
test compliance provisions of Sec. 60.713(b).)
    (20) Volatile Organic Compounds or VOC means any organic compounds 
that participate in atmospheric photochemical reactions or that are 
measured by Method 18, 24, 25, or 25A or an equivalent or alternative 
method as defined in 40 CFR 60.2.

a This table is presented for the convenience of the user and is not intended to supercede the language of the
  regulation. For the details of the requirements, refer to the text of the regulation.
b Refer to Part B to determine which subsections of Sec. Sec.  60.714, 60.715, and 60.717 correspond to each
  compliance provision (Sec.  60.713).
c As per Sec.  60.710(b), any new coating operation with solvent utilization <38 m\3\/yr or any modified or
  reconstructed coating operation with solvent utilization <370 m\3\/yr is exempt from the VOC standards (Sec.
  60.712). Such coating operations are subject only to Sec. Sec.  60.714(a), 60.717(b), and 60.717(c).
  However, should a coating operation once exceed the applicable annual solvent utilization cutoff, that coating
  operation shall be subject to the VOC standards (Sec.  60.712) and all other sections of the subpart. Once
  this has occurred, the coating operation shall remain subject to those requirements regardless of changes in
  annual solvent utilization.
d As applicable.
e Section 60.716 permits the use of an alternative means of VOC emission limitation that achieves an equivalent
  or greater VOC emission reduction.

requirements may apply to the Administrator for approval of the 
enclosure as a total enclosure on a case-by-case basis. The enclosure 
shall be considered a total enclosure if it is demonstrated to the 
satisfaction of the Administrator that all VOC emissions from the 
affected coating operation are contained and vented to the control 
device. The requirements for automatic approval are as follows:
    (A) Total area of all natural draft openings shall not exceed 5 
percent of the total surface area of the total enclosure's walls, floor, 
and ceiling;
    (B) All sources of emissions within the enclosure shall be a minimum

    (C) Average inward face velocity across all natural draft openings 
(FV) shall be a minimum of 3,600 meters per hour as determined by the 
following procedures:
    (1) Construct all forced makeup air ducts and all exhaust ducts so 
that the volumetric flow rate in each can be accurately determined by 
the test methods and procedures specified in Sec. 60.715(c) and (d). 
Volumetric flow rates shall be calculated without the adjustment 
normally made for moisture content; and
    (2) Determine FV by the following equation:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.062
    
    (D) The air passing through all natural draft openings shall flow 
into the enclosure continuously. If FV is less than or equal to 9,000 
meters per hour, the continuous inward flow of air shall be verified by 
continuous observation using smoke tubes, streamers, tracer gases, or 
other means approved by the Administrator over the period that the 
volumetric flow rate tests required to determine FV are carried out. If 
FV is greater than 9,000 meters per hour, the direction of airflow 
through the natural draft openings shall be presumed to be inward at all 
times without verification.
    (ii) Determine the control device efficiency using Equation (2) or 
Equations (4) and (5), as applicable, and the test methods and 
procedures specified in Sec. 60.715(b) through (g).

enclosure is demonstrated and the value of E determined from Equation 
(2) (or the value of H<INF>sys determined from Equations (4) and 
(5), as applicable) is equal to or greater than the required efficiency 
as specified below:
    (A) For coating operations subject to the standards of Sec. 
60.712(a), (b)(2)(ii), and (b)(3), 0.95 (95 percent); or

value of H<INF>sys determined from Equations (4) and (5), as 
applicable) pursuant to Sec. 60.713(a)(2) prior to modification or 
reconstruction or 0.95 (95 percent), whichever is lower.
    (6) To demonstrate compliance with Sec. 60.712(c) (standard for new 
mix equipment with concurrent construction of a control device), each 
owner or operator of affected coating mix preparation equipment shall 
demonstrate upon inspection that:
    (i) Covers satisfying the requirements of Sec. 60.712(c)(1)-(5) 
have been installed and are being used properly;
    (ii) Procedures detailing the proper use of covers, as specified in 
Sec. 60.712(c)(1), have been posted in all areas where affected coating 
mix preparation equipment is used;
    (iii) The coating mix preparation equipment is vented to a control 
device; and
    (iv) The control device efficiency (E or H<INF>sys, as 
applicable) determined using Equation (2) or Equations (4) and (5), 
respectively, and the test methods and procedures specified in Sec. 
60.715(b)-(g) is equal to or greater than 0.95.

    (iv) For each affected facility where the value of G is less than or 
equal to 0.20 kilogram of VOC per liter of coating solids applied, the 
facility is in compliance.
    (c) Startups and shutdowns are normal operation for this source 
category. Emissions from these operations are to be included when 
determining if the standards for coating operations specified in Sec. 
60.712(a) and (b) are being attained.
    (d) If a control device other than a carbon adsorber, condenser, or 
incinerator is used to control emissions from an affected facility, the 
necessary operating specifications for that device must be obtained from 
the Administrator. An example of such a device is a flare.

Sec. 60.714  Installation of monitoring devices and recordkeeping.

    All monitoring devices required under the provisions of this section 
shall be installed and calibrated, according to the manufacturer's 
specifications, prior to the initial performance tests in locations such 
that representative values of the monitored parameters will be obtained. 
The parameters to be monitored shall be continuously measured and 
recorded during all performance tests.
    (a) Each owner or operator of an affected coating operation that 
utilizes less solvent annually than the applicable cutoff provided in 
Sec. 60.710(b) and that is not subject to Sec. 60.712 (standards for 
coating operations) shall maintain records of actual solvent use.
    (b) Each owner or operator of an affected coating operation 
demonstrating compliance by the test method described in Sec. 
60.713(b)(1) (liquid material balance) shall maintain records of all the 
following for each and every nominal 1-month period:
    (1) Amount of coating applied at the applicator;
    (2) Results of the reference test method specified in Sec. 
60.715(a) for determining the VOC content of all coatings applied;
    (3) Amount VOC recovered; and
    (4) Calculation of the percent VOC recovered.
    (c) Each owner or operator of an affected coating operation or 
affected coating mix preparation equipment controlled by a carbon 
adsorption system and demonstrating compliance by the procedures 
described in Sec. 60.713(b)(2), (3), (4), (5), or (6) (which include 
control device efficiency determinations) shall carry out the monitoring 
and recordkeeping provisions of paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section, 
as appropriate.
    (1) For carbon adsorption systems with a common exhaust stack for 
all the individual adsorber vessels, install, calibrate, maintain, and 
operate, according to the manufacturer's specifications, a monitoring 
device that continuously indicates and records the concentration level 
of organic compounds in either the control device outlet gas stream or 
in both the control device inlet and outlet gas streams. The outlet gas 
stream would be monitored if the percent increase in the concentration 
level of organic compounds is used as the basis for reporting, as 
described in Sec. 60.717(d)(3). The inlet and outlet gas streams would 
be monitored if the percent control device efficiency is used as the 
basis for reporting, as described in Sec. 60.717(d)(4).
    (2) For carbon adsorption systems with individual exhaust stacks for

temperature being measured in Celsius degrees.
    (g) Each owner or operator of an affected coating operation 
demonstrating compliance pursuant to Sec. 60.713(b)(2), (3), or (4) 
(which include VOC capture system efficiency determinations) shall 
submit a monitoring plan for the VOC capture system to the Administrator 
for approval along with the notification of anticipated startup required 
under Sec. 60.7(a)(2) of the General Provisions. This plan shall 
identify the parameter to be monitored as an indicator of VOC capture 
system performance (e.g., the amperage to the exhaust fans or duct flow 
rates) and the method for monitoring the chosen parameter. The owner or 
operator shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate, according to 
the manufacturer's specifications, a monitoring device that continuously 
indicates and records the value of the chosen parameter.
    (h) Each owner or operator of an affected coating operation who uses 
the equipment alternative described in Sec. 60.713(b)(5) to demonstrate 
compliance shall follow the procedures described in paragraph (g) of 
this section to establish a monitoring plan for the total enclosure.
    (i) Each owner or operator of an affected coating operation shall 
record time periods of coating operations when an emission control 
device is not in use.
    (j) Each owner or operator of an affected coating operation or 
affected coating mix preparation equipment complying with Sec. 
60.712(e) shall maintain records of the monthly weighted average mass of 
VOC contained in the coating per volume of coating solids applied for 
each coating, as described in Sec. 60.713(b)(9)(i) through (iv).

Sec. 60.715  Test methods and procedures.

    Methods in appendix A of this part, except as provided under Sec. 
60.8(b), shall be used to determine compliance as follows:
    (a) Method 24 is used to determine the VOC content in coatings. If 
it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that plant 
coating formulation data are equivalent to Method 24 results, 
formulation data may be used. In the event of any inconsistency between 
a Method 24 test and a facility's formulation data, the Method 24 test 
will govern. For Method 24, the coating sample must be a 1-liter sample 
taken into a 1-liter container at a location and time such that the 
sample will be representative of the coating applied to the base film 
(i.e., the sample shall include any dilution solvent or other VOC added 
during the manufacturing process). The container must be tightly sealed 
immediately after the sample is taken. Any solvent or other VOC added 
after the sample is taken must be measured and accounted for in the 
calculations that use Method 24 results.
    (b) Method 18, 25, or 25A, as appropriate to the conditions at the 
site, is

[[Page 639]]

used to determine VOC concentration. The owner or operator shall submit 
notice of the intended test method to the Administrator for approval 
along with the notification of the performance test required under Sec. 
60.8(d) of the General Provisions. Method selection shall be based on 
consideration of the diversity of organic species present and their 
total concentration and on consideration of the potential presence of 
interfering gases. Except as indicated in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of 
this section, the test shall consist of three separate runs, each 
lasting a minimum of 30 minutes.
    (1) When the method is to be used in the determination of the 
efficiency of a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with a common exhaust 
stack for all the individual adsorber vessels pursuant to Sec. 
60.713(b)(2), (4), (5), or (6), the test shall consist of three separate 
runs, each coinciding with one or more complete sequences through the 
adsorption cycles of all the individual adsorber vessels.
    (2) When the method is to be used in the determination of the 
efficiency of a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with individual 
exhaust stacks for each adsorber vessel pursuant to Sec. 60.713(b)(3), 
(4), (5), or (6), each adsorber vessel shall be tested individually. The 
test for each adsorber vessel shall consist of three separate runs. Each 
run shall coincide with one or more complete adsorption cycles.
    (c) Method 1 or 1A is used for sample and velocity traverses.
    (d) Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D is used for velocity and volumetric flow 
rates.
    (e) Method 3 is used for gas analysis.
    (f) Method 4 is used for stack gas moisture.
    (g) Methods 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 3, and 4 shall be performed, as 
applicable, at least twice during each test period.

    (a) If, in the Administrator's judgment, an alternative means of 
emission limitation will achieve a reduction in emissions of VOC from 
any emission point subject to Sec. 60.712(c) or (d) (standards for mix 
equipment) at least equivalent to that required by Sec. 60.712 (c) or 
(d), respectively, the Administrator will publish in the Federal 
Register a notice permitting the use of the alternative means. The 
notice may condition permission on requirements related to the operation 
and maintenance of the alternative means.
    (b) Any notice under paragraph (a) of this section shall be 
published only after public notice and an opportunity for a public 
hearing.
    (c) Any person seeking permission under this section shall submit 
either results from an emission test that documents the collection and 
measurement of all VOC emissions from a given control device or an 
engineering evaluation that documents the determination of such 
emissions.

Sec. 60.723  Performance tests and compliance provisions.

    (a) Section 60.8 (d) and (f) do not apply to the performance test 
procedures required by this section.
    (b) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall conduct an 
initial performance test as required under Sec. 60.8(a) and thereafter 
a performance test each nominal 1-month period for each affected 
facility according to the procedures in this section.
    (1) The owner or operator shall determine the composition of 
coatings by analysis of each coating, as received, using Method 24, from 
data that have been determined by the coating manufacturer using Method 
24, or by other methods approved by the Administrator.
    (2) The owner or operator shall determine the volume of coating and 
the mass of VOC used for dilution of coatings from company records 
during each nominal 1-month period. If a common coating distribution 
system serves more than one affected facility or serves both affected 
and nonaffected spray booths, the owner or operator shall estimate the 
volume of coatings used at each facility by using procedures approved by 
the Administrator.
    (i) The owner or operator shall calculate the volume-weighted 
average mass of VOC's in coatings emitted per unit volume of coating 
solids applied (N) at each coating operation [i.e., for each type of 
coating (prime, color, texture, and touch-up) used] during each

[[Page 644]]

nominal 1-month period for each affected facility. Each 1-month 
calculation is considered a performance test. Except as provided in 
paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, N will be determined by the 
following procedures:
    (A) Calculate the mass of VOC's used (M<INF>o+M<INF>d) 
for each coating operation during each nominal 1-month period for each 
affected facility by the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.064

where n is the number of coatings of each type used during each nominal 
1-month period and m is the number of different diluent VOC's used 
during each nominal 1-month period. ([Sigma] L<INF>dj 
D<INF>dj will be 0 if no VOC's are added to the coatings, as 
received.)

    (B) Calculate the total volume of coating solids consumed 
(L<INF>s) in each nominal 1-month period for each coating 
operation for each affected facility by the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.065

where n is the number of coatings of each type used during each nominal 
1-month period.

    (C) Select the appropriate transfer efficiency (T) from Table 1 for 
each type of coating applications equipment used at each coating 
operation. If the owner or operator can demonstrate to the satisfaction 
of the Administrator that transfer efficiencies other than those shown 
are appropriate, the Administrator will approve their use on a case-by-
case basis. Transfer efficiency values for application methods not 
listed below shall be approved by the Administrator on a case-by-case 
basis. An owner or operator must submit sufficient data for the 
Administrator to judge the validity of the transfer efficiency claims.
    (D) Where more than one application method is used within a single 
coating operation, the owner or operator shall determine the volume of 
each coating applied by each method through a means acceptable to the 
Administrator and compute the volume-weighted average transfer 
efficiency by the following equation:

where n is the number of coatings of each type used and p is the number 
of application methods used.

    (E) Calculate the volume-weighted average mass of VOC's emitted per 
unit volume of coating solids applied (N) during each nominal 1-month 
period for each coating operation for each affected facility by the 
folowing equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.106

(T<INF>avg=T when only one type of coating operation occurs).

    (ii) Where the volume-weighted average mass of VOC's emitted to the 
atmosphere per unit volume of coating solids applied (N) is less than or 
equal to 1.5 kilograms per liter for prime coats, is less than or equal 
to 1.5 kilograms per liter for color coats, is less than or equal to 2.3 
kilograms per liter for texture coats, and is less than or equal to 2.3 
kilograms per liter for touch-up coats, the affected facility is in 
compliance.
    (iii) If each individual coating used by an affected facility has a 
VOC content (kg VOC/l of solids), as received, which when divided by the 
lowest transfer efficiency at which the coating is applied for each 
coating operation results in a value equal to or less than 1.5 kilograms 
per liter for prime and color coats and equal to or less than 2.3 
kilograms per liter for texture and touch-up coats, the affected 
facility is in compliance provided that no VOC's are added to the 
coatings during distribution or application.
    (iv) If an affected facility uses add-on controls to control VOC 
emissions and if the owner or operator can demonstrate to the 
Administrator that the volume-weighted average mass of VOC's emitted to 
the atmosphere during each nominal 1-month period per unit volume of 
coating solids applied (N) is within each of the applicable limits 
expressed in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section because of this 
equipment, the affected facility is in compliance. In such cases, 
compliance will be determined by the Administrator or a case-by-case 
basis.

site) for the formulation of polymeric coatings to be applied to 
supporting substrates at the coating operation, plus any solvent added 
after initial formulation is complete (e.g., dilution solvent added at 
the coating operation). If premixed coatings that require no mixing at 
the plant site are used, ``VOC used'' means the amount of VOC delivered 
to the coating applicator(s) of the affected facility.
    Volatile organic compounds or VOC means any organic compounds that 
participate in atmospheric photochemical reactions; or that are measured 
by a reference method, an equivalent method, an alternative method, or

130 Mg of VOC per 12-month period, the owner or operator shall either.
    (i) Install, operate, and maintain a cover on each piece of affected 
coating mix preparation equipment; or
    (ii) Install, operate, and maintain a cover on each piece of 
affected coating mix preparation equipment and vent VOC emissions to a 
VOC control device.

Sec. 60.743  Compliance provisions.

    (a) To demonstrate compliance with the emission reduction standard 
for coating operations specified in Sec. 60.742(b)(1), the owner or 
operator of the affected facility shall use one of the following 
methods.

[[Page 654]]

    (1) Gaseous emission test for coating operations not using carbon 
adsorption beds with individual exhausts. This method is applicable when 
the emissions from any affected coating operation are controlled by a 
control device other than a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with 
individual exhaust stacks for each adsorber vessel. The owner or 
operator using this method shall comply with the following procedures:
    (i) Construct the vapor capture system and control device so that 
all gaseous volumetric flow rates and total VOC emissions can be 
accurately determined by the applicable test methods and procedures 
specified in Sec. 60.745(b) through (g);
    (ii) Determine capture efficiency from the coating operation by 
capturing, venting, and measuring all VOC emissions from the coating 
operation. During a performance test, the owner or operator of an 
affected coating operation located in an area with other sources of VOC 
shall isolate the coating operation emissions from all other sources of 
VOC by one of the following methods:
    (A) Build a temporary enclosure, as defined in Sec. 60.741(a) and 
conforming to the requirements of Sec. 60.743(b)(1), around the 
affected coating operation. The temporary enclosure must be constructed 
and ventilated (through stacks suitable for testing) so that it has 
minimal impact on performance of the capture system; or
    (B) Shut down all other sources of VOC and continue to exhaust 
fugitive emissions from the affected coating operation through any 
building ventilation system and other room exhausts such as those on 
drying ovens. All such ventilation air must be vented through stacks 
suitable for testing because the VOC content in each must be determined.
    (iii) Operate the emission control device with all emission sources 
connected and operating.
    (iv) Determine the efficiency (E) of the control device by Equation 
1:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.067

    (v) Determine the efficiency (F) of the vapor capture system by 
Equation 2:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.068

    (vi) For each affected coating operation subject to Sec. 
60.742(b)(1) (emission reduction standard for coating operations), 
compliance is demonstrated if the product of (E)x(F) is equal to or 
greater than 0.90.

[[Page 655]]

    (2) Gaseous emission test for coating operations using carbon 
adsorption beds with individual exhausts. This method is applicable when 
emissions from any affected coating operation are controlled by a fixed-
bed carbon adsorption system with individual exhaust stacks for each 
adsorber vessel. The owner or operator using this method shall comply 
with the following procedures:
    (i) Construct the vapor capture system and control device so that 
each volumetric flow rate and the total VOC emissions can be accurately 
determined by the applicable test methods and procedures specified in 
Sec. 60.745 (b) through (g);
    (ii) Assure that all VOC emissions from the coating operation are 
segregated from other VOC sources and that the emissions can be captured 
for measurement, as described in Sec. 60.743(a)(1)(ii) (A) and (B);
    (iii) Operate the emission control device with all emission sources 
connected and operating;
    (iv) Determine the efficiency (H<INF>v) of each individual 
adsorber vessel (v) using Equation 3:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.069

    (v) Determine the efficiency of the carbon adsorption system 
(H<INF>sys) by computing the average efficiency of the adsorber 
vessels as weighted by the volumetric flow rate (Q<INF>hv) of each 
individual adsorber vessel (v) using Equation 4:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.070

    (vi) Determine the efficiency (F) of the vapor capture system using 
Equation (2).
    (vii) For each affected coating operation subject to Sec. 
60.742(b)(1) (emission reduction standard for coating operations), 
compliance is demonstrated if the product of (H<INF>sys)x(F) is 
equal to or greater than 0.90.
    (3) Monthly liquid material balance. This method can be used only 
when a VOC recovery device controls only those emissions from one 
affected coating operation. It may not be used if the VOC recovery 
device controls emissions from any other VOC emission sources. When 
demonstrating compliance by this method, Sec. 60.8(f) (Performance 
Tests) of this part does not apply. The owner or operator using this 
method shall comply with the following procedures to determine the VOC 
emission reduction for each nominal 1-month period:
    (i) Measure the amount of coating applied at the coating applicator. 
This quantity shall be determined at a time and location in the process 
after all ingredients (including any dilution solvent) have been added 
to the coating, or appropriate adjustments shall be made to account for 
any ingredients added after the amount of coating has been determined;
    (ii) Determine the VOC content of all coatings applied using the 
test method

[[Page 656]]

specified in Sec. 60.745(a). This value shall be determined at a time 
and location in the process after all ingredients (including any 
dilution solvent) have been added to the coating, or appropriate 
adjustments shall be made to account for any ingredients added after the 
VOC content in the coating has been determined;
    (iii) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate, according to the 
manufacturer's specifications, a device that indicates the cumulative 
amount of VOC recovered by the control device over each nominal 1-month 
period. The device shall be certified by the manufacturer to be accurate 
to within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.0 percent;
    (iv) Measure the amount of VOC recovered; and
    (v) Calculate the overall VOC emission reduction (R) for each and 
every nominal 1-month period using Equation 5. Emissions during startups 
and shutdowns are to be included when determining R because startups and 
shutdowns are part of normal operation for this source category.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.071


If the value of R is equal to or greater than 0.90, compliance with 
Sec. 60.742(b)(1) is demonstrated.
    (A) The value of RS<INF>i is zero unless the owner or operator 
submits the following information to the Administrator for approval of a 
measured value of RS<INF>i that is greater than zero but less than 
or equal to 6 percent by weight of the liquid VOC applied:
    (1) Measurement techniques; and
    (2) Documentation that the measured value of RS<INF>i exceeds 
zero but is less than or equal to 6 percent by weight of the liquid VOC 
applied.
    (B) For those facilities not subject to paragraph (a)(3)(v)(A) of 
this section, the value of RS<INF>i is zero unless the owner or 
operator submits the following information to the Administrator for 
approval of a measured value of RS<INF>i that is greater than 6 
percent by weight of the liquid VOC applied.
    (1) Measurement techniques;
    (2) Documentation that the measured value of RS<INF>i exceeds 
6 percent by weight of the liquid VOC applied; and
    (3) Either documentation of customer specifications requiring higher 
values or documentation that the desired properties of the product make 
it necessary for RS<INF>i to exceed 6 percent by weight of the 
liquid VOC applied and that such properties cannot be achieved by other 
means.
    (C) The measurement techniques of paragraphs (a)(3)(v)(A)(1) and 
(a)(3)(v)(B)(1) of this section shall be submitted to the Administrator 
for approval with the notification of anticipated startup required under 
Sec. 60.7(a)(2).
    (vi) The point at which M<INF>r is to be measured shall be 
established when the compliance procedures are approved. The presumptive 
point of measurement shall be prior to separation/ purification; a point 
after separation/purification may be adopted for enhanced convenience or 
accuracy.
    (4) Short-term liquid material balance. This method may be used as 
an alternative to the monthly liquid material balance described in 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The owner or operator using this 
method shall comply with the following procedures to determine VOC 
emission reduction for a 3- to 7-day period and shall continuously 
monitor VOC emissions as specified in Sec. 60.744.
    (i) Use the procedures described in paragraphs (a)(3) (i) through 
(vi) of this section to determine the overall emission reduction, R. 
Compliance is demonstrated if the value of R is equal to or greater than 
0.90.

[[Page 657]]

    (ii) The number of days for the performance test (3 to 7) is to be 
based on the affected facility's representative performance consistent 
with the requirements of Sec. 60.8(c). Data demonstrating that the 
chosen test period is representative shall be submitted to the 
Administrator for approval with the notification of anticipated startup 
required under Sec. 60.7(a)(2).
    (b) Each owner or operator of an affected coating operation subject 
to the standard specified in Sec. 60.742(b)(2) (alternative standard 
for coating operations) shall:
    (1) Demonstrate that a total enclosure is installed. The total 
enclosure shall either be approved by the Administrator in accordance 
with the provisions of Sec. 60.746, or meet the requirements in 
paragraphs (b)(1) (i) through (vi) of this section, as follows:
    (i) The only openings in the enclosure are forced makeup air and 
exhaust ducts and natural draft openings such as those through which raw 
materials enter and exist the coating operation;
    (ii) Total area of all natural draft openings does not exceed 5 
percent of the total surface area of the total enclosure's walls, floor, 
and ceiling;
    (iii) All access doors and windows are closed during normal 
operation of the enclosed coating operation, except for brief, 
occasional openings to accommodate process equipment adjustments. If 
such openings are frequent, or if the access door or window remains open 
for a significant amount of time during the process operation, it must 
be considered a natural draft opening. Access doors used routinely by 
workers to enter and exit the enclosed area shall be equipped with 
automatic closure devices;
    (iv) Average inward face velocity (FV) across all natural draft 
openings is a minimum of 3,600 meters per hour as determined by the 
following procedures:
    (A) Construct all forced makeup air ducts and all exhaust ducts so 
that the volumetric flow rate in each can be accurately determined by 
the test methods and procedures specified in Sec. 60.745 (c) and (d). 
Volumetric flow rates shall be calculated without the adjustment 
normally made for moisture content; and
    (B) Determine FV by Equation 6:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.072
    
    (v) The air passing through all natural draft openings flows into 
the enclosure continuously. If FV is less than or equal to 9,000 meters 
per hour, the continuous inward airflow shall be verified by continuous 
observation using smoke tubes, streamers, tracer gases, or other means 
approved by the Administrator over the period that the volumetric flow 
rate tests required to determine FV are carried out. If FV is greater 
than 9,000 meters per hour, the direction of airflow thourgh the natural 
draft openings shall be presumed to be inward at all times without 
verification.
    (vi) All sources of emissions within the enclosure shall be a 
minimum of four equivalent diameters away from each natural draft 
opening.
    (2) Determine the control device efficiency using Equation (1) or 
Equations (3) and (4), as applicable, and the test methods and 
procedures specified in Sec. 60.745 (b) through (g).
    (3) Compliance is demonstrated if the installation of a total 
enclosure is demonstrated and the value of E determined from Equation 
(1) or the value of

[[Page 658]]

H<INF>sys determined from Equations (3) and (4), as applicable, is 
equal to or greater than 0.95.
    (c) To demonstrate compliance with Sec. 60.742(c)(1) (standard for 
coating mix preparation equipment servicing a coating operation with 
concurrent construction of a control device that uses at least 130 Mg 
per year of VOC), each owner or operator of affected coating mix 
preparation equipment shall demonstrate that:
    (1) Covers meeting the following specifications have been installed 
and are being used properly:
    (i) Cover shall be closed at all times except when adding

mixer shaft or port for addition of ingredients) shall be covered 
consistent with paragraphs (c)(1) (i), (ii), and (iii) of this section 
when not actively in use. An opening sufficient to allow safe clearance 
for a mixer shaft is acceptable during those periods when the shaft is 
in place; and
    (v) A polyehtylene or nonpermanent cover may be used provided it 
meets the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) (ii), (iii), and (iv) of 
this section. Such a cover shall not be reused after once being removed.
    (2) Procedures detailing the proper use of covers, as specified in 
paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, have been posted in all areas where 
affected coatings mix preparation equipment is used;
    (3) The coating mix preparation equipment is vented to a control 
device while preparation of the coating is taking place within the 
vessel; and

respectively, and the test methods and procedures specified in Sec. 
60.745 (b) through (g) is equal to or greater than 0.95.
    (d) To demonstrate compliance with Sec. 60.742(c)(2) (standard for 
coating mix preparation equipment servicing a coating operation that 
does not have concurrent construction of a control device but uses at 
least 130 Mg of VOC per year) or Sec. 60.742(c)(3) (standard for 
coating mix preparation equipment servicing a coating operation that 
uses at least 95 Mg but less than 130 Mg of VOC per year), each owner or 
operator of affected coating mix preparation equipment shall demonstrate 
upon inspection that:
    (1) Covers satisfying the specifications in paragraphs (c)(1) (i) 
through (v) of this section have been installed and are being properly 
operated and maintained; and

paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, have been posted in all areas where 
affected coating mix preparation equipment is used.
    (3) Owners or operators meeting the standard specified in Sec. 
60.742 (c)(2)(ii) or (c)(3)(ii) shall also demonstrate that the coating 
mix preparation equipment is vented to a control device.
    (e) If a control device other than a carbon adsorber, condenser, or

[[Page 660]]

    (g) Each owner or operator of an affected facility who demonstrates 
compliance by the test methods described in Sec. 60.743(a)(1) or (2) 
(which include vapor capture system efficiency determinations) or Sec. 
60.743(a)(4) (short-term liquid material balance) shall submit a

<R05>
Sec. 60.745  Test methods and procedures.

    Methods in appendix A of this part, except as provided under Sec. 
60.8(b), shall be used to determine compliance as follows:
    (a) Method 24 is used to determine the VOC content in coatings. If 
it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that coating 
formulation data are equivalent to Method 24 results, formulation data 
may be used. In the event of any inconsistency between a Method 24 test 
and a facility's formulation data, the Method 24 test will govern. For 
Method 24, the coating sample must be a 1-liter sample collected in a 1-
liter container at a point in the process where the sample will be 
representative of the coating applied to the substrate (i.e., the sample 
shall include any dilution solvent or other VOC added during the 
manufacturing process). The container must be tightly sealed immediately 
after the sample is collected. Any solvent or other VOC added after the 
sample is taken must be measured and accounted for in the calculations 
that use Method 24 results.
    (b) Method 25 shall be used to determine VOC concentrations from 
incinerator gas streams. Alternative Methods (18 or 25A), may be used as 
explained in the applicability section of Method 25 in cases where use 
of Method 25 is demonstrated to be technically infeasible. The owner or 
operator shall submit notice of the intended test method to the 
Administrator for approval along with the notification of the 
performance test required under Sec. 60.8(d) of the General Provisions. 
Except as indicated in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, the 
test shall consist of three separate runs, each lasting a minimum of 30 
minutes.
    (1) When the method is to be used in the determination of the 
efficiency of a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with a common exhaust 
stack for all the individual adsorber vessels pursuant to Sec. 60.743 
(a)(1), (b), or (c), the test shall consist of three separate runs, each 
coinciding with one or more complete system rotations through the 
adsorption cycles of all the individual adsorber vessels.
    (2) When the method is to be used in the determination of the 
efficiency of a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with individual 
exhaust stacks for each adsorber vessel pursuant to Sec. 60.743 (a)(2), 
(b), or (c), each adsorber vessel shall be tested individually. Each 
test shall consist of three separate runs, each coinciding with one or 
more complete adsorption cycles.
    (c) Method 1 or 1A is used for sample and velocity traverses;
    (d) Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D is used for velocity and volumetric flow 
rates;

[[Page 661]]

    (e) Method 3 is used for gas analysis;
    (f) Method 4 is used for stack gas moisture;
    (g) Methods 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D; 3; and 4 shall be performed, as 
applicable, at least twice during each test run.


<R05>
Sec. 60.746  Permission to use alternative means of emission limitation.

    (a) If, in the Administrator's judgment, an alternative means of 
emission limitation will achieve a reduction in emissions of VOC from 
any emission point subject to Sec. 60.742(c) at least equivalent to 
that required by Sec. 60.742(b)(2) or Sec. 60.742(c), respectively, 
the Administrator will publish in the Federal Register a notice 
permitting the use of the alternative means. The Administrator may 
condition permission on requirements that may be necessary to ensure 
operation and maintenance to achieve the same emission reduction as 
specified in Sec. 60.742(b)(2) or Sec. 60.742(c), respectively.
    (b) Any notice under paragraph (a) of this section shall be 
published only after public notice and an opportunity for a public 
hearing.
    (c) Any person seeking permission under this section shall submit to 
the Administrator either results from an emission test that accurately 
collects and measures all VOC emissions from a given control device or 
an engineering evaluation that accurately determines such emissions.


<R05>
Sec. 60.747  Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

    (a) For each affected facility subject to the requirements of Sec. 
60.742(b) and (c), the owner or operator shall submit the performance

first year of operation shall submit to the Administrator, with the 
notification of anticipated startup required under Sec. 60.7(a)(2) of 
the General Provisions, a material flow chart indicating projected VOC 
use. The owner or operator shall also submit actual VOC use records at 
the end of the initial year.
    (c) Each owner or operator of an affected facility subject to the 
provisions of Sec. 60.742(c)(3) and initially using less than 130 Mg of 
VOC per year and each owner or operator of an affected facility 
initially using less than 95 Mg of VOC per year shall:
    (1) Record semiannual estimates of projected VOC use and actual 12-
month VOC use;
    (2) Report the first semiannual estimate in which projected annual 
VOC use exceeds the applicable cutoff; and
    (3) Report the first 12-month period in which the actual VOC use 
exceeds the applicable cutoff.
    (d) Each owner or operator of an affected facility demonstrating 
compliance by the methods described in Sec. 60.743(a)(1), (2), (4), 
(b), or (c) shall maintain records and submit quarterly reports to the 
Administrator documenting the following:

20 percent greater than the average value measured during the most 
recent performance test that demonstrated compliance.
    (ii) For carbon adsorption systems with individual exhaust stacks 
for each adsorber vessel, all 3-day rolling averages for each adsorber 
vessel when the concentration level of organic compounds in the 
individual outlet gas stream is more than 20 percent greater

Sec. 60.751  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, all terms not defined herein shall have the 
meaning given them in the Act or in subpart A of this part.
    Active collection system means a gas collection system that uses gas 
mover equipment.
    Active landfill means a landfill in which solid waste is being 
placed or a landfill that is planned to accept waste in the future.
    Closed landfill means a landfill in which solid waste is no longer 
being placed, and in which no additional solid wastes will be placed 
without first filing a notification of modification as prescribed under 
Sec. 60.7(a)(4). Once a notification of modification has been filed, 
and additional solid waste is placed in the landfill, the landfill is no 
longer closed.
    Closure means that point in time when a landfill becomes a closed 
landfill.

[[Page 664]]

    Commercial solid waste means all types of solid waste generated by 
stores, offices, restaurants, warehouses, and other nonmanufacturing 
activities, excluding residential and industrial wastes.
    Controlled landfill means any landfill at which collection and 
control systems are required under this subpart as a result of the 
nonmethane organic compounds emission rate. The landfill is considered 
controlled at the time a collection and control system design plan is 
submitted in compliance with Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(i).
    Design capacity means the maximum amount of solid waste a landfill 
can accept, as indicated in terms of volume or mass in the most recent 
permit issued by the State, local, or Tribal agency responsible for 
regulating the landfill, plus any in-place waste not accounted for in 
the most recent permit. If the owner or operator chooses to convert the 
design capacity from volume to mass or from mass to volume to 
demonstrate its design capacity is less than 2.5 million megagrams or 
2.5 million cubic meters, the calculation must include a site specific 
density, which must be recalculated annually.
    Disposal facility means all contiguous land and structures, other 
appurtenances, and improvements on the land used for the disposal of 
solid waste.
    Emission rate cutoff means the threshold annual emission rate to 
which a landfill compares its estimated emission rate to determine if 
control under the regulation is required.
    Enclosed combustor means an enclosed firebox which maintains a 
relatively constant limited peak temperature generally using a limited 
supply of combustion air. An enclosed flare is considered an enclosed 
combustor.
    Flare means an open combustor without enclosure or shroud.
    Gas mover equipment means the equipment (i.e., fan, blower, 
compressor) used to transport landfill gas through the header system.
    Household waste means any solid waste (including garbage, trash, and 
sanitary waste in septic tanks) derived from households (including, but 
not limited to, single and multiple residences, hotels and motels, 
bunkhouses, ranger stations, crew quarters, campgrounds, picnic grounds,

industry; rubber and miscellaneous plastic products; stone, glass, clay, 
and concrete products; textile manufacturing; transportation equipment; 
and water treatment. This term does not include mining waste or oil and 
gas waste.
    Interior well means any well or similar collection component located 
inside the perimeter of the landfill waste. A perimeter well located 
outside the landfilled waste is not an interior well.
    Landfill means an area of land or an excavation in which wastes are 
placed for permanent disposal, and that is not a land application unit, 
surface impoundment, injection well, or waste pile as those terms are 
defined under Sec. 257.2 of this title.
    Lateral expansion means a horizontal expansion of the waste 
boundaries of an existing MSW landfill. A lateral expansion is not a 
modification unless it results in an increase in the design capacity of 
the landfill.
    Modification means an increase in the permitted volume design 
capacity of the landfill by either horizontal or vertical expansion 
based on its permitted design capacity as of May 30, 1991. Modification 
does not occur until the owner or operator commences construction on the 
horizontal or vertical expansion.
    Municipal solid waste landfill or MSW landfill means an entire 
disposal facility in a contiguous geographical space where household 
waste is placed in or

[[Page 665]]

on land. An MSW landfill may also receive other types of RCRA Subtitle D 
wastes (Sec. 257.2 of this title) such as commercial solid waste, 
nonhazardous sludge, conditionally exempt small quantity generator 
waste, and industrial solid waste. Portions of an MSW landfill may be 
separated by access roads. An MSW landfill may be publicly or privately 
owned. An MSW landfill may be a new MSW landfill, an existing MSW 
landfill, or a lateral expansion.
    Municipal solid waste landfill emissions or MSW landfill emissions 
means gas generated by the decomposition of organic waste deposited in 
an MSW landfill or derived from the evolution of organic compounds in 
the waste.
    NMOC means nonmethane organic compounds, as measured according to 
the provisions of Sec. 60.754.

chemical breakdown or microbiological activity. Examples are, but are 
not limited to, concrete, municipal waste combustor ash, and metals.
    Passive collection system means a gas collection system that solely 
uses positive pressure within the landfill to move the gas rather than 
using gas mover equipment.
    Sludge means any solid, semisolid, or liquid waste generated from a 
municipal, commercial, or industrial wastewater treatment plant, water 
supply treatment plant, or air pollution control facility, exclusive of 
the treated effluent from a wastewater treatment plant.
    Solid waste means any garbage, sludge from a wastewater treatment 
plant, water supply treatment plant, or air pollution control facility 
and other discarded material, including solid, liquid, semisolid, or 
contained gaseous material resulting from industrial, commercial, 
mining, and agricultural operations, and from community activities, but 
does not include solid or dissolved material in domestic sewage, or 
solid or dissolved materials in irrigation return flows or industrial 
discharges that are point sources subject to permits under 33 U.S.C. 
1342, or source, special nuclear, or by-product material as defined by 
the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C 2011 et seq.).
    Sufficient density means any number, spacing, and combination of 
collection system components, including vertical wells, horizontal 
collectors, and surface collectors, necessary to maintain emission and 
migration control as determined by measures of performance set forth in 
this part.
    Sufficient extraction rate means a rate sufficient to maintain a 
negative pressure at all wellheads in the collection system without 
causing air infiltration, including any wellheads connected to the 
system as a result of expansion or excess surface emissions, for the 
life of the blower.

Sec. 60.753  Operational standards for collection and control systems.

    Each owner or operator of an MSW landfill with a gas collection and 
control system used to comply with the provisions of Sec. 
60.752(b)(2)(ii) of this subpart shall:
    (a) Operate the collection system such that gas is collected from 
each area, cell, or group of cells in the MSW landfill in which solid 
waste has been in place for:
    (1) 5 years or more if active; or
    (2) 2 years or more if closed or at final grade;
    (b) Operate the collection system with negative pressure at each 
wellhead except under the following conditions:
    (1) A fire or increased well temperature. The owner or operator 
shall record instances when positive pressure occurs in efforts to avoid 
a fire. These records shall be submitted with the annual reports as 
provided in Sec. 60.757(f)(1);
    (2) Use of a geomembrane or synthetic cover. The owner or operator 
shall develop acceptable pressure limits in the design plan;
    (3) A decommissioned well. A well may experience a static positive 
pressure after shut down to accommodate for declining flows. All design 
changes shall be approved by the Administrator;
    (c) Operate each interior wellhead in the collection system with a 
landfill gas temperature less than 55 [deg]C and with either a nitrogen 
level less than 20 percent or an oxygen level less than 5 percent. The 
owner or operator may establish a higher operating temperature, 
nitrogen, or oxygen value at a particular well. A higher operating value 
demonstration shall show supporting data that the elevated parameter 
does not cause fires or significantly inhibit anaerobic decomposition by 
killing methanogens.
    (1) The nitrogen level shall be determined using Method 3C, unless 
an alternative test method is established as allowed by Sec. 
60.752(b)(2)(i) of this subpart.
    (2) Unless an alternative test method is established as allowed by 
Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(i) of this subpart, the oxygen shall be determined by 
an oxygen meter using Method 3A or 3C except that:
    (i) The span shall be set so that the regulatory limit is between 20 
and 50 percent of the span;
    (ii) A data recorder is not required;
    (iii) Only two calibration gases are required, a zero and span, and 
ambient air may be used as the span;
    (iv) A calibration error check is not required;
    (v) The allowable sample bias, zero drift, and calibration drift are 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>10 percent.
    (d) Operate the collection system so that the methane concentration 
is less than 500 parts per million above background at the surface of 
the landfill. To determine if this level is exceeded, the owner or 
operator shall conduct surface testing around the perimeter of the 
collection area and along a pattern that traverses the landfill at 30 
meter intervals and where visual observations indicate elevated 
concentrations of landfill gas, such as distressed vegetation and cracks 
or seeps in the cover. The owner or operator may establish an 
alternative traversing pattern that ensures equivalent coverage. A 
surface monitoring design plan shall be developed that includes a 
topographical map with the monitoring route and the rationale for any 
site-specific deviations from the 30 meter intervals. Areas with steep 
slopes or other dangerous areas may be excluded from the surface 
testing.
    (e) Operate the system such that all collected gases are vented to a 
control system designed and operated in compliance with Sec. 
60.752(b)(2)(iii). In the event the collection or control system is 
inoperable, the gas mover system shall be shut down and all valves in 
the collection and control system contributing to venting of the gas to 
the atmosphere shall be closed within 1 hour; and
    (f) Operate the control or treatment system at all times when the 
collected gas is routed to the system.

[[Page 669]]

    (g) If monitoring demonstrates that the operational requirements in 
paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section are not met, corrective 
action shall be taken as specified in Sec. 60.755(a)(3) through (5) or 
Sec. 60.755(c) of this subpart. If corrective actions are taken as 
specified in Sec. 60.755, the monitored exceedance is not a violation 
of the operational requirements in this section.

Sec. 60.754  Test methods and procedures.

    (a)(1) The landfill owner or operator shall calculate the NMOC 
emission rate using either the equation provided in paragraph (a)(1)(i) 
of this section or the equation provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this 
section. Both equations may be used if the actual year-to-year solid 
waste acceptance rate is known, as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i), for 
part of the life of the landfill and the actual year-to-year solid waste 
acceptance rate is unknown, as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii), for 
part of the life of the landfill. The values to be used in both 
equations are 0.05 per year for k, 170 cubic meters per megagram for 
L<INF>O, and 4,000 parts per million by volume as hexane for the 
C<INF>NMOC. For landfills located in geographical areas with a 
thirty year annual average precipitation of less than 25 inches, as 
measured at the nearest representative official meteorologic site, the k 
value to be used is 0.02 per year.
    (i) The following equation shall be used if the actual year-to-year 
solid waste acceptance rate is known.

where,

M<INF>NMOC=Total NMOC emission rate from the landfill, megagrams 
per year
k=methane generation rate constant, year<SUP>-1</SUP>
L<INF>o=methane generation potential, cubic meters per megagram 
solid waste
M<INF>i=mass of solid waste in the i<SUP>th</SUP> section, 
megagrams
t<INF>i=age of the i<SUP>th</SUP> section, years
C<INF>NMOC=concentration of NMOC, parts per million by volume as 
hexane
3.6 x 10<SUP>-9</SUP>=conversion factor

    The mass of nondegradable solid waste may be subtracted from the 
total mass of solid waste in a particular section of the landfill when 
calculating the value for M<INF>i if documentation of the nature 
and amount of such wastes is maintained

    (ii) The following equation shall be used if the actual year-to-year 
solid waste acceptance rate is unknown.

M<INF>NMOC = 2L<INF>o R (e<SUP>-kc</SUP>-e<SUP>-kt</SUP>) 
    C<INF>NMOC (3.6 x 10<SUP>-9</SUP>)

Where:

M<INF>NMOC=mass emission rate of NMOC, megagrams per year
L<INF>o=methane generation potential, cubic meters per megagram 
solid waste
R=average annual acceptance rate, megagrams per year
k=methane generation rate constant, year<SUP>-1</SUP>
t = age of landfill, years
C<INF>NMOC=concentration of NMOC, parts per million by volume as 
hexane
c=time since closure, years; for active landfill c=O and 
e<SUP>-kc</SUP>1
3.6x10-9=conversion factor

    The mass of nondegradable solid waste may be subtracted from the 
total mass of solid waste in a particular section of the landfill when 
calculating the value of R, if documentation of the nature and amount of 
such wastes is maintained.
    (2) Tier 1. The owner or operator shall compare the calculated NMOC 
mass emission rate to the standard of 50 megagrams per year.
    (i) If the NMOC emission rate calculated in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section is less than 50 megagrams per year, then the landfill owner 
shall submit an emission rate report as provided in Sec. 60.757(b)(1), 
and shall recalculate the NMOC mass emission rate annually as required 
under Sec. 60.752(b)(1).
    (ii) If the calculated NMOC emission rate is equal to or greater 
than 50 megagrams per year, then the landfill owner shall either comply 
with

[[Page 670]]

Sec. 60.752(b)(2), or determine a site-specific NMOC concentration and 
recalculate the NMOC emission rate using the procedures provided in 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
    (3) Tier 2. The landfill owner or operator shall determine the NMOC 
concentration using the following sampling procedure. The landfill owner 
or operator shall install at least two sample probes per hectare of 
landfill surface that has retained waste for at least 2 years. If the 
landfill is larger than 25 hectares in area, only 50 samples are 
required. The sample probes should be located to avoid known areas of 
nondegradable solid waste. The owner or operator shall collect and 
analyze one sample of landfill gas from each probe to determine the NMOC 
concentration using Method 25 or 25C of Appendix A of this part. Method 
18 of Appendix A of this part may be used to analyze the samples 
collected by the Method 25 or 25C sampling procedure. Taking composite 
samples from different probes into a single cylinder is allowed; 
however, equal sample volumes must be taken from each probe. For each 
composite, the sampling rate, collection times, beginning and ending 
cylinder vacuums, or alternative volume measurements must be recorded to 
verify that composite volumes are equal. Composite sample volumes should 
not be less than one liter unless evidence can be provided to 
substantiate the accuracy of smaller volumes. Terminate compositing 
before the cylinder approaches ambient pressure where measurement 
accuracy diminishes. If using Method 18, the owner or operator must 
identify all compounds in the sample and, as a minimum, test for those 
compounds published in the most recent Compilation of Air Pollutant 
Emission Factors (AP-42), minus carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, and 
mercury. As a minimum, the instrument must be calibrated for each of the 
compounds on the list. Convert the concentration of each Method 18 
compound to C<INF>NMOC as hexane by multiplying by the ratio of 
its carbon atoms divided by six. If more than the required number of 
samples are taken, all samples must be used in the analysis. The 
landfill owner or operator must divide the NMOC concentration from 
Method 25 or 25C of Appendix A of this part by six to convert from 
C<INF>NMOC as carbon to C<INF>NMOC as hexane. If the 
landfill has an active or passive gas removal system in place, Method 25 
or 25C samples may be collected from these systems instead of surface 
probes provided the removal system can be shown to provide sampling as 
representative as the two sampling probe per hectare requirement. For 
active collection systems, samples may be collected from the common 
header pipe before the gas moving or condensate removal equipment. For 
these systems, a minimum of three samples must be collected from the 
header pipe.
    (i) The landfill owner or operator shall recalculate the NMOC mass 
emission rate using the equations provided in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or 
(a)(1)(ii) of this section and using the average NMOC concentration from 
the collected samples instead of the default value in the equation 
provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (ii) If the resulting mass emission rate calculated using the site-
specific NMOC concentration is equal to or greater than 50 megagrams per 
year, then the landfill owner or operator shall either comply with Sec. 
60.752(b)(2), or determine the site-specific methane generation rate 
constant and recalculate the NMOC emission rate using the site-specific 
methane generation rate using the procedure specified in paragraph 
(a)(4) of this section.
    (iii) If the resulting NMOC mass emission rate is less than 50 
megagrams per year, the owner or operator shall submit a periodic 
estimate of the emission rate report as provided in Sec. 60.757(b)(1) 
and retest the site-specific NMOC concentration every 5 years using the 
methods specified in this section.
    (4) Tier 3. The site-specific methane generation rate constant shall 
be determined using the procedures provided in Method 2E of appendix A 
of this part. The landfill owner or operator shall estimate the NMOC 
mass emission rate using equations in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (a)(1)(ii) 
of this section and

[[Page 671]]

using a site-specific methane generation rate constant k, and the site-
specific NMOC concentration as determined in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section instead of the default values provided in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section. The landfill owner or operator shall compare the resulting 
NMOC mass emission rate to the standard of 50 megagrams per year.
    (i) If the NMOC mass emission rate as calculated using the site-
specific methane generation rate and concentration of NMOC is equal to 
or greater than 50 megagrams per year, the owner or operator shall 
comply with Sec. 60.752(b)(2).
    (ii) If the NMOC mass emission rate is less than 50 megagrams per 
year, then the owner or operator shall submit a periodic emission rate 
report as provided in Sec. 60.757(b)(1) and shall recalculate the NMOC 
mass emission rate annually, as provided in Sec. 60.757(b)(1) using the 
equations in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and using the site-
specific methane generation rate constant and NMOC concentration 
obtained in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The calculation of the 
methane generation rate constant is performed only once, and the value 
obtained from this test shall be used in all subsequent annual NMOC 
emission rate calculations.
    (5) The owner or operator may use other methods to determine the 
NMOC concentration or a site-specific k as an alternative to the methods 
required in paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section if the method 
has been approved by the Administrator.
    (b) After the installation of a collection and control system in 
compliance with Sec. 60.755, the owner or operator shall calculate the 
NMOC emission rate for purposes of determining when the system can be 
removed as provided in Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(v), using the following 
equation:

M<INF>NMOC = 1.89 x 10<SUP>-3</SUP> Q<INF>LFG 
    C<INF>NMOC

where,

M<INF>NMOC = mass emission rate of NMOC, megagrams per year
Q<INF>LFG = flow rate of landfill gas, cubic meters per minute
C<INF>NMOC = NMOC concentration, parts per million by volume as 
hexane

    (1) The flow rate of landfill gas, Q<INF>LFG, shall be 
determined by measuring the total landfill gas flow rate at the common 
header pipe that leads to the control device using a gas flow measuring 
device calibrated according to the provisions of section 4 of Method 2E 
of appendix A of this part.
    (2) The average NMOC concentration, C<INF>NMOC, shall be 
determined by collecting and analyzing landfill gas sampled from the 
common header pipe before the gas moving or condensate removal equipment 
using the procedures in Method 25C or Method 18 of appendix A of this 
part. If using Method 18 of appendix A of this part, the minimum list of 
compounds to be tested shall be those published in the most recent 
Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors (AP-42). The sample 
location on the common header pipe shall be before any condensate 
removal or other gas refining units. The landfill owner or operator 
shall divide the NMOC concentration from Method 25C of appendix A of 
this part by six to convert from C<INF>NMOC as carbon to 
C<INF>NMOC as hexane.
    (3) The owner or operator may use another method to determine 
landfill gas flow rate and NMOC concentration if the method has been 
approved by the Administrator.
    (c) When calculating emissions for PSD purposes, the owner or 
operator of each MSW landfill subject to the provisions of this subpart 
shall estimate the NMOC emission rate for comparison to the PSD major 
source and significance levels in Sec. Sec. 51.166 or 52.21 of this 
chapter using AP-42 or other approved measurement procedures.
    (d) For the performance test required in Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(iii)(B), 
Method 25, 25C, or Method 18 of Appendix A of this part must be used to 
determine compliance with the 98 weight-percent efficiency or the 20 
ppmv outlet concentration level, unless another method to demonstrate 
compliance has been approved by the Administrator as provided by Sec. 
60.752(b)(2)(i)(B). Method 3 or 3A shall be used to determine oxygen for 
correcting the NMOC concentration as hexane to 3 percent. In cases where 
the outlet concentration is less than 50 ppm NMOC as carbon (8 ppm NMOC 
as hexane), Method 25A should be used in place of Method 25. If using 
Method 18

[[Page 672]]

of appendix A of this part, the minimum list of compounds to be tested 
shall be those published in the most recent Compilation of Air Pollutant 
Emission Factors (AP-42). The following equation shall be used to 
calculate efficiency:

Control Efficiency = (NMOC<INF>in - NMOC<INF>out)/
    (NMOC<INF>in)

where,

NMOC<INF>in = mass of NMOC entering control device
NMOC<INF>out = mass of NMOC exiting control device
    (e) For the performance test required in Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(iii)(A), 
the net heating value of the combusted landfill gas as determined in 
Sec. 60.18(f)(3) is calculated from the concentration of methane in the 
landfill gas as measured by Method 3C. A minimum of three 30-minute 
Method 3C samples are determined. The measurement of other organic 
components, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide is not applicable. Method 3C 
may be used to determine the landfill gas molecular weight for 
calculating the flare gas exit velocity under Sec. 60.18(f)(4).

Sec. 60.755  Compliance provisions.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(i)(B), the specified 
methods in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section shall be 
used to determine whether the gas collection system is in compliance 
with Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(ii).
    (1) For the purposes of calculating the maximum expected gas 
generation flow rate from the landfill to determine compliance with 
Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(ii)(A)(1), one of the following equations shall be 
used. The k and L<INF>o kinetic factors should be those published 
in the most recent Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors (AP-42) 
or other site specific values demonstrated to be appropriate and 
approved by the Administrator. If k has been determined as specified in 
Sec. 60.754(a)(4), the value of k determined from the test shall be 
used. A value of no more than 15 years shall be used for the intended 
use period of the gas mover equipment. The active life of the landfill 
is the age of the landfill plus the estimated number of years until 
closure.
    (i) For sites with unknown year-to-year solid waste acceptance rate:

Q<INF>m = 2L<INF>o R (e<SUP>-kc</SUP> - e<SUP>-kt</SUP>)

where,

Q<INF>m = maximum expected gas generation flow rate, cubic meters 
per year
L<INF>o = methane generation potential, cubic meters per megagram 
solid waste
R = average annual acceptance rate, megagrams per year
k = methane generation rate constant, year<SUP>-1</SUP>
t = age of the landfill at equipment installation plus the time the 
owner or operator intends to use the gas mover equipment or active life 
of the landfill, whichever is less. If the equipment is installed after 
closure, t is the age of the landfill at installation, years
c = time since closure, years (for an active landfill c = O and 
e<SUP>-kc</SUP> = 1)

    (ii) For sites with known year-to-year solid waste acceptance rate:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR12MR96.026
    
where,

Q<INF>M=maximum expected gas generation flow rate, cubic meters 
per year
k=methane generation rate constant, year<SUP>-1</SUP>
L<INF>o=methane generation potential, cubic meters per megagram 
solid waste
M<INF>i=mass of solid waste in the i<SUP>th</SUP> section, 
megagrams
t<INF>i=age of the i<SUP>th</SUP> section, years

    (iii) If a collection and control system has been installed, actual 
flow data may be used to project the maximum expected gas generation 
flow rate instead of, or in conjunction with, the equations in 
paragraphs (a)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section. If the landfill is still 
accepting waste, the actual measured flow data will not equal the 
maximum expected gas generation rate, so calculations using the 
equations in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) or (ii) or other methods shall be 
used to predict the maximum expected gas generation rate over the 
intended period of use of the gas control system equipment.
    (2) For the purposes of determining sufficient density of gas 
collectors for compliance with Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(ii)(A)(2),

[[Page 673]]

the owner or operator shall design a system of vertical wells, 
horizontal collectors, or other collection devices, satisfactory to the 
Administrator, capable of controlling and extracting gas from all 
portions of the landfill sufficient to meet all operational and 
performance standards.
    (3) For the purpose of demonstrating whether the gas collection 
system flow rate is sufficient to determine compliance with Sec. 
60.752(b)(2)(ii)(A)(3), the owner or operator shall measure gauge 
pressure in the gas collection header at each individual well, monthly. 
If a positive pressure exists, action shall be initiated to correct the 
exceedance within 5 calendar days, except for the three conditions 
allowed under Sec. 60.753(b). If negative pressure cannot be achieved 
without excess air infiltration within 15 calendar days of the first 
measurement, the gas collection system shall be expanded to correct the 
exceedance within 120 days of the initial measurement of positive 
pressure. Any attempted corrective measure shall not cause exceedances 
of other operational or performance standards. An alternative timeline 
for correcting the exceedance may be submitted to the Administrator for 
approval.
    (4) Owners or operators are not required to expand the system as 
required in paragraph (a)(3) of this section during the first 180 days 
after gas collection system startup.
    (5) For the purpose of identifying whether excess air infiltration 
into the landfill is occurring, the owner or operator shall monitor each 
well monthly for temperature and nitrogen or oxygen as provided in Sec. 
60.753(c). If a well exceeds one of these operating parameters, action 
shall be initiated to correct the exceedance within 5 calendar days. If 
correction of the exceedance cannot be achieved within 15 calendar days 
of the first measurement, the gas collection system shall be expanded to 
correct the exceedance within 120 days of the initial exceedance. Any 
attempted corrective measure shall not cause exceedances of other 
operational or performance standards. An alternative timeline for 
correcting the exceedance may be submitted to the Administrator for 
approval.
    (6) An owner or operator seeking to demonstrate compliance with 
Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(ii)(A)(4) through the use of a collection system not 
conforming to the specifications provided in Sec. 60.759 shall provide 
information satisfactory to the Administrator as specified in Sec. 
60.752(b)(2)(i)(C) demonstrating that off-site migration is being 
controlled.
    (b) For purposes of compliance with Sec. 60.753(a), each owner or 
operator of a controlled landfill shall place each well or design 
component as specified in the approved design plan as provided in Sec. 
60.752(b)(2)(i). Each well shall be installed no later than 60 days 
after the date on which the initial solid waste has been in place for a 
period of:
    (1) 5 years or more if active; or
    (2) 2 years or more if closed or at final grade.
    (c) The following procedures shall be used for compliance with the 
surface methane operational standard as provided in Sec. 60.753(d).
    (1) After installation of the collection system, the owner or 
operator shall monitor surface concentrations of methane along the 
entire perimeter of the collection area and along a pattern that 
traverses the landfill at 30 meter intervals (or a site-specific 
established spacing) for each collection area on a quarterly basis using 
an organic vapor analyzer, flame ionization detector, or other portable 
monitor meeting the specifications provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (2) The background concentration shall be determined by moving the 
probe inlet upwind and downwind outside the boundary of the landfill at 
a distance of at least 30 meters from the perimeter wells.
    (3) Surface emission monitoring shall be performed in accordance 
with section 4.3.1 of Method 21 of appendix A of this part, except that 
the probe inlet shall be placed within 5 to 10 centimeters of the 
ground. Monitoring shall be performed during typical meteorological 
conditions.
    (4) Any reading of 500 parts per million or more above background at 
any location shall be recorded as a monitored exceedance and the actions 
specified in paragraphs (c)(4) (i) through (v) of this section shall be 
taken. As long as the specified actions are taken, the

[[Page 674]]

exceedance is not a violation of the operational requirements of Sec. 
60.753(d).
    (i) The location of each monitored exceedance shall be marked and 
the location recorded.
    (ii) Cover maintenance or adjustments to the vacuum of the adjacent 
wells to increase the gas collection in the vicinity of each exceedance 
shall be made and the location shall be re-monitored within 10 calendar 
days of detecting the exceedance.
    (iii) If the re-monitoring of the location shows a second 
exceedance, additional corrective action shall be taken and the location 
shall be monitored again within 10 days of the second exceedance. If the 
re-monitoring shows a third exceedance for the same location, the action 
specified in paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section shall be taken, and no 
further monitoring of that location is required until the action 
specified in paragraph (c)(4)(v) has been taken.
    (iv) Any location that initially showed an exceedance but has a 
methane concentration less than 500 ppm methane above background at the 
10-day re-monitoring specified in paragraph (c)(4) (ii) or (iii) of this 
section shall be re-monitored 1 month from the initial exceedance. If 
the 1-month remonitoring shows a concentration less than 500 parts per 
million above background, no further monitoring of that location is 
required until the next quarterly monitoring period. If the 1-month 
remonitoring shows an exceedance, the actions specified in paragraph 
(c)(4) (iii) or (v) shall be taken.
    (v) For any location where monitored methane concentration equals or 
exceeds 500 parts per million above background three times within a 
quarterly period, a new well or other collection device shall be 
installed within 120 calendar days of the initial exceedance. An 
alternative remedy to the exceedance, such as upgrading the blower, 
header pipes or control device, and a corresponding timeline for 
installation may be submitted to the Administrator for approval.
    (5) The owner or operator shall implement a program to monitor for 
cover integrity and implement cover repairs as necessary on a monthly 
basis.
    (d) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with the provisions in 
paragraph (c) of this section shall comply with the following 
instrumentation specifications and procedures for surface emission 
monitoring devices:
    (1) The portable analyzer shall meet the instrument specifications 
provided in section 3 of Method 21 of appendix A of this part, except 
that ``methane'' shall replace all references to VOC.
    (2) The calibration gas shall be methane, diluted to a nominal 
concentration of 500 parts per million in air.
    (3) To meet the performance evaluation requirements in section 3.1.3 
of Method 21 of appendix A of this part, the instrument evaluation 
procedures of section 4.4 of Method 21 of appendix A of this part shall 
be used.
    (4) The calibration procedures provided in section 4.2 of Method 21 
of appendix A of this part shall be followed immediately before 
commencing a surface monitoring survey.
    (e) The provisions of this subpart apply at all times, except during 
periods of start-up, shutdown, or malfunction, provided that the 
duration of start-up, shutdown, or malfunction shall not exceed 5 days 
for collection systems and shall not exceed 1 hour for treatment or 
control devices.

    (b) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with Sec. 
60.752(b)(2)(iii) using an enclosed combustor shall calibrate,

[[Page 675]]

maintain, and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications, 
the following equipment.
    (1) A temperature monitoring device equipped with a continuous 
recorder and having a minimum accuracy of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 
percent of the temperature being measured expressed in degrees Celsius 
or <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 degrees Celsius, whichever is greater. A 
temperature monitoring device is not required for boilers or process 
heaters with design heat input capacity equal to or greater than 44 
megawatts.
    (2) A device that records flow to or bypass of the control device. 
The owner or operator shall either:
    (i) Install, calibrate, and maintain a gas flow rate measuring 
device that shall record the flow to the control device at least every 
15 minutes; or
    (ii) Secure the bypass line valve in the closed position with a car-
seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. A visual inspection of the 
seal or closure mechanism shall be performed at least once every month 
to ensure that the valve is maintained in the closed position and that 
the gas flow is not diverted through the bypass line.
    (c) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with Sec. 
60.752(b)(2)(iii) using an open flare shall install, calibrate, 
maintain, and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications the 
following equipment:
    (1) A heat sensing device, such as an ultraviolet beam sensor or 
thermocouple, at the pilot light or the flame itself to indicate the 
continuous presence of a flame.
    (2) A device that records flow to or bypass of the flare. The owner 
or operator shall either:
    (i) Install, calibrate, and maintain a gas flow rate measuring 
device that shall record the flow to the control device at least every 
15 minutes; or
    (ii) Secure the bypass line valve in the closed position with a car-
seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. A visual inspection of the 
seal or closure mechanism shall be performed at least once every month 
to ensure that the valve is maintained in the closed position and that 
the gas flow is not diverted through the bypass line.
    (d) Each owner or operator seeking to demonstrate compliance with 
Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(iii) using a device other than an open flare or an 
enclosed combustor shall provide information satisfactory to the 
Administrator as provided in Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(i)(B) describing the 
operation of the control device, the operating parameters that would 
indicate proper performance, and appropriate monitoring procedures. The 
Administrator shall review the information and either approve it, or 
request that additional information be submitted. The Administrator may 
specify additional appropriate monitoring procedures.
    (e) Each owner or operator seeking to install a collection system 
that does not meet the specifications in Sec. 60.759 or seeking to 
monitor alternative parameters to those required by Sec. 60.753 through 
Sec. 60.756 shall provide information satisfactory to the Administrator 
as provided in Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(i) (B) and (C) describing the design 
and operation of the collection system, the operating parameters that 
would indicate proper performance, and appropriate monitoring 
procedures. The Administrator may specify additional appropriate 
monitoring procedures.
    (f) Each owner or operator seeking to demonstrate compliance with 
Sec. 60.755(c), shall monitor surface concentrations of methane 
according to the instrument specifications and procedures provided in 
Sec. 60.755(d). Any closed landfill that has no monitored exceedances 
of the operational standard in three consecutive quarterly monitoring 
periods may skip to annual monitoring. Any methane reading of 500 ppm or

Sec. 60.757  Reporting requirements.

    Except as provided in Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(i)(B),
    (a) Each owner or operator subject to the requirements of this 
subpart shall submit an initial design capacity report to the 
Administrator.
    (1) The initial design capacity report shall fulfill the 
requirements of the notification of the date construction is

[[Page 676]]

commenced as required by Sec. 60.7(a)(1) and shall be submitted no 
later than:
    (i) June 10, 1996, for landfills that commenced construction, 
modification, or reconstruction on or after May 30, 1991 but before 
March 12, 1996 or
    (ii) Ninety days after the date of commenced construction, 
modification, or reconstruction for landfills that commence 
construction, modification, or reconstruction on or after March 12, 
1996.
    (2) The initial design capacity report shall contain the following 
information:
    (i) A map or plot of the landfill, providing the size and location 
of the landfill, and identifying all areas where solid waste may be 
landfilled according to the permit issued by the State, local, or tribal 
agency responsible for regulating the landfill.
    (ii) The maximum design capacity of the landfill. Where the maximum 
design capacity is specified in the permit issued by the State, local, 
or tribal agency responsible for regulating the landfill, a copy of the 
permit specifying the maximum design capacity may be submitted as part 
of the report. If the maximum design capacity of the landfill is not 
specified in the permit, the maximum design capacity shall be calculated 
using good engineering practices. The calculations shall be provided, 
along with the relevant parameters as part of the report. The State, 
Tribal, local agency or Administrator may request other reasonable 
information as may be necessary to verify the maximum design capacity of 
the landfill.
    (3) An amended design capacity report shall be submitted to the 
Administrator providing notification of an increase in the design 
capacity of the landfill, within 90 days of an increase in the maximum 
design capacity of the landfill to or above 2.5 million megagrams and 
2.5 million cubic meters. This increase in design capacity may result 
from an increase in the permitted volume of the landfill or an increase 
in the density as documented in the annual recalculation required in 
Sec. 60.758(f).
    (b) Each owner or operator subject to the requirements of this 
subpart shall submit an NMOC emission rate report to the Administrator 
initially and annually thereafter, except as provided for in paragraphs 
(b)(1)(ii) or (b)(3) of this section. The Administrator may request such 
additional information as may be necessary to verify the reported NMOC 
emission rate.
    (1) The NMOC emission rate report shall contain an annual or 5-year 
estimate of the NMOC emission rate calculated using the formula and 
procedures provided in Sec. 60.754(a) or (b), as applicable.
    (i) The initial NMOC emission rate report may be combined with the 
initial design capacity report required in paragraph (a) of this section 
and shall be submitted no later than indicated in paragraphs 
(b)(1)(i)(A) and (B) of this section. Subsequent NMOC emission rate 
reports shall be submitted annually thereafter, except as provided for 
in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(3) of this section.

modification, or reconstruction on or after May 30, 1991, but before 
March 12, 1996, or
    (B) Ninety days after the date of commenced construction, 
modification, or reconstruction for landfills that commence 
construction, modification, or reconstruction on or after March 12, 
1996.
    (ii) If the estimated NMOC emission rate as reported in the annual 
report to the Administrator is less than 50 megagrams per year in each 
of the next 5 consecutive years, the owner or operator may elect to 
submit an estimate of the NMOC emission rate for the next 5-year period 
in lieu of the annual report. This estimate shall include the current 
amount of solid waste-in-place and the estimated waste acceptance rate 
for each year of the 5 years for which an NMOC emission rate is 
estimated. All data and calculations upon which this estimate is based 
shall be provided to the Administrator. This estimate shall be revised 
at least once every 5 years. If the actual waste acceptance rate exceeds 
the estimated waste acceptance rate in any year reported in the 5-year 
estimate, a revised 5-year estimate shall be submitted to

[[Page 677]]

the Administrator. The revised estimate shall cover the 5-year period 
beginning with the year in which the actual waste acceptance rate 
exceeded the estimated waste acceptance rate.
    (2) The NMOC emission rate report shall include all the data, 
calculations, sample reports and measurements used to estimate the 
annual or 5-year emissions.
    (3) Each owner or operator subject to the requirements of this 
subpart is exempted from the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) 
of this section, after the installation of a collection and control 
system in compliance with Sec. 60.752(b)(2), during such time as the 
collection and control system is in operation and in compliance with 
Sec. Sec. 60.753 and 60.755.
    (c) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of Sec. 
60.752(b)(2)(i) shall submit a collection and control system design plan 
to the Administrator within 1 year of the first report required under 
paragraph (b) of this section in which the emission rate equals or 
exceeds 50 megagrams per year, except as follows:

rate after Tier 2 NMOC sampling and analysis as provided in Sec. 
60.754(a)(3) and the resulting rate is less than 50 megagrams per year, 
annual periodic reporting shall be resumed, using the Tier 2 determined 
site-specific NMOC concentration, until the calculated emission rate is 
equal to or greater than 50 megagrams per year or the landfill is 
closed. The revised NMOC emission rate report, with the recalculated 
emission rate based on NMOC sampling and analysis, shall be submitted 
within 180 days of the first calculated exceedance of 50 megagrams per 
year.
    (2) If the owner or operator elects to recalculate the NMOC emission 
rate after determining a site-specific methane generation rate constant 
(k), as provided in Tier 3 in Sec. 60.754(a)(4), and the resulting NMOC 
emission rate is less than 50 Mg/yr, annual periodic reporting shall be 
resumed. The resulting site-specific methane generation rate constant 
(k) shall be used in the emission rate calculation until such time as 
the emissions rate calculation results in an exceedance. The revised 
NMOC emission rate report based on the provisions of Sec. 60.754(a)(4) 
and the resulting site-specific methane generation rate constant (k) 
shall be submitted to the Administrator within 1 year of the first 
calculated emission rate exceeding 50 megagrams per year.
    (d) Each owner or operator of a controlled landfill shall submit a 
closure report to the Administrator within 30 days of waste acceptance 
cessation. The Administrator may request additional information as may 
be necessary to verify that permanent closure has taken place in 
accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 258.60. If a closure report 
has been submitted to the Administrator, no additional wastes may be 
placed into the landfill without filing a notification of modification 
as described under Sec. 60.7(a)(4).
    (e) Each owner or operator of a controlled landfill shall submit an 
equipment removal report to the Administrator 30 days prior to removal 
or cessation of operation of the control equipment.

    (1) The collection devices within the interior and along the 
perimeter areas shall be certified to achieve comprehensive control of 
surface gas emissions by a professional engineer. The following issues 
shall be addressed in the design: depths of refuse, refuse gas 
generation rates and flow characteristics, cover properties, gas system 
expandibility, leachate and condensate management, accessibility, 
compatibility with filling operations, integration with closure end use, 
air intrusion control, corrosion resistance, fill settlement, and 
resistance to the refuse decomposition heat.
    (2) The sufficient density of gas collection devices determined in

contribute less than 1 percent of the total amount of NMOC emissions 
from the landfill. The amount, location, and age of the material shall 
be documented and provided to the Administrator upon request. A separate 
NMOC emissions estimate shall be made for each section proposed for 
exclusion, and the sum of all such sections shall be compared to the 
NMOC emissions estimate for the entire landfill. Emissions from each 
section shall be computed using the following equation:


[[Page 681]]


Q<INF>i = 2 k L<INF>o M<INF>i (e-<SUP>kt</SUP> i) 
    (C<INF>NMOC) (3.6 x 10<SUP>-9</SUP>)

where,

Q<INF>i = NMOC emission rate from the i<SUP>th</SUP> section, 
megagrams per year
k = methane generation rate constant, year<SUP>-1</SUP>
L<INF>o = methane generation potential, cubic meters per megagram 
solid waste
M<INF>i = mass of the degradable solid waste in the i<SUP>th</SUP> 
section, megagram
t<INF>i = age of the solid waste in the i<SUP>th</SUP> section, 
years
C<INF>NMOC = concentration of nonmethane organic compounds, parts 
per million by volume
3.6x10<SUP>-9</SUP> = conversion factor

    (iii) The values for k and C<INF>NMOC determined in field 
testing shall be used if field testing has been performed in determining 
the NMOC emission rate or the radii of influence (this distance from the 
well center to a point in the landfill where the pressure gradient 
applied by the blower or compressor approaches zero). If field testing 
has not been performed, the default values for k, L<INF>O and 
C<INF>NMOC provided in Sec. 60.754(a)(1) or the alternative 
values from Sec. 60.754(a)(5) shall be used. The mass of nondegradable 
solid waste contained within the given section may be subtracted from 
the total mass of the section when estimating emissions provided the 
nature, location, age, and amount of the nondegradable material is 
documented as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.
    (b) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with Sec. 
60.752(b)(2)(i)(A) shall construct the gas collection devices using the 
following equipment or procedures:
    (1) The landfill gas extraction components shall be constructed of 
polyvinyl chloride (PVC), high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe, 
fiberglass, stainless steel, or other nonporous corrosion resistant 
material of suitable dimensions to: convey projected amounts of gases; 
withstand installation, static, and settlement forces; and withstand 
planned overburden or traffic loads. The collection system shall extend 
as necessary to comply with emission and migration standards. Collection 
devices such as wells and horizontal collectors shall be perforated to 
allow gas entry without head loss sufficient to impair performance 
across the intended extent of control. Perforations shall be situated 
with regard to the need to prevent excessive air infiltration.
    (2) Vertical wells shall be placed so as not to endanger underlying 
liners and shall address the occurrence of water within the landfill. 
Holes and trenches constructed for piped wells and horizontal collectors 
shall be of sufficient cross-section so as to allow for their proper 
construction and completion including, for example, centering of pipes 
and placement of gravel backfill. Collection devices shall be designed 
so as not to allow indirect short circuiting of air into the cover or 
refuse into the collection system or gas into the air. Any gravel used 
around pipe perforations should be of a dimension so as not to penetrate 
or block perforations.
    (3) Collection devices may be connected to the collection header 
pipes below or above the landfill surface. The connector assembly shall 
include a positive closing throttle valve, any necessary seals and 
couplings, access couplings and at least one sampling port. The 
collection devices shall be constructed of PVC, HDPE, fiberglass, 
stainless steel, or other nonporous material of suitable thickness.
    (c) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with Sec. 
60.752(b)(2)(i)(A) shall convey the landfill gas to a control system in 
compliance with Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(iii) through the collection header 
pipe(s). The gas mover equipment shall be sized to handle the maximum 
gas generation flow rate expected over the intended use period of the 
gas moving equipment using the following procedures:
    (1) For existing collection systems, the flow data shall be used to 
project the maximum flow rate. If no flow data exists, the procedures in 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall be used.
    (2) For new collection systems, the maximum flow rate shall be in 
accordance with Sec. 60.755(a)(1).

    Subpart AAAA_Standards of Performance for Small Municipal Waste 

 Combustion Units for Which Construction is Commenced After August 30, 
1999 or for Which Modification or Reconstruction is Commenced After June 
                                 6, 2001

    Source: 65 FR 76355, Dec. 6, 2000, unless otherwise noted.

                              Introduction


<R05>
Sec. 60.1000  What does this subpart do?

    This subpart establishes new source performance standards for new 
small municipal waste combustion units.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1005  When does this subpart become effective?

    This subpart takes effect June 6, 2001. Some of the requirements in 
this subpart apply to municipal waste combustion unit planning and must 
be completed before construction is commenced on the municipal waste 
combustion unit. In particular, the preconstruction requirements in 
Sec. Sec. 60.1050 through 60.1150 must be completed prior to commencing 
construction. Other requirements (such as the emission limits) apply 
when the municipal waste combustion unit begins operation.

                              Applicability


<R05>
Sec. 60.1010  Does this subpart apply to my municipal waste

combustion unit?

    Yes, if your municipal waste combustion unit meets two criteria:
    (a) Your municipal waste combustion unit is a new municipal waste 
combustion unit.
    (b) Your municipal waste combustion unit has the capacity to combust 
at least 35 tons per day but no more than 250 tons per day of municipal 
solid waste or refuse-derived fuel.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1015  What is a new municipal waste combustion unit?

    (a) A new municipal waste combustion unit is a municipal waste 
combustion unit that meets either of two criteria:
    (1) Commenced construction after August 30, 1999.
    (2) Commenced reconstruction or modification after June 6, 2001.
    (b) This subpart does not apply to your municipal waste combustion 
unit if you make physical or operational changes to an existing 
municipal waste combustion unit primarily to comply with the emission 
guidelines in subpart BBBB of this part. Such changes do not qualify as 
reconstruction or modification under this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1020  Does this subpart allow any exemptions?

    (a) Small municipal waste combustion units that combust less than 11 
tons per day. You are exempt from this subpart if you meet four 
requirements:
    (1) Your municipal waste combustion unit is subject to a federally

operator at the municipal waste combustion unit may fulfill the 
certified operator requirement. Depending on the length of time that a 
certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor are 
away, you must meet one of three criteria:
    (a) When the certified chief facility operator and certified shift 
supervisor are both offsite for 12 hours or less, and no other certified 
operator is onsite, the provisionally certified control room operator 
may perform those duties without notice to, or approval by, the 
Administrator.
    (b) When the certified chief facility operator and certified shift 
supervisor are offsite for more than 12 hours, but for 2 weeks or less, 
and no other certified operator is onsite, the provisionally certified 
control room operator may perform those duties without notice to, or 
approval by, the Administrator. However, you must record the period when 
the certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor are 
offsite and include that information in the annual report as specified 
under Sec. 60.1410(l).
    (c) When the certified chief facility operator and certified shift 
supervisor are offsite for more than 2 weeks, and no other certified 
operator is onsite, the provisionally certified control room operator 
may perform those duties without notice to, or approval by, the 
Administrator. However, you must take two actions:
    (1) Notify the Administrator in writing. In the notice, state what 
caused the absence and what you are doing to ensure that a certified 
chief facility operator or certified shift supervisor is onsite.
    (2) Submit a status report and corrective action summary to the 
Administrator every 4 weeks following the initial notification. If the 
Administrator notifies you that your status report or corrective action 
summary is disapproved, the municipal waste combustion unit may continue 
operation for 90 days, but then must cease operation. If corrective 
actions are taken in the 90-day period such that the Administrator 
withdraws the disapproval, municipal waste combustion unit operation may 
continue.

            Good Combustion Practices: Operating Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 60.1200  What are the operating practice requirements for my

municipal waste combustion unit?

    (a) You must not operate your municipal waste combustion unit at 
loads greater than 110 percent of the maximum demonstrated load of the 
municipal waste combustion unit (4-hour block average), as specified 
under ``Definitions'' (Sec. 60.1465).
    (b) You must not operate your municipal waste combustion unit so 
that the temperature at the inlet of the particulate matter control 
device exceeds 17[deg]C above the maximum demonstrated temperature of 
the particulate matter control device (4-hour block average), as 
specified under ``Definitions'' (Sec. 60.1465).
    (c) If your municipal waste combustion unit uses activated carbon to 
control dioxins/furans or mercury emissions, you must maintain an 8-hour 
block average carbon feed rate at or above the highest average level 
established during the most recent dioxins/furans or mercury test.
    (d) If your municipal waste combustion unit uses activated carbon to 
control dioxins/furans or mercury emissions, you must evaluate total 
carbon usage for each calendar quarter. The total amount of carbon 
purchased and

[[Page 691]]

delivered to your municipal waste combustion plant must be at or above 
the required quarterly usage of carbon. At your option, you may choose 
to evaluate required quarterly carbon usage on a municipal waste 
combustion unit basis for each individual municipal waste combustion 
unit at your plant. Calculate the required quarterly usage of carbon 
using equation 4 or 5 in Sec. 60.1460(f).
    (e) Your municipal waste combustion unit is exempt from limits on 
load level, temperature at the inlet of the particulate matter control 
device, and carbon feed rate during any of five situations:
    (1) During your annual tests for dioxins/furans.
    (2) During your annual mercury tests (for carbon feed rate 
requirements only).
    (3) During the 2 weeks preceding your annual tests for dioxins/
furans.
    (4) During the 2 weeks preceding your annual mercury tests (for 
carbon feed rate requirements only).
    (5) Whenever the Administrator or delegated State authority permits 
you to do any of five activities:
    (i) Evaluate system performance.
    (ii) Test new technology or control technologies.
    (iii) Perform diagnostic testing.
    (iv) Perform other activities to improve the performance of your 
municipal waste combustion unit.
    (v) Perform other activities to advance the state of the art for 
emission controls for your municipal waste combustion unit.

<R05>
Sec. 60.1215  What emission limits must I meet? By when?

    You must meet the emission limits specified in Tables 1 and 2 of 
this subpart. You must meet the limits 60 days after your municipal 
waste combustion unit reaches the maximum load level but no later than 
180 days after its initial startup.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1220  What happens to the emission limits during periods 

of startup, shutdown, and malfunction?

    (a) The emission limits of this subpart apply at all times except 
during periods of municipal waste combustion unit startup, shutdown, or

and all provisions under Sec. 60.11(d) apply.

                     Continuous Emission Monitoring


<R05>
Sec. 60.1225  What types of continuous emission monitoring 

must I perform?

    To continuously monitor emissions, you must perform four tasks:

[[Page 692]]

    (a) Install continuous emission monitoring systems for certain 
gaseous pollutants.
    (b) Make sure your continuous emission monitoring systems are 
operating correctly.
    (c) Make sure you obtain the minimum amount of monitoring data.
    (d) Install a continuous opacity monitoring system.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1230  What continuous emission monitoring systems must

I install for gaseous pollutants?

    (a) You must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate continuous 
emission monitoring systems for oxygen (or carbon dioxide), sulfur 
dioxide, and carbon monoxide. If you operate a Class I municipal waste 
combustion unit, you must also install, calibrate, maintain, and operate 
a continuous emission monitoring system for nitrogen oxides. Install the 
continuous emission monitoring systems for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen 
oxides, and oxygen (or carbon dioxide) at the outlet of the air 
pollution control device.
    (b) You must install, evaluate, and operate each continuous emission 
monitoring system according to the ``Monitoring Requirements'' in Sec. 
60.13.
    (c) You must monitor the oxygen (or carbon dioxide) concentration at 
each location where you monitor sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide. 
Additionally, if you operate a Class I municipal waste combustion unit, 
you must also monitor the oxygen (or carbon dioxide) concentration at 
the location where you monitor nitrogen oxides.
    (d) You may choose to monitor carbon dioxide instead of oxygen as a 
diluent gas. If you choose to monitor carbon dioxide, then an oxygen 
monitor is not required, and you must follow the requirements in Sec. 
60.1255.
    (e) If you choose to demonstrate compliance by monitoring the 
percent reduction of sulfur dioxide, you must also install continuous 
emission monitoring systems for sulfur dioxide and oxygen (or carbon 
dioxide) at the inlet of the air pollution control device.
    (f) If you prefer to use an alternative sulfur dioxide monitoring 
method, such as parametric monitoring, or cannot monitor emissions at 
the inlet of the air pollution control device to determine percent 
reduction, you can apply to the Administrator for approval to use an 
alternative monitoring method under Sec. 60.13(i).


<R05>
Sec. 60.1235  How are the data from the continuous emission 

monitoring systems used?

    You must use data from the continuous emission monitoring systems 
for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide to demonstrate 
continuous compliance with the emission limits specified in Tables 1 and 
2 of this subpart. To demonstrate compliance for dioxins/furans, 
cadmium, lead, mercury, particulate matter, opacity, hydrogen chloride, 
and fugitive ash, see Sec. 60.1290.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1240  How do I make sure my continuous emission monitoring

systems are operating correctly?

    (a) Conduct initial, daily, quarterly, and annual evaluations of 
your continuous emission monitoring systems that measure oxygen (or 
carbon dioxide), sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides (Class I municipal 
waste combustion units only), and carbon monoxide.
    (b) Complete your initial evaluation of the continuous emission 
monitoring systems within 60 days after your municipal waste combustion 
unit reaches the maximum load level at which it will operate, but no 
later than 180 days after its initial startup.
    (c) For initial and annual evaluations, collect data concurrently 
(or within 30 to 60 minutes) using your oxygen (or carbon dioxide) 
continuous emission monitoring system, your sulfur dioxide, nitrogen 
oxides, or carbon monoxide continuous emission monitoring systems, as 
appropriate, and the appropriate test methods specified in Table 3 of 
this subpart. Collect the data during each initial and annual evaluation 
of your continuous emission monitoring systems following the applicable 
performance specifications in appendix B of this part. Table 4 of this 
subpart shows the performance specifications that apply to each 
continuous emission monitoring system.
    (d) Follow the quality assurance procedures in Procedure 1 of 
appendix F of this part for each continuous emission

[[Page 693]]

monitoring system. The procedures include daily calibration drift and 
quarterly accuracy determinations.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1245  Am I exempt from any appendix B or appendix F 

requirements to evaluate continuous emission monitoring systems?

    Yes, the accuracy tests for your sulfur dioxide continuous emission 
monitoring system require you to also evaluate your oxygen (or carbon 
dioxide) continuous emission monitoring system. Therefore, your oxygen 
(or carbon dioxide) continuous emission monitoring system is exempt from 
two requirements:
    (a) Section 2.3 of Performance Specification 3 in appendix B of this 
part (relative accuracy requirement).
    (b) Section 5.1.1 of appendix F of this part (relative accuracy test 
audit).


<R05>
Sec. 60.1250  What is my schedule for evaluating continuous emission

monitoring systems?

    (a) Conduct annual evaluations of your continuous emission 
monitoring systems no more than 13 months after the previous evaluation 
was conducted.
    (b) Evaluate your continuous emission monitoring systems daily and 
quarterly as specified in appendix F of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1255  What must I do if I choose to monitor carbon dioxide

instead of oxygen as a diluent gas?

    You must establish the relationship between oxygen and carbon 
dioxide during the initial evaluation of your continuous emission 
monitoring systems. You may reestablish the relationship during annual 
evaluations. To establish the relationship use three procedures:
    (a) Use EPA Reference Method 3A or 3B in appendix A of this part to 
determine oxygen concentration at the location of your carbon dioxide 
monitor.
    (b) Conduct at least three test runs for oxygen. Make sure each test 
run represents a 1-hour average and that sampling continues for at least 
30 minutes in each hour.
    (c) Use the fuel-factor equation in EPA Reference Method 3B in 
appendix A of this part to determine the relationship between oxygen and 
carbon dioxide.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1260  What is the minimum amount of monitoring data I must 

collect with my continuous emission monitoring systems and is the 
data collection 
          requirement enforceable?

    (a) Where continuous emission monitoring systems are required, 
obtain 1-hour arithmetic averages. Make sure the averages for sulfur 
dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide are in parts per million 
by dry volume at 7 percent oxygen (or the equivalent carbon dioxide 
level). Use the 1-hour averages of oxygen (or carbon dioxide) data from 
your continuous emission monitoring system to determine the actual 
oxygen (or carbon dioxide) level and to calculate emissions at 7 percent 
oxygen (or the equivalent carbon dioxide level).
    (b) Obtain at least two data points per hour in order to calculate a 
valid 1-hour arithmetic average. Section 60.13(e)(2) requires your 
continuous emission monitoring systems to complete at least one cycle of 
operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each 15-minute 
period.
    (c) Obtain valid 1-hour averages for 75 percent of the operating 
hours per day for 90 percent of the operating days per calendar quarter. 
An operating day is any day the unit combusts any municipal solid waste 
or refuse-derived fuel.
    (d) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) 
through (c) of this section, you are in violation of the data collection 
requirement regardless of the emission level monitored, and you must 
notify the Administrator according to Sec. 60.1410(e).
    (e) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) 
through (c) of this section, you must still use all valid data from the 
continuous emission monitoring systems in calculating emission 
concentrations and percent reductions in accordance with Sec. 60.1265.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1265  How do I convert my 1-hour arithmetic averages into the

appropriate averaging times and units?

    (a) Use the equation in Sec. 60.1460(a) to calculate emissions at 7 
percent oxygen.
    (b) Use EPA Reference Method 19 in appendix A of this part, section 
4.3, to calculate the daily geometric average

[[Page 694]]

concentrations of sulfur dioxide emissions. If you are monitoring the 
percent reduction of sulfur dioxide, use EPA Reference Method 19 in 
appendix A of this part, section 5.4, to determine the daily geometric 
average percent reduction of potential sulfur dioxide emissions.
    (c) If you operate a Class I municipal waste combustion unit, use 
EPA Reference Method 19 in appendix A of this part, section 4.1, to 
calculate the daily arithmetic average for concentrations of nitrogen 
oxides.
    (d) Use EPA Reference Method 19 in appendix A of this part, section 
4.1, to calculate the 4-hour or 24-hour daily block averages (as 
applicable) for concentrations of carbon monoxide.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1270  What is required for my continuous opacity monitoring

system and how are the data used?

    (a) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous opacity 
monitoring system.
    (b) Install, evaluate, and operate each continuous opacity 
monitoring system according to Sec. 60.13.
    (c) Complete an initial evaluation of your continuous opacity 
monitoring system according to Performance Specification 1 in appendix B 
of this part. Complete the evaluation within 60 days after your 
municipal waste combustion unit reaches the maximum load level at which 
it will operate, but no more than 180 days after its initial startup.
    (d) Complete each annual evaluation of your continuous opacity 
monitoring system no more than 13 months after the previous evaluation.
    (e) Use tests conducted according to EPA Reference Method 9 in 
appendix A of this part, as specified in Sec. 60.1300, to determine 
compliance with the opacity limit in Table 1 of this subpart. The data 
obtained from your continuous opacity monitoring system are not used to 
determine compliance with the opacity limit.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1275  What additional requirements must I meet for the 

operation of my continuous emission monitoring systems and 
continuous opacity monitoring system?

    Use the required span values and applicable performance 
specifications in Table 4 of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1280  What must I do if any of my continuous emission

monitoring systems are temporarily unavailable to meet the data 
collection requirements?

    Refer to Table 4 of this subpart. It shows alternate methods for 
collecting data when systems malfunction or when repairs, calibration 
checks, or zero and span checks keep you from collecting the minimum 
amount of data.

                              Stack Testing


<R05>
Sec. 60.1285  What types of stack tests must I conduct?

    Conduct initial and annual stack tests to measure the emission 
levels of dioxins/furans, cadmium, lead, mercury, particulate matter, 
opacity, hydrogen chloride, and fugitive ash.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1290  How are the stack test data used?

    You must use results of stack tests for dioxins/furans, cadmium, 
lead, mercury, particulate matter, opacity, hydrogen chloride, and 
fugitive ash to demonstrate compliance with the emission limits in Table 
1 of this subpart. To demonstrate compliance for carbon monoxide, 
nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide, see Sec. 60.1235.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1295  What schedule must I follow for the stack testing?

    (a) Conduct initial stack tests for the pollutants listed in Sec. 
60.1285 within 60 days after your municipal waste combustion unit 
reaches the maximum load level at which it will operate, but no later 
than 180 days after its initial startup.
    (b) Conduct annual stack tests for the same pollutants after the 
initial stack test. Conduct each annual stack test no later than 13 
months after the previous stack test.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1300  What test methods must I use to stack test?

    (a) Follow Table 5 of this subpart to establish the sampling 
location and to determine pollutant concentrations, number of traverse 
points, individual test methods, and other specific testing requirements 
for the different pollutants.

[[Page 695]]

    (b) Make sure that stack tests for all the pollutants consist of at 
least three test runs, as specified in Sec. 60.8. Use the average of 
the pollutant emission concentrations from the three test runs to 
determine compliance with the emission limits in Table 1 of this 
subpart.
    (c) Obtain an oxygen (or carbon dioxide) measurement at the same 
time as your pollutant measurements to determine diluent gas levels, as 
specified in Sec. 60.1230.
    (d) Use the equations in Sec. 60.1460(a) to calculate emission 
levels at 7 percent oxygen (or an equivalent carbon dioxide basis), the 
percent reduction in potential hydrogen chloride emissions, and the 
reduction efficiency for mercury emissions. See the individual test 
methods in Table 5 of this subpart for other required equations.
    (e) You can apply to the Administrator for approval under Sec. 
60.8(b) to use a reference method with minor changes in methodology, use 
an equivalent method, use an alternative method the results of which the 
Administrator has determined are adequate for demonstrating compliance, 
waive the requirement for a performance test because you have 
demonstrated by other means that you are in compliance, or use a shorter 
sampling time or smaller sampling volume.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1305  May I conduct stack testing less often?

    (a) You may test less often if you own or operate a Class II 
municipal waste combustion unit and if all stack tests for a given 
pollutant over 3 consecutive years show you comply with the emission 
limit. In that case, you are not required to conduct a stack test for 
that pollutant for the next 2 years. However, you must conduct another 
stack test within 36 months of the anniversary date of the third 
consecutive stack test that shows you comply with the emission limit. 
Thereafter, you must perform stack tests every 3rd year but no later 
than 36 months following the previous stack tests. If a stack test shows 
noncompliance with an emission limit, you must conduct annual stack 
tests for that pollutant until all stack tests over 3 consecutive years 
show compliance with the emission limit for that pollutant. The 
provision applies to all pollutants subject to stack testing 
requirements: dioxins/furans, cadmium, lead, mercury, particulate 
matter, opacity, hydrogen chloride, and fugitive ash.
    (b) You can test less often for dioxins/furans emissions if you own 
or operate a municipal waste combustion plant that meets two conditions. 
First, you have multiple municipal waste combustion units onsite that 
are subject to this subpart. Second, all those municipal waste 
combustion units have demonstrated levels of dioxins/furans emissions 
less than or equal to 7 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total 
mass) for 2 consecutive years. In that case, you may choose to conduct 
annual stack tests on only one municipal waste combustion unit per year 
at your plant. The provision only applies to stack testing for dioxins/
furans emissions.
    (1) Conduct the stack test no more than 13 months following a stack 
test on any municipal waste combustion unit subject to this subpart at 
your plant. Each year, test a different municipal waste combustion unit 
subject to this subpart and test all municipal waste combustion units 
subject to this subpart in a sequence that you determine. Once you 
determine a testing sequence, it must not be changed without approval by 
the Administrator.
    (2) If each annual stack test shows levels of dioxins/furans 
emissions less than or equal to 7 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter 
(total mass), you may continue stack tests on only one municipal waste 
combustion unit subject to this subpart per year.
    (3) If any annual stack test indicates levels of dioxins/furans 
emissions greater than 7 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total 
mass), conduct subsequent annual stack tests on all municipal waste 
combustion units subject to this subpart at your plant. You may return 
to testing one municipal waste combustion unit subject to this subpart 
per year if you can demonstrate dioxins/furans emission levels less than 
or equal to 7 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass) for 
all municipal waste combustion units at your plant subject to this 
subpart for 2 consecutive years.

[[Page 696]]


<R05>
Sec. 60.1310  May I deviate from the 13-month testing schedule 

if unforeseen circumstances arise?

    You may not deviate from the 13-month testing schedules specified in 
Sec. Sec. 60.1295(b) and 60.1305(b)(1) unless you apply to the 
Administrator for an alternative schedule, and the Administrator 
approves your request for alternate scheduling prior to the date on 
which you would otherwise have been required to conduct the next stack 
test.

                      Other Monitoring Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 60.1315  Must I meet other requirements for continuous monitoring?

    You must also monitor three operating parameters:
    (a) Load level of each municipal waste combustion unit.
    (b) Temperature of flue gases at the inlet of your particulate 
matter air pollution control device.
    (c) Carbon feed rate if activated carbon is used to control dioxins/
furans or mercury emissions.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1320  How do I monitor the load of my municipal waste

combustion unit?

    (a) If your municipal waste combustion unit generates steam, you 
must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a steam flowmeter or a 
feed water flowmeter and meet five requirements:
    (1) Continuously measure and record the measurements of steam (or 
feed water) in kilograms (or pounds) per hour.
    (2) Calculate your steam (or feed water) flow in 4-hour block 
averages.
    (3) Calculate the steam (or feed water) flow rate using the method 
in ``American Society of Mechanical Engineers Power Test Codes: Test 
Code for Steam Generating Units, Power Test Code 4.1--1964 (R1991),'' 
section 4 (incorporated by reference in Sec. 60.17(h)(2)).
    (4) Design, construct, install, calibrate, and use nozzles or 
orifices for flow rate measurements, using the recommendations in 
``American Society of Mechanical Engineers Interim Supplement 19.5 on 
Instruments and Apparatus: Application, Part II of Fluid Meters,'' 6th 
Edition (1971), chapter 4 (incorporated by reference in Sec. 
60.17(h)(3)).
    (5) Before each dioxins/furans stack test, or at least once a year, 
calibrate all signal conversion elements associated with steam (or feed 
water) flow measurements according to the manufacturer instructions.
    (b) If your municipal waste combustion unit does not generate steam, 
or, if your municipal waste combustion units have shared steam systems 
and steam load cannot be estimated per unit, you must determine, to the 
satisfaction of the Administrator, one or more operating parameters that 
can be used to continuously estimate load level (for example, the feed 
rate of municipal solid waste or refuse-derived fuel). You must 
continuously monitor the selected parameters.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1325  How do I monitor the temperature of flue gases at

the inlet of my particulate matter control device?

    You must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a device to 
continuously measure the temperature of the flue gas stream at the inlet 
of each particulate matter control device.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1330  How do I monitor the injection rate of activated carbon?

    If your municipal waste combustion unit uses activated carbon to 
control dioxins/furans or mercury emissions, you must meet three 
requirements:
    (a) Select a carbon injection system operating parameter that can be 
used to calculate carbon feed rate (for example, screw feeder speed).
    (b) During each dioxins/furans and mercury stack test, determine the 
average carbon feed rate in kilograms (or pounds) per hour. Also, 
determine the average operating parameter level that correlates to the 
carbon feed rate. Establish a relationship between the operating 
parameter and the carbon feed rate in order to calculate the carbon feed 
rate based on the operating parameter level.
    (c) Continuously monitor the selected operating parameter during all 
periods when the municipal waste combustion unit is operating and 
combusting waste, and calculate the 8-hour

[[Page 697]]

block average carbon feed rate in kilograms (or pounds) per hour, based 
on the selected operating parameter. When calculating the 8-hour block 
average, do two things:
    (1) Exclude hours when the municipal waste combustion unit is not 
operating.
    (2) Include hours when the municipal waste combustion unit is 
operating but the carbon feed system is not working correctly.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1335  What is the minimum amount of monitoring data I

must collect with my continuous parameter monitoring systems and 
is the data collection 
          requirement enforceable?

    (a) Where continuous parameter monitoring systems are used, obtain 
1-hour arithmetic averages for three parameters:
    (1) Load level of the municipal waste combustion unit.
    (2) Temperature of the flue gases at the inlet of your particulate 
matter control device.
    (3) Carbon feed rate if activated carbon is used to control dioxins/
furans or mercury emissions.
    (b) Obtain at least two data points per hour in order to calculate a 
valid 1-hour arithmetic average.
    (c) Obtain valid 1-hour averages for at least 75 percent of the 
operating hours per day for 90 percent of the operating days per 
calendar quarter. An operating day is any day the unit combusts any 
municipal solid waste or refuse-derived fuel.
    (d) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) 
through (c) of this section, you are in violation of the data collection 
requirement and you must notify the Administrator according to Sec. 
60.1410(e).

                              Recordkeeping


<R05>
Sec. 60.1340  What records must I keep?

    You must keep five types of records:
    (a) Materials separation plan and siting analysis.
    (b) Operator training and certification.
    (c) Stack tests.
    (d) Continuously monitored pollutants and parameters.
    (e) Carbon feed rate.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1345  Where must I keep my records and for how long?

    (a) Keep all records onsite in paper copy or electronic format 
unless the Administrator approves another format.
    (b) Keep all records on each municipal waste combustion unit for at 
least 5 years.
    (c) Make all records available for submittal to the Administrator,

                                Equations


<R05>
Sec. 60.1460  What equations must I use?

    (a) Concentration correction to 7 percent oxygen. Correct any 
pollutant concentration to 7 percent oxygen using equation 1 of this 
section:

C<INF>7<not-eq> = C<INF>unc * (13.9) * (1/(20.9-
    CO<INF>2)) (Eq.1)

Where:

C<INF>7<not-eq> = concentration corrected to 7 percent oxygen.
C<INF>unc = uncorrected pollutant concentration.
CO<INF>2 = concentration of oxygen (percent).

    (b) Percent reduction in potential mercury emissions. Calculate the 
percent reduction in potential mercury emissions (%P<INF>Hg) using 
equation 2 of this section:


[[Page 705]]


%P<INF>Hg = (E<INF>i-<INF>o) * (100/E<INF>i) 
    (Eq. 2)

Where:

%P<INF>Hg = percent reduction of potential mercury emissions
E<INF>i = mercury emission concentration as measured at the air 
pollution control device inlet, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, dry basis
E<INF>o = mercury emission concentration as measured at the air 
pollution control device outlet, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, dry 
basis

    (c) Percent reduction in potential hydrogen chloride emissions. 
Calculate the percent reduction in potential hydrogen chloride emissions 
(%P<INF>HC1) using equation 3 of this section:

%P<INF>HC1 = (E<INF>i - E<INF>o) * (100/E<INF>i) 
    (Eq. 3)

Where:

%P<INF>HC1 = percent reduction of the potential hydrogen chloride 
emissions
E<INF>I = hydrogen chloride emission concentration as measured at 
the air pollution control device inlet, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, 
dry basis
E<INF>O = hydrogen chloride emission concentration as measured at 
the air pollution control device outlet, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, 
dry basis

    (d) Capacity of a municipal waste combustion unit. For a municipal 
waste combustion unit that can operate continuously for 24-hour periods, 
calculate the municipal waste combustion unit capacity based on 24 hours 
of operation at the maximum charge rate. To determine the maximum charge 
rate, use one of two methods:
    (1) For municipal waste combustion units with a design based on heat 
input capacity, calculate the maximum charging rate based on the maximum 
heat input capacity and one of two heating values:
    (i) If your municipal waste combustion unit combusts refuse-derived 
fuel, use a heating value of 12,800 kilojoules per kilogram (5,500 
British thermal units per pound).
    (ii) If your municipal waste combustion unit combusts municipal 
solid waste, use a heating value of 10,500 kilojoules per kilogram 
(4,500 British thermal units per pound).
    (2) For municipal waste combustion units with a design not based on 
heat input capacity, use the maximum designed charging rate.
    (e) Capacity of a batch municipal waste combustion unit. Calculate 
the capacity of a batch municipal waste combustion unit as the maximum 
design amount of municipal solid waste they can charge per batch 
multiplied by the maximum number of batches they can process in 24 
hours. Calculate the maximum number of batches by dividing 24 by the 
number of hours needed to process one batch. Retain fractional batches 
in the calculation. For example, if one batch requires 16 hours, the 
municipal waste combustion unit can combust 24/16, or 1.5 batches, in 24 
hours.
    (f) Quarterly carbon usage. If you use activated carbon to comply 
with the dioxins/furans or mercury limits, calculate the required 
quarterly usage of carbon using equation 4 of this section for plant 
basis or equation 5 of this section for unit basis:
    (1) Plant basis.
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06DE00.001
    
Where:

C = required quarterly carbon usage for the plant in kilograms (or 
pounds).
f<INF>i = required carbon feed rate for the municipal waste 
combustion unit in kilograms (or pounds) per hour. That is the average 
carbon feed rate during the most recent mercury or dioxins/furans stack 
tests (whichever has a higher feed rate).
h<INF>i = number of hours the municipal waste combustion unit was 
in operation during the calendar quarter (hours).
n = number of municipal waste combustion units, i, located at your 
plant.

    (2) Unit basis.
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06DE00.002
    
Where:

C = required quarterly carbon usage for the unit in kilograms (or 
pounds).
f = required carbon feed rate for the municipal waste combustion unit in 
kilograms (or pounds) per hour. That is the average carbon feed rate 
during the most recent mercury or dioxins/furans stack tests (whichever 
has a higher feed rate).
h = number of hours the municipal waste combustion unit was in operation 
during the calendar quarter (hours).

  Municipal Waste Combustion Units Constructed on or Before August 30, 
                                  1999

    Source: 65 FR 76384, Dec. 6, 2000, unless otherwise noted.

                              Introduction


<R05>
Sec. 60.1500  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    This subpart establishes emission guidelines and compliance 
schedules for the control of emissions from existing small municipal 
waste combustion units. The pollutants addressed by the emission 
guidelines are listed in Tables 2, 3, 4, and 5 of this subpart. The 
emission guidelines are developed in accordance with sections 111(d) and 
129 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and subpart B of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1505  Am I affected by this subpart?

    (a) If you are the Administrator of an air quality program in a 
State or United States protectorate with one or more existing small 
municipal waste combustion units that commenced construction on or 
before August 30, 1999, you must submit a State plan to the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that implements the emission 
guidelines contained in this subpart.
    (b) You must submit the State plan to EPA by December 6, 2001.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1510  Is a State plan required for all States?

    No, you are not required to submit a State plan if there are no 
existing small municipal waste combustion units in your State and you 
submit a negative declaration letter in place of the State plan.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1515  What must I include in my State plan?

    (a) Include nine items:
    (1) Inventory of affected municipal waste combustion units, 
including those that have ceased operation but have not been dismantled.
    (2) Inventory of emissions from affected municipal waste combustion 
units in your State.
    (3) Compliance schedules for each affected municipal waste 
combustion unit.
    (4) Good combustion practices and emission limits for affected 
municipal waste ombustion units that are at least as protective as the 
emission guidelines contained in this subpart.
    (5) Stack testing, continuous emission monitoring, recordkeeping, 
and reporting requirements.
    (6) Certification that the hearing on the State plan was held, a 
list of witnesses and their organizational affiliations, if any, 
appearing at the hearing, and a brief written summary of each 
presentation or written submission.
    (7) Provision for State progress reports to EPA.
    (8) Identification of enforceable State mechanisms that you selected 
for implementing the emission guidelines of this subpart.

[[Page 714]]

    (9) Demonstration of your State's legal authority to carry out the 
CAA sections 111(d) and 129 State plan.
    (b) Your State plan can deviate from the format and content of the 
emission guidelines contained in this subpart. However, if your State 
plan does deviate, you must demonstrate that your State plan is as 
protective as the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. Your 
State plan must address regulatory applicability, increments of progress 
for retrofit, operator training and certification, operating practice, 
emission limits, continuous emission monitoring, stack testing, 
recordkeeping, reporting, and air curtain incinerator requirements.
    (c) Follow the requirements of subpart B of this part in your State 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1520  Is there an approval process for my State plan?

    The EPA will review your State plan according to Sec. 60.27.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1525  What if my State plan is not approvable?

    If you do not submit an approvable State plan (or a negative 
declaration letter), EPA will develop a Federal plan, according to Sec. 
60.27 to implement the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. 
Owners and operators of municipal waste combustion units not covered by 
an approved and currently effective State plan must comply with the 
Federal plan. The Federal plan is an interim action and, by its own 
terms, will cease to apply when your State plan is approved and becomes 
effective.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1530  Is there an approval process for a negative

declaration letter?

    No, the EPA has no formal review process for negative declaration 
letters. Once your negative declaration letter has been received, EPA 
will place a copy in the public docket and publish a notice in the 
Federal Register. If, at a later date, an existing small municipal waste 
combustion unit is identified in your State, the Federal plan 
implementing the emission guidelines contained in this subpart will 
automatically apply to that municipal waste combustion unit until your 
State plan is approved.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1535  What compliance schedule must I include in my State plan?

    (a) Your State plan must include compliance schedules that require 
small municipal waste combustion units to achieve final compliance or 
cease operation as expeditiously as practicable but not later than the 
earlier of two dates:
    (1) December 6, 2005.
    (2) Three years after the effective date of State plan approval.
    (b) For compliance schedules longer than 1 year after the effective 
date of State plan approval, State plans must include two items:
    (1) Dates for enforceable increments of progress as specified in 
Sec. 60.1590.
    (2) For Class I units (see definition in Sec. 60.1940), dioxins/
furans stack test results for at least one test conducted during or 
after 1990. The stack tests must have been conducted according to the 
procedures specified under Sec. 60.1790.
    (c) Class I units that commenced construction after June 26, 1987 
must comply with the dioxins/furans and mercury limits specified in 
Tables 2 and 3 of this subpart by the later of two dates:
    (1) One year after the effective date of State plan approval.
    (2) One year following the issuance of a revised construction or 
operation permit, if a permit modification is required.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1540  Are there any State plan requirements for this

subpart that supersede the requirements specified in subpart B?

    Subpart B of this part establishes general requirements for 
developing and processing CAA section 111(d) plans. This subpart applies 
instead of the requirements in subpart B of this part, for two items:
    (a) Option for case-by-case less stringent emission standards and 
longer compliance schedules. State plans developed to implement this 
subpart must be as protective as the emission guidelines contained in 
this subpart. State plans must require all municipal waste combustion 
units to comply no later than December 6, 2005. That requirement applies 
instead of the option for case-by-case less stringent emission standards

[[Page 715]]

and longer compliance schedules in Sec. 60.24(f).
    (b) Increments of progress requirements. For Class II units (see 
definition in Sec. 60.1940), a State plan must include at least two 
increments of progress for the affected municipal waste combustion 
units. The two minimum increments are the final control plan submittal 
date and final compliance date in Sec. 60.21(h)(1) and (5). That 
requirement applies instead of the requirement of Sec. 60.24(e)(1) that 
would require a State plan to include all five increments of progress 
for all municipal waste combustion units. For Class I units under this 
subpart, the final control plan must contain the five increments of 
progress in Sec. 60.24(e)(1).


<R05>
Sec. 60.1545  Does this subpart directly affect municipal waste

combustion unit owners and operators in my State?

    (a) No, this subpart does not directly affect municipal waste 
combustion unit owners and operators in your State. However, municipal 
waste combustion unit owners and operators must comply with the State 
plan you developed to implement the emission guidelines contained in 
this subpart. Some States may incorporate the emission guidelines 
contained in this subpart into their State plans by direct incorporation 
by reference. Others may include the model rule text directly in their 
State plan.
    (b) All municipal waste combustion units must be in compliance with 
the requirements established in this subpart by December 6, 2005, 
whether the municipal waste combustion unit is regulated under a State 
or Federal plan.

                      Applicability of State Plans


<R05>
Sec. 60.1550  What municipal waste combustion units must

I address in my State plan?

    (a) Your State plan must address all existing small municipal waste 
combustion units in your State that meet two criteria:
    (1) The municipal waste combustion unit has the capacity to combust 
at least 35 tons per day of municipal solid waste but no more than 250 
tons per day of municipal solid waste or refuse-derived fuel.
    (2) The municipal waste combustion unit commenced construction on or 
before August 30, 1999.
    (b) If an owner or operator of a municipal waste combustion unit 
makes changes that meet the definition of modification or reconstruction 
after June 6, 2001 for subpart AAAA of this part, the municipal waste 
combustion unit becomes subject to subpart AAAA of this part and the 
State plan no longer applies to that unit.
    (c) If an owner or operator of a municipal waste combustion unit 
makes physical or operational changes to an existing municipal waste 
combustion unit primarily to comply with your State plan, subpart AAAA 
of this part (New Source Performance Standards for New Small Municipal 
Waste Combustion Units) does not apply to that unit. Such changes do not 
constitute modifications or reconstructions under subpart AAAA of this 
part.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1555  Are any small municipal waste combustion units exempt

from my State plan?

    (a) Small municipal waste combustion units that combust less than 11 
tons per day. Units are exempt from your State plan if four requirements 
are met:
    (1) The municipal waste combustion unit is subject to a federally 
enforceable permit limiting the amount of municipal solid waste 
combusted to less than 11 tons per day.
    (2) You are notified by the owner or operator that the unit 
qualifies for the exemption.
    (3) You receive from the owner or operator of the unit a copy of the 
federally enforceable permit.
    (4) The owner or operator of the unit keeps daily records of the 
amount of municipal solid waste combusted.
    (b) Small power production units. Units are exempt from your State 
plan if four requirements are met:

unit qualifies for the exemption.
    (c) Cogeneration units. Units are exempt from your State plan if 
four requirements are met:
    (1) The unit qualifies as a cogeneration facility under section 
3(18)(B) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 796(18)(B)).
    (2) The unit combusts homogeneous waste (excluding refuse-derived 
fuel) to produce electricity and steam or other forms of energy used for 
industrial, commercial, heating, or cooling purposes.
    (3) You are notified by the owner or operator that the unit 
qualifies for the exemption.
    (4) You receive documentation from the owner or operator that the 
unit qualifies for the exemption.
    (d) Municipal waste combustion units that combust only tires. Units 
are exempt from your State plan if three requirements are met:
    (1) The municipal waste combustion unit combusts a single-item waste 
stream of tires and no other municipal waste (the unit can co-fire coal, 
fuel oil, natural gas, or other nonmunicipal solid waste).
    (2) You are notified by the owner or operator that the unit 
qualifies for the exemption.
    (3) You receive documentation from the owner or operator that the 
unit qualifies for the exemption.
    (e) Hazardous waste combustion units. Units are exempt from your 
State plan if the units have received a permit under section 3005 of the 
Solid Waste Disposal Act.
    (f) Materials recovery units. Units are exempt from your State plan 
if the units combust waste mainly to recover metals. Primary and 
secondary smelters may qualify for the exemption.
    (g) Co-fired units. Units are exempt from your State plan if four 
requirements are met:
    (1) The unit has a federally enforceable permit limiting municipal 
solid waste combustion to 30 percent of the total fuel input by weight.
    (2) You are notified by the owner or operator that the unit 
qualifies for the exemption.
    (3) You receive from the owner or operator of the unit a copy of the 
federally enforceable permit.
    (4) The owner or operator records the weights, each quarter, of 
municipal solid waste and of all other fuels combusted.
    (h) Plastics/rubber recycling units. Units are exempt from your 
State plan if four requirements are met:
    (1) The pyrolysis/combustion unit is an integrated part of a 
plastics/rubber recycling unit as defined under ``Definitions'' (Sec. 
60.1940).
    (2) The owner or operator of the unit records the weight, each

    (3) The owner or operator of the unit records the weight, each 
quarter, of feed stocks produced and marketed from chemical plants and 
petroleum refineries.
    (4) The owner or operator of the unit keeps the name and address of 
the purchaser of the feed stocks.
    (i) Units that combust fuels made from products of plastics/rubber 
recycling plants. Units are exempt from your State plan if two 
requirements are met:
    (1) The unit combusts gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, fuel oils, 
residual oil, refinery gas, petroleum coke, liquified petroleum gas, 
propane, or butane produced by chemical plants or petroleum refineries 
that use feed stocks produced by plastics/rubber recycling units.
    (2) The unit does not combust any other municipal solid waste.
    (j) Cement kilns. Cement kilns that combust municipal solid waste 
are exempt from your State plan.
    (k) Air curtain incinerators. If an air curtain incinerator (see 
Sec. 60.1940 for definition) combusts 100 percent yard waste, then 
those units must only meet the requirements under ``Model Rule--Air 
Curtain Incinerators That Burn 100 Percent Yard Waste'' (Sec. Sec. 
60.1910 through 60.1930).

[[Page 717]]


<R05>
Sec. 60.1560  Can an affected municipal waste combustion unit 

reduce its capacity to less than 35 tons per day rather than 
comply with my State plan?

    (a) Yes, an owner or operator of an affected municipal waste 
combustion unit may choose to reduce, by your final compliance date, the 
maximum combustion capacity of the unit to less than 35 tons per day of 
municipal solid waste rather than comply with your State plan. They must 
submit a final control plan and the notifications of achievement of 
increments of progress as specified in Sec. 60.1610.
    (b) The final control plan must, at a minimum, include two items:
    (1) A description of the physical changes that will be made to 
accomplish the reduction.
    (2) Calculations of the current maximum combustion capacity and the 
planned maximum combustion capacity after the reduction. Use the 
equations specified under Sec. 60.1935(d) and (e) to calculate the 
combustion capacity of a municipal waste combustion unit.
    (c) A permit restriction or a change in the method of operation does 
not qualify as a reduction in capacity. Use the equations specified 
under Sec. 60.1935(d) and (e) to calculate the combustion capacity of a 
municipal waste combustion unit.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1565  What subcategories of small municipal waste

combustion units must I include in my State plan?

    This subpart specifies different requirements for different 
subcategories of municipal waste combustion units. You must use those 
same two subcategories in your State plan. Those two subcategories are 
based on the aggregate capacity of the municipal waste combustion plant 
as follows:
    (a) Class I units. Class I units are small municipal waste 
combustion units that are located at municipal waste combustion plants 
with an aggregate plant combustion capacity greater than 250 tons per 
day of municipal solid waste. (See the definition of ``municipal waste 
combustion plant capacity'' in Sec. 60.1940 for specification of which 
units at a plant are included in the aggregate capacity calculation.)
    (b) Class II units. Class II units are small municipal waste 
combustion units that are located at municipal waste combustion plants 
with an aggregate plant combustion capacity less than or equal to 250 
tons per day of municipal solid waste. (See the definition of 
``municipal waste combustion plant capacity'' in Sec. 60.1940 for 
specification of which units at a plant are included in the aggregate 
capacity calculation.)

                            Use of Model Rule


<R05>
Sec. 60.1570  What is the ``model rule'' in this subpart?

    (a) The model rule is the portion of the emission guidelines 
(Sec. Sec. 60.1585 through 60.1905) that addresses the regulatory 
requirements applicable to small municipal waste combustion units. The 
model rule provides the requirements in a regulation format.
    (b) In the model rule, ``you'' means the owner or operator of a 
small municipal waste combustion unit.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1575  How does the model rule relate to the required 

elements of my State plan?

    The model rule may be used to satisfy the State plan requirements 
specified in Sec. 60.1515(a)(4) and (5). Alternative language may be 
used in your State plan, but only if you can demonstrate that the 
alternative language is as protective as the model rule.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1580  What are the principal components of the model rule?

    The model rule contains five major components:
    (a) Increments of progress toward compliance.
    (b) Good combustion practices:
    (1) Operator training.
    (2) Operator certification.
    (3) Operating requirements.
    (c) Emission limits.
    (d) Monitoring and stack testing.
    (e) Recordkeeping and reporting.

modification is required, you must meet five increments of progress:
    (1) Submit a final control plan.
    (2) Submit a notification of retrofit contract award.
    (3) Initiate onsite construction.
    (4) Complete onsite construction.
    (5) Achieve final compliance.
    (b) Class II units. If you plan to achieve compliance more than 1 
year following the effective date of State plan approval and a permit 
modification is not required, or more than 1 year following the date of 
issuance of a revised construction or operation permit if a permit 
modification is required, you must meet two increments of progress:
    (1) Submit a final control plan.
    (2) Achieve final compliance.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1590  When must I complete each increment of progress?

    Table 1 of this subpart specifies compliance dates for each of the 
increments of progress for Class I and II units. (See Sec. 60.1940 for 
definitions of classes.)


<R05>
Sec. 60.1595  What must I include in the notifications of achievement 

of my increments of progress?

    Your notification of achievement of increments of progress must 
include three items:
    (a) Notification that the increment of progress has been achieved.
    (b) Any items required to be submitted with the increment of 
progress (Sec. Sec. 60.1610 through 60.1630).
    (c) The notification must be signed by the owner or operator of the 
municipal waste combustion unit.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1600  When must I submit the notifications of achievement 

of increments of progress?

postmarked no later than 10 days after the compliance date for the 
increment.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1605  What if I do not meet an increment of progress?

    If you fail to meet an increment of progress, you must submit a 
notification to the Administrator postmarked within 10 business days 
after the specified date in Table 1 of this subpart for achieving that 
increment of progress. The notification must inform the Administrator 
that you did not meet the increment. You must include in the 
notification an explanation of why the increment of progress was not met 
and your plan for meeting the increment as expeditiously as possible. 
You must continue to submit reports each subsequent month until the 
increment of progress is met.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1610  How do I comply with the increment of progress for 

submittal of a control plan?

    For your control plan increment of progress, you must complete two 
items:
    (a) Submit the final control plan, including a description of the 
devices for air pollution control and process changes that you will use 
to comply with the emission limits and other requirements of this 
subpart.
    (b) You must maintain an onsite copy of the final control plan.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1615  How do I comply with the increment of progress for

awarding contracts?

    You must submit a signed copy of the contracts awarded to initiate 
onsite construction, initiate onsite installation of emission control 
equipment, and incorporate process changes. Submit the copy of the 
contracts with the notification that the increment of progress has been 
achieved. You do not need to include documents incorporated by reference 
or the attachments to the contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1620  How do I comply with the increment of progress for 

initiating onsite construction?

    You must initiate onsite construction and installation of emission 
control equipment and initiate the process changes outlined in the final

achieving final compliance?

    For the final compliance increment of progress, you must complete 
two items:
    (a) Complete all process changes and complete retrofit construction 
as specified in the final control plan.
    (b) Connect the air pollution control equipment with the municipal 
waste combustion unit identified in the final control plan and complete 
process changes to the municipal waste combustion unit so that if the 
affected municipal waste combustion unit is brought online, all 
necessary process changes and air pollution control equipment are 
operating as designed.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1635  What must I do if I close my municipal waste 

combustion unit and then restart my municipal waste combustion
unit?

    (a) If you close your municipal waste combustion unit but will 
reopen it prior to the final compliance date in your State plan, you 
must meet the increments of progress specified in Sec. 60.1585.
    (b) If you close your municipal waste combustion unit but will 
restart it after your final compliance date, you must complete emission 
control retrofit and meet the emission limits and good combustion 
practices on the date your municipal waste combustion unit restarts 
operation.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1640  What must I do if I plan to permanently close my 

municipal waste combustion unit and not restart it?

    (a) If you plan to close your municipal waste combustion unit rather 
than comply with the State plan, you must submit a closure notification, 
including the date of closure, to the Administrator by the date your 
final control plan is due.
    (b) If the closure date is later than 1 year after the effective 
date of State plan approval, you must enter into a legally binding 
closure agreement with the Administrator by the date your final control 
plan is due. The agreement must specify the date by which operation will 
cease.

        Model Rule--Good Combustion Practices: Operator Training


<R05>
Sec. 60.1645  What types of training must I do?

    There are two types of required training:
    (a) Training of operators of municipal waste combustion units using 
the EPA or a State-approved training course.
    (b) Training of plant personnel using a plant-specific training 
course.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1650  Who must complete the operator training course? By when?

    (a) Three types of employees must complete the EPA or State-approved 
operator training course:
    (1) Chief facility operators.
    (2) Shift supervisors.
    (3) Control room operators.
    (b) Those employees must complete the operator training course by 
the later of three dates:
    (1) One year after the effective date of State plan approval.
    (2) Six months after your municipal waste combustion unit starts up.
    (3) The date before an employee assumes responsibilities that affect 
operation of the municipal waste combustion unit.
    (c) The requirement in paragraph (a) of this section does not apply 
to chief facility operators, shift supervisors, and control room 
operators who have obtained full certification from the American Society 
of Mechanical Engineers on or before the effective date of State plan 
approval.
    (d) You may request that the EPA Administrator waive the requirement 
in paragraph (a) of this section for chief facility operators, shift 
supervisors, and control room operators who have obtained provisional 
certification from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers on or 
before the effective date of State plan approval.

<R05>
Sec. 60.1680  After the required date for operator certification, who 

may operate the municipal waste combustion unit?

    After the required date for full or provisional certification, you 
must not operate your municipal waste combustion unit unless one of four 
employees is on duty:
    (a) A fully certified chief facility operator.
    (b) A provisionally certified chief facility operator who is 
scheduled to take the full certification exam.
    (c) A fully certified shift supervisor.
    (d) A provisionally certified shift supervisor who is scheduled to 
take the full certification exam.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1685  What if all the certified operators must be temporarily 

offsite?

    If the certified chief facility operator and certified shift 
supervisor both are unavailable, a provisionally certified control room 
operator at the municipal waste combustion unit may fulfill the 
certified operator requirement. Depending on the length of time that a 
certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor are 
away, you must meet one of three criteria:
    (a) When the certified chief facility operator and certified shift 
supervisor are both offsite for 12 hours or less and no other certified 
operator is onsite, the provisionally certified control room operator 
may perform those duties without notice to, or approval by, the 
Administrator.
    (b) When the certified chief facility operator and certified shift 
supervisor are offsite for more than 12 hours, but for 2 weeks or less, 
and no other certified operator is onsite, the provisionally certified 
control room operator may perform those duties without notice to, or 
approval by, the Administrator. However, you must record the periods 
when the certified chief facility operator and certified shift 
supervisor are offsite and include the information in the annual report 
as specified under Sec. 60.1885(l).
    (c) When the certified chief facility operator and certified shift 
supervisor are offsite for more than 2 weeks, and no other certified 
operator is onsite, the provisionally certified control room operator 
may perform those duties without notice to, or approval by, the 
Administrator. However, you must take two actions:
    (1) Notify the Administrator in writing. In the notice, state what 
caused the absence and what you are doing to ensure that a certified 
chief facility operator or certified shift supervisor is onsite.
    (2) Submit a status report and corrective action summary to the 
Administrator every 4 weeks following the initial notification. If the 
Administrator notifies you that your status report or corrective action 
summary is disapproved, the municipal waste combustion unit may continue 
operation for 90 days, but then must cease operation. If corrective 
actions are taken in the 90-day period such that the Administrator 
withdraws the disapproval, municipal waste combustion unit operation may 
continue.

see Table 5 of this subpart.
    (b) If your Class I municipal waste combustion unit began 
construction, reconstruction, or modification after June 26, 1987, then 
you must comply with the dioxins/furans and mercury emission limits 
specified in Table 2 of this subpart as applicable by the later of the 
following two dates:
    (1) One year after the effective date of State plan approval.
    (2) One year after the issuance of a revised construction or 
operating permit, if a permit modification is required. Final compliance 
with the dioxins/furans limits must be achieved no later than December 
6, 2005, even if the date 1 year after the issuance of a revised 
construction or operation permit is later than December 6, 2005.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1710  What happens to the emission limits during periods

of startup, shutdown, and malfunction?

    (a) The emission limits of this subpart apply at all times except 
during periods of municipal waste combustion unit startup, shutdown, or

               Model Rule--Continuous Emission Monitoring


<R05>
Sec. 60.1715  What types of continuous emission monitoring

must I perform?

    To continuously monitor emissions, you must perform four tasks:
    (a) Install continuous emission monitoring systems for certain 
gaseous pollutants.
    (b) Make sure your continuous emission monitoring systems are 
operating correctly.
    (c) Make sure you obtain the minimum amount of monitoring data.
    (d) Install a continuous opacity monitoring system.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1720  What continuous emission monitoring systems must 

I install for gaseous pollutants?

    (a) You must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate continuous 
emission monitoring systems for oxygen (or carbon dioxide), sulfur 
dioxide, and carbon monoxide. If you operate a Class I municipal waste 
combustion unit, also install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a 
continuous emission monitoring system for nitrogen oxides. Install the 
continuous emission monitoring systems for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen 
oxides, and oxygen (or carbon dioxide) at the outlet of the air 
pollution control device.
    (b) You must install, evaluate, and operate each continuous emission 
monitoring system according to the ``Monitoring Requirements'' in Sec. 
60.13.
    (c) You must monitor the oxygen (or carbon dioxide) concentration at 
each location where you monitor sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide. 
Additionally, if you operate a Class I municipal waste combustion unit, 
you must also monitor the oxygen (or carbon dioxide) concentration at 
the location where you monitor nitrogen oxides.
    (d) You may choose to monitor carbon dioxide instead of oxygen as a 
diluent gas. If you choose to monitor carbon dioxide, then an oxygen 
monitor is not required and you must follow the requirements in Sec. 
60.1745.
    (e) If you choose to demonstrate compliance by monitoring the 
percent reduction of sulfur dioxide, you must also install continuous 
emission monitoring systems for sulfur dioxide and oxygen (or carbon 
dioxide) at the inlet of the air pollution control device.
    (f) If you prefer to use an alternative sulfur dioxide monitoring 
method, such as parametric monitoring, or cannot monitor emissions at 
the inlet of the

[[Page 724]]

air pollution control device to determine percent reduction, you can 
apply to the Administrator for approval to use an alternative monitoring 
method under Sec. 60.13(i).


<R05>
Sec. 60.1725  How are the data from the continuous emission monitoring 

systems used?

    You must use data from the continuous emission monitoring systems 
for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide to demonstrate 
continuous compliance with the applicable emission limits specified in 
Tables 2, 3, 4, and 5 of this subpart. To demonstrate compliance for 
dioxins/furans, cadmium, lead, mercury, particulate matter, opacity, 
hydrogen chloride, and fugitive ash, see Sec. 60.1780.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1730  How do I make sure my continuous emission monitoring 

systems are operating correctly?

    (a) Conduct initial, daily, quarterly, and annual evaluations of 
your continuous emission monitoring systems that measure oxygen (or 
carbon dioxide), sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides (Class I municipal 
waste combustion units only), and carbon monoxide.
    (b) Complete your initial evaluation of the continuous emission 
monitoring systems within 180 days after your final compliance date.
    (c) For initial and annual evaluations, collect data concurrently 
(or within 30 to 60 minutes) using your oxygen (or carbon dioxide) 
continuous emission monitoring system, your sulfur dioxide, nitrogen 
oxides, or carbon monoxide continuous emission monitoring systems, as 
appropriate, and the appropriate test methods specified in Table 6 of 
this subpart. Collect the data during each initial and annual evaluation 
of your continuous emission monitoring systems following the applicable 
performance specifications in appendix B of this part. Table 7 of this 
subpart shows the performance specifications that apply to each 
continuous emission monitoring system.
    (d) Follow the quality assurance procedures in Procedure 1 of 
appendix F of this part for each continuous emission monitoring system. 
The procedures include daily calibration drift and quarterly accuracy 
determinations.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1735  Am I exempt from any appendix B or appendix F

requirements to evaluate continuous emission monitoring systems?

    Yes, the accuracy tests for your sulfur dioxide continuous emission 
monitoring system require you to also evaluate your oxygen (or carbon 
dioxide) continuous emission monitoring system. Therefore, your oxygen 
(or carbon dioxide) continuous emission monitoring system is exempt from 
two requirements:
    (a) Section 2.3 of Performance Specification 3 in appendix B of this 
part (relative accuracy requirement).
    (b) Section 5.1.1 of appendix F of this part (relative accuracy test 
audit).


<R05>
Sec. 60.1740  What is my schedule for evaluating continuous emission

monitoring systems?

    (a) Conduct annual evaluations of your continuous emission 
monitoring systems no more than 13 months after the previous evaluation 
was conducted.
    (b) Evaluate your continuous emission monitoring systems daily and 
quarterly as specified in appendix F of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1745  What must I do if I choose to monitor carbon dioxide 

instead of oxygen as a diluent gas?

    You must establish the relationship between oxygen and carbon 
dioxide during the initial evaluation of your continuous emission 
monitoring systems. You may reestablish the relationship during annual 
evaluations. To establish the relationship use three procedures:
    (a) Use EPA Reference Method 3A or 3B in appendix A of this part to 
determine oxygen concentration at the location of your carbon dioxide 
monitor.
    (b) Conduct at least three test runs for oxygen. Make sure each test 
run represents a 1-hour average and that sampling continues for at least 
30 minutes in each hour.
    (c) Use the fuel-factor equation in EPA Reference Method 3B in 
appendix A of this part to determine the relationship between oxygen and 
carbon dioxide.

[[Page 725]]


<R05>
Sec. 60.1750  What is the minimum amount of monitoring data I must

collect with my continuous emission monitoring systems and is the 
data collection 
          requirement enforceable?

    (a) Where continuous emission monitoring systems are required, 
obtain 1-hour arithmetic averages. Make sure the averages for sulfur 
dioxide, nitrogen oxides (Class I municipal waste combustion units 
only), and carbon monoxide are in parts per million by dry volume at 7 
percent oxygen (or the equivalent carbon dioxide level). Use the 1-hour 
averages of oxygen (or carbon dioxide) data from your continuous 
emission monitoring system to determine the actual oxygen (or carbon 
dioxide) level and to calculate emissions at 7 percent oxygen (or the 
equivalent carbon dioxide level).
    (b) Obtain at least two data points per hour in order to calculate a 
valid 1-hour arithmetic average. Section 60.13(e)(2) requires your 
continuous emission monitoring systems to complete at least one cycle of 
operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each 15-minute 
period.
    (c) Obtain valid 1-hour averages for 75 percent of the operating 
hours per day for 90 percent of the operating days per calendar quarter. 
An operating day is any day the unit combusts any municipal solid waste 
or refuse-derived fuel.
    (d) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) 
through (c) of this section, you are in violation of the data collection 
requirement regardless of the emission level monitored, and you must 
notify the Administrator according to Sec. 60.1885(e).
    (e) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) 
through (c) of this section, you must still use all valid data from the 
continuous emission monitoring systems in calculating emission 
concentrations and percent reductions in accordance with Sec. 60.1755.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1755  How do I convert my 1-hour arithmetic averages into 

appropriate averaging times and units?

    (a) Use the equation in Sec. 60.1935(a) to calculate emissions at 7 
percent oxygen.
    (b) Use EPA Reference Method 19 in appendix A of this part, section 
4.3, to calculate the daily geometric average concentrations of sulfur 
dioxide emissions. If you are monitoring the percent reduction of sulfur 
dioxide, use EPA Reference Method 19 in appendix A of this part, section 
5.4, to determine the daily geometric average percent reduction of 
potential sulfur dioxide emissions.
    (c) If you operate a Class I municipal waste combustion unit, use 
EPA Reference Method 19 in appendix A of this part, section 4.1, to 
calculate the daily arithmetic average for concentrations of nitrogen 
oxides.
    (d) Use EPA Reference Method 19 in appendix A of this part, section 
4.1, to calculate the 4-hour or 24-hour daily block averages (as 
applicable) for concentrations of carbon monoxide.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1760  What is required for my continuous opacity monitoring 

system and how are the data used?

    (a) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous opacity 
monitoring system.
    (b) Install, evaluate, and operate each continuous opacity 
monitoring system according to Sec. 60.13.
    (c) Complete an initial evaluation of your continuous opacity 
monitoring system according to Performance Specification 1 in appendix B 
of this part. Complete the evaluation by 180 days after your final 
compliance date.
    (d) Complete each annual evaluation of your continuous opacity 
monitoring system no more than 13 months after the previous evaluation.
    (e) Use tests conducted according to EPA Reference Method 9 in 
appendix A of this part, as specified in Sec. 60.1790, to determine 
compliance with the opacity limit in Table 2 or 4 of this subpart. The 
data obtained from your continuous opacity monitoring system are not 
used to determine compliance with the opacity limit.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1765  What additional requirements must I meet for the 

operation of my continuous emission monitoring systems and 
continuous opacity monitoring system?

    Use the required span values and applicable performance 
specifications in Table 8 of this subpart.

[[Page 726]]


<R05>
Sec. 60.1770  What must I do if any of my continuous 

emission monitoring systems are temporarily unavailable to
meet the data collection requirements?

    Refer to Table 8 of this subpart. It shows alternate methods for 
collecting data when systems malfunction or when repairs, calibration 
checks, or zero and span checks keep you from collecting the minimum 
amount of data.

                        Model Rule--Stack Testing


<R05>
Sec. 60.1775  What types of stack tests must I conduct?

    Conduct initial and annual stack tests to measure the emission 
levels of dioxins/furans, cadmium, lead, mercury, particulate matter, 
opacity, hydrogen chloride, and fugitive ash.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1780  How are the stack test data used?

    You must use results of stack tests for dioxins/furans, cadmium, 
lead, mercury, particulate matter, opacity, hydrogen chloride, and 
fugitive ash to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission 
limits in Tables 2 and 4 of this subpart. To demonstrate compliance for 
carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide, see Sec. 60.1725.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1785  What schedule must I follow for the stack testing?

    (a) Conduct initial stack tests for the pollutants listed in Sec. 
60.1775 by 180 days after your final compliance date.
    (b) Conduct annual stack tests for the same pollutants after the 
initial stack test. Conduct each annual stack test no later than 13 
months after the previous stack test.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1790  What test methods must I use to stack test?

    (a) Follow Table 8 of this subpart to establish the sampling 
location and to determine pollutant concentrations, number of traverse 
points, individual test methods, and other specific testing requirements 
for the different pollutants.
    (b) Make sure that stack tests for all the pollutants consist of at 
least three test runs, as specified in Sec. 60.8. Use the average of 
the pollutant emission concentrations from the three test runs to 
determine compliance with the applicable emission limits in Tables 2 and 
4 of this subpart.
    (c) Obtain an oxygen (or carbon dioxide) measurement at the same 
time as your pollutant measurements to determine diluent gas levels, as 
specified in Sec. 60.1720.
    (d) Use the equations in Sec. 60.1935(a) to calculate emission 
levels at 7 percent oxygen (or an equivalent carbon dioxide basis), the 
percent reduction in potential hydrogen chloride emissions, and the 
reduction efficiency for mercury emissions. See the individual test 
methods in Table 6 of this subpart for other required equations.
    (e) You can apply to the Administrator for approval under Sec. 
60.8(b) to use a reference method with minor changes in methodology, use 
an equivalent method, use an alternative method the results of which the 
Administrator has determined are adequate for demonstrating compliance, 
waive the requirement for a performance test because you have 
demonstrated by other means that you are in compliance, or use a shorter 
sampling time or smaller sampling volume.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1795  May I conduct stack testing less often?

    (a) You may test less often if you own or operate a Class II 
municipal waste combustion unit and if all stack tests for a given 
pollutant over 3 consecutive years show you comply with the emission 
limit. In that case, you are not required to conduct a stack test for 
that pollutant for the next 2 years. However, you must conduct another 
stack test within 36 months of the anniversary date of the third 
consecutive stack test that shows you comply with the emission limit. 
Thereafter, you must perform stack tests every 3rd year but no later 
than 36 months following the previous stack tests. If a stack test shows 
noncompliance with an emission limit, you must conduct annual stack 
tests for that pollutant until all stack tests over 3 consecutive years 
show compliance with the emission limit for that pollutant. The 
provision applies to all pollutants subject to stack testing 
requirements: dioxins/furans, cadmium, lead,

[[Page 727]]

mercury, particulate matter, opacity, hydrogen chloride, and fugitive 
ash.
    (b) You can test less often for dioxins/furans emissions if you own 
or operate a municipal waste combustion plant that meets two conditions. 
First, you have multiple municipal waste combustion units onsite that 
are subject to this subpart. Second, all those municipal waste 
combustion units have demonstrated levels of dioxins/furans emissions 
less than or equal to 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total 
mass) for Class I units, or 30 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter 
(total mass) for Class II units, for 2 consecutive years. In that case, 
you may choose to conduct annual stack tests on only one municipal waste 
combustion unit per year at your plant. The provision only applies to 
stack testing for dioxins/furans emissions.
    (1) Conduct the stack test no more than 13 months following a stack 
test on any municipal waste combustion unit subject to this subpart at 
your plant. Each year, test a different municipal waste combustion unit 
subject to this subpart and test all municipal waste combustion units 
subject to this subpart in a sequence that you determine. Once you 
determine a testing sequence, it must not be changed without approval by 
the Administrator.
    (2) If each annual stack test shows levels of dioxins/furans 
emissions less than or equal to 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic 
meter (total mass) for Class I units, or 30 nanograms per dry standard 
cubic meter (total mass) for Class II units, you may continue stack 
tests on only one municipal waste combustion unit subject to this 
subpart per year.
    (3) If any annual stack test indicates levels of dioxins/furans 
emissions greater than 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total 
mass) for Class I units, or 30 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter 
(total mass) for Class II units, conduct subsequent annual stack tests 
on all municipal waste combustion units subject to this subpart at your 
plant. You may return to testing one municipal waste combustion unit 
subject to this subpart per year if you can demonstrate dioxins/furans

test.

                Model Rule--Other Monitoring Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 60.1805  Must I meet other requirements for continuous monitoring?

    You must also monitor three operating parameters:
    (a) Load level of each municipal waste combustion unit.
    (b) Temperature of flue gases at the inlet of your particulate 
matter air pollution control device.
    (c) Carbon feed rate if activated carbon is used to control dioxins/
furans or mercury emissions.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1810  How do I monitor the load of my municipal waste

combustion unit?

    (a) If your municipal waste combustion unit generates steam, you 
must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a steam flowmeter or a 
feed water flowmeter and meet five requirements:
    (1) Continuously measure and record the measurements of steam (or 
feed water) in kilograms (or pounds) per hour.
    (2) Calculate your steam (or feed water) flow in 4-hour block 
averages.
    (3) Calculate the steam (or feed water) flow rate using the method 
in ``American Society of Mechanical Engineers Power Test Codes: Test 
Code for Steam Generating Units, Power Test Code 4.1--1964 (R1991),'' 
section 4 (incorporated by reference in Sec. 60.17(h)(2)).

[[Page 728]]

    (4) Design, construct, install, calibrate, and use nozzles or 
orifices for flow rate measurements, using the recommendations in 
``American Society of Mechanical Engineers Interim Supplement 19.5 on 
Instruments and Apparatus: Application, Part II of Fluid Meters,'' 6th 
Edition (1971), chapter 4 (incorporated by reference in Sec. 
60.17(h)(3)).
    (5) Before each dioxins/furans stack test, or at least once a year, 
calibrate all signal conversion elements associated with steam (or feed 
water) flow measurements according to the manufacturer instructions.
    (b) If your municipal waste combustion units do not generate steam, 
or, if your municipal waste combustion units have shared steam systems 
and steam load cannot be estimated per unit, you must determine, to the 
satisfaction of the Administrator, one or more operating parameters that 
can be used to continuously estimate load level (for example, the feed 
rate of municipal solid waste or refuse-derived fuel). You must 
continuously monitor the selected parameters.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1815  How do I monitor the temperature of flue gases at 

the inlet of my particulate matter control device?

Sec. 60.1820  How do I monitor the injection rate of activated carbon?

    If your municipal waste combustion unit uses activated carbon to 
control dioxins/furans or mercury emissions, you must meet three 
requirements:
    (a) Select a carbon injection system operating parameter that can be 
used to calculate carbon feed rate (for example, screw feeder speed).
    (b) During each dioxins/furans and mercury stack test, determine the 
average carbon feed rate in kilograms (or pounds) per hour. Also, 
determine the average operating parameter level that correlates to the 
carbon feed rate. Establish a relationship between the operating 
parameter and the carbon feed rate in order to calculate the carbon feed 
rate based on the operating parameter level.
    (c) Continuously monitor the selected operating parameter during all 
periods when the municipal waste combustion unit is operating and 
combusting waste and calculate the 8-hour block average carbon feed rate 
in kilograms (or pounds) per hour, based on the selected operating 
parameter. When calculating the 8-hour block average, do two things:
    (1) Exclude hours when the municipal waste combustion unit is not 
operating.
    (2) Include hours when the municipal waste combustion unit is 
operating but the carbon feed system is not working correctly.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1825  What is the minimum amount of monitoring data I must

collect with my continuous parameter monitoring systems and is the
data collection 
          requirement enforceable?

1-hour arithmetic averages for three parameters:
    (1) Load level of the municipal waste combustion unit.
    (2) Temperature of the flue gases at the inlet of your particulate 
matter control device.
    (3) Carbon feed rate if activated carbon is used to control dioxins/
furans or mercury emissions.

valid 1-hour arithmetic average.
    (c) Obtain valid 1-hour averages for at least 75 percent of the 
operating hours per day for 90 percent of the operating days per 
calendar quarter. An operating day is any day the unit combusts any 
municipal solid waste or refuse-derived fuel.
    (d) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) 
through (c) of this section, you are in violation of the data collection 
requirement, and you must notify the Administrator according to Sec. 
60.1885(e).

Sec. 60.1910  What is an air curtain incinerator?

    An air curtain incinerator operates by forcefully projecting a 
curtain of air across an open chamber or open pit in which combustion 
occurs. Incinerators of that type can be constructed above or below 
ground and with or without refractory walls and floor.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1915  What is yard waste?

    Yard waste is grass, grass clippings, bushes, shrubs, and clippings 
from bushes and shrubs. They come from residential, commercial/retail, 
institutional, or industrial sources as part of maintaining yards or 
other private or public lands. Yard waste does not include two items:

[[Page 735]]

    (a) Construction, renovation, and demolition wastes that are exempt 
from the definition of ``municipal solid waste'' in Sec. 60.1940.
    (b) Clean wood that is exempt from the definition of ``municipal 
solid waste'' in Sec. 60.1940.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1920  What are the emission limits for air curtain

incinerators that burn 100 percent yard waste?

    If your air curtain incinerator combusts 100 percent yard waste, you 
must only meet the emission limits in this section.
    (a) By 180 days after your final compliance date, you must meet two 
limits:
    (1) The opacity limit is 10 percent (6-minute average) for air 
curtain incinerators that can combust at least 35 tons per day of 
municipal solid waste and no more than 250 tons per day of municipal 
solid waste.
    (2) The opacity limit is 35 percent (6-minute average) during the 
startup period that is within the first 30 minutes of operation.
    (b) Except during malfunctions, the requirements of this subpart 
apply at all times. Each malfunction must not exceed 3 hours.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1925  How must I monitor opacity for air curtain 

incinerators that burn 100 percent yard waste?

    (a) Use EPA Reference Method 9 in appendix A of this part to 
determine compliance with the opacity limit.
    (b) Conduct an initial test for opacity as specified in Sec. 60.8.
    (c) After the initial test for opacity, conduct annual tests no more 
than 13 calendar months following the date of your previous test.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1930  What are the recordkeeping and reporting requirements 

for air curtain incinerators that burn 100 percent yard waste?

    (a) Provide a notice of construction that includes four items:
    (1) Your intent to construct the air curtain incinerator.
    (2) Your planned initial startup date.
    (3) Types of fuels you plan to combust in your air curtain 
incinerator.
    (4) The capacity of your incinerator, including supporting capacity 
calculations, as specified in Sec. 60.1935(d) and (e).
    (b) Keep records of results of all opacity tests onsite in either 
paper copy or electronic format unless the Administrator approves 
another format.
    (c) Keep all records for each incinerator for at least 5 years.
    (d) Make all records available for submittal to the Administrator or 
for onsite review by an inspector.
    (e) Submit the results (each 6-minute average) of the opacity tests 
by February 1 of the year following the year of the opacity emission 
test.
    (f) Submit reports as a paper copy on or before the applicable 
submittal date. If the Administrator agrees, you may submit reports on 
electronic media.
    (g) If the Administrator agrees, you may change the annual reporting 
dates (see Sec. 60.19(c)).
    (h) Keep a copy of all reports onsite for a period of 5 years.

                                Equations


<R05>
Sec. 60.1935  What equations must I use?

    (a) Concentration correction to 7 percent oxygen. Correct any 
pollutant concentration to 7 percent oxygen using equation 1 of this 
section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06DE00.003

Where:

C<INF>7<not-eq> = concentration corrected to 7 percent oxygen.
C<INF>unc = uncorrected pollutant concentration.
CO<INF>2 = concentration of oxygen (percent).

    (b) Percent reduction in potential mercury emissions. Calculate the 
percent reduction in potential mercury emissions (%P<INF>Hg) using 
equation 2 of this section:

[[Page 736]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06DE00.004

Where:

%P<INF>Hg = percent reduction of potential mercury emissions
E<INF>i = mercury emission concentration as measured at the air 
pollution control device inlet, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, dry basis
E<INF>o = mercury emission concentration as measured at the air 
pollution control device outlet, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, dry 
basis

    (c) Percent reduction in potential hydrogen chloride emissions. 
Calculate the percent reduction in potential hydrogen chloride emissions 
(%P<INF>HC1) using equation 3 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06DE00.005

Where:

%P<INF>HC1 = percent reduction of the potential hydrogen chloride 
emissions
E<INF>i = hydrogen chloride emission concentration as measured at 
the air pollution control device inlet, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, 
dry basis
E<INF>o = hydrogen chloride emission concentration as measured at 
the air pollution control device outlet, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, 
dry basis

    (d) Capacity of a municipal waste combustion unit. For a municipal 
waste combustion unit that can operate continuously for 24-hour periods, 
calculate the municipal waste combustion unit capacity based on 24 hours 
of operation at the maximum charge rate. To determine the maximum charge 
rate, use one of two methods:
    (1) For municipal waste combustion units with a design based on heat 
input capacity, calculate the maximum charging rate based on the maximum 
heat input capacity and one of two heating values:
    (i) If your municipal waste combustion unit combusts refuse-derived 
fuel, use a heating value of 12,800 kilojoules per kilogram (5,500 
British thermal units per pound).
    (ii) If your municipal waste combustion unit combusts municipal 
solid waste, use a heating value of 10,500 kilojoules per kilogram 
(4,500 British thermal units per pound).
    (2) For municipal waste combustion units with a design not based on 
heat input capacity, use the maximum designed charging rate.
    (e) Capacity of a batch municipal waste combustion unit. Calculate 
the capacity of a batch municipal waste combustion unit as the maximum 
design amount of municipal solid waste they can charge per batch 
multiplied by the maximum number of batches they can process in 24 
hours. Calculate the maximum number of batches by dividing 24 by the 
number of hours needed to process one batch. Retain fractional batches 
in the calculation. For example, if one batch requires 16 hours, the 
municipal waste combustion unit can combust 24/16, or 1.5 batches, in 24 
hours.
    (f) Quarterly carbon usage. If you use activated carbon to comply 
with the dioxins/furans or mercury limits, calculate the required 
quarterly usage of carbon using equation 4 of this section for plant 
basis or equation 5 of this section for unit basis:
    (1) Plant basis.
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06DE00.006
    
Where:

C = required quarterly carbon usage for the plant in kilograms (or 
pounds).
f<INF>i = required carbon feed rate for the municipal waste 
combustion unit in kilograms (or pounds) per hour. That is the average 
carbon feed rate during the most recent mercury or dioxins/furans stack 
tests (whichever has a higher feed rate).
h<INF>i = number of hours the municipal waste combustion unit was 
in operation during the calendar quarter (hours).
n = number of municipal waste combustion units, i, located at your 
plant.


[[Page 737]]


    (2) Unit basis.
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06DE00.007
    
Where:

C = required quarterly carbon usage for the unit in kilograms (or 
pounds).
f = required carbon feed rate for the municipal waste combustion unit in 
kilograms (or pounds) per hour. That is the average carbon feed rate 
during the most recent mercury or dioxins/furans stack tests (whichever 
has a higher feed rate).
h = number of hours the municipal waste combustion unit was in operation 
during the calendar quarter (hours).

    November 30, 1999 or for Which Modification or Reconstruction Is 
                   Commenced on or After June 1, 2001

    Source: 65 FR 75350, Dec. 1, 2000, unless otherwise noted.

                              Introduction


<R05>
Sec. 60.2000  What does this subpart do?

    This subpart establishes new source performance standards for 
commercial and industrial solid waste incineration (CISWI) units.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2005  When does this subpart become effective?

    This subpart takes effect on June 1, 2001. Some of the requirements 
in this subpart apply to planning the CISWI unit and must be completed 
even before construction is initiated on the CISWI unit (i.e., the 
preconstruction requirements in Sec. Sec. 60.2045 and 60.2050). Other 
requirements such as the emission limitations and operating limits apply 
after the CISWI unit begins operation.

your request to continue operation of the CISWI unit is disapproved, the 
CISWI unit may continue operation for 90 days, then must cease 
operation. Operation of the unit may resume if you meet the two 
requirements in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (i) A qualified operator is accessible as required under Sec. 
60.2070(a).
    (ii) You notify the Administrator that a qualified operator is 
accessible and that you are resuming operation.

                Emission Limitations and Operating Limits


<R05>
Sec. 60.2105  What emission limitations must I meet and by when?

    You must meet the emission limitations specified in Table 1 of this 
subpart 60 days after your CISWI unit reaches the charge rate at which 
it will operate, but no later than 180 days after its initial startup.

[[Page 752]]


<R05>
Sec. 60.2110  What operating limits must I meet and by when?

    (a) If you use a wet scrubber to comply with the emission 
limitations, you must establish operating limits for four operating 
parameters (as specified in Table 2 of this subpart) as described in 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section during the initial 
performance test.
    (1) Maximum charge rate, calculated using one of the two different 
procedures in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii), as appropriate.
    (i) For continuous and intermittent units, maximum charge rate is 
110 percent of the average charge rate measured during the most recent 
performance test demonstrating compliance with all applicable emission 
limitations.
    (ii) For batch units, maximum charge rate is 110 percent of the 
daily charge rate measured during the most recent performance test 
demonstrating compliance with all applicable emission limitations.
    (2) Minimum pressure drop across the wet scrubber, which is 
calculated as 90 percent of the average pressure drop across the wet 
scrubber measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating 
compliance with the particulate matter emission limitations; or minimum 
amperage to the wet scrubber, which is calculated as 90 percent of the 
average amperage to the wet scrubber measured during the most recent 
performance test demonstrating compliance with the particulate matter 
emission limitations.
    (3) Minimum scrubber liquor flow rate, which is calculated as 90 
percent of the average liquor flow rate at the inlet to the wet scrubber 
measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating 
compliance with all applicable emission limitations.
    (4) Minimum scrubber liquor pH, which is calculated as 90 percent of 
the average liquor pH at the inlet to the wet scrubber measured during 
the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the HCl 
emission limitation.
    (b) You must meet the operating limits established during the 
initial performance test 60 days after your CISWI unit reaches the 
charge rate at which it will operate, but no later than 180 days after 
its initial startup.
    (c) If you use a fabric filter to comply with the emission 
limitations, you must operate each fabric filter system such that the 
bag leak detection system alarm does not sound more than 5 percent of 
the operating time during a 6-month period. In calculating this 
operating time percentage, if inspection of the fabric filter 
demonstrates that no corrective action is required, no alarm time is 
counted. If corrective action is required, each alarm shall be counted 
as a minimum of 1 hour. If you take longer than 1 hour to initiate 
corrective action, the alarm time shall be counted as the actual amount 
of time taken by you to initiate corrective action.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2115  What if I do not use a wet scrubber to comply with 

the emission limitations?

    If you use an air pollution control device other than a wet 
scrubber, or limit emissions in some other manner, to comply with the 
emission limitations under Sec. 60.2105, you must petition the 
Administrator for specific operating limits to be established during the 
initial performance test and continuously monitored thereafter. You must 
not conduct the initial performance test until after the petition has 
been approved by the Administrator. Your petition must include the five 
items listed in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
    (a) Identification of the specific parameters you propose to use as 
additional operating limits.
    (b) A discussion of the relationship between these parameters and 
emissions of regulated pollutants, identifying how emissions of 
regulated pollutants change with changes in these parameters, and how 
limits on these parameters will serve to limit emissions of regulated 
pollutants.
    (c) A discussion of how you will establish the upper and/or lower 
values for these parameters which will establish the operating limits on 
these parameters.
    (d) A discussion identifying the methods you will use to measure and 
the instruments you will use to monitor these parameters, as well as the

[[Page 753]]

relative accuracy and precision of these methods and instruments.
    (e) A discussion identifying the frequency and methods for 
recalibrating the instruments you will use for monitoring these 
parameters.


<R05>

<R05>
Sec. 60.2125  How do I conduct the initial and annual performance test?

    (a) All performance tests must consist of a minimum of three test 
runs conducted under conditions representative of normal operations.
    (b) You must document that the waste burned during the performance 
test is representative of the waste burned under normal operating 
conditions by maintaining a log of the quantity of waste burned (as 
required in Sec. 60.2175(b)(1)) and the types of waste burned during 
the performance test.
    (c) All performance tests must be conducted using the minimum run 
duration specified in Table 1 of this subpart.
    (d) Method 1 of appendix A of this part must be used to select the 
sampling location and number of traverse points.
    (e) Method 3A or 3B of appendix A of this part must be used for gas 
composition analysis, including measurement of oxygen concentration. 
Method 3A or 3B of appendix A of this part must be used simultaneously 
with each method.
    (f) All pollutant concentrations, except for opacity, must be 
adjusted to 7 percent oxygen using Equation 1 of this section:

C<INF>adj = C<INF>meas (20.9-7)/(20.9-%O<INF>2) (Eq. 
    1)

Where:

C<INF>adj = pollutant concentration adjusted to 7 percent oxygen;
C<INF>meas = pollutant concentration measured on a dry basis;
(20.9-7) = 20.9 percent oxygen-7 percent oxygen (defined oxygen 
correction basis);
20.9 = oxygen concentration in air, percent; and
%O<INF>2 = oxygen concentration measured on a dry basis, percent.

    (g) You must determine dioxins/furans toxic equivalency by following 
the procedures in paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of this section.
    (1) Measure the concentration of each dioxin/furan tetra-through 
octachlorinated-congener emitted using EPA Method 23.
    (2) For each dioxin/furan (tetra-through octachlorinated) congener 
measured in accordance with paragraph (g)(1) of this section, multiply 
the congener concentration by its corresponding toxic equivalency factor 
specified in Table 3 of this subpart.
    (3) Sum the products calculated in accordance with paragraph (g)(2) 
of this section to obtain the total concentration of dioxins/furans 
emitted in terms of toxic equivalency.


<R05>

    You use results of performance tests to demonstrate compliance with 
the emission limitations in Table 1 of this subpart.

                     Initial Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 60.2135  How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the

emission limitations and establish the operating limits?

    You must conduct an initial performance test, as required under 
Sec. 60.8, to determine compliance with the emission limitations in 
Table 1 of this subpart and to establish operating limits using the 
procedure in Sec. 60.2110 or Sec. 60.2115. The initial performance 
test must be conducted using the test methods listed in Table 1 of this 
subpart and the procedures in Sec. 60.2125.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2140  By what date must I conduct the initial performance test?

    The initial performance test must be conducted within 60 days after 
your CISWI unit reaches the charge rate at which it will operate, but no 
later than 180 days after its initial startup.

[[Page 754]]

                   Continuous Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 60.2145  How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the

emission limitations and the operating limits?

    (a) You must conduct an annual performance test for particulate 
matter, hydrogen chloride, and opacity for each CISWI unit as required 
under Sec. 60.8 to determine compliance with the emission limitations. 
The annual performance test must be conducted using the test methods 
listed in Table 1 of this subpart and the procedures in Sec. 60.2125.
    (b) You must continuously monitor the operating parameters specified 
in Sec. 60.2110 or established under Sec. 60.2115. Operation above the 
established maximum or below the established minimum operating limits 
constitutes a deviation from the established operating limits. Three-
hour rolling average values are used to determine compliance (except for 
baghouse leak detection system alarms) unless a different averaging 
period is established under Sec. 60.2115. Operating limits do not apply 
during performance tests.
    (c) You must only burn the same types of waste used to establish 
operating limits during the performance test.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2150  By what date must I conduct the annual performance test?

    You must conduct annual performance tests for particulate matter, 
hydrogen chloride, and opacity within 12 months following the initial 
performance test. Conduct subsequent annual performance tests within 12 
months following the previous one.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2155  May I conduct performance testing less often?

    (a) You can test less often for a given pollutant if you have test 
data for at least 3 years, and all performance tests for the pollutant 
(particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, or opacity) over 3 consecutive 
years show that you comply with the emission limitation. In this case, 
you do not have to conduct a performance test for that pollutant for the 
next 2 years. You must conduct a performance test during the 3rd year 
and no more than 36 months following the previous performance test.
    (b) If your CISWI unit continues to meet the emission limitation for 
particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, or opacity, you may choose to 
conduct performance tests for these pollutants every 3rd year, but each 
test must be within 36 months of the previous performance test.
    (c) If a performance test shows a deviation from an emission 
limitation for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, or opacity, you 
must conduct annual performance tests for that pollutant until all 
performance tests over a 3-year period show compliance.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2160  May I conduct a repeat performance test to establish 

new operating limits?

    (a) Yes. You may conduct a repeat performance test at any time to 
establish new values for the operating limits. The Administrator may 
request a repeat performance test at any time.
    (b) You must repeat the performance test if your feed stream is 
different than the feed streams used during any performance test used to 
demonstrate compliance.

                               Monitoring


<R05>
Sec. 60.2165  What monitoring equipment must I install and what

    (a) If you are using a wet scrubber to comply with the emission 
limitation under Sec. 60.2105, you must install, calibrate (to 
manufacturers' specifications), maintain, and operate devices (or 
establish methods) for monitoring the value of the operating parameters 
used to determine compliance with the operating limits listed in Table 2 
of this subpart. These devices (or methods) must measure and record the 
values for these operating parameters at the frequencies indicated in 
Table 2 of this subpart at all times except as specified in Sec. 
60.2170(a).
    (b) If you use a fabric filter to comply with the requirements of 
this subpart, you must install, calibrate, maintain, and continuously 
operate a bag leak detection system as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) 
through (8) of this section.
    (1) You must install and operate a bag leak detection system for 
each exhaust stack of the fabric filter.

[[Page 755]]

    (2) Each bag leak detection system must be installed, operated,

 Subpart DDDD_Emissions Guidelines and Compliance Times for Commercial 
      and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units that Commenced 
               Construction On or Before November 30, 1999

    Source: 65 FR 75362, Dec. 1, 2000, unless otherwise noted.

                              Introduction


<R05>
Sec. 60.2500  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    This subpart establishes emission guidelines and compliance 
schedules for the control of emissions from commercial and industrial 
solid waste incineration (CISWI) units. The pollutants addressed by 
these emission guidelines are listed in Table 2 of this subpart. These 
emission guidelines are developed in accordance with sections 111(d) and 
129 of the Clean Air Act and subpart B of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2505  Am I affected by this subpart?

    (a) If you are the Administrator of an air quality program in a 
State or United States protectorate with one or more existing CISWI 
units that commenced construction on or before November 30, 1999, you 
must submit a State plan to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
that implements the emission guidelines contained in this subpart.
    (b) You must submit the State plan to EPA by December 3, 2001.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2510  Is a State plan required for all States?

    No. You are not required to submit a State plan if there are no 
existing CISWI units in your State, and you submit a negative 
declaration letter in place of the State plan.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2515  What must I include in my State plan?

    (a) You must include the nine items described in paragraphs (a)(1) 
through (9) of this section in your State plan.
    (1) Inventory of affected CISWI units, including those that have 
ceased operation but have not been dismantled.
    (2) Inventory of emissions from affected CISWI units in your State.
    (3) Compliance schedules for each affected CISWI unit.
    (4) Emission limitations, operator training and qualification 
requirements, a waste management plan, and operating limits for affected 
CISWI units that are at least as protective as the emission guidelines 
contained in this subpart.
    (5) Performance testing, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.
    (6) Certification that the hearing on the State plan was held, a 
list of witnesses and their organizational affiliations, if any, 
appearing at the hearing, and a brief written summary of each 
presentation or written submission.
    (7) Provision for State progress reports to EPA.
    (8) Identification of enforceable State mechanisms that you selected 
for implementing the emission guidelines of this subpart.
    (9) Demonstration of your State's legal authority to carry out the 
sections 111(d) and 129 State plan.
    (b) Your State plan may deviate from the format and content of the 
emission guidelines contained in this subpart. However, if your State 
plan does deviate in content, you must demonstrate that your State plan 
is at least as protective as the emission guidelines contained in this 
subpart. Your State plan must address regulatory applicability, 
increments of progress for retrofit, operator training and 
qualification, a waste management plan, emission limitations, 
performance testing, operating limits, monitoring, recordkeeping and 
reporting, and air curtain incinerator requirements.
    (c) You must follow the requirements of subpart B of this part 
(Adoption and Submittal of State Plans for Designated Facilities) in 
your State plan.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2520  Is there an approval process for my State plan?

    Yes. The EPA will review your State plan according to Sec. 60.27.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2525  What if my State plan is not approvable?

    If you do not submit an approvable State plan (or a negative 
declaration

[[Page 766]]

letter) by December 2, 2002, EPA will develop a Federal plan according 
to Sec. 60.27 to implement the emission guidelines contained in this 
subpart. Owners and operators of CISWI units not covered by an approved 
State plan must comply with the Federal plan. The Federal plan is an 
interim action and will be automatically withdrawn when your State plan 
is approved.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2530  Is there an approval process for a negative declaration 

letter?

    No. The EPA has no formal review process for negative declaration 
letters. Once your negative declaration letter has been received, EPA 
will place a copy in the public docket and publish a notice in the 
Federal Register. If, at a later date, an existing CISWI unit is found 
in your State, the Federal plan implementing the emission guidelines 
contained in this subpart would automatically apply to that CISWI unit 
until your State plan is approved.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2535  What compliance schedule must I include in my State plan?

    (a) Your State plan must include compliance schedules that require 
CISWI units to achieve final compliance as expeditiously as practicable 
after approval of the State plan but not later than the earlier of the 
two dates specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
    (1) December 1, 2005.
    (2) Three years after the effective date of State plan approval.
    (b) For compliance schedules more than 1 year following the 
effective date of State plan approval, State plans must include dates 
for enforceable increments of progress as specified in Sec. 60.2580.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2540  Are there any State plan requirements for this subpart 

that apply instead of the requirements specified in subpart B?

    Yes. Subpart B establishes general requirements for developing and 
processing section 111(d) plans. This subpart applies instead of the 
requirements in subpart B of this part for paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section:
    (a) State plans developed to implement this subpart must be as 
protective as the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. State 
plans must require all CISWI units to comply by December 1, 2005 or 3 
years after the effective date of State plan approval, whichever is 
sooner. This applies instead of the option for case-by-case less 
stringent emission standards and longer compliance schedules in Sec. 
60.24(f).
    (b) State plans developed to implement this subpart are required to 
include two increments of progress for the affected CISWI units. These 
two minimum increments are the final control plan submittal date and 
final compliance date in Sec. 60.21(h)(1) and (5). This applies instead 
of the requirement of Sec. 60.24(e)(1) that would require a State plan 
to include all five increments of progress for all CISWI units.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2545  Does this subpart directly affect CISWI unit owners and 

operators in my State?

    (a) No. This subpart does not directly affect CISWI unit owners and 
operators in your State. However, CISWI unit owners and operators must 
comply with the State plan you develop to implement the emission 
guidelines contained in this subpart. States may choose to incorporate 
the model rule text directly in their State plan.
    (b) If you do not submit an approvable plan to implement and enforce 
the guidelines contained in this subpart by December 2, 2002, the EPA 
will implement and enforce a Federal plan, as provided in Sec. 60.2525, 
to ensure that each unit within your State reaches compliance with all

          Model Rule--Emission Limitations and Operating Limits


<R05>
Sec. 60.2670  What emission limitations must I meet and by when?

    You must meet the emission limitations specified in Table 2 of this 
subpart on the date the initial performance test is required or 
completed (whichever is earlier).


<R05>
Sec. 60.2675  What operating limits must I meet and by when?

    (a) If you use a wet scrubber to comply with the emission 
limitations, you must establish operating limits for four operating 
parameters (as specified in Table 3 of this subpart) as described in 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section during the initial 
performance test.
    (1) Maximum charge rate, calculated using one of the two different 
procedures in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii), as appropriate.
    (i) For continuous and intermittent units, maximum charge rate is 
110 percent of the average charge rate measured during the most recent 
performance test demonstrating compliance with all applicable emission 
limitations.
    (ii) For batch units, maximum charge rate is 110 percent of the 
daily charge rate measured during the most recent performance test 
demonstrating compliance with all applicable emission limitations.
    (2) Minimum pressure drop across the wet scrubber, which is 
calculated as 90 percent of the average pressure drop across the wet 
scrubber measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating 
compliance with the particulate matter emission limitations; or minimum 
amperage to the wet scrubber, which is calculated as 90 percent of the 
average amperage to the wet scrubber measured during the most recent 
performance test demonstrating compliance with the particulate matter 
emission limitations.
    (3) Minimum scrubber liquor flow rate, which is calculated as 90 
percent of the average liquor flow rate at the inlet to the wet scrubber 
measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating 
compliance with all applicable emission limitations.
    (4) Minimum scrubber liquor pH, which is calculated as 90 percent of 
the average liquor pH at the inlet to the wet scrubber measured during 
the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the HCl 
emission limitation.
    (b) You must meet the operating limits established during the 
initial performance test on the date the initial performance test is 
required or completed (whichever is earlier).
    (c) If you use a fabric filter to comply with the emission 
limitations, you must operate each fabric filter system such that the 
bag leak detection system alarm does not sound more than 5 percent of 
the operating time during a 6-month period. In calculating this 
operating time percentage, if inspection of the fabric filter 
demonstrates that

[[Page 774]]

no corrective action is required, no alarm time is counted. If 
corrective action is required, each alarm shall be counted as a minimum 
of 1 hour. If you take longer than 1 hour to initiate corrective action, 
the alarm time shall be counted as the actual amount of time taken by 
you to initiate corrective action.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2680  What if I do not use a wet scrubber to comply with 

the emission limitations?

    If you use an air pollution control device other than a wet 
scrubber, or limit emissions in some other manner, to comply with the 
emission limitations under Sec. 60.2670, you must petition the 
Administrator for specific operating limits to be established during the 
initial performance test and continuously monitored thereafter. You must 
not conduct the initial performance test until after the petition has 
been approved by the Administrator. Your petition must include the five 
items listed in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
    (a) Identification of the specific parameters you propose to use as 
additional operating limits.
    (b) A discussion of the relationship between these parameters and 
emissions of regulated pollutants, identifying how emissions of 
regulated pollutants change with changes in these parameters, and how 
limits on these parameters will serve to limit emissions of regulated 
pollutants.
    (c) A discussion of how you will establish the upper and/or lower 
values for these parameters which will establish the operating limits on 
these parameters.
    (d) A discussion identifying the methods you will use to measure and 
the instruments you will use to monitor these parameters, as well as the 
relative accuracy and precision of these methods and instruments.
    (e) A discussion identifying the frequency and methods for 
recalibrating the instruments you will use for monitoring these 
parameters.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2685  What happens during periods of startup, shutdown, 

and malfunction?

    (a) The emission limitations and operating limits apply at all times 
except during CISWI unit startups, shutdowns, or malfunctions.
    (b) Each malfunction must last no longer than 3 hours.

                     Model Rule--Performance Testing


<R05>
Sec. 60.2690  How do I conduct the initial and annual performance test?

    (a) All performance tests must consist of a minimum of three test 
runs conducted under conditions representative of normal operations.
    (b) You must document that the waste burned during the performance 
test is representative of the waste burned under normal operating 
conditions by maintaining a log of the quantity of waste burned (as 
required in Sec. 60.2740(b)(1)) and the types of waste burned during 
the performance test.
    (c) All performance tests must be conducted using the minimum run 
duration specified in Table 2 of this subpart.
    (d) Method 1 of appendix A of this part must be used to select the 
sampling location and number of traverse points.
    (e) Method 3A or 3B of appendix A of this part must be used for gas 
composition analysis, including measurement of oxygen concentration. 
Method 3A or 3B of appendix A of this part must be used simultaneously 
with each method.
    (f) All pollutant concentrations, except for opacity, must be 
adjusted to 7 percent oxygen using Equation 1 of this section:

C<INF>adj = C<INF>meas (20.9-7)/(20.9-%O<INF>2) (Eq. 
    1)

Where:

C<INF>adj = pollutant concentration adjusted to 7 percent oxygen;
C<INF>meas = pollutant concentration measured on a dry basis;
(20.9-7) = 20.9 percent oxygen-7 percent oxygen (defined oxygen 
correction basis);
20.9 = oxygen concentration in air, percent; and
%O<INF>2 = oxygen concentration measured on a dry basis, percent.

    (g) You must determine dioxins/furans toxic equivalency by following

[[Page 775]]

the procedures in paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of this section.
    (1) Measure the concentration of each dioxin/furan tetra- through 
octa-congener emitted using EPA Method 23.
    (2) For each dioxin/furan congener measured in accordance with 
paragraph (g)(1) of this section, multiply the congener concentration by 
its corresponding toxic equivalency factor specified in Table 4 of this 
subpart.
    (3) Sum the products calculated in accordance with paragraph (g)(2) 
of this section to obtain the total concentration of dioxins/furans 
emitted in terms of toxic equivalency.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2695  How are the performance test data used?

    You use results of performance tests to demonstrate compliance with 
the emission limitations in Table 2 of this subpart.

               Model Rule--Initial Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 60.2700  How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the 

emission limitations and establish the operating limits?

    You must conduct an initial performance test, as required under 
Sec. 60.8, to determine compliance with the emission limitations in 
Table 2 of this subpart and to establish operating limits using the 
procedure in Sec. 60.2675 or Sec. 60.2680. The initial performance 
test must be conducted using the test methods listed in Table 2 of this 
subpart and the procedures in Sec. 60.2690.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2705  By what date must I conduct the initial performance test?

    The initial performance test must be conducted no later than 180 
days after your final compliance date. Your final compliance date is 
specified in Table 1 of this subpart.

             Model Rule--Continuous Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 60.2710  How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with 

the emission limitations and the operating limits?

    (a) You must conduct an annual performance test for particulate 
matter, hydrogen chloride, and opacity for each CISWI unit as required 
under Sec. 60.8 to determine compliance with the emission limitations. 
The annual performance test must be conducted using the test methods 
listed in Table 2 of this subpart and the procedures in Sec. 60.2690.
    (b) You must continuously monitor the operating parameters specified 
in Sec. 60.2675 or established under Sec. 60.2680. Operation above the 
established maximum or below the established minimum operating limits 
constitutes a deviation from the established operating limits. Three-
hour rolling average values are used to determine compliance (except for 
baghouse leak detection system alarms) unless a different averaging 
period is established under Sec. 60.2680. Operating limits do not apply 
during performance tests.
    (c) You must only burn the same types of waste used to establish 
operating limits during the performance test.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2715  By what date must I conduct the annual performance test?

    You must conduct annual performance tests for particulate matter, 
hydrogen chloride, and opacity within 12 months following the initial 
performance test. Conduct subsequent annual performance tests within 12 
months following the previous one.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2720  May I conduct performance testing less often?

    (a) You can test less often for a given pollutant if you have test 
data for at least 3 years, and all performance tests for the pollutant 
(particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, or opacity) over 3 consecutive 
years show that you comply with the emission limitation. In this case, 
you do not have to conduct a performance test for that pollutant for the 
next 2 years. You must conduct a performance test during the third year 
and no more than 36 months following the previous performance test.
    (b) If your CISWI unit continues to meet the emission limitation for 
particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, or opacity, you may choose to 
conduct performance tests for these pollutants every third year, but 
each test must be within 36 months of the previous performance test.

[[Page 776]]

    (c) If a performance test shows a deviation from an emission 
limitation for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, or opacity, you 
must conduct annual performance tests for that pollutant until all 
performance tests over a 3-year period show compliance.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2725  May I conduct a repeat performance test to establish

new operating limits?

    (a) Yes. You may conduct a repeat performance test at any time to 
establish new values for the operating limits. The Administrator may 
request a repeat performance test at any time.
    (b) You must repeat the performance test if your feed stream is 
different than the feed streams used during any performance test used to 
demonstrate compliance.

calibrate (to the manufacturers' specifications), maintain, and operate 
the equipment necessary to monitor compliance with the site-specific 
operating limits established using the procedures in Sec. 60.2680.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2735  Is there a minimum amount of monitoring data I must obtain?

    (a) Except for monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, and 
required quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as 
applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments of 
the monitoring system), you must conduct all monitoring at all times the 
CISWI unit is operating.
    (b) Do not use data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, 
associated repairs, and required quality assurance or quality control 
activities for meeting the requirements of this subpart,

Subpart EEEE_Standards of Performance for Other Solid Waste Incineration 

Units for Which Construction is Commenced After December 9, 2004, or for 
 Which Modification or Reconstruction is Commenced on or After June 16, 
                                  2006

    Source: 70 FR 74892, Dec. 16, 2005, unless otherwise noted.

                              Introduction


<R05>
Sec. 60.2880  What does this subpart do?

    This subpart establishes new source performance standards for other 
solid waste incineration (OSWI) units. Other solid waste incineration 
units are very small municipal waste combustion units and institutional 
waste incineration units.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2881  When does this subpart become effective?

    This subpart takes effect June 16, 2006. Some of the requirements in 
this subpart apply to planning the incineration unit and must be 
completed even before construction is initiated on the unit (i.e., the 
preconstruction requirements in Sec. Sec. 60.2894 and 60.2895). Other 
requirements such as the emission limitations and operating limits apply 
when the unit begins operation.

                              Applicability


<R05>
Sec. 60.2885  Does this subpart apply to my incineration unit?

    Yes, if your incineration unit meets all the requirements specified 
in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.
    (a) Your incineration unit is a new incineration unit as defined in 
Sec. 60.2886.
    (b) Your incineration unit is an OSWI unit as defined in Sec. 
60.2977 or an air curtain incinerator subject to this subpart as 
described in Sec. 60.2888(b). Other solid waste incineration units are

initial performance test and then continuously monitored thereafter. You 
must not conduct the initial performance test until after the petition 
has been approved by EPA. Your petition must include the five items 
listed in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
    (a) Identification of the specific parameters you propose to use as 
operating limits.
    (b) A discussion of the relationship between these parameters and 
emissions of regulated pollutants, identifying how emissions of 
regulated pollutants change with changes in these parameters, and how 
limits on these parameters will serve to limit emissions of regulated 
pollutants.
    (c) A discussion of how you will establish the upper and/or lower 
values for these parameters that will establish the operating limits on 
these parameters.
    (d) A discussion identifying the methods you will use to measure and

<R05>
Sec. 60.2923  How are the performance test data used?

    You use results of performance tests to demonstrate compliance with 
the emission limitations in Table 1 of this subpart.

                     Initial Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 60.2927  How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission

limitations and establish the operating limits?

    You must conduct an initial performance test, as required under 
Sec. 60.8, to determine compliance with the emission limitations in 
Table 1 of this subpart and to establish operating limits using the 
procedure in Sec. 60.2916 or Sec. 60.2917. The initial performance 
test must be conducted using the test methods listed in Table 1 of this 
subpart and the procedures in Sec. 60.2922.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2928  By what date must I conduct the initial performance test?

    The initial performance test must be conducted within 60 days after 
your OSWI unit reaches the charge rate at which it will operate, but no 
later than 180 days after its initial startup.

                   Continuous Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 60.2932  How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the 

emission limitations and the operating limits?

    (a) You must conduct an annual performance test for all of the 
pollutants in Table 1 of this subpart for each OSWI unit to determine 
compliance with the emission limitations. The annual performance test 
must be conducted using the test methods listed in Table 1 of this 
subpart and the procedures in 60.2922.
    (b) You must continuously monitor carbon monoxide emissions to 
determine compliance with the carbon monoxide emissions limitation. 
Twelve-hour rolling average values are used to determine compliance. A 
12-hour rolling average value above the carbon monoxide emission limit 
in Table 1 of this subpart constitutes a deviation from the emission 
limitation.
    (c) You must continuously monitor the operating parameters specified 
in Sec. 60.2916 or established under Sec. 60.2917. Three-hour rolling 
average values are used to determine compliance with the operating 
limits unless a different averaging period is established under Sec. 
60.2917. A 3-hour rolling average value (unless a different averaging 
period is established under Sec. 60.2917) above the established maximum 
or below the established minimum operating limits constitutes a 
deviation from the established operating limits. Operating limits do not 
apply during performance tests.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2933  By what date must I conduct the annual performance test?

    You must conduct annual performance tests within 12 months following 
the initial performance test. Conduct subsequent annual performance 
tests within 12 months following the previous one.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2934  May I conduct performance testing less often?

    (a) You can test less often for a given pollutant if you have test 
data for at least three consecutive annual tests,

[[Page 796]]

and all performance tests for the pollutant over that period show that 
you comply with the emission limitation. In this case, you do not have 
to conduct a performance test for that pollutant for the next 2 years. 
You must conduct a performance test during the 3rd year and no more than 
36 months following the previous performance test.
    (b) If your OSWI unit continues to meet the emission limitation for 
the pollutant, you may choose to conduct performance tests for that 
pollutant every 3rd year, but each test must be within 36 months of the 
previous performance test.
    (c) If a performance test shows a deviation from an emission 
limitation for any pollutant, you must conduct annual performance tests 
for that pollutant until three consecutive annual performance tests for 
that pollutant all show compliance.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2935  May I conduct a repeat performance test to establish 

new operating limits?

    Yes, you may conduct a repeat performance test at any time to 
establish new values for the operating limits. The Administrator may 
request a repeat performance test at any time.

                               Monitoring


<R05>
Sec. 60.2939  What continuous emission monitoring systems must I install?

    (a) You must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate continuous 
emission monitoring systems for carbon monoxide and for oxygen. You must 
monitor the oxygen concentration at each location where you monitor 
carbon monoxide.
    (b) You must install, evaluate, and operate each continuous emission 
monitoring system according to the ``Monitoring Requirements'' in Sec. 
60.13.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2940  How do I make sure my continuous emission monitoring 

systems are operating correctly?

    (a) Conduct initial, daily, quarterly, and annual evaluations of 
your continuous emission monitoring systems that measure carbon monoxide 
and oxygen.
    (b) Complete your initial evaluation of the continuous emission 
monitoring systems within 60 days after your OSWI unit reaches the 
maximum load level at which it will operate, but no later than 180 days 
after its initial startup.
    (c) For initial and annual evaluations, collect data concurrently 
(or within 30 to 60 minutes) using your carbon monoxide and oxygen 
continuous emission monitoring systems. To validate carbon monoxide 
concentration levels, use EPA Method 10, 10A, or 10B of appendix A of 
this part. Use EPA Method 3 or 3A to measure oxygen. Collect the data 
during each initial and annual evaluation of your continuous emission 
monitoring systems following the applicable performance specifications 
in appendix B of this part. Table 3 of this subpart shows the required 
span values and performance specifications that apply to each continuous 
emission monitoring system.
    (d) Follow the quality assurance procedures in Procedure 1 of 
appendix F of this part for each continuous emission monitoring system. 
The procedures include daily calibration drift and quarterly accuracy 
determinations.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2941  What is my schedule for evaluating continuous emission

monitoring systems?

    (a) Conduct annual evaluations of your continuous emission 
monitoring systems no more than 12 months after the previous evaluation 
was conducted.
    (b) Evaluate your continuous emission monitoring systems daily and 
quarterly as specified in appendix F of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2942  What is the minimum amount of monitoring data I must

collect with my continuous emission monitoring systems, and is the 
data collection 
          requirement enforceable?

    (a) Where continuous emission monitoring systems are required, 
obtain 1-hour arithmetic averages. Make sure the averages for carbon 
monoxide are in parts per million by dry volume at 7 percent oxygen. Use 
the 1-hour averages of oxygen data from your continuous emission 
monitoring system to determine the actual oxygen level and to calculate 
emissions at 7 percent oxygen.
    (b) Obtain at least two data points per hour in order to calculate a 
valid 1-hour arithmetic average. Section 60.13(e)(2) requires your 
continuous

[[Page 797]]

emission monitoring systems to complete at least one cycle of operation 
(sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each 15-minute period.
    (c) Obtain valid 1-hour averages for at least 75 percent of the 
operating hours per day for at least 90 percent of the operating days 
per calendar quarter. An operating day is any day the unit combusts any 
municipal or institutional solid waste.
    (d) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) 
through (c) of this section, you have deviated from the data collection 
requirement regardless of the emission level monitored.
    (e) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) 
through (c) of this section, you must still use all valid data from the 
continuous emission monitoring systems in calculating emission 
concentrations.
    (f) If continuous emission monitoring systems are temporarily 
unavailable to meet the data collection requirements, refer to Table 3 
of this subpart. It shows alternate methods for collecting data when 
systems malfunction or when repairs, calibration checks, or zero and 
span checks keep you from collecting the minimum amount of data.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2943  How do I convert my 1-hour arithmetic averages into 

the appropriate averaging times and units?

    (a) Use Equation 1 in Sec. 60.2975 to calculate emissions at 7 
percent oxygen.
    (b) Use Equation 2 in Sec. 60.2975 to calculate the 12-hour rolling 
averages for concentrations of carbon monoxide.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2944  What operating parameter monitoring equipment must 

I install, and what operating parameters must I monitor?

    (a) If you are using a wet scrubber to comply with the emission 
limitations under Sec. 60.2915, you must install, calibrate (to 
manufacturers' specifications), maintain, and operate devices (or 
establish methods) for monitoring the value of the operating parameters 
used to determine compliance with the operating limits listed in Table 2 
of this subpart. These devices (or methods) must measure and record the 
values for these operating parameters at the frequencies indicated in 
Table 2 of this subpart at all times.
    (b) You must install, calibrate (to manufacturers' specifications), 
maintain, and operate a device or method for measuring the use of any 
stack that could be used to bypass the control device. The measurement 
must include the date, time, and duration of the use of the bypass 
stack.
    (c) If you are using a method or air pollution control device other 
than a wet scrubber to comply with the emission limitations under Sec. 
60.2915, you must install, calibrate (to the manufacturers' 
specifications), maintain, and operate the equipment necessary to 
monitor compliance with the site-specific operating limits established 
using the procedures in Sec. 60.2917.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2945  Is there a minimum amount of operating parameter

monitoring data I must obtain?

    (a) Except for monitor malfunctions, associated repairs, and 
required quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as 
applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments of 
the monitoring system), you must conduct all monitoring at all times the 
OSWI unit is operating.
    (b) You must obtain valid monitoring data for at least 75 percent of 
the operating hours per day for at least 90 percent of the operating 
days per calendar quarter. An operating day is any day the unit combusts 
any municipal or institutional solid waste.
    (c) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of this section, you have deviated from the data collection 
requirement regardless of the operating parameter level monitored.
    (d) Do not use data recorded during monitor malfunctions, associated 
repairs, and required quality assurance or quality control activities 
for meeting the requirements of this subpart, including data averages 
and calculations. You must use all the data collected during all other 
periods in assessing compliance with the operating limits.

                        Title V Operating Permits


<R05>
Sec. 60.2966  Am I required to apply for and obtain a title V 

operating permit for my unit?

    Yes, if you are subject to this subpart, you are required to apply 
for and obtain a title V operating permit unless you meet the relevant 
requirements for an exemption specified in Sec. 60.2887.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2967  When must I submit a title V permit application for 

my new unit?

    (a) If your new unit subject to this subpart is not subject to an 
earlier permit application deadline, a complete title V permit 
application must be submitted on or before one of the dates specified in 
paragraphs (a)(1) or (2) of this section. (See section 503(c) of the 
Clean Air Act and 40 CFR 70.5(a)(1)(i) and 40 CFR 71.5(a)(1)(i).)
    (1) For a unit that commenced operation as a new source as of 
December 16, 2005, then a complete title V permit application must be 
submitted not later than December 18, 2006.
    (2) For a unit that does not commence operation as a new source 
until after December 16, 2005, then a complete title V permit 
application must be submitted not later than 12 months after the date 
the unit commences operation as a new source.
    (b) If your new unit subject to this subpart is subject to title V 
as a result of some triggering requirement(s) other than this subpart 
(for example, a unit subject to this subpart may be a major source or 
part of a major source), then your unit may be required to apply for a 
title V permit prior to the deadlines specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section. If more than one requirement triggers a source's obligation to 
apply for a title V permit, the 12-month timeframe for filing a title V 
permit application is triggered by the requirement that first causes the 
source to be subject to title V. (See section 503(c) of the Clean Air 
Act and 40 CFR 70.3(a) and (b), 40 CFR 70.5(a)(1)(i), 40 CFR 71.3(a) and

%O<INF>2 = oxygen concentration measured on a dry basis, percent


[[Page 804]]


    (b) Capacity of a very small municipal waste combustion unit. For 
very small municipal waste combustion units that can operate 
continuously for 24-hour periods, calculate the unit capacity based on 
24 hours of operation at the maximum charge rate. To determine the 
maximum charge rate, use one of two methods:
    (1) For very small municipal waste combustion units with a design 
based on heat input capacity, calculate the maximum charging rate based 
on the maximum heat input capacity and one of two heating values:
    (i) If your very small municipal waste combustion unit combusts 
refuse-derived fuel, use a heating value of 12,800 kilojoules per 
kilogram (5,500 British thermal units per pound).
    (ii) If your very small municipal waste combustion unit combusts 
municipal solid waste, use a heating value of 10,500 kilojoules per 
kilogram (4,500 British thermal units per pound).
    (2) For very small municipal waste combustion units with a design 
not based on heat input capacity, use the maximum design charging rate.
    (c) Capacity of a batch very small municipal waste combustion unit. 
Calculate the capacity of a batch OSWI unit as the maximum design amount 
of municipal solid waste it can charge per batch multiplied by the 
maximum number of batches it can process in 24 hours. Calculate the 
maximum number of batches by dividing 24 by the number of hours needed 
to process one batch. Retain fractional batches in the calculation. For 
example, if one batch requires 16 hours, the unit can combust 24/16, or 
1.5 batches, in 24 hours.
    (d) Carbon monoxide pollutant rate. When hourly average pollutant 
rates (E<INF>h) are obtained (e.g., CEMS values), compute the 
rolling average carbon monoxide pollutant rate (E<INF>a) for each 
12-hour period using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16DE05.001

Where:

E<INF>a = Average carbon monoxide pollutant rate for the 12-hour 
period, ppm corrected to 7 percent O<INF>2.
E<INF>hj = Hourly arithmetic average pollutant rate for hour 
``j,'' ppm corrected to 7 percent O<INF>2.

 Subpart FFFF_Emission Guidelines and Compliance Times for Other Solid 
   Waste Incineration Units That Commenced Construction On or Before 
                            December 9, 2004

    Source: 70 FR 74907, Dec. 16, 2005, unless otherwise noted.

                              Introduction


<R05>
Sec. 60.2980  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    This subpart establishes emission guidelines and compliance 
schedules for the control of emissions from other solid waste 
incineration (OSWI) units. The pollutants addressed by these emission 
guidelines are listed in Table 2 of this subpart. These emission 
guidelines are developed in accordance with sections 111(d) and 129 of 
the Clean Air Act and subpart B of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2981  Am I affected by this subpart?

    (a) If you are the Administrator of an air quality program in a 
State or United States protectorate with one or more existing OSWI units 
or air curtain incinerators subject to this subpart as described in 
Sec. 60.2994(b) that commenced construction on or before December 9, 
2004, you must submit a State plan to the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) that implements the emission guidelines contained in this 
subpart.
    (b) You must submit the State plan to EPA by December 18, 2006.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2982  Is a State plan required for all States?

    No, you are not required to submit a State plan if there are no 
existing OSWI units or air curtain incinerators subject to this subpart 
as described in Sec. 60.2994(b) in your State and you submit a negative 
declaration letter in place of the State plan.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2983  What must I include in my State plan?

    (a) You must include the following nine items in your State plan:
    (1) Inventory of affected incineration units, including those that 
have ceased operation but have not been dismantled.
    (2) Inventory of emissions from affected incineration units in your 
State.
    (3) Compliance schedules for each affected incineration unit.
    (4) For each affected incineration unit, emission limitations, 
operator training and qualification requirements, a waste management 
plan, and operating parameter requirements that are at least as 
protective as the emission guidelines contained in this subpart.
    (5) Stack testing, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.
    (6) Transcript of the public hearing on the State plan.
    (7) Provision for State progress reports to EPA.
    (8) Identification of enforceable State mechanisms that you selected 
for implementing the emission guidelines of this subpart.
    (9) Demonstration of your State's legal authority to carry out the 
sections 111(d) and 129 in your State plan.
    (b) Your State plan may deviate from the format and content of the 
emission guidelines contained in this subpart.

[[Page 812]]

However, if your State plan does deviate, you must demonstrate that your 
State plan is at least as protective as the emission guidelines 
contained in this subpart. Your State plan must address regulatory 
applicability, compliance schedule, operator training and qualification, 
a waste management plan, emission limitations, stack testing, operating 
parameter requirements, monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting, and air 
curtain incinerator requirements.
    (c) You must follow the requirements of subpart B of this part 
(Adoption and Submittal of State Plans for Designated Facilities) in 
your State plan.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2984  Is there an approval process for my State plan?

    Yes, EPA will review your State plan according to Sec. 60.27.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2985  What if my State plan is not approvable?

    If you do not submit an approvable State plan (or a negative 
declaration letter) by December 17, 2007, EPA will develop a Federal 
plan according to Sec. 60.27 to implement the emission guidelines 
contained in this subpart. Owners and operators of incineration units 
not covered by an approved State plan must comply with the Federal plan. 
The Federal plan is an interim action and applies to units until a State 
plan covering those units is approved and becomes effective.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2986  Is there an approval process for a negative declaration 

letter?

    No, EPA has no formal review process for negative declaration 
letters. Once we receive your negative declaration letter, we will place 
a copy in the public docket and publish a notice in the Federal 
Register. If, at a later date, an existing incineration unit is found in 
your State, the Federal plan implementing the emission guidelines 
contained in this subpart would automatically apply to that unit until 
your State plan is approved.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2987  What compliance schedule must I include in my State plan?

    Your State plan must include compliance schedules that require OSWI 
units and air curtain incinerators subject to this subpart as described 
in Sec. 60.2994(b) to achieve final compliance as expeditiously as 
practicable after approval of the State plan but not later than the 
earlier of the following two dates:
    (a) December 16, 2010.
    (b) Three years after the effective date of State plan approval.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2988  Are there any State plan requirements for this subpart

that apply instead of the requirements specified in subpart B of this
part?

    Yes, subpart B of this part establishes general requirements for 
developing and processing section 111(d) plans. This subpart applies 
instead of the requirements in subpart B of this part for the following:
    (a) State plans developed to implement this subpart must be as 
protective as the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. State 
plans must require all OSWI units and air curtain incinerators subject 
to this subpart as described in Sec. 60.2994(b) to comply by December 
16, 2010 or 3 years after the effective date of State plan approval, 
whichever is sooner. This applies instead of the option for case-by-case 
less stringent emission standards and longer compliance schedules in 
Sec. 60.24(f).
    (b) State plans developed to implement this subpart are required to 
include only one increment of progress for the affected incineration 
units. This increment is the final compliance date in Sec. 60.21(h)(5). 
This applies instead of the requirement of Sec. 60.24(e)(1).


<R05>
Sec. 60.2989  Does this subpart directly affect incineration unit 

owners and operators in my State?

    (a) No, this subpart does not directly affect incineration unit 
owners and operators in your State. However, unit owners and operators 
must comply with the State plan you develop to implement the emission 
guidelines contained in this subpart.
    (b) If you do not submit an approvable plan to implement and enforce 
the guidelines contained in this subpart by December 17, 2007, EPA will 
implement and enforce a Federal plan, as provided in Sec. 60.2985, to 
ensure that each unit within your State reaches compliance with all the 
provisions of this subpart by December 16, 2010.

[[Page 813]]


<R05>
Sec. 60.2990  What Authorities are withheld by EPA?

    The following authorities are withheld by EPA and not transferred to 
the State, local or tribal agency:
    (1) Approval of alternatives to the emission limitations in Table 2 
of this subpart and operating limits established under Sec. 60.3023 and 
Table 3 of this subpart.
    (2) Approval of petitions for specific operating limits in Sec. 
60.3024.
    (3) Approval of major alternatives to test methods.
    (4) Approval of major alternatives to monitoring.
    (5) Approval of major alternatives to recordkeeping and reporting.
    (6) The status report requirements in Sec. 60.3020(c)(2).

                      Applicability of State Plans


<R05>
Sec. 60.2991  What incineration units must I address in my State plan?

    Your State plan must address all incineration units in your State 
that meet all the requirements specified in paragraphs (a) through (c) 
of this section.
    (a) The incineration unit is an existing incineration unit as 
defined in Sec. 60.2992.
    (b) The incineration unit is an OSWI unit as defined in Sec. 
60.3078 or an air curtain incinerator subject to this subpart as 
described in Sec. 60.2994(b). OSWI units are very small municipal waste 
combustion units and institutional waste incineration units as defined 
in Sec. 60.3078.
    (c) The incineration unit is not excluded under Sec. 60.2993.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2992  What is an existing incineration unit?

    An existing incineration unit is an OSWI unit or air curtain 
incinerator subject to this subpart that commenced construction on or 
before December 9, 2004, except as provided in paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (a) If the owner or operator of an incineration unit makes changes 
that meet the definition of modification or reconstruction on or after 
June 16, 2006, the unit becomes subject to subpart EEEE of this part 
(New Source Performance Standards for Other Solid Waste Incineration 
Units) and the State plan no longer applies to that unit.

limitations, you must establish operating limits for four operating 
parameters (as specified in Table 3 of this subpart) as described in 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section during the initial 
performance test.
    (1) Maximum charge rate, calculated using one of the two different 
procedures in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, as 
appropriate.
    (i) For continuous and intermittent units, maximum charge rate is 
the average charge rate measured during the most recent performance test 
demonstrating compliance with all applicable emission limitations.
    (ii) For batch units, maximum charge rate is the charge rate 
measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating 
compliance with all applicable emission limitations.
    (2) Minimum pressure drop across the wet scrubber, which is 
calculated as the average pressure drop across the wet scrubber measured 
during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with 
the particulate matter emission limitations; or minimum amperage to the 
wet scrubber, which is calculated as the average amperage to the wet 
scrubber measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating 
compliance with the particulate matter emission limitations.
    (3) Minimum scrubber liquor flow rate, which is calculated as the 
average liquor flow rate at the inlet to the wet scrubber measured 
during the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with 
all applicable emission limitations.
    (4) Minimum scrubber liquor pH, which is calculated as the average 
liquor pH at the inlet to the wet scrubber measured during the most 
recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the hydrogen 
chloride and sulfur dioxide emission limitations.

emission limitations?

    If you use an air pollution control device other than a wet scrubber 
or limit emissions in some other manner to comply with the emission 
limitations under Sec. 60.3022, you must petition EPA for specific 
operating limits, the values of which are to be established during the 
initial performance test and then

[[Page 820]]

continuously monitored thereafter. You must not conduct the initial 
performance test until after the petition has been approved by EPA. Your 
petition must include the five items listed in paragraphs (a) through 
(e) of this section.
    (a) Identification of the specific parameters you propose to use as 
operating limits.
    (b) A discussion of the relationship between these parameters and 
emissions of regulated pollutants, identifying how emissions of 
regulated pollutants change with changes in these parameters, and how 
limits on these parameters will serve to limit emissions of regulated 
pollutants.
    (c) A discussion of how you will establish the upper and/or lower 
values for these parameters that will establish the operating limits on 
these parameters.
    (d) A discussion identifying the methods you will use to measure and 
the instruments you will use to monitor these parameters, as well as the 
relative accuracy and precision of these methods and instruments.

period. Follow the sampling procedures outlined in section 8.1.5 of 
Method 26A of appendix A of this part. For the conditioning run, water 
can be used as the impinger solution.
    (ii) Remove the impingers from the sampling train and replace with a 
fresh impinger train for the sampling run, leaving the probe and filter 
(and cyclone, if used) in position. Do not recover the filter or rinse 
the probe before the first run. Thoroughly rinse the impingers used in 
the preconditioning run with deionized water and discard these rinses.
    (iii) The probe and filter assembly are conditioned by the stack gas 
and are not recovered or cleaned until the end of testing.
    (2) For the duration of sampling, a temperature around the probe and 
filter (and cyclone, if used) between 120 [deg]C (248 [deg]F) and 134 
[deg]C (273 [deg]F) must be maintained.
    (3) If water droplets are present in the sample gas stream, the 
requirements specified in paragraphs (g)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section 
must be met.
    (i) The cyclone described in section 6.1.4 of Method 26A of appendix

<R05>
Sec. 60.3028  How are the performance test data used?

    You use results of performance tests to demonstrate compliance with 
the emission limitations in Table 2 of this subpart.

               Model Rule--Initial Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 60.3030  How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the 

emission limitations and establish the operating limits?

    You must conduct an initial performance test, as required under 
Sec. 60.8, to determine compliance with the emission limitations in 
Table 2 of this subpart and to establish operating limits using the 
procedure in Sec. 60.3023 or Sec. 60.3024. The initial performance 
test must be conducted using the test methods listed in Table 2 of this 
subpart and the procedures in Sec. 60.3027.


<R05>
Sec. 60.3031  By what date must I conduct the initial performance test?

    The initial performance test must be conducted no later than 180 
days after your final compliance date. Your final compliance date is 
specified in Table 1 of this subpart.

             Model Rule--Continuous Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 60.3033  How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the 

emission limitations and the operating limits?

    (a) You must conduct an annual performance test for all of the 
pollutants in Table 2 of this subpart for each OSWI unit to determine 
compliance with the emission limitations. The annual performance test 
must be conducted using the test methods listed in Table 2 of this 
subpart and the procedures in Sec. 60.3027.
    (b) You must continuously monitor carbon monoxide emissions to 
determine compliance with the carbon monoxide emissions limitation. 
Twelve-hour rolling average values are used to determine compliance. A 
12-hour rolling average value above the carbon monoxide emission limit 
in Table 2 constitutes a deviation from the emission limitation.
    (c) You must continuously monitor the operating parameters specified 
in Sec. 60.3023 or established under Sec. 60.3024. Three-hour rolling 
average values are used to determine compliance with the operating 
limits unless a different averaging period is established under Sec. 
60.3024. A 3-hour rolling average value (unless a different averaging 
period is established under Sec. 60.3024) above the established maximum 
or below the established minimum operating limits constitutes a 
deviation from the established operating limits. Operating limits do not 
apply during performance tests.


<R05>
Sec. 60.3034  By what date must I conduct the annual performance test?

    You must conduct annual performance tests within 12 months following 
the initial performance test. Conduct subsequent annual performance 
tests within 12 months following the previous one.


<R05>
Sec. 60.3035  May I conduct performance testing less often?

    (a) You can test less often for a given pollutant if you have test 
data for at least three consecutive annual tests, and all performance 
tests for the pollutant over that period show that you comply with the 
emission limitation. In this case, you do not have to conduct a 
performance test for that pollutant for the next 2 years. You must 
conduct a performance test during the 3rd year and no more than 36 
months following the previous performance test.
    (b) If your OSWI unit continues to meet the emission limitation for 
the pollutant, you may choose to conduct performance tests for that 
pollutant every 3rd year, but each test must be within 36 months of the 
previous performance test.
    (c) If a performance test shows a deviation from an emission 
limitation for any pollutant, you must conduct annual performance tests 
for that pollutant until three consecutive annual performance tests for 
that pollutant all show compliance.

[[Page 822]]


<R05>
Sec. 60.3036  May I conduct a repeat performance test to establish 

new operating limits?

    Yes, you may conduct a repeat performance test at any time to 
establish new values for the operating limits. The Administrator may 
request a repeat performance test at any time.

                         Model Rule--Monitoring


<R05>
Sec. 60.3038  What continuous emission monitoring systems must I install?

    (a) You must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate continuous 
emission monitoring systems for carbon monoxide and for oxygen. You must 
monitor the oxygen concentration at each location where you monitor 
carbon monoxide.
    (b) You must install, evaluate, and operate each continuous emission 
monitoring system according to the ``Monitoring Requirements'' in Sec. 
60.13.


<R05>
Sec. 60.3039  How do I make sure my continuous emission monitoring 

systems are operating correctly?

    (a) Conduct initial, daily, quarterly, and annual evaluations of 
your continuous emission monitoring systems that measure carbon monoxide 
and oxygen.
    (b) Complete your initial evaluation of the continuous emission 
monitoring systems within 180 days after your final compliance date in 
Table 1 of this subpart.
    (c) For initial and annual evaluations, collect data concurrently 
(or within 30 to 60 minutes) using your carbon monoxide and oxygen 
continuous emission monitoring systems. To validate carbon monoxide 
concentration levels, use EPA Method 10, 10A, or 10B of appendix A of 
this part. Use EPA Method 3 or 3A to measure oxygen. Collect the data 
during each initial and annual evaluation of your continuous emission 
monitoring systems following the applicable performance specifications 
in appendix B of this part. Table 4 of this subpart shows the required 
span values and performance specifications that apply to each continuous 
emission monitoring system.
    (d) Follow the quality assurance procedures in Procedure 1 of 
appendix F of this part for each continuous emission monitoring system. 
The procedures include daily calibration drift and quarterly accuracy 
determinations.


<R05>
Sec. 60.3040  What is my schedule for evaluating continuous

emission monitoring systems?

    (a) Conduct annual evaluations of your continuous emission 
monitoring systems no more than 12 months after the previous evaluation 
was conducted.
    (b) Evaluate your continuous emission monitoring systems daily and 
quarterly as specified in appendix F of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 60.3041  What is the minimum amount of monitoring data I must 

collect with my continuous emission monitoring systems, and is the 
data collection 
          requirement enforceable?

    (a) Where continuous emission monitoring systems are required, 
obtain 1-hour arithmetic averages. Make sure the averages for carbon 
monoxide are in parts per million by dry volume at 7 percent oxygen. Use 
the 1-hour averages of oxygen data from your continuous emission 
monitoring system to determine the actual oxygen level and to calculate 
emissions at 7 percent oxygen.
    (b) Obtain at least two data points per hour in order to calculate a 
valid 1-hour arithmetic average. Section 60.13(e)(2) requires your 
continuous emission monitoring systems to complete at least one cycle of 
operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each 15-minute 
period.
    (c) Obtain valid 1-hour averages for at least 75 percent of the 
operating hours per day for at least 90 percent of the operating days 
per calendar quarter. An operating day is any day the unit combusts any 
municipal or institutional solid waste.
    (d) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) 
through (c) of this section, you have deviated from the data collection 
requirement regardless of the emission level monitored.
    (e) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) 
through (c) of this section, you must still use all valid data from the 
continuous emission monitoring systems in calculating emission 
concentrations.
    (f) If continuous emission monitoring systems are temporarily 
unavailable to

[[Page 823]]

meet the data collection requirements, refer to Table 4 of this subpart. 
It shows alternate methods for collecting data when systems malfunction 
or when repairs, calibration checks, or zero and span checks keep you 
from collecting the minimum amount of data.


<R05>
Sec. 60.3042  How do I convert my 1-hour arithmetic averages into 

the appropriate averaging times and units?

    (a) Use Equation 1 in Sec. 60.3076 to calculate emissions at 7 
percent oxygen.
    (b) Use Equation 2 in Sec. 60.3076 to calculate the 12-hour rolling 
averages for concentrations of carbon monoxide.


<R05>
Sec. 60.3043  What operating parameter monitoring equipment must 

I install, and what operating parameters must I monitor?

    (a) If you are using a wet scrubber to comply with the emission 
limitations under Sec. 60.3022, you must install, calibrate (to 
manufacturers' specifications), maintain, and operate devices (or 
establish methods) for monitoring the value of the operating parameters 
used to determine compliance with the operating limits listed in Table 3 
of this subpart. These devices (or methods) must measure and record the 
values for these operating parameters at the frequencies indicated in 
Table 3 of this subpart at all times.
    (b) You must install, calibrate (to manufacturers' specifications), 
maintain, and operate a device or method for measuring the use of any 
stack that could be used to bypass the control device. The measurement 
must include the date, time, and duration of the use of the bypass 
stack.
    (c) If you are using a method or air pollution control device other 
than a wet scrubber to comply with the emission limitations under Sec. 
60.3022, you must install, calibrate (to the manufacturers' 
specifications), maintain, and operate the equipment necessary to 
monitor compliance with the site-specific operating limits established 
using the procedures in Sec. 60.3024.


<R05>
Sec. 60.3044  Is there a minimum amount of operating parameter

monitoring data I must obtain?

    (a) Except for monitor malfunctions, associated repairs, and 
required quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as 
applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments of 
the monitoring system), you must conduct all monitoring at all times the 
OSWI unit is operating.
    (b) You must obtain valid monitoring data for at least 75 percent of 
the operating hours per day for at least 90 percent of the operating 
days per calendar quarter. An operating day is any day the unit combusts 
any municipal or institutional solid waste.
    (c) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of this section, you have deviated from the data collection 
requirement regardless of the operating parameter level monitored.
    (d) Do not use data recorded during monitor malfunctions, associated 
repairs, and required quality assurance or quality control activities 
for meeting the requirements of this subpart, including data averages 
and calculations. You must use all the data collected during all other 
periods in assessing compliance with the operating limits.

                  Model Rule--Title V Operating Permits


<R05>
Sec. 60.3059  Am I required to apply for and obtain a title 

V operating permit for my unit?

    Yes, if you are subject to an applicable EPA-approved and effective 
Clean Air Act section 111(d)/129 State or Tribal plan or an applicable 
and effective Federal plan, you are required to apply for and obtain a 
title V operating permit unless you meet the relevant requirements for 
an exemption specified in Sec. 60.2993.


<R05>
Sec. 60.3060  When must I submit a title V permit application for

my existing unit?

    (a)(1) If your existing unit is not subject to an earlier permit 
application deadline, a complete title V permit application must be 
submitted on or before the earlier of the dates specified in paragraphs 
(a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. (See sections 129(e), 503(c), 
503(d), and 502(a) of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR 70.5(a)(1)(i) and 40 
CFR 71.5(a)(1)(i).)
    (i) 12 months after the effective date of any applicable EPA-
approved Clean Air Act section 111(d)/129 State or Tribal plan.
    (ii) 12 months after the effective date of any applicable Federal 
plan.
    (iii) December 16, 2008.

[[Page 827]]

    (2) For any existing unit not subject to an earlier permit 
application deadline, the application deadline of 36 months after the 
promulgation of 40 CFR part 60, subpart FFFF, applies regardless of 
whether or when any applicable Federal plan is effective, or whether or 
when any applicable Clean Air Act section 111(d)/129 State or Tribal 
plan is approved by EPA and becomes effective.
    (b) If your existing unit is subject to title V as a result of some 
triggering requirement(s) other than those specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section (for example, a unit may be a major source or part of a 
major source), then your unit may be required to apply for a title V 
permit prior to the deadlines specified in paragraph (a). If more than 
one requirement triggers a source's obligation to apply for a title V 
permit, the 12-month timeframe for filing a title V permit application 
is triggered by the requirement which first causes the source to be 
subject to title V. (See section 503(c) of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR 
70.3(a) and (b), 40 CFR 70.5(a)(1)(i), 40 CFR 71.3(a) and (b), and 40 
CFR 71.5(a)(1)(i).)
    (c) A ``complete'' title V permit application is one that has been 
determined or deemed complete by the relevant permitting authority under 
section 503(d) of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR 70.5(a)(2) or 40 CFR 
71.5(a)(2). You must submit a complete permit application by the 
relevant application deadline in order to operate after this date in 
compliance with Federal law. (See sections 503(d) and 502(a) of the 
Clean Air Act and 40 CFR 70.7(b) and 40 CFR 71.7(b).)

Model Rule--Temporary-Use Incinerators and Air Curtain Incinerators Used 
                          in Disaster Recovery


<R05>
Sec. 60.3061  What are the requirements for temporary-use incinerators

and air curtain incinerators used in disaster recovery?

    Your incinerator or air curtain incinerator is excluded from the 
requirements of this subpart if it is used on a temporary basis to 
combust debris from a disaster or emergency such as a tornado, 
hurricane, flood, ice storm, high winds, or act of bioterrorism. To 
qualify for this exclusion, the incinerator or air curtain incinerator 
must be used to combust debris in an area declared a State of Emergency 
by a local or State government, or the President, under the authority of 
the Stafford Act, has declared that an emergency or a major disaster 
exists in the area, and you must follow the requirements specified in 
paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.
    (a) If the incinerator or air curtain incinerator is used during a 
period that begins on the date the unit started operation and lasts 8 
weeks or less within the boundaries of the same emergency or disaster 
declaration area, then it is excluded from the requirements of this

                          Model Rule--Equations


<R05>
Sec. 60.3076  What equations must I use?

    (a) Percent oxygen. Adjust all pollutant concentrations to 7 percent 
oxygen using Equation 1 of this section.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16DE05.002

Where:

C<INF>adj = pollutant concentration adjusted to 7 percent oxygen
C<INF>meas = pollutant concentration measured on a dry basis
(20.9-7) = 20.9 percent oxygen-7 percent oxygen (defined oxygen 
correction basis)
20.9 = oxygen concentration in air, percent
%O<INF>2 = oxygen concentration measured on a dry basis, percent

    (b) Capacity of a very small municipal waste combustion unit. For 
very small municipal waste combustion units that can operate 
continuously for 24-hour periods, calculate the unit capacity based on 
24 hours of operation at the maximum charge rate. To determine the 
maximum charge rate, use one of two methods:
    (1) For very small municipal waste combustion units with a design 
based on heat input capacity, calculate the maximum charging rate based 
on the maximum heat input capacity and one of two heating values:
    (i) If your very small municipal waste combustion unit combusts 
refuse-derived fuel, use a heating value of 12,800 kilojoules per 
kilogram (5,500 British thermal units per pound).
    (ii) If your very small municipal waste combustion unit combusts 
municipal solid waste, use a heating value of 10,500 kilojoules per 
kilogram (4,500 British thermal units per pound).
    (2) For very small municipal waste combustion units with a design 
not

[[Page 830]]

based on heat input capacity, use the maximum design charging rate.
    (c) Capacity of a batch very small municipal waste combustion unit. 
Calculate the capacity of a batch OSWI unit as the maximum design amount 
of municipal solid waste it can charge per batch multiplied by the 
maximum number of batches it can process in 24 hours. Calculate the 
maximum number of batches by dividing 24 by the number of hours needed 
to process one batch. Retain fractional batches in the calculation. For 
example, if one batch requires 16 hours, the OSWI unit can combust 24/
16, or 1.5 batches, in 24 hours.
    (d) Carbon monoxide pollutant rate. When hourly average pollutant 
rates (E<INF>h) are obtained (e.g., CEMS values), compute the 
rolling average carbon monoxide pollutant rate (E<INF>a) for each 
12-hour period using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16DE05.003

Where:

E<INF>a = Average carbon monoxide pollutant rate for the 12-hour 
period, ppm corrected to 7 percent O<INF>2.
E<INF>hj = Hourly arithmetic average pollutant rate for hour 
``j,'' ppm corrected to 7 percent O<INF>2.

Sec. 60.4142  Hg allowance allocations.

    (a)(1) The baseline heat input (in MMBtu) used with respect to Hg 
allowance allocations under paragraph (b) of this section for each Hg 
Budget unit will be:
    (i) For units commencing operation before January 1, 2001, the 
average of the three highest amounts of the unit's adjusted control 
period heat input for 2000 through 2004, with the adjusted control 
period heat input for each year calculated as the sum of the following:
    (A) Any portion of the unit's control period heat input for the year 
that results from the unit's combustion of lignite, multiplied by 3.0;
    (B) Any portion of the unit's control period heat input for the year 
that results from the unit's combustion of subbituminous coal, 
multiplied by 1.25; and
    (C) Any portion of the unit's control period heat input for the year 
that is not covered by paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) or (B) of this section, 
multiplied by 1.0.
    (ii) For units commencing operation on or after January 1, 2001 and 
operating each calendar year during a period of 5 or more consecutive 
calendar years, the average of the 3 highest amounts of the unit's total 
converted control period heat input over the first such 5 years.
    (2)(i) A unit's control period heat input for a calendar year under 
paragraphs (a)(1)(i) of this section, and a unit's total ounces of Hg 
emissions during a calendar year under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, 
will be determined in accordance with part 75 of this chapter, to the 
extent the unit was otherwise subject to the requirements of part 75 of 
this chapter for the year, or will be based on the best available data 
reported to the permitting authority for the unit, to the extent the

[[Page 854]]

unit was not otherwise subject to the requirements of part 75 of this 
chapter for the year. The unit's types and amounts of fuel combusted, 
under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, will be based on the best 
available data reported to the permitting authority for the unit.
    (ii) A unit's converted control period heat input for a calendar 
year specified under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section equals:
    (A) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) or (C) of this 
section, the control period gross electrical output of the generator or 
generators served by the unit multiplied by 7,900 Btu/kWh and divided by 
1,000,000 Btu/MMBtu, provided that if a generator is served by 2 or more 
units, then the gross electrical output of the generator will be 
attributed to each unit in proportion to the unit's share of the total 
control period heat input of such units for the year;
    (B) For a unit that is a boiler and has equipment used to produce 
electricity and useful thermal energy for industrial, commercial, 
heating, or cooling purposes through the sequential use of energy, the 
total heat energy (in Btu) of the steam produced by the boiler during 
the control period, divided by 0.8 and by 1,000,000 Btu/MMBtu; or
    (C) For a unit that is a combustion turbine and has equipment used 
to produce electricity and useful thermal energy for industrial, 
commercial, heating, or cooling purposes through the sequential use of 
energy, the control period gross electrical output of the enclosed 
device comprising the compressor, combustor, and turbine multiplied by 
3,413 Btu/kWh, plus the total heat energy (in Btu) of the steam produced 
by any associated heat recovery steam generator during the control 
period divided by 0.8, and with the sum divided by 1,000,000 Btu/MMBtu.
    (b)(1) For each control period in 2010 and thereafter, the 
permitting authority will allocate to all Hg Budget units in the State 
that have a baseline heat input (as determined under paragraph (a) of 
this section) a total amount of Hg allowances equal to 95 percent for a 
control period in 2010 through 2014, and 97 percent for a control period 
in 2015 and thereafter, of the amount of ounces (i.e., tons multiplied 
by 32,000 ounces/ton) of Hg emissions in the applicable State trading 
budget under Sec. 60.4140 (except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section).
    (2) The permitting authority will allocate Hg allowances to each Hg 
Budget unit under paragraph (b)(1) of this section in an amount 
determined by multiplying the total amount of Hg allowances allocated 
under paragraph (b)(1) of this section by the ratio of the baseline heat 
input of such Hg Budget unit to the total amount of baseline heat input 
of all such Hg Budget units in the State and rounding to the nearest 
whole allowance as appropriate.
    (c) For each control period in 2010 and thereafter, the permitting 
authority will allocate Hg allowances to Hg Budget units in the State 
that commenced operation on or after January 1, 2001 and do not yet have 
a baseline heat input (as determined under paragraph (a) of this 
section), in accordance with the following procedures:
    (1) The permitting authority will establish a separate new unit set-
aside for each control period. Each new unit set-aside will be allocated 
Hg allowances equal to 5 percent for a control period in 2010 through 
2014, and 3 percent for a control period in 2015 and thereafter, of the 
amount of ounces (i.e., tons multiplied by 32,000 ounces/ton) of Hg 
emissions in the applicable State trading budget under Sec. 60.4140.
    (2) The Hg designated representative of such a Hg Budget unit may 
submit to the permitting authority a request, in a format specified by 
the permitting authority, to be allocated Hg allowances, starting with 
the later of the control period in 2010 or the first control period 
after the control period in which the Hg Budget unit commences 
commercial operation and until the first control period for which the 
unit is allocated Hg allowances under paragraph (b) of this section. The 
Hg allowance allocation request must be submitted on or before July 1 of 
the first control period for which the Hg allowances are requested and 
after the date on which the Hg Budget unit commences commercial 
operation.
    (3) In a Hg allowance allocation request under paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section, the Hg designated representative

[[Page 855]]

may request for a control period Hg allowances in an amount not 
exceeding the Hg Budget unit's total ounces of Hg emissions during the 
control period immediately before such control period.
    (4) The permitting authority will review each Hg allowance 
allocation request under paragraph (c)(2) of this section and will 
allocate Hg allowances for each control period pursuant to such request 
as follows:
    (i) The permitting authority will accept an allowance allocation 
request only if the request meets, or is adjusted by the permitting 
authority as necessary to meet, the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2) 
and (3) of this section.
    (ii) On or after July 1 of the control period, the permitting 
authority will determine the sum of the Hg allowances requested (as 
adjusted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section) in all allowance 
allocation requests accepted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section 
for the control period.
    (iii) If the amount of Hg allowances in the new unit set-aside for 
the control period is greater than or equal to the sum under paragraph 
(c)(4)(ii) of this section, then the permitting authority will allocate 
the amount of Hg allowances requested (as adjusted under paragraph 
(c)(4)(i) of this section) to each Hg Budget unit covered by an 
allowance allocation request accepted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this 
section.
    (iv) If the amount of Hg allowances in the new unit set-aside for 
the control period is less than the sum under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of 
this section, then the permitting authority will allocate to each Hg 
Budget unit covered by an allowance allocation request accepted under 
paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section the amount of the Hg allowances 
requested (as adjusted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section), 
multiplied by the amount of Hg allowances in the new unit set-aside for 
the control period, divided by the sum determined under paragraph 
(c)(4)(ii) of this section, and rounded to the nearest whole allowance 
as appropriate.
    (v) The permitting authority will notify each Hg designated 
representative that submitted an allowance allocation request of the 
amount of Hg allowances (if any) allocated for the control period to the 
Hg Budget unit covered by the request.
    (d) If, after completion of the procedures under paragraph (c)(4) of 
this section for a control period, any unallocated Hg allowances remain 
in the new unit set-aside for the control period, the permitting 
authority will allocate to each Hg Budget unit that was allocated Hg 
allowances under paragraph (b) of this section an amount of Hg 
allowances equal to the total amount of such remaining unallocated Hg 
allowances, multiplied by the unit's allocation under paragraph (b) of 
this section, divided by 95 percent for 2010 through 2014, and 97 
percent for 2014 and thereafter, of the amount of ounces (i.e., tons 
multiplied by 32,000 ounces/ton) of Hg emissions in the applicable State 
trading budget under Sec. 60.4140, and rounded to the nearest whole 
allowance as appropriate.

<R05>
Sec. 60.4152  Responsibilities of Hg authorized account representative.

    Following the establishment of a Hg Allowance Tracking System 
account, all submissions to the Administrator pertaining to the account, 
including, but not limited to, submissions concerning the deduction or 
transfer of Hg allowances in the account, shall be made only by the Hg 
authorized account representative for the account.


<R05>
Sec. 60.4153  Recordation of Hg allowance allocations.

    (a) By December 1, 2006, the Administrator will record in the Hg 
Budget source's compliance account the Hg allowances allocated for the 
Hg Budget units at a source, as submitted by the permitting authority in 
accordance with Sec. 60.4141(a), for the control periods in 2010, 2011, 
2012, 2013, and 2014.
    (b) By December 1, 2008, the Administrator will record in the Hg 
Budget source's compliance account the Hg allowances allocated for the 
Hg Budget units at the source, as submitted by the permitting authority 
or as determined by the Administrator in accordance with Sec. 
60.4141(b), for the control period in 2015.
    (c) In 2011 and each year thereafter, after the Administrator has 
made all deductions (if any) from a Hg Budget source's compliance 
account under Sec. 60.4154, the Administrator will record in the Hg 
Budget source's compliance account the Hg allowances allocated for the 
Hg Budget units at the source, as submitted by the permitting authority 
or determined by the Administrator in accordance with Sec. 60.4141(b), 
for the control period in the sixth year after the year of the control 
period for which such deductions were or could have been made.
    (d) By December 1, 2010 and December 1 of each year thereafter, the 
Administrator will record in the Hg Budget source's compliance account 
the Hg allowances allocated for the Hg Budget units at the source, as 
submitted by the permitting authority or determined by the Administrator 
in accordance with Sec. 60.4141(c), for the control period in the year 
of the applicable deadline for recordation under this paragraph.
    (e) Serial numbers for allocated Hg allowances. When recording the 
allocation of Hg allowances for a Hg Budget unit in a compliance 
account, the Administrator will assign each Hg allowance a unique 
identification number that will include digits identifying the year of 
the control period for which the Hg allowance is allocated.


<R05>
Sec. 60.4154  Compliance with Hg budget emissions limitation.

    (a) Allowance transfer deadline. The Hg allowances are available to 
be deducted for compliance with a source's Hg Budget emissions 
limitation for a control period in a given calendar year only if the Hg 
allowances:
    (1) Were allocated for the control period in the year or a prior 
year;
    (2) Are held in the compliance account as of the allowance transfer 
deadline for the control period or are transferred into the compliance 
account by a Hg allowance transfer correctly submitted for recordation 
under Sec. Sec. 60.4160 through 60.4162 by the allowance transfer 
deadline for the control period; and
    (3) Are not necessary for deductions for excess emissions for a 
prior control period under paragraph (d) of this section.
    (b) Deductions for compliance. Following the recordation, in 
accordance with Sec. Sec. 60.4160 through 60.4162, of Hg allowance 
transfers submitted for recordation in a source's compliance account by 
the allowance transfer deadline for a control period, the Administrator 
will deduct from the compliance account Hg allowances available under 
paragraph (a) of this section in order to determine whether the source 
meets the Hg Budget emissions limitation for the control period, as 
follows:
    (1) Until the amount of Hg allowances deducted equals the number of 
ounces of total Hg emissions, determined in accordance with Sec. Sec. 
60.4170 through 60.4176, from all Hg Budget units at the source for the 
control period; or

[[Page 859]]

    (2) If there are insufficient Hg allowances to complete the 
deductions in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, until no more Hg 
allowances available under paragraph (a) of this section remain in the 
compliance account.
    (c)(1) Identification of Hg allowances by serial number. The Hg 
authorized account representative for a source's compliance account may 
request that specific Hg allowances, identified by serial number, in the 
compliance account be deducted for emissions or excess emissions for a 
control period in accordance with paragraph (b) or (d) of this section. 
Such request shall be submitted to the Administrator by the allowance 
transfer deadline for the control period and include, in a format 
prescribed by the Administrator, the identification of the Hg Budget 
source and the appropriate serial numbers.
    (2) First-in, first-out. The Administrator will deduct Hg allowances 
under paragraph (b) or (d) of this section from the source's compliance 
account, in the absence of an identification or in the case of a partial 
identification of Hg allowances by serial number under paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section, on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) accounting basis in the 
following order:
    (i) Any Hg allowances that were allocated to the units at the 
source, in the order of recordation; and then
    (ii) Any Hg allowances that were allocated to any unit and 
transferred and recorded in the compliance account pursuant to 
Sec. Sec. 60.4160 through 60.4162, in the order of recordation.
    (d) Deductions for excess emissions. (1) After making the deductions 
for compliance under paragraph (b) of this section for a control period 
in a calendar year in which the Hg Budget source has excess emissions, 
the Administrator will deduct from the source's compliance account an 
amount of Hg allowances, allocated for the control period in the 
immediately following calendar year, equal to 3 times the number of 
ounces of the source's excess emissions.
    (2) Any allowance deduction required under paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section shall not affect the liability of the owners and operators of 
the Hg Budget source or the Hg Budget units at the source for any fine, 
penalty, or assessment, or their obligation to comply with any other 
remedy, for the same violation, as ordered under the Clean Air Act or 
applicable State law.
    (e) Recordation of deductions. The Administrator will record in the 
appropriate compliance account all deductions from such an account under 
paragraph (b) or (d) of this section.
    (f) Administrator's action on submissions. (1) The Administrator may 
review and conduct independent audits concerning any submission under 
the Hg Budget Trading Program and make appropriate adjustments of the 
information in the submissions.

that may significantly affect the ability of the system to accurately 
measure or record Hg mass emissions or heat input rate or to meet

[[Page 863]]

the quality-assurance and quality-control requirements of Sec. 75.21 of 
this chapter or appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, the owner or 
operator shall recertify the monitoring system in accordance with Sec. 
75.20(b) of this chapter. Furthermore, whenever the owner or operator 
makes a replacement, modification, or change to the flue gas handling 
system or the unit's operation that may significantly change the stack 
flow or concentration profile, the owner or operator shall recertify 
each continuous emission monitoring system, and each excepted monitoring 
system (sorbent trap monitoring system) under Sec. 75.15, whose 
accuracy is potentially affected by the change, in accordance with Sec. 
75.20(b) of this chapter. Examples of changes to a continuous emission 
monitoring system that require recertification include replacement of 
the analyzer, complete replacement of an existing continuous emission 
monitoring system, or change in location or orientation of the sampling 
probe or site.
    (3) Approval process for initial certification and recertification. 
Paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section apply to both initial 
certification and recertification of a continuous monitoring system 
under Sec. 60.4170(a)(1). For recertifications, apply the word 
``recertification'' instead of the words ``certification'' and ``initial 
certification'' and apply the word ``recertified'' instead of the word 
``certified,'' and follow the procedures in Sec. 75.20(b)(5) of this 
chapter in lieu of the procedures in paragraph (c)(3)(v) of this 
section.
    (i) Notification of certification. The Hg designated representative 
shall submit to the permitting authority, the appropriate EPA Regional 
Office, and the Administrator written notice of the dates of 
certification testing, in accordance with Sec. 60.4173.
    (ii) Certification application. The Hg designated representative 
shall submit to the permitting authority a certification application for 
each monitoring system. A complete certification application shall 
include the information specified in Sec. 75.63 of this chapter.
    (iii) Provisional certification date. The provisional certification 
date for a monitoring system shall be determined in accordance with 
Sec. 75.20(a)(3) of this chapter. A provisionally certified monitoring 
system may be used under the Hg Budget Trading Program for a period not 
to exceed 120 days after receipt by the permitting authority of the 
complete certification application for the monitoring system under 
paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. Data measured and recorded by the 
provisionally certified monitoring system, in accordance with the 
requirements of part 75 of this chapter, will be considered valid 
quality-assured data (retroactive to the date and time of provisional 
certification), provided that the permitting authority does not 
invalidate the provisional certification by issuing a notice of 
disapproval within 120 days of the date of receipt of the complete 
certification application by the permitting authority.
    (iv) Certification application approval process. The permitting 
authority will issue a written notice of approval or disapproval of the 
certification application to the owner or operator within 120 days of 
receipt of the complete certification application under paragraph 
(c)(3)(ii) of this section. In the event the permitting authority does 
not issue such a notice within such 120-day period, each monitoring 
system that meets the applicable performance requirements of part 75 of 
this chapter and is included in the certification application will be 
deemed certified for use under the Hg Budget Trading Program.
    (A) Approval notice. If the certification application is complete 
and shows that each monitoring system meets the applicable performance 
requirements of part 75 of this chapter, then the permitting authority 
will issue a written notice of approval of the certification application 
within 120 days of receipt.
    (B) Incomplete application notice. If the certification application 
is not complete, then the permitting authority will issue a written 
notice of incompleteness that sets a reasonable date by which the Hg 
designated representative must submit the additional information 
required to complete the certification application. If the Hg designated 
representative does not comply with the notice of incompleteness by the 
specified date, then the permitting

[[Page 864]]

authority may issue a notice of disapproval under paragraph 
(c)(3)(iv)(C) of this section. The 120-day review period shall not begin 
before receipt of a complete certification application.
    (C) Disapproval notice. If the certification application shows that 
any monitoring system does not meet the performance requirements of part 
75 of this chapter or if the certification application is incomplete and 
the requirement for disapproval under paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(B) of this 
section is met, then the permitting authority will issue a written 
notice of disapproval of the certification application. Upon issuance of 
such notice of disapproval, the provisional certification is invalidated 
by the permitting authority and the data measured and recorded by each 
uncertified monitoring system shall not be considered valid quality-
assured data beginning with the date and hour of provisional 
certification (as defined under Sec. 75.20(a)(3) of this chapter). The 
owner or operator shall follow the procedures for loss of certification 
in paragraph (c)(3)(v) of this section for each monitoring system that 
is disapproved for initial certification.
    (D) Audit decertification. The permitting authority may issue a 
notice of disapproval of the certification status of a monitor in 
accordance with Sec. 60.4172(b).
    (v) Procedures for loss of certification. If the permitting 
authority issues a notice of disapproval of a certification application 
under paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(C) of this section or a notice of disapproval 
of certification status under paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(D) of this section, 
then:
    (A) The owner or operator shall substitute the following values, for 
each disapproved monitoring system, for each hour of unit operation 
during the period of invalid data specified under Sec. 
75.20(a)(4)(iii), or Sec. 75.21(e) of this chapter and continuing until 
the applicable date and hour specified under Sec. 75.20(a)(5)(i) of 
this chapter:
    (1) For a disapproved Hg pollutant concentration monitors and 
disapproved flow monitor, respectively, the maximum potential 
concentration of Hg and the maximum potential flow rate, as defined in 
sections 2.1.7.1 and 2.1.4.1 of appendix A to part 75 of this chapter; 
and
    (2) For a disapproved moisture monitoring system and disapproved 
diluent gas monitoring system, respectively, the minimum potential 
moisture percentage and either the maximum potential CO<INF>2 
concentration or the minimum potential O<INF>2 concentration (as 
applicable), as defined in sections 2.1.5, 2.1.3.1, and 2.1.3.2 of 
appendix A to part 75 of this chapter.
    (3) For a disapproved excepted monitoring system (sorbent trap 
monitoring system) under Sec. 75.15 and disapproved flow monitor, 
respectively, the maximum potential concentration of Hg and maximum 
potential flow rate, as defined in sections 2.1.7.1 and 2.1.4.1 of

certification procedures required in 40 CFR part 89, subpart B, or 40 
CFR part 1039, subpart C, as applicable, and must test their engines as 
specified in those parts. For the purposes of this subpart, engines 
certified to the standards in table 1 to this subpart shall be subject 
to the same requirements as engines certified to the standards in 40 CFR 
part 89. For the purposes of this subpart, engines certified to the 
standards in table 4 to this subpart shall be subject to the same 
requirements as engines certified to the standards in 40 CFR part 89, 
except that engines with NFPA nameplate power of less than 37 KW (50 HP) 
certified to model year 2011 or later standards shall be subject to the 
same requirements as engines certified to the standards in 40 CFR part

combustion engine manufacturers must meet the corresponding provisions 
of 40 CFR part 89 or 40 CFR part 94 for engines that would be covered by 
that part if they were nonroad (including marine) engines. Labels on 
such engines must refer to stationary engines, rather than or in 
addition to nonroad or marine engines, as appropriate. Stationary CI 
internal combustion engine manufacturers must label their engines 
according to paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section.
    (1) Stationary CI internal combustion engines manufactured from 
January 1, 2006 to March 31, 2006 (January 1, 2006 to June 30, 2006 for 
fire pump engines), other than those that are part of certified engine 
families under the nonroad CI engine regulations, must be labeled 
according to 40 CFR 1039.20.
    (2) Stationary CI internal combustion engines manufactured from 
April 1, 2006 to December 31, 2006 (or, for fire pump engines, July 1, 
2006 to December 31 of the year preceding the year listed in table 3 to 
this subpart) must be labeled according to paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through 
(iii) of this section:
    (i) Stationary CI internal combustion engines that are part of 
certified engine families under the nonroad regulations must meet the 
labeling requirements for nonroad CI engines, but do not have to meet 
the labeling requirements in 40 CFR 1039.20.
    (ii) Stationary CI internal combustion engines that meet Tier 1 
requirements (or requirements for fire pumps) under this subpart, but do 
not meet the requirements applicable to nonroad CI engines must be 
labeled according to 40 CFR 1039.20. The engine manufacturer may add 
language to the label clarifying that the engine meets Tier 1 
requirements (or requirements for fire pumps) of this subpart.
    (iii) Stationary CI internal combustion engines manufactured after 
April 1, 2006 that do not meet Tier 1 requirements of this subpart, or 
fire pumps engines manufactured after July 1, 2006 that do not meet the 
requirements for fire pumps under this subpart, may not be used in the 
U.S. If any such engines are manufactured in the U.S. after April 1, 
2006 (July 1, 2006 for fire pump engines), they must be exported or must 
be brought into compliance with the appropriate standards prior to 
initial operation. The export provisions of 40 CFR 1068.230 would apply 
to engines for export and the manufacturers must

[[Page 872]]

label such engines according to 40 CFR 1068.230.
    (3) Stationary CI internal combustion engines manufactured after 
January 1, 2007 (for fire pump engines, after January 1 of the year 
listed in table 3 to this subpart, as applicable) must be labeled 
according to paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section.
    (i) Stationary CI internal combustion engines that meet the 
requirements of this subpart and the corresponding requirements for 
nonroad (including marine) engines of the same model year and HP must be 
labeled according to the provisions in part 89, 94 or 1039, as 
appropriate.
    (ii) Stationary CI internal combustion engines that meet the 
requirements of this subpart, but are not certified to the standards 
applicable to nonroad (including marine) engines of the same model year 
and HP must be labeled according to the provisions in part 89, 94 or 
1039, as appropriate, but the words ``stationary'' must be included 
instead of ``nonroad'' or ``marine'' on the label. In addition, such 
engines must be labeled according to 40 CFR 1039.20.
    (iii) Stationary CI internal combustion engines that do not meet the 
requirements of this subpart must be labeled according to 40 CFR 
1068.230 and must be exported under the provisions of 40 CFR 1068.230.
    (d) An engine manufacturer certifying an engine family or families 
to standards under this subpart that are identical to standards 
applicable under parts 89, 94, or 1039 for that model year may certify 
any such family that contains both nonroad (including marine) and 
stationary engines as a single engine family and/or may include any such 
family containing stationary engines in the averaging, banking and 
trading provisions applicable for such engines under those parts.
    (e) Manufacturers of engine families discussed in paragraph (d) of 
this section may meet the labeling requirements referred to in paragraph 
(c) of this section for stationary CI ICE by either adding a separate 
label containing the information required in paragraph (c) of this 
section or by adding the words ``and stationary'' after the word 
``nonroad'' or ``marine,'' as appropriate, to the label.
    (f) Starting with the model years shown in table 5 to this subpart, 
stationary CI internal combustion engine manufacturers must add a 
permanent label stating that the engine is for stationary emergency use 
only to each new emergency stationary CI internal combustion engine 
greater than or equal to 19 KW (25 HP) that meets all the emission 
standards for emergency engines in Sec. 60.4202 but does not meet all 
the emission standards for non-emergency engines in Sec. 60.4201. The 
label must be added according to the labeling requirements specified in 
40 CFR 1039.135(b). Engine manufacturers must specify in the owner's 
manual that operation of emergency engines is limited to emergency 
operations and required maintenance and testing.
    (g) Manufacturers of fire pump engines may use the test cycle in 
table 6 to this subpart for testing fire pump engines and may test at 
the NFPA certified nameplate HP, provided that the engine is labeled as 
``Fire Pump Applications Only''.
    (h) Engine manufacturers, including importers, may introduce into 
commerce uncertified engines or engines certified to earlier standards 
that were manufactured before the new or changed standards took effect 
until inventories are depleted, as long as such engines are part of 
normal inventory. For example, if the engine manufacturers' normal 
industry practice is to keep on hand a one-month supply of engines based 
on its projected sales, and a new tier of standards starts to apply for 
the 2009 model year, the engine manufacturer may manufacture engines 
based on the normal inventory requirements late in the 2008 model year, 
and sell those engines for installation. The engine manufacturer may not 
circumvent the provisions of Sec. Sec. 60.4201 or 60.4202 by 
stockpiling engines that are built before new or changed standards take 
effect. Stockpiling of such engines beyond normal industry practice is a 
violation of this subpart.
    (i) The replacement engine provisions of 40 CFR 89.1003(b)(7), 40 
CFR 94.1103(b)(3), 40 CFR 94.1103(b)(4) and 40 CFR 1068.240 are

          to the ultimate CO<INF>2 volume produced by the fuel at 
          zero percent excess air.
0.209 = Fraction of air that is O<INF>2, percent/100.
F<INF>d = Ratio of the volume of dry effluent gas to the gross 
          calorific value of the fuel from Method 19, dsm\3\/J (dscf/

F<INF>c = Ratio of the volume of CO<INF>2 produced to the 
          gross calorific value of the fuel from Method 19, dsm\3\/J 
          (dscf/10\6\ Btu).

    (ii) Calculate the CO<INF>2 correction factor for correcting 
measurement data to 15 percent O<INF>2, as follows:

5.9 = 20.9 percent O<INF>2-15 percent O<INF>2, the defined 
          O<INF>2 correction value, percent.

    (iii) Calculate the NO<INF>X and PM gas concentrations 
adjusted to 15 percent O<INF>2 using CO<INF>2 as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11JY06.005

Where:

C<INF>adj = Calculated NO<INF>X or PM concentration adjusted 
          to 15 percent O<INF>2.
C<INF>d = Measured concentration of NO<INF>X or PM, 
          uncorrected.
%CO<INF>2 = Measured CO<INF>2 concentration, dry basis, 
          percent.

    (e) To determine compliance with the NO<INF>X mass per unit 
output emission limitation, convert the concentration of NO<INF>X 
in the engine exhaust using Equation 7 of this section:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11JY06.006

          grams per standard cubic meter at 25 degrees Celsius.
Q = Stack gas volumetric flow rate, in standard cubic meter per hour.
T = Time of test run, in hours.
KW-hour = Brake work of the engine, in KW-hour.

    (f) To determine compliance with the PM mass per unit output 
emission limitation, convert the concentration of PM in the engine 
exhaust using Equation 8 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR11JY06.007

Where:

ER = Emission rate in grams per KW-hour.
C<INF>adj = Calculated PM concentration in grams per standard 
          cubic meter.

<R05>
Sec. 60.4219  What definitions apply to this subpart?

    As used in this subpart, all terms not defined herein shall have the 
meaning given them in the CAA and in subpart A of this part.
    Combustion turbine means all equipment, including but not limited to 
the turbine, the fuel, air, lubrication and exhaust gas systems, control 
systems (except emissions control equipment), and any ancillary 
components and sub-components comprising any simple cycle combustion 
turbine, any regenerative/recuperative cycle combustion turbine, the 
combustion turbine portion of any cogeneration cycle combustion system, 
or the combustion turbine portion of any combined cycle steam/electric 
generating system.
    Compression ignition means relating to a type of stationary internal 
combustion engine that is not a spark ignition engine.
    Diesel fuel means any liquid obtained from the distillation of 
petroleum with a boiling point of approximately 150 to 360 degrees 
Celsius. One commonly used form is number 2 distillate oil.
    Diesel particulate filter means an emission control technology that 
reduces PM emissions by trapping the particles in a flow filter 
substrate and periodically removes the collected particles by either 
physical action or by oxidizing (burning off) the particles in a process 
called regeneration.
    Emergency stationary internal combustion engine means any stationary 
internal combustion engine whose operation is limited to emergency 
situations and required testing and maintenance. Examples include 
stationary ICE used to produce power for critical networks or equipment 
(including power supplied to portions of a facility) when electric power 
from the local utility (or the normal power source, if the facility runs 
on its own power production) is interrupted, or stationary ICE used to 
pump water in the case of fire or flood, etc. Stationary CI ICE used to 
supply power to an electric grid or that supply power as part of a 
financial arrangement with another entity are not considered to be 
emergency engines.
    Engine manufacturer means the manufacturer of the engine. See the 
definition of ``manufacturer'' in this section.
    Fire pump engine means an emergency stationary internal combustion 
engine certified to NFPA requirements that is used to provide power to 
pump water for fire suppression or protection.
    Manufacturer has the meaning given in section 216(1) of the Act. In 
general, this term includes any person who manufactures a stationary 
engine for sale in the United States or otherwise introduces a new 
stationary engine into commerce in the United States. This includes 
importers who import stationary engines for sale or resale.
    Maximum engine power means maximum engine power as defined in 40 CFR 
1039.801.
    Model year means either:
    (1) The calendar year in which the engine was originally produced, 
or
    (2) The annual new model production period of the engine 
manufacturer if it is different than the calendar year. This must 
include January 1 of the calendar year for which the model year is 
named. It may not begin before January 2 of the previous calendar year 
and it must end by December 31 of the named calendar year. For an engine 
that is converted to a stationary engine after being placed into service 
as a nonroad or other non-stationary engine, model year means the 
calendar year or new model production period in which the engine was 
originally produced.
    Other internal combustion engine means any internal combustion 
engine, except combustion turbines, which is not a reciprocating 
internal combustion engine or rotary internal combustion engine.
    Reciprocating internal combustion engine means any internal 
combustion engine which uses reciprocating motion to convert heat energy 
into mechanical work.

[[Page 879]]

    Rotary internal combustion engine means any internal combustion 
engine which uses rotary motion to convert heat energy into mechanical 
work.
    Spark ignition means relating to a gasoline, natural gas, or 
liquefied petroleum gas fueled engine or any other type of engine with a 
spark plug (or other sparking device) and with operating characteristics 
significantly similar to the theoretical Otto combustion cycle. Spark 
ignition engines usually use a throttle to regulate intake air flow to 
control power during normal operation. Dual-fuel engines in which a 
liquid fuel (typically diesel fuel) is used for CI and gaseous fuel 
(typically natural gas) is used as the primary fuel at an annual average 
ratio of less than 2 parts diesel fuel to 100 parts total fuel on an 
energy equivalent basis are spark ignition engines.
    Stationary internal combustion engine means any internal combustion 
engine, except combustion turbines, that converts heat energy into 
mechanical work and is not mobile. Stationary ICE differ from mobile ICE 
in that a stationary internal combustion engine is not a nonroad engine 
as defined at 40 CFR 1068.30 (excluding paragraph (2)(ii) of that 
definition), and is not used to propel a motor vehicle or a vehicle used 
solely for competition. Stationary ICE include reciprocating ICE, rotary 
ICE, and other ICE, except combustion turbines.
    Subpart means 40 CFR part 60, subpart IIII.
    Useful life means the period during which the engine is designed to 
properly function in terms of reliability and fuel consumption, without 
being remanufactured, specified as a number of hours of operation or 
calendar years, whichever comes first. The values for useful life for 
stationary CI ICE with a displacement of less than 10 liters per 
cylinder are given in 40 CFR 1039.101(g). The values for useful life for 
stationary CI ICE with a displacement of greater than or equal to 10 
liters per cylinder and less than 30 liters per cylinder are given in 40 
CFR 94.9(a).

Subpart JJJJ [Reserved]


<R04>
Subpart KKKK_Standards of Performance for Stationary Combustion Turbines

    Source: 71 FR 38497, July 6, 2006, unless otherwise noted.

                              Introduction


<R05>
Sec. 60.4300  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    This subpart establishes emission standards and compliance schedules 
for the control of emissions from stationary combustion turbines that 
commenced construction, modification or reconstruction after February 
18, 2005.

                              Applicability


<R05>
Sec. 60.4305  Does this subpart apply to my stationary

combustion turbine?

    (a) If you are the owner or operator of a stationary combustion 
turbine with a heat input at peak load equal to or greater than 10.7 
gigajoules (10 MMBtu) per hour, based on the higher heating value of the 
fuel, which commenced construction, modification, or reconstruction 
after February 18, 2005, your turbine is subject to this subpart. Only 
heat input to the combustion turbine should be included when determining 
whether or not this subpart is applicable to your turbine. Any 
additional heat input to associated heat recovery steam generators 
(HRSG) or duct burners should not be included when determining your peak 
heat input. However, this subpart does apply to emissions from any 
associated HRSG and duct burners.
    (b) Stationary combustion turbines regulated under this subpart are 
exempt from the requirements of subpart GG of this part. Heat recovery 
steam generators and duct burners regulated under this subpart are 
exempted from the requirements of subparts Da, Db, and Dc of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 60.4310  What types of operations are exempt from these 

standards of performance?

    (a) Emergency combustion turbines, as defined in Sec. 60.4420(i), 
are exempt from the nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X) emission limits in 
Sec. 60.4320.
    (b) Stationary combustion turbines engaged by manufacturers in 
research and development of equipment for both combustion turbine 
emission control techniques and combustion turbine efficiency 
improvements are exempt from the NO<INF>X emission limits in Sec. 
60.4320 on a case-by-case basis as determined by the Administrator.
    (c) Stationary combustion turbines at integrated gasification 
combined cycle electric utility steam generating units that are subject 
to subpart Da of this part are exempt from this subpart.
    (d) Combustion turbine test cells/stands are exempt from this 
subpart.

                             Emission Limits


<R05>
Sec. 60.4315  What pollutants are regulated by this subpart?

    The pollutants regulated by this subpart are nitrogen oxide 
(NO<INF>X) and sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2).


<R05>
Sec. 60.4320  What emission limits must I meet for nitrogen oxides (NOX)?

    (a) You must meet the emission limits for NO<INF>X specified 
in Table 1 to this subpart.
    (b) If you have two or more turbines that are connected to a single 
generator, each turbine must meet the emission limits for 
NO<INF>X.


<R05>
Sec. 60.4325  What emission limits must I meet for NOX if my 

turbine burns both natural gas and distillate oil (or some other 
combination of fuels)?

    You must meet the emission limits specified in Table 1 to this 
subpart. If your total heat input is greater than or equal to 50 percent 
natural gas, you must meet the corresponding limit for a natural gas-
fired turbine when you are burning that fuel. Similarly, when your total 
heat input is greater than 50 percent distillate oil and fuels other 
than natural gas, you must meet the corresponding limit for distillate 
oil and fuels other than natural gas for the duration of the time that 
you burn that particular fuel.

[[Page 885]]


<R05>
Sec. 60.4330  What emission limits must I meet for sulfur dioxide (SO2)?

    (a) If your turbine is located in a continental area, you must 
comply with either paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section. If your 
turbine is located in Alaska, you do not have to comply with the 
requirements in paragraph (a) of this section until January 1, 2008.
    (1) You must not cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from the 
subject stationary combustion turbine any gases which contain 
SO<INF>2 in excess of 110 nanograms per Joule (ng/J) (0.90 pounds 
per megawatt-hour (lb/MWh)) gross output, or
    (2) You must not burn in the subject stationary combustion turbine 
any fuel which contains total potential sulfur emissions in excess of 26 
ng SO<INF>2/J (0.060 lb SO<INF>2/MMBtu) heat input. If your 
turbine simultaneously fires multiple fuels, each fuel must meet this 
requirement.
    (b) If your turbine is located in a noncontinental area or a 
continental area that the Administrator determines does not have access 
to natural gas and that the removal of sulfur compounds would cause more 
environmental harm than benefit, you must comply with one or the other 
of the following conditions:
    (1) You must not cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from the 
subject stationary combustion turbine any gases which contain 
SO<INF>2 in excess of 780 ng/J (6.2 lb/MWh) gross output, or
    (2) You must not burn in the subject stationary combustion turbine 
any fuel which contains total sulfur with potential sulfur emissions in 
excess of 180 ng SO<INF>2/J (0.42 lb SO<INF>2/MMBtu) heat 
input. If your turbine simultaneously fires multiple fuels, each fuel 
must meet this requirement.

                     General Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 60.4333  What are my general requirements for complying 

with this subpart?

    (a) You must operate and maintain your stationary combustion 
turbine, air pollution control equipment, and monitoring equipment in a 
manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for 
minimizing emissions at all times including during startup, shutdown, 
and malfunction.
    (b) When an affected unit with heat recovery utilizes a common steam 
header with one or more combustion turbines, the owner or operator shall 
either:
    (1) Determine compliance with the applicable NO<INF>X 
emissions limits by measuring the emissions combined with the emissions 
from the other unit(s) utilizing the common heat recovery unit; or
    (2) Develop, demonstrate, and provide information satisfactory to 
the Administrator on methods for apportioning the combined gross energy 
output from the heat recovery unit for each of the affected combustion 
turbines. The Administrator may approve such demonstrated substitute 
methods for apportioning the combined gross energy output measured at 
the steam turbine whenever the demonstration ensures accurate estimation 
of emissions related under this part.

                               Monitoring


<R05>
Sec. 60.4335  How do I demonstrate compliance for NOX if I use 

water or steam injection?

    (a) If you are using water or steam injection to control 
NO<INF>X emissions, you must install, calibrate, maintain and 
operate a continuous monitoring system to monitor and record the fuel 
consumption and the ratio of water or steam to fuel being fired in the 
turbine when burning a fuel that requires water or steam injection for 
compliance.
    (b) Alternatively, you may use continuous emission monitoring, as 
follows:
    (1) Install, certify, maintain, and operate a continuous emission 
monitoring system (CEMS) consisting of a NO<INF>X monitor and a 
diluent gas (oxygen (O<INF>2) or carbon dioxide (CO<INF>2)) 
monitor, to determine the hourly NO<INF>X emission rate in parts 
per million (ppm) or pounds per million British thermal units (lb/
MMBtu); and
    (2) For units complying with the output-based standard, install, 
calibrate, maintain, and operate a fuel flow meter (or flow meters) to 
continuously measure the heat input to the affected unit; and

[[Page 886]]

    (3) For units complying with the output-based standard, install, 
calibrate, maintain, and operate a watt meter (or meters) to 
continuously measure the gross electrical output of the unit in 
megawatt-hours; and
    (4) For combined heat and power units complying with the output-
based standard, install, calibrate, maintain, and operate meters for 
useful recovered energy flow rate, temperature, and pressure, to 
continuously measure the total thermal energy output in British thermal 
units per hour (Btu/h).


<R05>
Sec. 60.4340  How do I demonstrate continuous compliance for NOX 

if I do not use water or steam injection?

    (a) If you are not using water or steam injection to control 
NO<INF>X emissions, you must perform annual performance tests in 
accordance with Sec. 60.4400 to demonstrate continuous compliance. If 
the NO<INF>X emission result from the performance test is less 
than or equal to 75 percent of the NO<INF>X emission limit for the 
turbine, you may reduce the frequency of subsequent performance tests to 
once every 2 years (no more than 26 calendar months following the 
previous performance test). If the results of any subsequent performance 
test exceed 75 percent of the NO<INF>X emission limit for the 
turbine, you must resume annual performance tests.
    (b) As an alternative, you may install, calibrate, maintain and 
operate one of the following continuous monitoring systems:
    (1) Continuous emission monitoring as described in Sec. Sec. 
60.4335(b) and 60.4345, or
    (2) Continuous parameter monitoring as follows:
    (i) For a diffusion flame turbine without add-on selective catalytic 
reduction (SCR) controls, you must define parameters indicative of the 
unit's NO<INF>X formation characteristics, and you must monitor 
these parameters continuously.
    (ii) For any lean premix stationary combustion turbine, you must 
continuously monitor the appropriate parameters to determine whether the 
unit is operating in low-NO<INF>X mode.
    (iii) For any turbine that uses SCR to reduce NO<INF>X 
emissions, you must continuously monitor appropriate parameters to 
verify the proper operation of the emission controls.
    (iv) For affected units that are also regulated under part 75 of 
this chapter, with state approval you can monitor the NO<INF>X 
emission rate using the methodology in appendix E to part 75 of this 
chapter, or the low mass emissions methodology in Sec. 75.19, the 
requirements of this paragraph (b) may be met by performing the 
parametric monitoring described in section 2.3 of part 75 appendix E or 
in Sec. 75.19(c)(1)(iv)(H).


<R05>
Sec. 60.4345  What are the requirements for the continuous emission

monitoring system equipment, if I choose to use this option?

    If the option to use a NO<INF>X CEMS is chosen:
    (a) Each NO<INF>X diluent CEMS must be installed and certified 
according to Performance Specification 2 (PS 2) in appendix B to this 
part, except the 7-day calibration drift is based on unit operating 
days, not calendar days. With state approval, Procedure 1 in appendix F 
to this part is not required. Alternatively, a NO<INF>X diluent 
CEMS that is installed and certified according to appendix A of part 75 
of this chapter is acceptable for use under this subpart. The relative 
accuracy test audit (RATA) of the CEMS shall be performed on a lb/MMBtu 
basis.
    (b) As specified in Sec. 60.13(e)(2), during each full unit 
operating hour, both the NO<INF>X monitor and the diluent monitor 
must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, 
and data recording) for each 15-minute quadrant of the hour, to validate 
the hour. For partial unit operating hours, at least one valid data 
point must be obtained with each monitor for each quadrant of the hour 
in which the unit operates. For unit operating hours in which required 
quality assurance and maintenance activities are performed on the CEMS, 
a minimum of two valid data points (one in each of two quadrants) are 
required for each monitor to validate the NO<INF>X emission rate 
for the hour.
    (c) Each fuel flowmeter shall be installed, calibrated, maintained, 
and operated according to the manufacturer's instructions. 
Alternatively, with state approval, fuel flowmeters that meet

[[Page 887]]

the installation, certification, and quality assurance requirements of 
appendix D to part 75 of this chapter are acceptable for use under this 
subpart.
    (d) Each watt meter, steam flow meter, and each pressure or 
temperature measurement device shall be installed, calibrated, 
maintained, and operated according to manufacturer's instructions.
    (e) The owner or operator shall develop and keep on-site a quality 
assurance (QA) plan for all of the continuous monitoring equipment 
described in paragraphs (a), (c), and (d) of this section. For the CEMS 
and fuel flow meters, the owner or operator may, with state approval, 
satisfy the requirements of this paragraph by implementing the QA 
program and plan described in section 1 of appendix B to part 75 of this 
chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 60.4350  How do I use data from the continuous emission 

monitoring equipment to identify excess emissions?

    For purposes of identifying excess emissions:
    (a) All CEMS data must be reduced to hourly averages as specified in 
Sec. 60.13(h).
    (b) For each unit operating hour in which a valid hourly average, as 
described in Sec. 60.4345(b), is obtained for both NO<INF>X and 
diluent monitors, the data acquisition and handling system must 
calculate and record the hourly NO<INF>X emission rate in units of 
ppm or lb/MMBtu, using the appropriate equation from method 19 in 
appendix A of this part. For any hour in which the hourly average 
O<INF>2 concentration exceeds 19.0 percent O<INF>2 (or the 
hourly average CO<INF>2 concentration is less than 1.0 percent 
CO<INF>2), a diluent cap value of 19.0 percent O<INF>2 or 
1.0 percent CO<INF>2 (as applicable) may be used in the emission 
calculations.
    (c) Correction of measured NO<INF>X concentrations to 15 
percent O<INF>2 is not allowed.
    (d) If you have installed and certified a NO<INF>X diluent 
CEMS to meet the requirements of part 75 of this chapter, states can 
approve that only quality assured data from the CEMS shall be used to 
identify excess emissions under this subpart. Periods where the missing 
data substitution procedures in subpart D of part 75 are applied are to 
be reported as monitor downtime in the excess emissions and monitoring 
performance report required under Sec. 60.7(c).
    (e) All required fuel flow rate, steam flow rate, temperature, 
pressure, and megawatt data must be reduced to hourly averages.
    (f) Calculate the hourly average NO<INF>X emission rates, in 
units of the emission standards under Sec. 60.4320, using either ppm 
for units complying with the concentration limit or the following 
equation for units complying with the output based standard:
    (1) For simple-cycle operation:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06JY06.000
    
Where:

E = hourly NO<INF>X emission rate, in lb/MWh,
(NO<INF>X)<INF>h = hourly NO<INF>X emission rate, in 
lb/MMBtu,
(HI)<INF>h = hourly heat input rate to the unit, in MMBtu/h, 
measured using the fuel flowmeter(s), e.g., calculated using Equation D-
15a in appendix D to part 75 of this chapter, and
P = gross energy output of the combustion turbine in MW.

    (2) For combined-cycle and combined heat and power complying with 
the output-based standard, use Equation 1 of this subpart, except that 
the gross energy output is calculated as the sum of the total electrical 
and mechanical energy generated by the combustion turbine, the 
additional electrical or mechanical energy (if any) generated by the 
steam turbine following the heat recovery steam generator, and 100 
percent of the total useful thermal energy output that is not used to 
generate additional electricity or mechanical output, expressed in 
equivalent MW, as in the following equations:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06JY06.001

Where:

P = gross energy output of the stationary combustion turbine system in 
MW.
(Pe)<INF>t = electrical or mechanical energy output of the 
combustion turbine in MW,
(Pe)<INF>c = electrical or mechanical energy output (if any) of 
the steam turbine in MW, and

[[Page 888]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06JY06.002

Where:

Ps = useful thermal energy of the steam, measured relative to ISO 
conditions, not used to generate additional electric or mechanical 
output, in MW,
Q = measured steam flow rate in lb/h,
H = enthalpy of the steam at measured temperature and pressure relative 
to ISO conditions, in Btu/lb, and 3.413 x 10<INF>6 = conversion 
from Btu/h to MW.


    Po = other useful heat recovery, measured relative to ISO 
conditions, not used for steam generation or performance enhancement of 
the combustion turbine.

    (3) For mechanical drive applications complying with the output-
based standard, use the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06JY06.003


Where:

E = NO<INF>X emission rate in lb/MWh,
(NO<INF>X)<INF>m = NO<INF>X emission rate in lb/h,
BL = manufacturer's base load rating of turbine, in MW, and
AL = actual load as a percentage of the base load.

    (g) For simple cycle units without heat recovery, use the calculated 
hourly average emission rates from paragraph (f) of this section to 
assess excess emissions on a 4-hour rolling average basis, as described 
in Sec. 60.4380(b)(1).
    (h) For combined cycle and combined heat and power units with heat 
recovery, use the calculated hourly average emission rates from 
paragraph (f) of this section to assess excess emissions on a 30 unit 
operating day rolling average basis, as described in Sec. 
60.4380(b)(1).


<R05>
Sec. 60.4355  How do I establish and document a proper parameter

monitoring plan?

    (a) The steam or water to fuel ratio or other parameters that are 
continuously monitored as described in Sec. Sec. 60.4335 and 60.4340 
must be monitored during the performance test required under Sec. 60.8, 
to establish acceptable values and ranges. You may supplement the 
performance test data with engineering analyses, design specifications, 
manufacturer's recommendations and other relevant information to define 
the acceptable parametric ranges more precisely. You must develop and 
keep on-site a parameter monitoring plan which explains the procedures 
used to document proper operation of the NO<INF>X emission 
controls. The plan must:
    (1) Include the indicators to be monitored and show there is a 
significant relationship to emissions and proper operation of the 
NO<INF>X emission controls,
    (2) Pick ranges (or designated conditions) of the indicators, or 
describe the process by which such range (or designated condition) will 
be established,
    (3) Explain the process you will use to make certain that you obtain 
data that are representative of the emissions or parameters being 
monitored (such as detector location, installation specification if 
applicable),
    (4) Describe quality assurance and control practices that are 
adequate to ensure the continuing validity of the data,
    (5) Describe the frequency of monitoring and the data collection 
procedures which you will use (e.g., you are using a computerized data 
acquisition over a number of discrete data points with the average (or 
maximum value) being used for purposes of determining whether an 
exceedance has occurred), and
    (6) Submit justification for the proposed elements of the 
monitoring. If a proposed performance specification differs from 
manufacturer recommendation, you must explain the reasons for the 
differences. You must submit the data supporting the justification, but 
you may refer to generally available sources of information used to 
support the justification. You may rely on engineering assessments and 
other data, provided you demonstrate factors which assure compliance or 
explain why performance testing is unnecessary to establish indicator 
ranges. When establishing indicator ranges, you may choose to simplify 
the process by treating the parameters as if they were correlated. Using 
this assumption, testing can be divided into two cases:
    (i) All indicators are significant only on one end of range (e.g., 
for a thermal incinerator controlling volatile organic compounds (VOC) 
it is only important

[[Page 889]]

to insure a minimum temperature, not a maximum). In this case, you may 
conduct your study so that each parameter is at the significant limit of 
its range while you conduct your emissions testing. If the emissions 
tests show that the source is in compliance at the significant limit of 
each parameter, then as long as each parameter is within its limit, you 
are presumed to be in compliance.
    (ii) Some or all indicators are significant on both ends of the 
range. In this case, you may conduct your study so that each parameter 
that is significant at both ends of its range assumes its extreme values 
in all possible combinations of the extreme values (either single or 
double) of all of the other parameters. For example, if there were only 
two parameters, A and B, and A had a range of values while B had only a 
minimum value, the combinations would be A high with B minimum and A low 
with B minimum. If both A and B had a range, the combinations would be A 
high and B high, A low and B low, A high and B low, A low and B high. 
For the case of four parameters all having a range, there are 16 
possible combinations.
    (b) For affected units that are also subject to part 75 of this 
chapter and that have state approval to use the low mass emissions 
methodology in Sec. 75.19 or the NO<INF>X emission measurement 
methodology in appendix E to part 75, you may meet the requirements of 
this paragraph by developing and keeping on-site (or at a central 
location for unmanned facilities) a QA plan, as described in Sec. 
75.19(e)(5) or in section 2.3 of appendix E to part 75 of this chapter 
and section 1.3.6 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 60.4360  How do I determine the total sulfur content of the 

turbine's combustion fuel?

    You must monitor the total sulfur content of the fuel being fired in 
the turbine, except as provided in Sec. 60.4365. The sulfur content of 
the fuel must be determined using total sulfur methods described in 
Sec. 60.4415. Alternatively, if the total sulfur content of the gaseous 
fuel during the most recent performance test was less than half the 
applicable limit, ASTM D4084, D4810, D5504, or D6228, or Gas Processors 
Association Standard 2377 (all of which are incorporated by reference, 
see Sec. 60.17), which measure the major sulfur compounds, may be used.


<R05>
Sec. 60.4365  How can I be exempted from monitoring the total sulfur

content of the fuel?

    You may elect not to monitor the total sulfur content of the fuel 
combusted in the turbine, if the fuel is demonstrated not to exceed 
potential sulfur emissions of 26 ng SO<INF>2/J (0.060 lb 
SO<INF>2/MMBtu) heat input for units located in continental areas 
and 180 ng SO<INF>2/J (0.42 lb SO<INF>2/MMBtu) heat input 
for units located in noncontinental areas or a continental area that the 
Administrator determines does not have access to natural gas and that 
the removal of sulfur compounds would cause more environmental harm than 
benefit. You must use one of the following sources of information to 
make the required demonstration:
    (a) The fuel quality characteristics in a current, valid purchase 
contract, tariff sheet or transportation contract for the fuel, 
specifying that the maximum total sulfur content for oil use in 
continental areas is 0.05 weight percent (500 ppmw) or less and 0.4 
weight percent (4,000 ppmw) or less for noncontinental areas, the total 
sulfur content for natural gas use in continental areas is 20 grains of 
sulfur or less per 100 standard cubic feet and 140 grains of sulfur or 
less per 100 standard cubic feet for noncontinental areas, has potential 
sulfur emissions of less than less than 26 ng SO<INF>2/J (0.060 lb 
SO<INF>2/MMBtu) heat input for continental areas and has potential 
sulfur emissions of less than less than 180 ng SO<INF>2/J (0.42 lb 
SO<INF>2/MMBtu) heat input for noncontinental areas; or
    (b) Representative fuel sampling data which show that the sulfur 
content of the fuel does not exceed 26 ng SO<INF>2/J (0.060 lb 
SO<INF>2/MMBtu) heat input for continental areas or 180 ng 
SO<INF>2/J (0.42 lb SO<INF>2/MMBtu) heat input for 
noncontinental areas. At a minimum, the amount of fuel sampling data 
specified in section 2.3.1.4 or 2.3.2.4 of appendix D to part 75 of this 
chapter is required.

[[Page 890]]


<R05>
Sec. 60.4370  How often must I determine the sulfur content of the fuel?

    The frequency of determining the sulfur content of the fuel must be 
as follows:
    (a) Fuel oil. For fuel oil, use one of the total sulfur sampling 
options and the associated sampling frequency described in sections 
2.2.3, 2.2.4.1, 2.2.4.2, and 2.2.4.3 of appendix D to part 75 of this 
chapter (i.e., flow proportional sampling, daily sampling, sampling from 
the unit's storage tank after each addition of fuel to the tank, or 
sampling each delivery prior to combining it with fuel oil already in 
the intended storage tank).
    (b) Gaseous fuel. If you elect not to demonstrate sulfur content 
using options in Sec. 60.4365, and the fuel is supplied without 
intermediate bulk storage, the sulfur content value of the gaseous fuel 
must be determined and recorded once per unit operating day.
    (c) Custom schedules. Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph 
(b) of this section, operators or fuel vendors may develop custom 
schedules for determination of the total sulfur content of gaseous 
fuels, based on the design and operation of the affected facility and 
the characteristics of the fuel supply. Except as provided in paragraphs 
(c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, custom schedules shall be 
substantiated with data and shall be approved by the Administrator 
before they can be used to comply with the standard in Sec. 60.4330.
    (1) The two custom sulfur monitoring schedules set forth in 
paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv) and in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section are acceptable, without prior Administrative approval:
    (i) The owner or operator shall obtain daily total sulfur content 
measurements for 30 consecutive unit operating days, using the 
applicable methods specified in this subpart. Based on the results of 
the 30 daily samples, the required frequency for subsequent monitoring 
of the fuel's total sulfur content shall be as specified in paragraph 
(c)(1)(ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section, as applicable.
    (ii) If none of the 30 daily measurements of the fuel's total sulfur 
content exceeds half the applicable standard, subsequent sulfur content 
monitoring may be performed at 12-month intervals. If any of the samples 
taken at 12-month intervals has a total sulfur content greater than half 
but less than the applicable limit, follow the procedures in paragraph 
(c)(1)(iii) of this section. If any measurement exceeds the applicable 
limit, follow the procedures in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section.
    (iii) If at least one of the 30 daily measurements of the fuel's 
total sulfur content is greater than half but less than the applicable 
limit, but none exceeds the applicable limit, then:
    (A) Collect and analyze a sample every 30 days for 3 months. If any 
sulfur content measurement exceeds the applicable limit, follow the 
procedures in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section. Otherwise, follow 
the procedures in paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(B) of this section.
    (B) Begin monitoring at 6-month intervals for 12 months. If any 
sulfur content measurement exceeds the applicable limit, follow the 
procedures in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section. Otherwise, follow 
the procedures in paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(C) of this section.
    (C) Begin monitoring at 12-month intervals. If any sulfur content 
measurement exceeds the applicable limit, follow the procedures in 
paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section. Otherwise, continue to monitor at 
this frequency.
    (iv) If a sulfur content measurement exceeds the applicable limit, 
immediately begin daily monitoring according to paragraph (c)(1)(i) of 
this section. Daily monitoring shall continue until 30 consecutive daily 
samples, each having a sulfur content no greater than the applicable 
limit, are obtained. At that point, the applicable procedures of 
paragraph (c)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section shall be followed.
    (2) The owner or operator may use the data collected from the 720-
hour sulfur sampling demonstration described in section 2.3.6 of 
appendix D to part 75 of this chapter to determine a custom sulfur 
sampling schedule, as follows:
    (i) If the maximum fuel sulfur content obtained from the 720 hourly 
samples does not exceed 20 grains/100 scf, no additional monitoring of 
the sulfur content of the gas is required, for the purposes of this 
subpart.

[[Page 891]]

    (ii) If the maximum fuel sulfur content obtained from any of the 720 
hourly samples exceeds 20 grains/100 scf, but none of the sulfur content 
values (when converted to weight percent sulfur) exceeds half the 
applicable limit, then the minimum required sampling frequency shall be 
one sample at 12 month intervals.
    (iii) If any sample result exceeds half the applicable limit, but 
none exceeds the applicable limit, follow the provisions of paragraph 
(c)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (iv) If the sulfur content of any of the 720 hourly samples exceeds 
the applicable limit, follow the provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of 
this section.

                                Reporting


<R05>
Sec. 60.4375  What reports must I submit?

    (a) For each affected unit required to continuously monitor 
parameters or emissions, or to periodically determine the fuel sulfur 
content under this subpart, you must submit reports of excess emissions 
and monitor downtime, in accordance with Sec. 60.7(c). Excess emissions 
must be reported for all periods of unit operation, including start-up, 
shutdown, and malfunction.
    (b) For each affected unit that performs annual performance tests in 
accordance with Sec. 60.4340(a), you must submit a written report of 
the results of each performance test before the close of business on the 
60th day following the completion of the performance test.


<R05>
Sec. 60.4380  How are excess emissions and monitor downtime defined 

for NOX?

    For the purpose of reports required under Sec. 60.7(c), periods of 
excess emissions and monitor downtime that must be reported are defined 
as follows:
    (a) For turbines using water or steam to fuel ratio monitoring:
    (1) An excess emission is any unit operating hour for which the 4-
hour rolling average steam or water to fuel ratio, as measured by the 
continuous monitoring system, falls below the acceptable steam or water 
to fuel ratio needed to demonstrate compliance with Sec. 60.4320, as 
established during the performance test required in Sec. 60.8. Any unit 
operating hour in which no water or steam is injected into the turbine 
when a fuel is being burned that requires water or steam injection for 
NO<INF>X control will also be considered an excess emission.
    (2) A period of monitor downtime is any unit operating hour in which 
water or steam is injected into the turbine, but the essential 
parametric data needed to determine the steam or water to fuel ratio are 
unavailable or invalid.
    (3) Each report must include the average steam or water to fuel 
ratio, average fuel consumption, and the combustion turbine load during 
each excess emission.
    (b) For turbines using continuous emission monitoring, as described 
in Sec. Sec. 60.4335(b) and 60.4345:
    (1) An excess emissions is any unit operating period in which the 4-
hour or 30-day rolling average NO<INF>X emission rate exceeds the 
applicable emission limit in Sec. 60.4320. For the purposes of this 
subpart, a ``4-hour rolling average NO<INF>X emission rate'' is 
the arithmetic average of the average NO<INF>X emission rate in 
ppm or ng/J (lb/MWh) measured by the continuous emission monitoring 
equipment for a given hour and the three unit operating hour average 
NO<INF>X emission rates immediately preceding that unit operating 
hour. Calculate the rolling average if a valid NO<INF>X emission 
rate is obtained for at least 3 of the 4 hours. For the purposes of this 
subpart, a ``30-day rolling average NO<INF>X emission rate'' is 
the arithmetic average of all hourly NO<INF>X emission data in ppm 
or ng/J (lb/MWh) measured by the continuous emission monitoring 
equipment for a given day and the twenty-nine unit operating days 
immediately preceding that unit operating day. A new 30-day average is 
calculated each unit operating day as the average of all hourly 
NO<INF>X emissions rates for the preceding 30 unit operating days 
if a valid NO<INF>X emission rate is obtained for at least 75 
percent of all operating hours.
    (2) A period of monitor downtime is any unit operating hour in which 
the data for any of the following parameters are either missing or 
invalid: NO<INF>X concentration, CO<INF>2 or O<INF>2 
concentration, fuel flow rate, steam flow rate, steam temperature, steam 
pressure, or megawatts. The steam flow rate, steam

[[Page 892]]

temperature, and steam pressure are only required if you will use this 
information for compliance purposes.
    (3) For operating periods during which multiple emissions standards 
apply, the applicable standard is the average of the applicable 
standards during each hour. For hours with multiple emissions standards, 
the applicable limit for that hour is determined based on the condition 
that corresponded to the highest emissions standard.
    (c) For turbines required to monitor combustion parameters or 
parameters that document proper operation of the NO<INF>X emission 
controls:
    (1) An excess emission is a 4-hour rolling unit operating hour 
average in which any monitored parameter does not achieve the target 
value or is outside the acceptable range defined in the parameter 
monitoring plan for the unit.
    (2) A period of monitor downtime is a unit operating hour in which 
any of the required parametric data are either not recorded or are 
invalid.


<R05>
Sec. 60.4385  How are excess emissions and monitoring downtime defined

for SO[bdi2]?

    If you choose the option to monitor the sulfur content of the fuel, 
excess emissions and monitoring downtime are defined as follows:
    (a) For samples of gaseous fuel and for oil samples obtained using 
daily sampling, flow proportional sampling, or sampling from the unit's 
storage tank, an excess emission occurs each unit operating hour 
included in the period beginning on the date and hour of any sample for 
which the sulfur content of the fuel being fired in the combustion 
turbine exceeds the applicable limit and ending on the date and hour 
that a subsequent sample is taken that demonstrates compliance with the 
sulfur limit.
    (b) If the option to sample each delivery of fuel oil has been 
selected, you must immediately switch to one of the other oil sampling 
options (i.e., daily sampling, flow proportional sampling, or sampling 
from the unit's storage tank) if the sulfur content of a delivery 
exceeds 0.05 weight percent. You must continue to use one of the other 
sampling options until all of the oil from the delivery has been 
combusted, and you must evaluate excess emissions according to paragraph 
(a) of this section. When all of the fuel from the delivery has been 
burned, you may resume using the as-delivered sampling option.
    (c) A period of monitor downtime begins when a required sample is 
not taken by its due date. A period of monitor downtime also begins on 
the date and hour of a required sample, if invalid results are obtained. 
The period of monitor downtime ends on the date and hour of the next 
valid sample.


<R05>
Sec. 60.4390  What are my reporting requirements if I operate an 

emergency combustion turbine or a research and development turbine?

    (a) If you operate an emergency combustion turbine, you are exempt 
from the NO<INF>X limit and must submit an initial report to the 
Administrator stating your case.
    (b) Combustion turbines engaged by manufacturers in research and 
development of equipment for both combustion turbine emission control 
techniques and combustion turbine efficiency improvements may be 
exempted from the NO<INF>X limit on a case-by-case basis as 
determined by the Administrator. You must petition for the exemption.


<R05>
Sec. 60.4395  When must I submit my reports?

    All reports required under Sec. 60.7(c) must be postmarked by the 
30th day following the end of each 6-month period.

                            Performance Tests


<R05>
Sec. 60.4400  How do I conduct the initial and subsequent performance 

tests, regarding NOX?

    (a) You must conduct an initial performance test, as required in 
Sec. 60.8. Subsequent NO<INF>X performance tests shall be 
conducted on an annual basis (no more than 14 calendar months following 
the previous performance test).
    (1) There are two general methodologies that you may use to conduct 
the performance tests. For each test run:
    (i) Measure the NO<INF>X concentration (in parts per million 
(ppm)), using EPA

[[Page 893]]

Method 7E or EPA Method 20 in appendix A of this part. For units 
complying with the output based standard, concurrently measure the stack 
gas flow rate, using EPA Methods 1 and 2 in appendix A of this part, and 
measure and record the electrical and thermal output from the unit. 
Then, use the following equation to calculate the NO<INF>X 
emission rate:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06JY06.004

Where:

E = NO<INF>X emission rate, in lb/MWh
1.194 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> = conversion constant, in lb/dscf-ppm
(NO<INF>X)<INF>c = average NO<INF>X concentration for 
the run, in ppm
Q<INF>std = stack gas volumetric flow rate, in dscf/hr
P = gross electrical and mechanical energy output of the combustion 
turbine, in MW (for simple-cycle operation), for combined-cycle 
operation, the sum of all electrical and mechanical output from the 
combustion and steam turbines, or, for combined heat and power 
operation, the sum of all electrical and mechanical output from the 
combustion and steam turbines plus all useful recovered thermal output 
not used for additional electric or mechanical generation, in MW, 
calculated according to Sec. 60.4350(f)(2); or

    (ii) Measure the NO<INF>X and diluent gas concentrations, 
using either EPA Methods 7E and 3A, or EPA Method 20 in appendix A of 
this part. Concurrently measure the heat input to the unit, using a fuel 
flowmeter (or flowmeters), and measure the electrical and thermal output 
of the unit. Use EPA Method 19 in appendix A of this part to calculate 
the NO<INF>X emission rate in lb/MMBtu. Then, use Equations 1 and, 
if necessary, 2 and 3 in Sec. 60.4350(f) to calculate the 
NO<INF>X emission rate in lb/MWh.
    (2) Sampling traverse points for NO<INF>X and (if applicable) 
diluent gas are to be selected following EPA Method 20 or EPA Method 1 
(non-particulate procedures), and sampled for equal time intervals. The 
sampling must be performed with a traversing single-hole probe, or, if 
feasible, with a stationary multi-hole probe that samples each of the 
points sequentially. Alternatively, a multi-hole probe designed and 
documented to sample equal volumes from each hole may be used to sample 
simultaneously at the required points.
    (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(2) of this section, you may test 
at fewer points than are specified in EPA Method 1 or EPA Method 20 in 
appendix A of this part if the following conditions are met:
    (i) You may perform a stratification test for NO<INF>X and 
diluent pursuant to
    (A) [Reserved], or
    (B) The procedures specified in section 6.5.6.1(a) through (e) of 
appendix A of part 75 of this chapter.
    (ii) Once the stratification sampling is completed, you may use the 
following alternative sample point selection criteria for the 
performance test:
    (A) If each of the individual traverse point NO<INF>X 
concentrations is within <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>10 percent of the mean 
concentration for all traverse points, or the individual traverse point 
diluent concentrations differs by no more than <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>5ppm or <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 percent CO<INF>2 
(or O<INF>2) from the mean for all traverse points, then you may 
use three points (located either 16.7, 50.0 and 83.3 percent of the way 
across the stack or duct, or, for circular stacks or ducts greater than 
2.4 meters (7.8 feet) in diameter, at 0.4, 1.2, and 2.0 meters from the 
wall). The three points must be located along the measurement line that 
exhibited the highest average NO<INF>X concentration during the 
stratification test; or
    (B) For turbines with a NO<INF>X standard greater than 15 ppm 
@ 15% O<INF>2, you may sample at a single point, located at least 
1 meter from the stack wall or at the stack centroid if each of the 
individual traverse point NO<INF>X concentrations is within <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>5 percent of the mean concentration for all traverse 
points, or the individual traverse point diluent concentrations differs 
by no more than

[[Page 894]]

<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>3ppm or <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.3 percent 
CO<INF>2 (or O<INF>2) from the mean for all traverse points; 
or
    (C) For turbines with a NO<INF>X standard less than or equal 
to 15 ppm @ 15% O<INF>2, you may sample at a single point, located 
at least 1 meter from the stack wall or at the stack centroid if each of 
the individual traverse point NO<INF>X concentrations is within 
<plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>2.5 percent of the mean concentration for all 
traverse points, or the individual traverse point diluent concentrations 
differs by no more than <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1ppm or <plus-
minus<ls-thn-eq>0.15 percent CO<INF>2 (or O<INF>2) from the 
mean for all traverse points.
    (b) The performance test must be done at any load condition within 
plus or minus 25 percent of 100 percent of peak load. You may perform 
testing at the highest achievable load point, if at least 75 percent of 
peak load cannot be achieved in practice. You must conduct three 
separate test runs for each performance test. The minimum time per run 
is 20 minutes.
    (1) If the stationary combustion turbine combusts both oil and gas 
as primary or backup fuels, separate performance testing is required for 
each fuel.
    (2) For a combined cycle and CHP turbine systems with supplemental 
heat (duct burner), you must measure the total NO<INF>X emissions 
after the duct burner rather than directly after the turbine. The duct 
burner must be in operation during the performance test.
    (3) If water or steam injection is used to control NO<INF>X 
with no additional post-combustion NO<INF>X control and you choose 
to monitor the steam or water to fuel ratio in accordance with Sec. 
60.4335, then that monitoring system must be operated concurrently with 
each EPA Method 20 or EPA Method 7E run and must be used to determine 
the fuel consumption and the steam or water to fuel ratio necessary to 
comply with the applicable Sec. 60.4320 NO<INF>X emission limit.
    (4) Compliance with the applicable emission limit in Sec. 60.4320 
must be demonstrated at each tested load level. Compliance is achieved 
if the three-run arithmetic average NO<INF>X emission rate at each 
tested level meets the applicable emission limit in Sec. 60.4320.
    (5) If you elect to install a CEMS, the performance evaluation of 
the CEMS may either be conducted separately or (as described in Sec. 
60.4405) as part of the initial performance test of the affected unit.
    (6) The ambient temperature must be greater than 0 [deg]F during the 
performance test.


<R05>
Sec. 60.4405  How do I perform the initial performance test if I have

chosen to install a NOX-diluent CEMS?

    If you elect to install and certify a NO<INF>X-diluent CEMS 
under Sec. 60.4345, then the initial performance test required under 
Sec. 60.8 may be performed in the following alternative manner:
    (a) Perform a minimum of nine RATA reference method runs, with a 
minimum time per run of 21 minutes, at a single load level, within plus 
or minus 25 percent of 100 percent of peak load. The ambient temperature 
must be greater than 0 [deg]F during the RATA runs.
    (b) For each RATA run, concurrently measure the heat input to the 
unit using a fuel flow meter (or flow meters) and measure the electrical 
and thermal output from the unit.
    (c) Use the test data both to demonstrate compliance with the 
applicable NO<INF>X emission limit under Sec. 60.4320 and to 
provide the required reference method data for the RATA of the CEMS 
described under Sec. 60.4335.
    (d) Compliance with the applicable emission limit in Sec. 60.4320 
is achieved if the arithmetic average of all of the NO<INF>X 
emission rates for the RATA runs, expressed in units of ppm or lb/MWh, 
does not exceed the emission limit.


<R05>
Sec. 60.4410  How do I establish a valid parameter range if I have

chosen to continuously monitor parameters?

    If you have chosen to monitor combustion parameters or parameters 
indicative of proper operation of NO<INF>X emission controls in 
accordance with Sec. 60.4340, the appropriate parameters must be 
continuously monitored and recorded during each run of the initial 
performance test, to establish acceptable operating ranges, for purposes 
of the parameter monitoring plan for the affected unit, as specified in 
Sec. 60.4355.

[[Page 895]]


<R05>
Sec. 60.4415  How do I conduct the initial and subsequent performance

tests for sulfur?

    (a) You must conduct an initial performance test, as required in 
Sec. 60.8. Subsequent SO<INF>2 performance tests shall be 
conducted on an annual basis (no more than 14 calendar months following 
the previous performance test). There are three methodologies that you 
may use to conduct the performance tests.
    (1) If you choose to periodically determine the sulfur content of 
the fuel combusted in the turbine, a representative fuel sample would be 
collected following ASTM D5287 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 
60.17) for natural gas or ASTM D4177 (incorporated by reference, see 
Sec. 60.17) for oil. Alternatively, for oil, you may follow the 
procedures for manual pipeline sampling in section 14 of ASTM D4057 
(incorporated by reference, see Sec. 60.17). The fuel analyses of this 
section may be performed either by you, a service contractor retained by 
you, the fuel vendor, or any other qualified agency. Analyze the samples 
for the total sulfur content of the fuel using:
    (i) For liquid fuels, ASTM D129, or alternatively D1266, D1552, 
D2622, D4294, or D5453 (all of which are incorporated by reference, see 
Sec. 60.17); or
    (ii) For gaseous fuels, ASTM D1072, or alternatively D3246, D4084, 
D4468, D4810, D6228, D6667, or Gas Processors Association Standard 2377 
(all of which are incorporated by reference, see Sec. 60.17).
    (2) Measure the SO<INF>2 concentration (in parts per million 
(ppm)), using EPA Methods 6, 6C, 8, or 20 in appendix A of this part. In 
addition, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) standard, 
ASME PTC 19-10-1981-Part 10, ``Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses,'' manual 
methods for sulfur dioxide (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 60.17) 
can be used instead of EPA Methods 6 or 20. For units complying with the 
output based standard, concurrently measure the stack gas flow rate, 
using EPA Methods 1 and 2 in appendix A of this part, and measure and 
record the electrical and thermal output from the unit. Then use the 
following equation to calculate the SO<INF>2 emission rate:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06JY06.005

Where:

E = SO<INF>2 emission rate, in lb/MWh
1.664 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> = conversion constant, in lb/dscf-ppm
(SO<INF>2)<INF>c = average SO<INF>2 concentration for 
the run, in ppm
Q<INF>std = stack gas volumetric flow rate, in dscf/hr
P = gross electrical and mechanical energy output of the combustion 
turbine, in MW (for simple-cycle operation), for combined-cycle 
operation, the sum of all electrical and mechanical output from the 
combustion and steam turbines, or, for combined heat and power 
operation, the sum of all electrical and mechanical output from the 
combustion and steam turbines plus all useful recovered thermal output 
not used for additional electric or mechanical generation, in MW, 
calculated according to Sec. 60.4350(f)(2); or

    (3) Measure the SO<INF>2 and diluent gas concentrations, using 
either EPA Methods 6, 6C, or 8 and 3A, or 20 in appendix A of this part. 
In addition, you may use the manual methods for sulfur dioxide ASME PTC 
19-10-1981-Part 10 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 60.17). 
Concurrently measure the heat input to the unit, using a fuel flowmeter 
(or flowmeters), and measure the electrical and thermal output of the 
unit. Use EPA Method 19 in appendix A of this part to calculate the 
SO<INF>2 emission rate in lb/MMBtu. Then, use Equations 1 and, if 
necessary, 2 and 3 in Sec. 60.4350(f) to calculate the SO<INF>2 
emission rate in lb/MWh.

                               Definitions


<R05>
Sec. 60.4420  What definitions apply to this subpart?

    As used in this subpart, all terms not defined herein will have the 
meaning given them in the Clean Air Act and in subpart A (General 
Provisions) of this part.
    Combined cycle combustion turbine means any stationary combustion 
turbine which recovers heat from the combustion turbine exhaust gases to 
generate steam that is only used to create additional power output in a 
steam turbine.
    Combined heat and power combustion turbine means any stationary 
combustion turbine which recovers heat from the exhaust gases to heat 
water or another medium, generate steam for useful purposes other than 
additional electric generation, or directly uses the heat in the exhaust 
gases for a useful purpose.
    Combustion turbine model means a group of combustion turbines having 
the same nominal air flow, combustor inlet pressure, combustor inlet 
temperature, firing temperature, turbine inlet temperature and turbine 
inlet pressure.
    Combustion turbine test cell/stand means any apparatus used for 
testing uninstalled stationary or uninstalled mobile (motive) combustion 
turbines.
    Diffusion flame stationary combustion turbine means any stationary 
combustion turbine where fuel and air are injected at the combustor and 
are mixed only by diffusion prior to ignition.
    Duct burner means a device that combusts fuel and that is placed in 
the exhaust duct from another source, such as a stationary combustion 
turbine, internal combustion engine, kiln, etc., to allow the firing of 
additional fuel to heat the exhaust gases before the exhaust gases enter 
a heat recovery steam generating unit.
    Efficiency means the combustion turbine manufacturer's rated heat 
rate at peak load in terms of heat input per unit of power output--based 
on the higher heating value of the fuel.
    Emergency combustion turbine means any stationary combustion turbine 
which operates in an emergency situation. Examples include stationary 
combustion turbines used to produce power for critical networks or 
equipment, including power supplied to portions of a facility, when 
electric power from the local utility is interrupted, or stationary 
combustion turbines used to pump water in the case of fire or flood, 
etc. Emergency stationary combustion turbines do not include stationary 
combustion turbines used as peaking units at electric utilities or 
stationary combustion turbines at industrial facilities that typically 
operate at low capacity factors. Emergency combustion turbines may be 
operated for the purpose of maintenance checks and readiness testing, 
provided that the tests are required by the manufacturer, the vendor, or 
the insurance company associated with the turbine. Required testing of 
such units should be minimized, but there is no time limit on the use of 
emergency combustion turbines.
    Excess emissions means a specified averaging period over which 
either (1) the NO<INF>X emissions are higher than the applicable 
emission limit in Sec. 60.4320; (2) the total sulfur content of the 
fuel being combusted in the affected facility exceeds the limit 
specified in Sec. 60.4330; or (3) the recorded value of a particular 
monitored parameter is outside the acceptable range specified in the 
parameter monitoring plan for the affected unit.
    Gross useful output means the gross useful work performed by the 
stationary combustion turbine system. For units using the mechanical 
energy directly or generating only electricity, the gross useful work 
performed is the gross electrical or mechanical output from the turbine/
generator set. For combined heat and power units, the gross useful work 
performed is the gross electrical or mechanical output plus the useful 
thermal output (i.e., thermal energy delivered to a process).
    Heat recovery steam generating unit means a unit where the hot 
exhaust gases from the combustion turbine are routed in order to extract 
heat from the gases and generate steam, for use in a steam turbine or 
other device that utilizes steam. Heat recovery steam generating units 
can be used with or without duct burners.
    Integrated gasification combined cycle electric utility steam 
generating unit

[[Page 897]]

means a coal-fired electric utility steam generating unit that burns a 
synthetic gas derived from coal in a combined-cycle gas turbine. No 
solid coal is directly burned in the unit during operation.
    ISO conditions means 288 Kelvin, 60 percent relative humidity and 
101.3 kilopascals pressure.
    Lean premix stationary combustion turbine means any stationary 
combustion turbine where the air and fuel are thoroughly mixed to form a 
lean mixture before delivery to the combustor. Mixing may occur before 
or in the combustion chamber. A lean premixed turbine may operate in 
diffusion flame mode during operating conditions such as startup and 
shutdown, extreme ambient temperature, or low or transient load.
    Natural gas means a naturally occurring fluid mixture of 
hydrocarbons (e.g., methane, ethane, or propane) produced in geological 
formations beneath the Earth's surface that maintains a gaseous state at 
standard atmospheric temperature and pressure under ordinary conditions. 
Additionally, natural gas must either be composed of at least 70 percent 
methane by volume or have a gross calorific value between 950 and 1,100 
British thermal units (Btu) per standard cubic foot. Natural gas does 
not include the following gaseous fuels: landfill gas, digester gas, 
refinery gas, sour gas, blast furnace gas, coal-derived gas, producer 
gas, coke oven gas, or any gaseous fuel produced in a process which 
might result in highly variable sulfur content or heating value.
    Noncontinental area means the State of Hawaii, the Virgin Islands, 
Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Northern 
Mariana Islands, or offshore platforms.
    Peak load means 100 percent of the manufacturer's design capacity of 
the combustion turbine at ISO conditions.
    Regenerative cycle combustion turbine means any stationary 
combustion turbine which recovers heat from the combustion turbine 
exhaust gases to preheat the inlet combustion air to the combustion 
turbine.
    Simple cycle combustion turbine means any stationary combustion 
turbine which does not recover heat from the combustion turbine exhaust 
gases to preheat the inlet combustion air to the combustion turbine, or 
which does not recover heat from the combustion turbine exhaust gases 
for purposes other than enhancing the performance of the combustion 
turbine itself.
    Stationary combustion turbine means all equipment, including but not 
limited to the turbine, the fuel, air, lubrication and exhaust gas 
systems, control systems (except emissions control equipment), heat 
recovery system, and any ancillary components and sub-components 
comprising any simple cycle stationary combustion turbine, any 
regenerative/recuperative cycle stationary combustion turbine, any 
combined cycle combustion turbine, and any combined heat and power 
combustion turbine based system. Stationary means that the combustion 
turbine is not self propelled or intended to be propelled while 
performing its function. It may, however, be mounted on a vehicle for 
portability.
    Unit operating day means a 24-hour period between 12 midnight and 
the following midnight during which any fuel is combusted at any time in 
the unit. It is not necessary for fuel to be combusted continuously for 
the entire 24-hour period.
    Unit operating hour means a clock hour during which any fuel is 
combusted in the affected unit. If the unit combusts fuel for the entire 
clock hour, it is considered to be a full unit operating hour. If the 
unit combusts fuel for only part of the clock hour, it is considered to 
be a partial unit operating hour.
    Useful thermal output means the thermal energy made available for 
use in any industrial or commercial process, or used in any heating or 
cooling application, i.e., total thermal energy made available for 
processes and applications other than electrical or mechanical 
generation. Thermal output for this subpart means the energy in 
recovered thermal output measured against the energy in the thermal 
output at 15 degrees Celsius and 101.325 kilopascals of pressure.
