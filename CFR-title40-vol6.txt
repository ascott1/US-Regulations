                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2003), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

Date

    (e)(1) Notwithstanding the frequency of reporting requirements 
specified in paragraph (c) of this section, an owner or operator who is 
required by an applicable subpart to submit excess emissions and 
monitoring systems performance reports (and summary reports) on a 
quarterly (or more frequent) basis may reduce the frequency of reporting 
for that standard to semiannual if the following conditions are met:

[[Page 59]]

    (i) For 1 full year (e.g., 4 quarterly or 12 monthly reporting 
periods) the affected facility's excess emissions and monitoring systems 
reports submitted to comply with a standard under this part continually 
demonstrate that the facility is in compliance with the applicable 
standard;
    (ii) The owner or operator continues to comply with all 
recordkeeping and monitoring requirements specified in this subpart and 
the applicable standard; and
    (iii) The Administrator does not object to a reduced frequency of 
reporting for the affected facility, as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of 
this section.
    (2) The frequency of reporting of excess emissions and monitoring 
systems performance (and summary) reports may be reduced only after the 
owner or operator notifies the Administrator in writing of his or her 
intention to make such a change and the Administrator does not object to 
the intended change. In deciding whether to approve a reduced frequency 
of reporting, the Administrator may review information concerning the 
source's entire previous performance history during the required 
recordkeeping period prior to the intended change, including performance 
test results, monitoring data, and evaluations of an owner or operator's 
conformance with operation and maintenance requirements. Such 
information may be used by the Administrator to make a judgment about 
the source's potential for noncompliance in the future. If the 
Administrator disapproves the owner or operator's request to reduce the 
frequency of reporting, the Administrator will notify the owner or 
operator in writing within 45 days after receiving notice of the owner 
or operator's intention. The notification from the Administrator to the 
owner or operator will specify the grounds on which the disapproval is 
based. In the absence of a notice of disapproval within 45 days, 
approval is automatically granted.
    (3) As soon as monitoring data indicate that the affected facility 
is not in compliance with any emission limitation or operating parameter 
specified in the applicable standard, the frequency of reporting shall 
revert to the frequency specified in the applicable standard, and the 
owner or operator shall submit an excess emissions and monitoring 
systems performance report (and summary report, if required) at the next 
appropriate reporting period following the noncomplying event. After 
demonstrating compliance with the applicable standard for another full 
year, the owner or operator may again request approval from the 
Administrator to reduce the frequency of reporting for that standard as 
provided for in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section.
    (f) Any owner or operator subject to the provisions of this part 
shall maintain a file of all measurements, including continuous 
monitoring system, monitoring device, and performance testing 
measurements; all continuous monitoring system performance evaluations; 
all continuous monitoring system or monitoring device calibration 
checks; adjustments and maintenance performed on these systems or 
devices; and all other information required by this part recorded in a 
permanent form suitable for inspection. The file shall be retained for 
at least two years following the date of such measurements, maintenance, 
reports, and records, except as follows:
    (1) This paragraph applies to owners or operators required to 
install a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) where the CEMS 
installed is automated, and where the calculated data averages do not 
exclude periods of CEMS breakdown or malfunction. An automated CEMS 
records and reduces the measured data to the form of the pollutant 
emission standard through the use of a computerized data acquisition 
system. In lieu of maintaining a file of all CEMS subhourly measurements 
as required under paragraph (f) of this section, the owner or operator 
shall retain the most recent consecutive three averaging periods of 
subhourly measurements and a file that contains a hard copy of the data 
acquisition system algorithm used to reduce the measured data into the 
reportable form of the standard.
    (2) This paragraph applies to owners or operators required to 
install a CEMS where the measured data is manually reduced to obtain the 
reportable form

[[Page 60]]

of the standard, and where the calculated data averages do not exclude 
periods of CEMS breakdown or malfunction. In lieu of maintaining a file 
of all CEMS subhourly measurements as required under paragraph (f) of 
this section, the owner or operator shall retain all subhourly 
measurements for the most recent reporting period. The subhourly 
measurements shall be retained for 120 days from the date of the most 
recent summary or excess emission report submitted to the Administrator.
    (3) The Administrator or delegated authority, upon notification to 
the source, may require the owner or operator to maintain all 
measurements as required by paragraph (f) of this section, if the 
Administrator or the delegated authority determines these records are 
required to more accurately assess the compliance status of the affected 
source.
    (g) If notification substantially similar to that in paragraph (a) 
of this section is required by any other State or local agency, sending 
the Administrator a copy of that notification will satisfy the 
requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
    (h) Individual subparts of this part may include specific provisions 
which clarify or make inapplicable the provisions set forth in this 
section.

Sec. 60.8  Performance tests.

    (a) Within 60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at 
which the affected facility will be operated, but not later than 180 
days after initial startup of such facility and at such other times as 
may be required by the Administrator under section 114 of the Act, the 
owner or operator of such facility shall conduct performance test(s) and 
furnish the Administrator a written report of the results of such 
performance test(s).
    (b) Performance tests shall be conducted and data reduced in 
accordance with the test methods and procedures contained in each 
applicable subpart unless the Administrator (1) specifies or approves, 
in specific cases, the use of a reference method with minor changes in 
methodology, (2) approves the use of an equivalent method, (3) approves 
the use of an alternative method the results of which he has determined 
to be adequate for indicating whether a specific source is in 
compliance, (4) waives the requirement for performance tests because the 
owner or operator of a source has demonstrated by other means to the 
Administrator's satisfaction that the affected facility is in compliance 
with the standard, or (5) approves shorter sampling times and smaller 
sample volumes when necessitated by process variables or other factors. 
Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to abrogate the 
Administrator's authority to require testing under section 114 of the 
Act.
    (c) Performance tests shall be conducted under such conditions as 
the Administrator shall specify to the plant operator based on 
representative performance of the affected facility. The owner or 
operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may 
be necessary to determine the conditions of the performance tests. 
Operations during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction shall 
not constitute representative conditions for the purpose of a 
performance test nor shall emissions in excess of the level of the 
applicable emission limit during periods of startup, shutdown, and 
malfunction be considered a violation of the applicable emission limit 
unless otherwise specified in the applicable standard.
    (d) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall provide the 
Administrator at least 30 days prior notice of any performance test, 
except as specified under other subparts, to afford the Administrator 
the opportunity to have an observer present. If after 30 days notice for 
an initially scheduled performance test, there is a delay (due to 
operational problems, etc.) in conducting the scheduled performance 
test, the owner or operator of an affected facility shall notify the 
Administrator (or delegated State or local agency) as soon as possible 
of any delay in the original test date, either by providing

[[Page 61]]

at least 7 days prior notice of the rescheduled date of the performance 
test, or by arranging a rescheduled date with the Administrator (or 
delegated State or local agency) by mutual agreement.
    (e) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall provide, or 
cause to be provided, performance testing facilities as follows:
    (1) Sampling ports adequate for test methods applicable to such 
facility. This includes (i) constructing the air pollution control 
system such that volumetric flow rates and pollutant emission rates can 
be accurately determined by applicable test methods and procedures and 
(ii) providing a stack or duct free of cyclonic flow during performance 
tests, as demonstrated by applicable test methods and procedures.
    (2) Safe sampling platform(s).
    (3) Safe access to sampling platform(s).
    (4) Utilities for sampling and testing equipment.
    (f) Unless otherwise specified in the applicable subpart, each 
performance test shall consist of three separate runs using the 
applicable test method. Each run shall be conducted for the time and 
under the conditions specified in the applicable standard. For the 
purpose of determining compliance with an applicable standard, the 
arithmetic means of results of the three runs shall apply. In the event 
that a sample is accidentally lost or conditions occur in which one of 
the three runs must be discontinued because of forced shutdown, failure 
of an irreplaceable portion of the sample train, extreme meteorological 
conditions, or other circumstances, beyond the owner or operator's 
control, compliance may, upon the Administrator's approval, be 
determined using the arithmetic mean of the results of the two other 
runs.

<R05>
Sec. 60.9  Availability of information.

    The availability to the public of information provided to, or 
otherwise obtained by, the Administrator under this part shall be 
governed by part 2 of this chapter. (Information submitted voluntarily 
to the Administrator for the purposes of Secs. 60.5 and 60.6 is governed 
by Secs. 2.201 through 2.213 of this chapter and not by Sec. 2.301 of 
this chapter.)


<R05>
Sec. 60.10  State authority.

    The provisions of this part shall not be construed in any manner to 
preclude any State or political subdivision thereof from:
    (a) Adopting and enforcing any emission standard or limitation 
applicable to an affected facility, provided that such emission standard 
or limitation is not less stringent than the standard applicable to such 
facility.
    (b) Requiring the owner or operator of an affected facility to 
obtain permits, licenses, or approvals prior to initiating construction, 
modification, or operation of such facility.


<R05>
Sec. 60.11  Compliance with standards and maintenance requirements.

    (a) Compliance with standards in this part, other than opacity 
standards, shall be determined in accordance with performance tests 
established by Sec. 60.8, unless otherwise specified in the applicable 
standard.
    (b) Compliance with opacity standards in this part shall be 
determined by conducting observations in accordance with Method 9 in 
appendix A of this part, any alternative method that is approved by the 
Administrator, or as provided in paragraph (e)(5) of this section. For 
purposes of determining initial compliance, the minimum total time of 
observations shall be 3 hours (30 6-minute averages) for the performance 
test or other set of observations (meaning those fugitive-type emission 
sources subject only to an opacity standard).
    (c) The opacity standards set forth in this part shall apply at all 
times except during periods of startup, shutdown, malfunction, and as 
otherwise provided in the applicable standard.
    (d) At all times, including periods of startup, shutdown, and 
malfunction, owners and operators shall, to the extent practicable, 
maintain and operate any affected facility including associated air 
pollution control equipment in

[[Page 62]]

a manner consistent with good air pollution control practice for 
minimizing emissions. Determination of whether acceptable operating and 
maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information 
available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, 
monitoring results, opacity observations, review of operating and 
maintenance procedures, and inspection of the source.
    (e)(1) For the purpose of demonstrating initial compliance, opacity 
observations shall be conducted concurrently with the initial 
performance test required in Sec. 60.8 unless one of the following 
conditions apply. If no performance test under Sec. 60.8 is required, 
then opacity observations shall be conducted within 60 days after 
achieving the maximum production rate at which the affected facility 
will be operated but no later than 180 days after initial startup of the 
facility. If visibility or other conditions prevent the opacity 
observations from being conducted concurrently with the initial 
performance test required under Sec. 60.8, the source owner or operator 
shall reschedule the opacity observations as soon after the initial 
performance test as possible, but not later than 30 days thereafter, and 
shall advise the Administrator of the rescheduled date. In these cases, 
the 30-day prior notification to the Administrator required in 
Sec. 60.7(a)(6) shall be waived. The rescheduled opacity observations 
shall be conducted (to the extent possible) under the same operating 
conditions that existed during the initial performance test conducted 
under Sec. 60.8. The visible emissions observer shall determine whether 
visibility or other conditions prevent the opacity observations from 
being made concurrently with the initial performance test in accordance 
with procedures contained in Method 9 of appendix B of this part. 
Opacity readings of portions of plumes which contain condensed, 
uncombined water vapor shall not be used for purposes of determing 
compliance with opacity standards. The owner or operator of an affected 
facility shall make available, upon request by the Administrator, such 
records as may be necessary to determine the conditions under which the 
visual observations were made and shall provide evidence indicating 
proof of current visible observer emission certification. Except as 
provided in paragraph (e)(5) of this section, the results of continuous 
monitoring by transmissometer which indicate that the opacity at the 
time visual observations were made was not in excess of the standard are 
probative but not conclusive evidence of the actual opacity of an 
emission, provided that the source shall meet the burden of proving that 
the instrument used meets (at the time of the alleged violation) 
Performance Specification 1 in appendix B of this part, has been 
properly maintained and (at the time of the alleged violation) that the 
resulting data have not been altered in any way.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the 
owner or operator of an affected facility to which an opacity standard 
in this part applies shall conduct opacity observations in accordance 
with paragraph (b) of this section, shall record the opacity of 
emissions, and shall report to the Administrator the opacity results 
along with the results of the initial performance test required under 
Sec. 60.8. The inability of an owner or operator to secure a visible 
emissions observer shall not be considered a reason for not conducting 
the opacity observations concurrent with the initial performance test.
    (3) The owner or operator of an affected facility to which an 
opacity standard in this part applies may request the Administrator to 
determine and to record the opacity of emissions from the affected 
facility during the initial performance test and at such times as may be 
required. The owner or operator of the affected facility shall report 
the opacity results. Any request to the Administrator to determine and 
to record the opacity of emissions from an affected facility shall be 
included in the notification required in Sec. 60.7(a)(6). If, for some 
reason, the Administrator cannot determine and record the opacity of 
emissions from the affected facility during the performance test, then 
the provisions of paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall apply.
    (4) An owner or operator of an affected facility using a continuous 
opacity monitor (transmissometer) shall

[[Page 63]]

record the monitoring data produced during the initial performance test 
required by Sec. 60.8 and shall furnish the Administrator a written 
report of the monitoring results along with Method 9 and Sec. 60.8 
performance test results.
    (5) An owner or operator of an affected facility subject to an 
opacity standard may submit, for compliance purposes, continuous opacity 
monitoring system (COMS) data results produced during any performance 
test required under Sec. 60.8 in lieu of Method 9 observation data. If 
an owner or operator elects to submit COMS data for compliance with the 
opacity standard, he shall notify the Administrator of that decision, in 
writing, at least 30 days before any performance test required under 
Sec. 60.8 is conducted. Once the owner or operator of an affected 
facility has notified the Administrator to that effect, the COMS data 
results will be used to determine opacity compliance during subsequent 
tests required under Sec. 60.8 until the owner or operator notifies the 
Administrator, in writing, to the contrary. For the purpose of 
determining compliance with the opacity standard during a performance 
test required under Sec. 60.8 using COMS data, the minimum total time of 
COMS data collection shall be averages of all 6-minute continuous 
periods within the duration of the mass emission performance test. 
Results of the COMS opacity determinations shall be submitted along with 
the results of the performance test required under Sec. 60.8. The owner 
or operator of an affected facility using a COMS for compliance purposes 
is responsible for demonstrating that the COMS meets the requirements 
specified in Sec. 60.13(c) of this part, that the COMS has been properly 
maintained and operated, and that the resulting data have not been 
altered in any way. If COMS data results are submitted for compliance 
with the opacity standard for a period of time during which Method 9 
data indicates noncompliance, the Method 9 data will be used to 
determine compliance with the opacity standard.
    (6) Upon receipt from an owner or operator of the written reports of 
the results of the performance tests required by Sec. 60.8, the opacity 
observation results and observer certification required by 
Sec. 60.11(e)(1), and the COMS results, if applicable, the Administrator 
will make a finding concerning compliance with opacity and other 
applicable standards. If COMS data results are used to comply with an 
opacity standard, only those results are required to be submitted along 
with the performance test results required by Sec. 60.8. If the 
Administrator finds that an affected facility is in compliance with all 
applicable standards for which performance tests are conducted in 
accordance with Sec. 60.8 of this part but during the time such 
performance tests are being conducted fails to meet any applicable 
opacity standard, he shall notify the owner or operator and advise him 
that he may petition the Administrator within 10 days of receipt of 
notification to make appropriate adjustment to the opacity standard for 
the affected facility.
    (7) The Administrator will grant such a petition upon a 
demonstration by the owner or operator that the affected facility and 
associated air pollution control equipment was operated and maintained 
in a manner to minimize the opacity of emissions during the performance 
tests; that the performance tests were performed under the conditions 
established by the Administrator; and that the affected facility and 
associated air pollution control equipment were incapable of being 
adjusted or operated to meet the applicable opacity standard.
    (8) The Administrator will establish an opacity standard for the 
affected facility meeting the above requirements at a level at which the 
source will be able, as indicated by the performance and opacity tests, 
to meet the opacity standard at all times during which the source is 
meeting the mass or concentration emission standard. The Administrator 
will promulgate the new opacity standard in the Federal Register.
    (f) Special provisions set forth under an applicable subpart shall 
supersede any conflicting provisions in paragraphs (a) through (e) of 
this section.
    (g) For the purpose of submitting compliance certifications or 
establishing whether or not a person has violated or is in violation of 
any standard in this part, nothing in this part

[[Page 64]]

shall preclude the use, including the exclusive use, of any credible 
evidence or information, relevant to whether a source would have been in 
compliance with applicable requirements if the appropriate performance 
or compliance test or procedure had been performed.

Sec. 60.12  Circumvention.

    No owner or operator subject to the provisions of this part shall 
build, erect, install, or use any article, machine, equipment or 
process, the use of which conceals an emission which would otherwise 
constitute a violation of an applicable standard. Such concealment 
includes, but is not limited to, the use of gaseous diluents to achieve 
compliance with an opacity standard or with a standard which is based on 
the concentration of a pollutant in the gases discharged to the 
atmosphere.

Sec. 60.13  Monitoring requirements.

    (a) For the purposes of this section, all continuous monitoring 
systems required under applicable subparts shall be subject to the 
provisions of this section upon promulgation of performance 
specifications for continuous monitoring systems under appendix B to 
this part and, if the continuous monitoring system is used to 
demonstrate compliance with emission limits on a continuous basis, 
appendix F to this part, unless otherwise specified in an applicable 
subpart or by the Administrator. Appendix F is applicable December 4, 
1987.
    (b) All continuous monitoring systems and monitoring devices shall 
be installed and operational prior to conducting performance tests under 
Sec. 60.8. Verification of operational status shall, as a minimum, 
include completion of the manufacturer's written requirements or 
recommendations for installation, operation, and calibration of the 
device.
    (c) If the owner or operator of an affected facility elects to 
submit continous opacity monitoring system (COMS) data for compliance 
with the opacity standard as provided under Sec. 60.11(e)(5), he shall 
conduct a performance evaluation of the COMS as specified in Performance 
Specification 1, appendix B, of this part before the performance test 
required under Sec. 60.8 is conducted. Otherwise, the owner or operator 
of an affected facility shall conduct a performance evaluation of the 
COMS or continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) during any 
performance test required under Sec. 60.8 or within 30 days thereafter 
in accordance with the applicable performance specification in appendix 
B of this part, The owner or operator of an affected facility shall 
conduct COMS or CEMS performance evaluations at such other times as may 
be required by the Administrator under section 114 of the Act.
    (1) The owner or operator of an affected facility using a COMS to 
determine opacity compliance during any performance test required under 
Sec. 60.8 and as described in Sec. 60.11(e)(5) shall furnish the 
Administrator two or, upon request, more copies of a written report of 
the results of the COMS performance evaluation described in paragraph 
(c) of this section at least 10 days before the performance test 
required under Sec. 60.8 is conducted.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the 
owner or operator of an affected facility shall furnish the 
Administrator within 60 days of completion two or, upon request, more 
copies of a written report of the results of the performance evaluation.
    (d)(1) Owners and operators of a CEMS installed in accordance with 
the provisions of this part, must automatically check the zero (or low 
level value between 0 and 20 percent of span value) and span (50 to 100 
percent of span value) calibration drifts at least once daily in 
accordance with a written procedure. The zero and span must, as a 
minimum, be adjusted whenever either the 24-hour zero drift or the 24-
hour span drift exceeds two times the limit of the applicable 
performance specification in appendix B of this part. The system must 
allow the amount of the

[[Page 65]]

excess zero and span drift to be recorded and quantified whenever 
specified. Owners and operators of a COMS installed in accordance with 
the provisions of this part, must automatically, intrinsic to the 
opacity monitor, check the zero and upscale (span) calibration drifts at 
least once daily. For a particular COMS, the acceptable range of zero 
and upscale calibration materials is as defined in the applicable 
version of PS-1 in appendix B of this part. For a COMS, the optical 
surfaces, exposed to the effluent gases, must be cleaned before 
performing the zero and upscale drift adjustments, except for systems 
using automatic zero adjustments. The optical surfaces must be cleaned 
when the cumulative automatic zero compensation exceeds 4 percent 
opacity.
    (2) Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, the following 
procedures must be followed for a COMS. Minimum procedures must include 
an automated method for producing a simulated zero opacity condition and 
an upscale opacity condition using a certified neutral density filter or 
other related technique to produce a known obstruction of the light 
beam. Such procedures must provide a system check of all active analyzer 
internal optics with power or curvature, all active electronic circuitry 
including the light source and photodetector assembly, and electronic or 
electro-mechanical systems and hardware and or software used during 
normal measurement operation.
    (e) Except for system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and 
zero and span adjustments required under paragraph (d) of this section, 
all continuous monitoring systems shall be in continuous operation and 
shall meet minimum frequency of operation requirements as follows:
    (1) All continuous monitoring systems referenced by paragraph (c) of 
this section for measuring opacity of emissions shall complete a minimum 
of one cycle of sampling and analyzing for each successive 10-second 
period and one cycle of data recording for each successive 6-minute 
period.
    (2) All continuous monitoring systems referenced by paragraph (c) of 
this section for measuring emissions, except opacity, shall complete a 
minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data 
recording) for each successive 15-minute period.
    (f) All continuous monitoring systems or monitoring devices shall be 
installed such that representative measurements of emissions or process 
parameters from the affected facility are obtained. Additional 
procedures for location of continuous monitoring systems contained in 
the applicable Performance Specifications of appendix B of this part 
shall be used.
    (g) When the effluents from a single affected facility or two or 
more affected facilities subject to the same emission standards are 
combined before being released to the atmosphere, the owner or operator 
may install applicable continuous monitoring systems on each effluent or 
on the combined effluent. When the affected facilities are not subject 
to the same emission standards, separate continuous monitoring systems 
shall be installed on each effluent. When the effluent from one affected 
facility is released to the atmosphere through more than one point, the 
owner or operator shall install an applicable continuous monitoring 
system on each separate effluent unless the installation of fewer 
systems is approved by the Administrator. When more than one continuous 
monitoring system is used to measure the emissions from one affected 
facility (e.g., multiple breechings, multiple outlets), the owner or 
operator shall report the results as required from each continuous 
monitoring system.
    (h) Owners or operators of all continuous monitoring systems for 
measurement of opacity shall reduce all data to 6-minute averages and 
for continuous monitoring systems other than opacity to 1-hour averages 
for time periods as defined in Sec. 60.2. Six-minute opacity averages 
shall be calculated from 36 or more data points equally spaced over each 
6-minute period. For continuous monitoring systems other than opacity, 
1-hour averages shall be computed from four or more data points equally 
spaced over each 1-hour period. Data recorded during periods of 
continuous system breakdown, repair, calibration checks, and zero and 
span adjustments shall not be included in the data averages computed 
under this paragraph.

[[Page 66]]

For owners and operators complying with the requirements in Sec. 60.7(f) 
(1) or (2), data averages must include any data recorded during periods 
of monitor breakdown or malfunction. An arithmetic or integrated average 
of all data may be used. The data may be recorded in reduced or 
nonreduced form (e.g., ppm pollutant and percent O<INF>2</INF> or ng/J 
of pollutant). All excess emissions shall be converted into units of the 
standard using the applicable conversion procedures specified in 
subparts. After conversion into units of the standard, the data may be 
rounded to the same number of significant digits as used in the 
applicable subparts to specify the emission limit (e.g., rounded to the 
nearest 1 percent opacity).
    (i) After receipt and consideration of written application, the 
Administrator may approve alternatives to any monitoring procedures or 
requirements of this part including, but not limited to the following:
    (1) Alternative monitoring requirements when installation of a 
continuous monitoring system or monitoring device specified by this part 
would not provide accurate measurements due to liquid water or other 
interferences caused by substances in the effluent gases.
    (2) Alternative monitoring requirements when the affected facility 
is infrequently operated.
    (3) Alternative monitoring requirements to accommodate continuous 
monitoring systems that require additional measurements to correct for 
stack moisture conditions.
    (4) Alternative locations for installing continuous monitoring 
systems or monitoring devices when the owner or operator can demonstrate 
that installation at alternate locations will enable accurate and 
representative measurements.
    (5) Alternative methods of converting pollutant concentration 
measurements to units of the standards.
    (6) Alternative procedures for performing daily checks of zero and 
span drift that do not involve use of span gases or test cells.
    (7) Alternatives to the A.S.T.M. test methods or sampling procedures 
specified by any subpart.
    (8) Alternative continuous monitoring systems that do not meet the 
design or performance requirements in Performance Specification 1, 
appendix B, but adequately demonstrate a definite and consistent 
relationship between its measurements and the measurements of opacity by 
a system complying with the requirements in Performance Specification 1. 
The Administrator may require that such demonstration be performed for 
each affected facility.
    (9) Alternative monitoring requirements when the effluent from a 
single affected facility or the combined effluent from two or more 
affected facilities is released to the atmosphere through more than one 
point.
    (j) An alternative to the relative accuracy (RA) test specified in 
Performance Specification 2 of appendix B may be requested as follows:
    (1) An alternative to the reference method tests for determining RA 
is available for sources with emission rates demonstrated to be less 
than 50 percent of the applicable standard. A source owner or operator 
may petition the Administrator to waive the RA test in Section 8.4 of 
Performance Specification 2 and substitute the procedures in Section 
16.0 if the results of a performance test conducted according to the 
requirements in Sec. 60.8 of this subpart or other tests performed 
following the criteria in Sec. 60.8 demonstrate that the emission rate 
of the pollutant of interest in the units of the applicable standard is 
less than 50 percent of the applicable standard. For sources subject to 
standards expressed as control efficiency levels, a source owner or 
operator may petition the Administrator to waive the RA test and 
substitute the procedures in Section 16.0 of Performance Specification 2 
if the control device exhaust emission rate is less than 50 percent of 
the level needed to meet the control efficiency requirement. The 
alternative procedures do not apply if the continuous emission 
monitoring system is used to determine compliance continuously with the 
applicable standard. The petition to waive the RA test shall include a 
detailed description of the procedures to be applied. Included shall be 
location and procedure

[[Page 67]]

for conducting the alternative, the concentration or response levels of 
the alternative RA materials, and the other equipment checks included in 
the alternative procedure. The Administrator will review the petition 
for completeness and applicability. The determination to grant a waiver 
will depend on the intended use of the CEMS data (e.g., data collection 
purposes other than NSPS) and may require specifications more stringent 
than in Performance Specification 2 (e.g., the applicable emission limit 
is more stringent than NSPS).
    (2) The waiver of a CEMS RA test will be reviewed and may be 
rescinded at such time, following successful completion of the 
alternative RA procedure, that the CEMS data indicate that the source 
emissions are approaching the level. The criterion for reviewing the 
waiver is the collection of CEMS data showing that emissions have 
exceeded 70 percent of the applicable standard for seven, consecutive, 
averaging periods as specified by the applicable regulation(s). For 
sources subject to standards expressed as control efficiency levels, the 
criterion for reviewing the waiver is the collection of CEMS data 
showing that exhaust emissions have exceeded 70 percent of the level 
needed to meet the control efficiency requirement for seven, 
consecutive, averaging periods as specified by the applicable 
regulation(s) [e.g., Sec. 60.45(g) (2) and (3), Sec. 60.73(e), and 
Sec. 60.84(e)]. It is the responsibility of the source operator to 
maintain records and determine the level of emissions relative to the 
criterion on the waiver of RA testing. If this criterion is exceeded, 
the owner or operator must notify the Administrator within 10 days of 
such occurrence and include a description of the nature and cause of the 
increasing emissions. The Administrator will review the notification and 
may rescind the waiver and require the owner or operator to conduct a RA 
test of the CEMS as specified in Section 8.4 of Performance 
Specification 2.

    Editorial Note: At 65 FR 61749, Oct. 17, 2000, Sec. 60.13 was 
amended by revising the words ``ng/J of pollutant'' to read ``ng of 
pollutant per J of heat input'' in the sixth sentence of paragraph (h). 
However, the amendment could not be incorporated because the words ``ng/
J of pollutant'' do not exist in the sixth sentence of paragraph (h).


<R05>
Sec. 60.14  Modification.

    (a) Except as provided under paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, 
any physical or operational change to an existing facility which results 
in an increase in the emission rate to the atmosphere of any pollutant 
to which a standard applies shall be considered a modification within 
the meaning of section 111 of the Act. Upon modification, an existing 
facility shall become an affected facility for each pollutant to which a 
standard applies and for which there is an increase in the emission rate 
to the atmosphere.
    (b) Emission rate shall be expressed as kg/hr of any pollutant 
discharged into the atmosphere for which a standard is applicable. The 
Administrator shall use the following to determine emission rate:
    (1) Emission factors as specified in the latest issue of 
``Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors,'' EPA Publication No. 
AP-42, or other emission factors determined by the Administrator to be 
superior to AP-42 emission factors, in cases where utilization of 
emission factors demonstrates that the emission level resulting from the 
physical or operational change will either clearly increase or clearly 
not increase.
    (2) Material balances, continuous monitor data, or manual emission 
tests

[[Page 68]]

in cases where utilization of emission factors as referenced in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not demonstrate to the 
Administrator's satisfaction whether the emission level resulting from 
the physical or operational change will either clearly increase or 
clearly not increase, or where an owner or operator demonstrates to the 
Administrator's satisfaction that there are reasonable grounds to 
dispute the result obtained by the Administrator utilizing emission 
factors as referenced in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. When the 
emission rate is based on results from manual emission tests or 
continuous monitoring systems, the procedures specified in appendix C of 
this part shall be used to determine whether an increase in emission 
rate has occurred. Tests shall be conducted under such conditions as the 
Administrator shall specify to the owner or operator based on 
representative performance of the facility. At least three valid test 
runs must be conducted before and at least three after the physical or 
operational change. All operating parameters which may affect emissions 
must be held constant to the maximum feasible degree for all test runs.
    (c) The addition of an affected facility to a stationary source as 
an expansion to that source or as a replacement for an existing facility 
shall not by itself bring within the applicability of this part any 
other facility within that source.
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) The following shall not, by themselves, be considered 
modifications under this part:
    (1) Maintenance, repair, and replacement which the Administrator 
determines to be routine for a source category, subject to the 
provisions of paragraph (c) of this section and Sec. 60.15.
    (2) An increase in production rate of an existing facility, if that 
increase can be accomplished without a capital expenditure on that 
facility.
    (3) An increase in the hours of operation.
    (4) Use of an alternative fuel or raw material if, prior to the date 
any standard under this part becomes applicable to that source type, as 
provided by Sec. 60.1, the existing facility was designed to accommodate 
that alternative use. A facility shall be considered to be designed to 
accommodate an alternative fuel or raw material if that use could be 
accomplished under the facility's construction specifications as amended 
prior to the change. Conversion to coal required for energy 
considerations, as specified in section 111(a)(8) of the Act, shall not 
be considered a modification.
    (5) The addition or use of any system or device whose primary 
function is the reduction of air pollutants, except when an emission 
control system is removed or is replaced by a system which the 
Administrator determines to be less environmentally beneficial.
    (6) The relocation or change in ownership of an existing facility.
    (f) Special provisions set forth under an applicable subpart of this 
part shall supersede any conflicting provisions of this section.
    (g) Within 180 days of the completion of any physical or operational 
change subject to the control measures specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section, compliance with all applicable standards must be achieved.
    (h) No physical change, or change in the method of operation, at an 
existing electric utility steam generating unit shall be treated as a 
modification for the purposes of this section provided that such change 
does not increase the maximum hourly emissions of any pollutant 
regulated under this section above the maximum hourly emissions 
achievable at that unit during the 5 years prior to the change.
    (i) Repowering projects that are awarded funding from the Department 
of Energy as permanent clean coal technology demonstration projects (or 
similar projects funded by EPA) are exempt from the requirements of this 
section provided that such change does not increase the maximum hourly 
emissions of any pollutant regulated under this section above the 
maximum hourly emissions achievable at that unit during the five years 
prior to the change.
    (j)(1) Repowering projects that qualify for an extension under 
section 409(b) of the Clean Air Act are exempt from the requirements of 
this section,

[[Page 69]]

provided that such change does not increase the actual hourly emissions 
of any pollutant regulated under this section above the actual hourly 
emissions achievable at that unit during the 5 years prior to the 
change.
    (2) This exemption shall not apply to any new unit that:
    (i) Is designated as a replacement for an existing unit;
    (ii) Qualifies under section 409(b) of the Clean Air Act for an 
extension of an emission limitation compliance date under section 405 of 
the Clean Air Act; and
    (iii) Is located at a different site than the existing unit.
    (k) The installation, operation, cessation, or removal of a 
temporary clean coal technology demonstration project is exempt from the 
requirements of this section. A temporary clean coal control technology 
demonstration project, for the purposes of this section is a clean coal 
technology demonstration project that is operated for a period of 5 
years or less, and which complies with the State implementation plan for 
the State in which the project is located and other requirements 
necessary to attain and maintain the national ambient air quality 
standards during the project and after it is terminated.
    (l) The reactivation of a very clean coal-fired electric utility 
steam generating unit is exempt from the requirements of this section.

Sec. 60.15  Reconstruction.

    (a) An existing facility, upon reconstruction, becomes an affected 
facility, irrespective of any change in emission rate.
    (b) ``Reconstruction'' means the replacement of components of an 
existing facility to such an extent that:
    (1) The fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent 
of the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a 
comparable entirely new facility, and
    (2) It is technologically and economically feasible to meet the 
applicable standards set forth in this part.
    (c) ``Fixed capital cost'' means the capital needed to provide all 
the depreciable components.
    (d) If an owner or operator of an existing facility proposes to 
replace components, and the fixed capital cost of the new components 
exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost that would be required to 
construct a comparable entirely new facility, he shall notify the 
Administrator of the proposed replacements. The notice must be 
postmarked 60 days (or as soon as practicable) before construction of 
the replacements is commenced and must include the following 
information:
    (1) Name and address of the owner or operator.
    (2) The location of the existing facility.
    (3) A brief description of the existing facility and the components 
which are to be replaced.
    (4) A description of the existing air pollution control equipment 
and the proposed air pollution control equipment.
    (5) An estimate of the fixed capital cost of the replacements and of 
constructing a comparable entirely new facility.
    (6) The estimated life of the existing facility after the 
replacements.
    (7) A discussion of any economic or technical limitations the 
facility may have in complying with the applicable standards of 
performance after the proposed replacements.
    (e) The Administrator will determine, within 30 days of the receipt 
of the notice required by paragraph (d) of this section and any 
additional information he may reasonably require, whether the proposed 
replacement constitutes reconstruction.
    (f) The Administrator's determination under paragraph (e) shall be 
based on:
    (1) The fixed capital cost of the replacements in comparison to the 
fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a comparable 
entirely new facility;
    (2) The estimated life of the facility after the replacements 
compared to the life of a comparable entirely new facility;

[[Page 70]]

    (3) The extent to which the components being replaced cause or 
contribute to the emissions from the facility; and
    (4) Any economic or technical limitations on compliance with 
applicable standards of performance which are inherent in the proposed 
replacements.
    (g) Individual subparts of this part may include specific provisions 
which refine and delimit the concept of reconstruction set forth in this 
section.

where:

H<INF>T</INF>=Net heating value of the sample, MJ/scm; where the net 
enthalpy per mole of offgas is based on combustion at 25  deg.C and 760 
mm Hg, but the standard temperature for determining the volume 
corresponding to one mole is 20  deg.C;
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.009

C<INF>i</INF>=Concentration of sample component i in ppm on a wet basis, 
as measured for organics by Reference Method 18 and measured for 
hydrogen and carbon monoxide by ASTM D1946-77 or 90 (Reapproved 1994) 
(Incorporated by reference as specified in Sec. 60.17); and
H<INF>i</INF>=Net heat of combustion of sample component i, kcal/g mole 
at 25  deg.C and 760 mm Hg. The heats of combustion may be determined 
using ASTM D2382-76 or 88 or D4809-95 (incorporated by reference as 
specified in Sec. 60.17) if published values are not available or cannot 
be calculated.

    (4) The actual exit velocity of a flare shall be determined by 
dividing the volumetric flowrate (in units of standard temperature and 
pressure), as determined by Reference Methods 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D as 
appropriate; by the unobstructed (free) cross sectional area of the 
flare tip.
    (5) The maximum permitted velocity, V<INF>max</INF>, for flares 
complying with paragraph (c)(4)(iii) shall be determined by the 
following equation.
Log<INF>10</INF> (V<INF>max</INF>)=(H<INF>T</INF>+28.8)/31.7

V<INF>max</INF>=Maximum permitted velocity, M/sec
28.8=Constant
31.7=Constant
H<INF>T</INF>=The net heating value as determined in paragraph (f)(3).

    (6) The maximum permitted velocity, V<INF>max</INF>, for air-
assisted flares shall be determined by the following equation.
V<INF>max</INF>=8.706+0.7084 (H<INF>T</INF>)

V<INF>max</INF>=Maximum permitted velocity, m/sec
8.706=Constant
0.7084=Constant

Sec. 60.19  General notification and reporting requirements.

    (a) For the purposes of this part, time periods specified in days 
shall be measured in calendar days, even if the word ``calendar'' is 
absent, unless otherwise specified in an applicable requirement.
    (b) For the purposes of this part, if an explicit postmark deadline 
is not specified in an applicable requirement for the submittal of a 
notification, application, report, or other written communication to the 
Administrator, the owner or operator shall postmark the submittal on or 
before the number of days specified in the applicable requirement. For 
example, if a notification must be submitted 15 days before a particular 
event is scheduled to take place, the notification shall be postmarked 
on or before 15 days preceding the event; likewise, if a notification 
must be submitted 15 days after a particular event takes place, the 
notification shall be delivered or postmarked on or before 15 days 
following the end of the event. The use of reliable non-Government mail 
carriers that provide indications of verifiable delivery of information 
required to be submitted to

[[Page 77]]

the Administrator, similar to the postmark provided by the U.S. Postal 
Service, or alternative means of delivery, including the use of 
electronic media, agreed to by the permitting authority, is acceptable.
    (c) Notwithstanding time periods or postmark deadlines specified in 
this part for the submittal of information to the Administrator by an 
owner or operator, or the review of such information by the 
Administrator, such time periods or deadlines may be changed by mutual 
agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator. 
Procedures governing the implementation of this provision are specified 
in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (d) If an owner or operator of an affected facility in a State with 
delegated authority is required to submit periodic reports under this 
part to the State, and if the State has an established timeline for the 
submission of periodic reports that is consistent with the reporting 
frequency(ies) specified for such facility under this part, the owner or 
operator may change the dates by which periodic reports under this part 
shall be submitted (without changing the frequency of reporting) to be 
consistent with the State's schedule by mutual agreement between the 
owner or operator and the State. The allowance in the previous sentence 
applies in each State beginning 1 year after the affected facility is 
required to be in compliance with the applicable subpart in this part. 
Procedures governing the implementation of this provision are specified 
in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (e) If an owner or operator supervises one or more stationary 
sources affected by standards set under this part and standards set 
under part 61, part 63, or both such parts of this chapter, he/she may 
arrange by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the 
Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) a common 
schedule on which periodic reports required by each applicable standard 
shall be submitted throughout the year. The allowance in the previous 
sentence applies in each State beginning 1 year after the stationary 
source is required to be in compliance with the applicable subpart in 
this part, or 1 year after the stationary source is required to be in 
compliance with the applicable 40 CFR part 61 or part 63 of this chapter 
standard, whichever is latest. Procedures governing the implementation 
of this provision are specified in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (f)(1)(i) Until an adjustment of a time period or postmark deadline 
has been approved by the Administrator under paragraphs (f)(2) and 
(f)(3) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected facility 
remains strictly subject to the requirements of this part.
    (ii) An owner or operator shall request the adjustment provided for 
in paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section each time he or she 
wishes to change an applicable time period or postmark deadline 
specified in this part.
    (2) Notwithstanding time periods or postmark deadlines specified in 
this part for the submittal of information to the Administrator by an 
owner or operator, or the review of such information by the 
Administrator, such time periods or deadlines may be changed by mutual 
agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator. An owner 
or operator who wishes to request a change in a time period or postmark 
deadline for a particular requirement shall request the adjustment in 
writing as soon as practicable before the subject activity is required 
to take place. The owner or operator shall include in the request 
whatever information he or she considers useful to convince the 
Administrator that an adjustment is warranted.
    (3) If, in the Administrator's judgment, an owner or operator's 
request for an adjustment to a particular time period or postmark 
deadline is warranted, the Administrator will approve the adjustment. 
The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of 
approval or disapproval of the request for an adjustment within 15 
calendar days of receiving sufficient information to evaluate the 
request.
    (4) If the Administrator is unable to meet a specified deadline, he 
or she will notify the owner or operator of any significant delay and 
inform the

[[Page 78]]

owner or operator of the amended schedule.

Sec. 60.20  Applicability.

    The provisions of this subpart apply to States upon publication of a 
final guideline document under Sec. 60.22(a).


<R05>
Sec. 60.21  Definitions.

    Terms used but not defined in this subpart shall have the meaning 
given them in the Act and in subpart A:
    (a) Designated pollutant means any air pollutant, emissions of which 
are subject to a standard of performance for new stationary sources but 
for which air quality criteria have not been issued, and which is not 
included on a list published under section 108(a) or section 
112(b)(1)(A) of the Act.
    (b) Designated facility means any existing facility (see 
Sec. 60.2(aa)) which emits a designated pollutant and which would be 
subject to a standard of performance for that pollutant if the existing 
facility were an affected facility (see Sec. 60.2(e)).
    (c) Plan means a plan under section 111(d) of the Act which 
establishes emission standards for designated pollutants from designated 
facilities and provides for the implementation and enforcement of such 
emission standards.
    (d) Applicable plan means the plan, or most recent revision thereof, 
which has been approved under Sec. 60.27(b) or promulgated under 
Sec. 60.27(d).
    (e) Emission guideline means a guideline set forth in subpart C of 
this part, or in a final guideline document published under 
Sec. 60.22(a), which reflects the degree of emission reduction 
achievable through the application of the best system of emission 
reduction which (taking into account the cost of such reduction) the 
Administrator has determined has been adequately demonstrated for 
designated facilities.
    (f) Emission standard means a legally enforceable regulation setting 
forth an allowable rate of emissions into the atmosphere, or prescribing 
equipment specifications for control of air pollution emissions.
    (g) Compliance schedule means a legally enforceable schedule 
specifying a date or dates by which a source or category of sources must 
comply with specific emission standards contained in a plan or with any 
increments of progress to achieve such compliance.
    (h) Increments of progress means steps to achieve compliance which 
must be taken by an owner or operator of a designated facility, 
including:
    (1) Submittal of a final control plan for the designated facility to 
the appropriate air pollution control agency;
    (2) Awarding of contracts for emission control systems or for 
process modifications, or issuance of orders for the purchase of 
component parts to accomplish emission control or process modification;
    (3) Initiation of on-site construction or installation of emission 
control equipment or process change;
    (4) Completion of on-site construction or installation of emission 
control equipment or process change; and
    (5) Final compliance.
    (i) Region means an air quality control region designated under 
section 107 of the Act and described in part 81 of this chapter.
    (j) Local agency means any local governmental agency.


<R05>
Sec. 60.22  Publication of guideline documents, emission guidelines, and 
final compliance times.

    (a) Concurrently upon or after proposal of standards of performance 
for the control of a designated pollutant from affected facilities, the 
Administrator will publish a draft guideline document containing 
information pertinent to control of the designated pollutant form 
designated facilities. Notice of the availability of the draft guideline 
document will be published in the Federal Register and public comments 
on its contents will be invited. After consideration of public comments 
and upon or after promulgation of standards of performance for control 
of a designated pollutant from

[[Page 79]]

affected facilities, a final guideline document will be published and 
notice of its availability will be published in the Federal Register.
    (b) Guideline documents published under this section will provide 
information for the development of State plans, such as:
    (1) Information concerning known or suspected endangerment of public 
health or welfare caused, or contributed to, by the designated 
pollutant.
    (2) A description of systems of emission reduction which, in the 
judgment of the Administrator, have been adequately demonstrated.
    (3) Information on the degree of emission reduction which is 
achievable with each system, together with information on the costs and 
environmental effects of applying each system to designated facilities.
    (4) Incremental periods of time normally expected to be necessary 
for the design, installation, and startup of identified control systems.
    (5) An emission guideline that reflects the application of the best 
system of emission reduction (considering the cost of such reduction) 
that has been adequately demonstrated for designated facilities, and the 
time within which compliance with emission standards of equivalent 
stringency can be achieved. The Administrator will specify different 
emission guidelines or compliance times or both for different sizes, 
types, and classes of designated facilities when costs of control, 
physical limitations, geographical location, or similar factors make 
subcategorization appropriate. (6) Such other available information as 
the Administrator determines may contribute to the formulation of State 
plans.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the 
emission guidelines and compliance times referred to in paragraph (b)(5) 
of this section will be proposed for comment upon publication of the 
draft guideline document, and after consideration of comments will be 
promulgated in subpart C of this part with such modifications as may be 
appropriate.
    (d)(1) If the Administrator determines that a designated pollutant 
may cause or contribute to endangerment of public welfare, but that 
adverse effects on public health have not been demonstrated, he will 
include the determination in the draft guideline document and in the 
Federal Register notice of its availability. Except as provided in 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section, paragraph (c) of this section shall be 
inapplicable in such cases.
    (2) If the Administrator determines at any time on the basis of new 
information that a prior determination under paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section is incorrect or no longer correct, he will publish notice of the 
determination in the Federal Register, revise the guideline document as 
necessary under paragraph (a) of this section, and propose and 
promulgate emission guidelines and compliance times under paragraph (c) 
of this section.

Sec. 60.24  Emission standards and compliance schedules.

    (a) Each plan shall include emission standards and compliance 
schedules.
    (b)(1) Emission standards shall prescribe allowable rates of 
emissions except when it is clearly impracticable. Such cases will be 
identified in the guideline documents issued under Sec. 60.22. Where 
emission standards prescribing equipment specifications are established, 
the plan shall, to the degree possible, set forth the emission 
reductions achievable by implementation of such specifications, and may 
permit compliance by the use of equipment determined by the State to be 
equivalent to that prescribed.
    (2) Test methods and procedures for determining compliance with the 
emission standards shall be specified in the plan. Methods other than 
those specified in appendix A to this part may be specified in the plan 
if shown to be equivalent or alternative methods as defined in Sec. 60.2 
(t) and (u).
    (3) Emission standards shall apply to all designated facilities 
within the State. A plan may contain emission standards adopted by local 
jurisdictions provided that the standards are enforceable by the State.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, where the 
Administrator has determined that a designated pollutant may cause or 
contribute to endangerment of public health, emission standards shall be 
no less stringent than the corresponding emission guideline(s) specified 
in subpart C of this part, and final compliance shall be required as 
expeditiously

[[Page 81]]

as practicable but no later than the compliance times specified in 
subpart C of this part.
    (d) Where the Administrator has determined that a designated 
pollutant may cause or contribute to endangerment of public welfare but 
that adverse effects on public health have not been demonstrated, States 
may balance the emission guidelines, compliance times, and other 
information provided in the applicable guideline document against other 
factors of public concern in establishing emission standards, compliance 
schedules, and variances. Appropriate consideration shall be given to 
the factors specified in Sec. 60.22(b) and to information presented at 
the public hearing(s) conducted under Sec. 60.23(c).
    (e)(1) Any compliance schedule extending more than 12 months from 
the date required for submittal of the plan must include legally 
enforceable increments of progress to achieve compliance for each 
designated facility or category of facilities. Unless otherwise 
specified in the applicable subpart, increments of progress must 
include, where practicable, each increment of progress specified in 
Sec. 60.21(h) and must include such additional increments of progress as 
may be necessary to permit close and effective supervision of progress 
toward final compliance.
    (2) A plan may provide that compliance schedules for individual 
sources or categories of sources will be formulated after plan 
submittal. Any such schedule shall be the subject of a public hearing 
held according to Sec. 60.23 and shall be submitted to the Administrator 
within 60 days after the date of adoption of the schedule but in no case 
later than the date prescribed for submittal of the first semiannual 
report required by Sec. 60.25(e).
    (f) Unless otherwise specified in the applicable subpart on a case-
by-case basis for particular designated facilities or classes of 
facilities, States may provide for the application of less stringent 
emissions standards or longer compliance schedules than those otherwise 
required by paragraph (c) of this section, provided that the State 
demonstrates with respect to each such facility (or class of 
facilities):
    (1) Unreasonable cost of control resulting from plant age, location, 
or basic process design;
    (2) Physical impossibility of installing necessary control 
equipment; or
    (3) Other factors specific to the facility (or class of facilities) 
that make application of a less stringent standard or final compliance 
time significantly more reasonable.
    (g) Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to preclude any State 
or political subdivision thereof from adopting or enforcing (1) emission 
standards more stringent than emission guidelines specified in subpart C 
of this part or in applicable guideline documents or (2) compliance 
schedules requiring final compliance at earlier times than those 
specified in subpart C or in applicable guideline documents.

Subpart Cc--Emission Guidelines and Compliance Times for Municipal Solid 
                             Waste Landfills

    Source: 61 FR 9919, Mar. 12, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 60.30c  Scope.

    This subpart contains emission guidelines and compliance times for 
the control of certain designated pollutants from certain designated 
municipal solid waste landfills in accordance with section 111(d) of the 
Act and subpart B.


<R05>
Sec. 60.31c  Definitions.

    Terms used but not defined in this subpart have the meaning given 
them in the Act and in subparts A, B, and WWW of this part.
    Municipal solid waste landfill or MSW landfill means an entire 
disposal facility in a contiguous geographical space where household 
waste is placed in or on land. An MSW landfill may also receive other 
types of RCRA Subtitle D wastes such as commercial solid waste, 
nonhazardous sludge, conditionally exempt small quantity generator 
waste, and industrial solid waste. Portions of an MSW landfill may be 
separated by access roads. An MSW landfill may be publicly or privately 
owned. An MSW landfill may be a new MSW landfill, an existing MSW 
landfill or a lateral expansion.


<R05>
Sec. 60.32c  Designated facilities.

    (a) The designated facility to which the guidelines apply is each 
existing MSW landfill for which construction, reconstruction or 
modification was commenced before May 30, 1991.
    (b) Physical or operational changes made to an existing MSW landfill 
solely to comply with an emission guideline are not considered a 
modification or reconstruction and would not subject an existing MSW 
landfill to the requirements of subpart WWW [see Sec. 60.750 of Subpart

Sec. 60.45  Emission and fuel monitoring.

    (a) Each owner or operator shall install, calibrate, maintain, and 
operate continuous monitoring systems for measuring the opacity of 
emissions, sulfur dioxide emissions, nitrogen oxides emissions, and 
either oxygen or carbon dioxide except as provided in paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (b) Certain of the continuous monitoring system requirements under 
paragraph (a) of this section do not apply to owners or operators under 
the following conditions:
    (1) For a fossil fuel-fired steam generator that burns only gaseous 
fossil fuel, continuous monitoring systems for measuring the opacity of 
emissions and sulfur dioxide emissions are not required.
    (2) For a fossil fuel-fired steam generator that does not use a flue 
gas desulfurization device, a continuous monitoring system for measuring 
sulfur dioxide emissions is not required if the owner or operator 
monitors sulfur dioxide emissions by fuel sampling and analysis.
    (3) Notwithstanding Sec. 60.13(b), installation of a continuous 
monitoring system for nitrogen oxides may be delayed until after the 
initial performance tests under Sec. 60.8 have been conducted. If the 
owner or operator demonstrates during the performance test that 
emissions of nitrogen oxides are less than 70 percent of the applicable 
standards in Sec. 60.44, a continuous monitoring system for measuring 
nitrogen oxides emissions is not required. If the initial performance 
test results show that nitrogen oxide emissions are greater than 70 
percent of the applicable standard, the owner or operator shall install 
a continuous monitoring system for nitrogen oxides within one year after 
the date of the initial performance tests under Sec. 60.8 and comply 
with all other applicable monitoring requirements under this part.

[[Page 104]]

    (4) If an owner or operator does not install any continuous 
monitoring systems for sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides, as provided 
under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(3) or paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of 
this section a continuous monitoring system for measuring either oxygen 
or carbon dioxide is not required.
    (c) For performance evaluations under Sec. 60.13(c) and calibration 
checks under Sec. 60.13(d), the following procedures shall be used:
    (1) Methods 6, 7, and 3B, as applicable, shall be used for the 
performance evaluations of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides continuous 
monitoring systems. Acceptable alternative methods for Methods 6, 7, and 
3B are given in Sec. 60.46(d).
    (2) Sulfur dioxide or nitric oxide, as applicable, shall be used for 
preparing calibration gas mixtures under Performance Specification 2 of 
appendix B to this part.
    (3) For affected facilities burning fossil fuel(s), the span value 
for a continuous monitoring system measuring the opacity of emissions 
shall be 80, 90, or 100 percent and for a continuous monitoring system 
measuring sulfur oxides or nitrogen oxides the span value shall be 
determined as follows:

y=the fraction of total heat input derived from liquid fossil fuel, and
z=the fraction of total heat input derived from solid fossil fuel.

    (4) All span values computed under paragraph (c)(3) of this section 
for burning combinations of fossil fuels shall be rounded to the nearest 
500 ppm.
    (5) For a fossil fuel-fired steam generator that simultaneously 
burns fossil fuel and nonfossil fuel, the span value of all continuous 
monitoring systems shall be subject to the Administrator's approval.
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) For any continuous monitoring system installed under paragraph 
(a) of this section, the following conversion procedures shall be used 
to convert the continuous monitoring data into units of the applicable 
standards (ng/J, lb/million Btu):
    (1) When a continuous monitoring system for measuring oxygen is 
selected, the measurement of the pollutant concentration and oxygen 
concentration shall each be on a consistent basis (wet or dry). 
Alternative procedures approved by the Administrator shall be used when 
measurements are on a wet basis. When measurements are on a dry basis, 
the following conversion procedure shall be used:

E=CF[20.9/(20.9--percent O<INF>2</INF>)]

where:

E, C, F, and %O<INF>2</INF> are determined under paragraph (f) of this 
section.

    (2) When a continuous monitoring system for measuring carbon dioxide 
is selected, the measurement of the pollutant concentration and carbon 
dioxide concentration shall each be on a consistent basis (wet or dry) 
and the following conversion procedure shall be used:

E=CF<INF>c</INF> [100/percent CO<INF>2</INF>]

where:

E, C, F<INF>c</INF> and %CO<INF>2</INF> are determined under paragraph 
(f) of this section.

    (f) The values used in the equations under paragraphs (e) (1) and 
(2) of this section are derived as follows:
    (1) E=pollutant emissions, ng/J (lb/million Btu).
    (2) C=pollutant concentration, ng/dscm (lb/dscf), determined by 
multiplying the average concentration (ppm) for each one-hour period by 
4.15x10<SUP> 4</SUP> M ng/dscm per ppm (2.59x10<SUP>- 9</SUP> M lb/dscf 
per ppm) where M=pollutant molecular weight, g/g-mole (lb/lb-mole). 
M=64.07 for sulfur dioxide and 46.01 for nitrogen oxides.
    (3) %O<INF>2</INF>, %CO<INF>2</INF>=oxygen or carbon dioxide volume

<R05>
Sec. 60.46  Test methods and procedures.

    (a) In conducting the performance tests required in Sec. 60.8, the 
owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test 
methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as 
specified in this section, except as provided in Sec. 60.8(b). 
Acceptable alternative methods and procedures are given in paragraph (d) 
of this section.
    (b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
particulate matter, SO<INF>2</INF>, and NO<INF>x</INF> standards in 
Secs. 60.42, 60.43, and 60.44 as follows:
    (1) The emission rate (E) of particulate matter, SO<INF>2</INF>, or 
NO<INF>x</INF> shall be computed for each run using the following 
equation:

E=C F<INF>d</INF> (20.9)/(20.9-% 0<INF>2</INF>)

E = emission rate of pollutant, ng/J (1b/million Btu).

[[Page 107]]

C = concentration of pollutant, ng/dscm (1b/dscf).
%O<INF>2</INF> = oxygen concentration, percent dry basis.
F<INF>d</INF> = factor as determined from Method 19.

    (2) Method 5 shall be used to determine the particular matter 
concentration (C) at affected facilities without wet flue-gas-
desulfurization (FGD) systems and Method 5B shall be used to determine 
the particulate matter concentration (C) after FGD systems.
    (i) The sampling time and sample volume for each run shall be at 
least 60 minutes and 0.85 dscm (30 dscf). The probe and filter holder 
heating systems in the sampling train shall be set to provide an average 
gas temperature of 160<plus-minus>14  deg.C (320<plus-minus>25  deg.F).
    (ii) The emission rate correction factor, integrated or grab 
sampling and analysis procedure of Method 3B shall be used to determine 
the O<INF>2</INF> concentration (%O<INF>2</INF>). The O<INF>2</INF> 
sample shall be obtained simultaneously with, and at the same traverse 
points as, the particulate sample. If the grab sampling procedure is 
used, the O<INF>2</INF> concentration for the run shall be the 
arithmetic mean of the sample O<INF>2</INF> concentrations at all 
traverse points.
    (iii) If the particulate run has more than 12 traverse points, the 
O<INF>2</INF> traverse points may be reduced to 12 provided that Method 
1 is used to locate the 12 O<INF>2</INF> traverse points.
    (3) Method 9 and the procedures in Sec. 60.11 shall be used to 
determine opacity.
    (4) Method 6 shall be used to determine the SO<INF>2</INF> 
concentration.
    (i) The sampling site shall be the same as that selected for the 
particulate sample. The sampling location in the duct shall be at the 
centroid of the cross section or at a point no closer to the walls than 
1 m (3.28 ft). The sampling time and sample volume for each sample run 
shall be at least 20 minutes and 0.020 dscm (0.71 dscf). Two samples 
shall be taken during a 1-hour period, with each sample taken within a 
30-minute interval.
    (ii) The emission rate correction factor, integrated sampling and 
analysis procedure of Method 3B shall be used to determine the 
O<INF>2</INF> concentration (%O<INF>2</INF>). The O<INF>2</INF> sample 
shall be taken simultaneously with, and at the same point as, the 
SO<INF>2</INF> sample. The SO<INF>2</INF> emission rate shall be 
computed for each pair of SO<INF>2</INF> and O<INF>2</INF> samples. The 
SO<INF>2</INF> emission rate (E) for each run shall be the arithmetic 
mean of the results of the two pairs of samples.
    (5) Method 7 shall be used to determine the NO<INF>x</INF> 
concentration.
    (i) The sampling site and location shall be the same as for the 
SO<INF>2</INF> sample. Each run shall consist of four grab samples, with 
each sample taken at about 15-minute intervals.
    (ii) For each NO<INF>x</INF> sample, the emission rate correction 
factor, grab sampling and analysis procedure of Method 3B shall be used 
to determine the O<INF>2</INF> concentration (%O<INF>2</INF>). The 
sample shall be taken simultaneously with, and at the same point as, the 
NO<INF>x</INF> sample.
    (iii) The NO<INF>x</INF> emission rate shall be computed for each 
pair of NO<INF>x</INF> and O<INF>2</INF> samples. The NO<INF>x</INF> 
emission rate (E) for each run shall be the arithmetic mean of the 
results of the four pairs of samples.
    (c) When combinations of fossil fuels or fossil fuel and wood 
residue are fired, the owner or operator (in order to compute the 
prorated standard as shown in Secs. 60.43(b) and 60.44(b)) shall 
determine the percentage (w, x, y, or z) of the total heat input derived 
from each type of fuel as follows:
    (1) The heat input rate of each fuel shall be determined by 
multiplying the gross calorific value of each fuel fired by the rate of 
each fuel burned.
    (2) ASTM Methods D2015-77 (Reapproved 1978), 96, or D5865-98 (solid 
fuels), D240-76 or 92 (liquid fuels), or D1826-77 or 94 (gaseous fuels) 
(incorporated by reference--see Sec. 60.17) shall be used to determine 
the gross calorific values of the fuels. The method used to determine 
the calorific value of wood residue must be approved by the 
Administrator.
    (3) Suitable methods shall be used to determine the rate of each 
fuel burned during each test period, and a material balance over the 
steam generating system shall be used to confirm the rate.
    (d) The owner or operator may use the following as alternatives to 
the reference methods and procedures in this section or in other 
sections as specified:

[[Page 108]]

    (1) The emission rate (E) of particulate matter, SO<INF>2</INF> and 
NO<INF>x</INF> may be determined by using the F<INF>c</INF> factor, 
provided that the following procedure is used:
    (i) The emission rate (E) shall be computed using the following 
equation:

E=C F<INF>c</INF> (100/%CO<INF>2</INF>)

where:

E=emission rate of pollutant, ng/J (lb/million Btu).
C=concentration of pollutant, ng/dscm (lb/dscf).
%CO<INF>2</INF>=carbon dioxide concentration, percent dry basis.
F<INF>c</INF>=factor as determined in appropriate sections of Method 19.

    (ii) If and only if the average F<INF>c</INF> factor in Method 19 is 
used to calculate E and either E is from 0.97 to 1.00 of the emission 
standard or the relative accuracy of a continuous emission monitoring 
system is from 17 to 20 percent, then three runs of Method 3B shall be 
used to determine the O<INF>2</INF> and CO<INF>2</INF> concentration 
according to the procedures in paragraph (b) (2)(ii), (4)(ii), or 
(5)(ii) of this section. Then if F<INF>o</INF> (average of three runs), 
as calculated from the equation in Method 3B, is more than <plus-minus>3 
percent than the average F<INF>o</INF> value, as determined from the 
average values of F<INF>d</INF> and F<INF>c</INF> in Method 19, i.e., 
F<INF>oa</INF>=0.209 (F<INF>da</INF>/F<INF>ca</INF>), then the following 
procedure shall be followed:
    (A) When F<INF>o</INF> is less than 0.97 F<INF>oa</INF>, then E 
shall be increased by that proportion under 0.97 F<INF>oa</INF>, e.g., 
if F<INF>o</INF> is 0.95 F<INF>oa</INF>, E shall be increased by 2 
percent. This recalculated value shall be used to determine compliance 
with the emission standard.
    (B) When F<INF>o</INF> is less than 0.97 F<INF>oa</INF> and when the 
average difference (d) between the continuous monitor minus the 
reference methods is negative, then E shall be increased by that 
proportion under 0.97 F<INF>oa</INF>, e.g., if F<INF>o</INF> is 0.95 
F<INF>oa</INF>, E shall be increased by 2 percent. This recalculated 
value shall be used to determine compliance with the relative accuracy 
specification.
    (C) When F<INF>o</INF> is greater than 1.03 F<INF>oa</INF> and when 
the average difference d is positive, then E shall be decreased by that 
proportion over 1.03 F<INF>oa</INF>, e.g., if F<INF>o</INF> is 1.05 
F<INF>oa</INF>, E shall be decreased by 2 percent. This recalculated 
value shall be used to determine compliance with the relative accuracy 
specification.
    (2) For Method 5 or 5B, Method 17 may be used at facilities with or 
without wet FGD systems if the stack gas temperature at the sampling 
location does not exceed an average temperature of 160  deg.C (320 
deg.F). The procedures of sections 2.1 and 2.3 of Method 5B may be used 
with Method 17 only if it is used after wet FGD systems. Method 17 shall 
not be used after wet FGD systems if the effluent gas is saturated or 
laden with water droplets.
    (3) Particulate matter and SO<INF>2</INF> may be determined 
simultaneously with the Method 5 train provided that the following 
changes are made:
    (i) The filter and impinger apparatus in sections 2.1.5 and 2.1.6 of 
Method 8 is used in place of the condenser (section 2.1.7) of Method 5.
    (ii) All applicable procedures in Method 8 for the determination of 
SO<INF>2</INF> (including moisture) are used:
    (4) For Method 6, Method 6C may be used. Method 6A may also be used 
whenever Methods 6 and 3B data are specified to determine the 
SO<INF>2</INF> emission rate, under the conditions in paragraph (d)(1) 
of this section.
    (5) For Method 7, Method 7A, 7C, 7D, or 7E may be used. If Method 
7C, 7D, or 7E is used, the sampling time for each run shall be at least 
1 hour and the integrated sampling approach shall be used to determine 
the O<INF>2</INF> concentration (%O<INF>2</INF>) for the emission rate 
correction factor.
    (6) For Method 3, Method 3A or 3B may be used.
    (7) For Method 3B, Method 3A may be used.

these transmission lines.
    Available system capacity means the capacity determined by 
subtracting the system load and the system emergency reserves from the 
net system capacity.
    Boiler operating day means a 24-hour period during which fossil fuel 
is combusted in a steam generating unit for the entire 24 hours.
    Coal refuse means waste products of coal mining, physical coal 
cleaning, and coal preparation operations (e.g. culm, gob, etc.) 
containing coal, matrix material, clay, and other organic and inorganic 
material.
    Combined cycle gas turbine means a stationary turbine combustion 
system where heat from the turbine exhaust gases is recovered by a steam 
generating unit.
    Duct burner means a device that combusts fuel and that is placed in 
the exhaust duct from another source, such as a stationary gas turbine, 
internal combustion engine, kiln, etc., to allow the firing of

    Electric utility combined cycle gas turbine means any combined cycle 
gas turbine used for electric generation that is constructed for the 
purpose of supplying more than one-third of its potential electric 
output capacity and more than 25 MW electrical output to any utility 
power distribution system for sale. Any steam distribution system that 
is constructed for the purpose of providing steam to a steam electric 
generator that would produce electrical power for sale is also 
considered

[[Page 110]]

in determining the electrical energy output capacity of the affected 
facility.
    Electric utility company means the largest interconnected 
organization, business, or governmental entity that generates electric 
power for sale (e.g., a holding company with operating subsidiary 
companies).
    Electric utility steam generating unit means any steam electric 
generating unit that is constructed for the purpose of supplying more 
than one-third of its potential electric output capacity and more than 
25 MW electrical output to any utility power distribution system for

electrical energy output capacity of the affected facility.
    Emergency condition means that period of time when:
    (a) The electric generation output of an affected facility with a

possible from an affected facility with a malfunctioning flue gas 
desulfurization system to one or more electrical generating units held 
in reserve by the principal company or by a neighboring company, or
    (c) An affected facility with a malfunctioning flue gas 
desulfurization system becomes the only available unit to maintain a 
part or all of the principal company's system emergency reserves and the 
unit is operated in spinning reserve at the lowest practical electric 
generation load consistent with not causing significant physical damage

demand, an emergency condition would not exist unless the conditions 
under (a) of this definition apply.
    Fossil fuel means natural gas, petroleum, coal, and any form of 
solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel derived from such material for the 
purpose of creating useful heat.
    Gross output means the gross useful work performed by the steam

    Neighboring company means any one of those electric utility 
companies with one or more electric power interconnections to the 
principal company and which have geographically adjoining service areas.
    Net system capacity means the sum of the net electric generating 
capability (not necessarily equal to rated capacity) of all electric 
generating equipment owned by an electric utility company (including 
steam generating units, internal combustion engines, gas turbines, 
nuclear units, hydroelectric units, and all other electric generating 
equipment) plus firm contractual purchases that are interconnected to 
the affected facility that has the malfunctioning flue gas 
desulfurization system. The electric generating capability of equipment 
under multiple ownership is prorated based on ownership unless the 
proportional entitlement to electric output is otherwise established by 
contractual arrangement.
    Noncontinental area means the State of Hawaii, the Virgin Islands, 
Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth

[[Page 111]]

    Potential electrical output capacity is defined as 33 percent of the 
maximum design heat input capacity of the steam generating unit (e.g., a 
steam generating unit with a 100-MW (340 million Btu/hr) fossil-fuel 
heat input capacity would have a 33-MW potential electrical output 
capacity). For electric utility combined cycle gas turbines the 
potential electrical output capacity is determined on the basis of the 
fossil-fuel firing capacity of the steam generator exclusive of the heat 
input and electrical power contribution by the gas turbine.

    Spinning reserve means the sum of the unutilized net generating 
capability of all units of the electric utility company that are 
synchronized to the power distribution system and that are capable of 
immediately accepting additional load. The electric generating 
capability of equipment under multiple ownership is prorated based on 
ownership unless the proportional entitlement to electric output is 
otherwise established by contractual arrangement.
    Steam generating unit means any furnace, boiler, or other device 
used for combusting fuel for the purpose of producing steam (including 
fossil-fuel-fired steam generators associated with combined cycle gas 
turbines; nuclear steam generators are not included).

capacity equivalent to the rated capacity of the single largest electric 
generating unit in the electric utility company (including steam 
generating units, internal combustion engines, gas turbines, nuclear 
units, hydroelectric units, and all other electric generating equipment) 
which is interconnected with the affected facility that has the 
malfunctioning flue gas desulfurization system. The electric generating 
capability of equipment under multiple ownership is prorated based on 
ownership unless the proportional entitlement to electric output is 
otherwise established by contractual arrangement.
    System load means the entire electric demand of an electric utility 
company's service area interconnected with the affected facility that 
has the malfunctioning flue gas desulfurization system plus firm

Sec. 60.46a  Compliance provisions.

    (a) Compliance with the particulate matter emission limitation under 
Sec. 60.42a(a)(1) constitutes compliance with the percent reduction 
requirements for particulate matter under Sec. 60.42a(a)(2) and (3).
    (b) Compliance with the nitrogen oxides emission limitation under 
Sec. 60.44a(a) constitutes compliance with the percent reduction 
requirements under Sec. 60.44a(a)(2).
    (c) The particulate matter emission standards under Sec. 60.42a and 
the nitrogen oxides emission standards under Sec. 60.44a apply at all 
times except during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction. The 
sulfur dioxide emission standards under Sec. 60.43a apply at all times 
except during periods of startup, shutdown, or when both emergency 
conditions exist and the procedures under paragraph (d) of this section 
are implemented.
    (d) During emergency conditions in the principal company, an 
affected facility with a malfunctioning flue gas desulfurization system 
may be operated if sulfur dioxide emissions are minimized by:
    (1) Operating all operable flue gas desulfurization system modules, 
and bringing back into operation any malfunctioned module as soon as 
repairs are completed,
    (2) Bypassing flue gases around only those flue gas desulfurization 
system modules that have been taken out of operation because they were 
incapable of any sulfur dioxide emission reduction or which would have 
suffered significant physical damage if they had remained in operation, 
and
    (3) Designing, constructing, and operating a spare flue gas 
desulfurization system module for an affected facility larger than 365 
MW (1,250 million Btu/hr) heat input (approximately 125 MW electrical 
output capacity). The Administrator may at his discretion require the 
owner or operator within 60 days of notification to demonstrate spare 
module capability. To demonstrate this capability, the owner or operator 
must demonstrate compliance with the appropriate requirements under 
paragraph (a), (b), (d), (e), and (h) under Sec. 60.43a for any period 
of operation lasting from 24 hours to 30 days when:
    (i) Any one flue gas desulfurization module is not operated,
    (ii) The affected facility is operating at the maximum heat input 
rate,
    (iii) The fuel fired during the 24-hour to 30-day period is 
representative of the type and average sulfur content of fuel used over 
a typical 30-day period, and
    (iv) The owner or operator has given the Administrator at least 30 
days notice of the date and period of time over which the demonstration 
will be performed.
    (e) After the initial performance test required under Sec. 60.8, 
compliance with the sulfur dioxide emission limitations and percentage 
reduction requirements under Sec. 60.43a and the nitrogen oxides 
emission limitations under Sec. 60.44a is based on the average emission 
rate for 30 successive boiler operating days. A separate performance 
test is completed at the end of each boiler operating day after the 
initial performance test, and a new 30 day average emission rate for 
both sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides and a new percent reduction for 
sulfur dioxide are calculated to show compliance with the standards.
    (f) For the initial performance test required under Sec. 60.8, 
compliance with the sulfur dioxide emission limitations and percent 
reduction requirements under Sec. 60.43a and the nitrogen oxides 
emission limitation under Sec. 60.44a is based on the average emission 
rates for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and percent reduction for 
sulfur dioxide for the first 30 successive boiler operating days. The 
initial performance test is the only test in which at least 30 days 
prior notice is required unless otherwise specified by the 
Administrator. The initial performance test is to be scheduled so that 
the first boiler operating day of the 30 successive boiler operating 
days is completed within 60 days after achieving the maximum production 
rate at which the affected facility will be operated, but not later

[[Page 116]]

than 180 days after initial startup of the facility.
    (g) Compliance is determined by calculating the arithmetic average 
of all hourly emission rates for SO<INF>2</INF> and NO<INF>x</INF> for 
the 30 successive boiler operating days, except for data obtained during 
startup, shutdown, malfunction (NO<INF>x</INF> only), or emergency 
conditions (SO<INF>2</INF> only). Compliance with the percentage 
reduction requirement for SO<INF>2</INF> is determined based on the 
average inlet and average outlet SO<INF>2</INF> emission rates for the 
30 successive boiler operating days.
    (h) If an owner or operator has not obtained the minimum quantity of 
emission data as required under Sec. 60.47a of this subpart, compliance 
of the affected facility with the emission requirements under 
Secs. 60.43a and 60.44a of this subpart for the day on which the 30-day 
period ends may be determined by the Administrator by following the 
applicable procedures in section 7 of Method 19.
    (i) Compliance provisions for sources subject to Sec. 60.44a(d)(1). 
The owner or operator of an affected facility subject to 
Sec. 60.44a(d)(1) (new source constructed after July 7, 1997) shall 
calculate NO<INF>X</INF> emissions by multiplying the average hourly 
NO<INF>X</INF> output concentration, measured according to the 
provisions of Sec. 60.47a(c), by the average hourly flow rate, measured 
according to the provisions of Sec. 60.47a(l), and divided by the 
average hourly gross energy output, measured according to the provisions 
of Sec. 60.47a(k).
    (j) Compliance provisions for duct burners subject to 
Sec. 60.44a(a)(1). To determine compliance with the emissions limits for 
NO<INF>X</INF> required by Sec. 60.44a(a) for duct burners used in 
combined cycle systems, either of the procedures described in paragraph 
(j)(1) or (2) of this section may be used:
    (1) The owner or operator of an affected duct burner shall conduct 
the performance test required under Sec. 60.8 using the appropriate 
methods in appendix A of this part. Compliance with the emissions limits 
under Sec. 60.44a(a)(1) is determined on the average of three (nominal 
1-hour) runs for the initial and subsequent performance tests. During 
the performance test, one sampling site shall be located in the exhaust 
of the turbine prior to the duct burner. A second sampling site shall be 
located at the outlet from the heat recovery steam generating unit. 
Measurements shall be taken at both sampling sites during the 
performance test; or
    (2) The owner or operator of an affected duct burner may elect to 
determine compliance by using the continuous emission monitoring system 
specified under Sec. 60.47a for measuring NO<INF>X</INF> and oxygen and 
meet the requirements of Sec. 60.47a. Data from a CEMS certified (or 
recertified) according to the provisions of 40 CFR 75.20, meeting the QA 
and QC requirements of 40 CFR 75.21, and validated according to 40 CFR 
75.23 may be used. The sampling site shall be located at the outlet from

NO<INF>X</INF> emission rate from the duct burner of the combined cycle 
system.
    (k) Compliance provisions for duct burners subject to 
Sec. 60.44a(d)(1). To determine compliance with the emissions limits for 
NO<INF>X</INF> required by Sec. 60.44a(d)(1) for duct burners used in 
combined cycle systems, either of the procedures described in paragraphs 
(k)(1) and (2) of this section may be used:
    (1) The owner or operator of an affected duct burner used in 
combined cycle systems shall determine compliance with the 
NO<INF>X</INF> standard in Sec. 60.44a(d)(1) as follows:

Equation 1 of this section:

E = [(Csg x Qsg)-(Cte x Qte)]/(Osg x h) (Eq. 1)

Where:

E = emission rate of NO<INF>X</INF> from the duct burner, ng/J (lb/Mwh) 
gross output
Csg = average hourly concentration of NO<INF>X</INF> exiting the steam 
generating unit, ng/dscm (lb/dscf)
Cte = average hourly concentration of NO<INF>X</INF> in the turbine 
exhaust upstream from duct burner, ng/dscm (lb/dscf)
Qsg = average hourly volumetric flow rate of exhaust gas from steam 
generating unit, dscm/hr (dscf/hr)

generating unit derived

[[Page 117]]

from the combustion of fuel in the affected duct burner

    (ii) Method 7E of appendix A of this part shall be used to determine 
the NO<INF>X</INF> concentrations (Csg and Cte). Method 2, 2F or 2G of 
appendix A of this part, as appropriate, shall be used to determine the 
volumetric flow rates (Qsg and Qte) of the exhaust gases. The volumetric 
flow rate measurements shall be taken at the same time as the 
concentration measurements.
    (iii) The owner or operator shall develop, demonstrate, and provide 
information satisfactory to the Administrator to determine the average 
hourly gross energy output from the steam generating unit, and the 
average hourly percentage of the total heat input to the steam 
generating unit derived from the combustion of fuel in the affected duct 
burner.
    (iv) Compliance with the emissions limits under Sec. 60.44a (d)(1) 
is determined by the three-run average (nominal 1-hour runs) for the 
initial and subsequent performance tests.
    (2) The owner or operator of an affected duct burner used in a 
combined cycle system may elect to determine compliance with the 
NO<INF>X</INF> standard in Sec. 60.44a(d)(1) on a 30-day rolling average 
basis as indicated in paragraphs (k)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section.
    (i) The emission rate (E) of NO<INF>X</INF> shall be computed using 
Equation 2 of this section:

E = (Csg x Qsd) /Occ (Eq. 2)

Where:

E = emission rate of NO<INF>X</INF> from the duct burner, ng/J (lb/Mwh) 
gross output
Csg = average hourly concentration of NO<INF>X</INF> exiting the steam

unit. Data from a continuous flow monitoring system certified (or 
recertified) following procedures specified in 40 CFR 75.20, meeting the 
quality assurance and quality control requirements of 40 CFR 75.21, and 
validated according to 40 CFR 75.23 may be used.
    (iii) The continuous monitoring system specified under 
Sec. 60.47a(k) for measuring and determining gross energy output shall 
be used to determine the average hourly gross energy output from the 
entire combined cycle unit (Occ), which is the combined output from the 
combustion turbine and the steam generating unit.
    (iv) The owner or operator may, in lieu of installing, operating,

emissions by installing, operating, and maintaining continuous fuel 
flowmeters following the appropriate measurements procedures specified 
in appendix D of 40 CFR part 75. If this compliance option is selected, 
the emission rate (E) of NO<INF>X</INF> shall be computed using Equation 
3 of this section:

E = (ERsg x Hcc) /Occ (Eq. 3)

Where:

E = emission rate of NO<INF>X</INF> from the duct burner, ng/J (lb/Mwh) 
gross output
ERsg = average hourly emission rate of NO<INF>X</INF> exiting the steam

emissions limits by measuring the emissions combined with the emissions 
from the other unit(s) utilizing the common steam turbine; or
    (ii) Develop, demonstrate, and provide information satisfactory to 
the

turbine whenever the demonstration ensures accurate estimation of 
emissions regulated under this part.

Sec. 60.47a  Emission monitoring.

    (a) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall install, 
calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous monitoring system, and 
record the output of the system, for measuring the opacity of emissions 
discharged to the atmosphere, except where gaseous fuel is the only fuel 
combusted. If opacity interference due to water droplets exists in the 
stack (for example, from the use of an FGD system), the opacity is 
monitored upstream of the interference (at the inlet to the FGD system). 
If opacity interference is experienced at all locations (both at the 
inlet and outlet of the sulfur dioxide control system), alternate 
parameters indicative of the particulate matter control system's 
performance are monitored (subject to the approval of the 
Administrator).
    (b) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall install, 
calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous monitoring system, and 
record the output of the system, for measuring sulfur dioxide emissions, 
except where natural gas is the only fuel combusted, as follows:
    (1) Sulfur dioxide emissions are monitored at both the inlet and 
outlet of the sulfur dioxide control device.
    (2) For a facility which qualifies under the provisions of 
Sec. 60.43a(d), sulfur dioxide emissions are only monitored as 
discharged to the atmosphere.
    (3) An ``as fired'' fuel monitoring system (upstream of coal 
pulverizers) meeting the requirements of Method 19may be used to 
determine potential sulfur dioxide emissions in place of a continuous 
sulfur dioxide emission monitor at the inlet to the sulfur dioxide 
control device as required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (c)(1) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall install, 
calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous monitoring system, and 
record the output of the system, for measuring nitrogen oxides emissions 
discharged to the atmosphere; or
    (2) If the owner or operator has installed a nitrogen oxides 
emission rate continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) to meet the 
requirements of part 75 of this chapter and is continuing to meet the 
ongoing requirements of part 75 of this chapter, that CEMS may be used 
to meet the requirements of this section, except that the owner or 
operator shall also meet the requirements of Sec. 60.49a. Data reported 
to meet the requirements of Sec. 60.49a shall not include data 
substituted using the missing data procedures in subpart D of part 75 of 
this chapter, nor shall the data have been bias adjusted according to 
the procedures of part 75 of this chapter.
    (d) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall install, 
calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous monitoring system, and 
record the output of the system, for measuring the oxygen or carbon 
dioxide content of the flue gases at each location where sulfur dioxide 
or nitrogen oxides emissions are monitored.
    (e) The continuous monitoring systems under paragraphs (b), (c), and 
(d) of this section are operated and data recorded during all periods of 
operation of the affected facility including periods of startup, 
shutdown, malfunction or emergency conditions, except for continuous 
monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero and 
span adjustments.
    (f) The owner or operator shall obtain emission data for at least 18 
hours in at least 22 out of 30 successive boiler operating days. If this 
minimum data requirement cannot be met with a continuous monitoring 
system, the owner or operator shall supplement emission data with other 
monitoring systems approved by the Administrator or the reference 
methods and procedures as described in paragraph (h) of this section.

[[Page 119]]

    (g) The 1-hour averages required under paragraph Sec. 60.13(h) are 
expressed in ng/J (lb/million Btu) heat input and used to calculate the 
average emission rates under Sec. 60.46a. The 1-hour averages are 
calculated using the data points required under Sec. 60.13(b). At least 
two data points must be used to calculate the 1-hour averages.
    (h) When it becomes necessary to supplement continuous monitoring 
system data to meet the minimum data requirements in paragraph (f) of 
this section, the owner or operator shall use the reference methods and 
procedures as specified in this paragraph. Acceptable alternative 
methods and procedures are given in paragraph (j) of this section.

    (3) The emission rate correction factor, integrated bag sampling and 
analysis procedure of Method 3B shall be used to determine the 
O<INF>2</INF> or CO<INF>2</INF> concentration at the same location as 
the O<INF>2</INF> or CO<INF>2</INF> monitor. Samples shall be taken for 
at least 30 minutes in each hour. Each sample represents a 1-hour 
average.
    (4) The procedures in Method 19 shall be used to compute each 1-hour 
average concentration in ng/J (1b/million Btu) heat input.
    (i) The owner or operator shall use methods and procedures in this 
paragraph to conduct monitoring system performance evaluations under 
Sec. 60.13(c) and calibration checks under Sec. 60.13(d). Acceptable 
alternative methods and procedures are given in paragraph (j) of this 
section.
    (1) Methods 3B, 6, and 7 shall be used to determine O<INF>2</INF>, 
SO<INF>2</INF>, and NO<INF>X</INF> concentrations, respectively.
    (2) SO<INF>2</INF> or NO<INF>x</INF> (NO), as applicable, shall be 
used for preparing the calibration gas mixtures (in N<INF>2</INF>, as

part.
    (3) For affected facilities burning only fossil fuel, the span value 
for a continuous monitoring system for measuring opacity is between 60 
and 80 percent and for a continuous monitoring system measuring nitrogen 
oxides is determined as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                       Span value for
                    Fossil fuel                        nitrogen oxides
                                                            (ppm)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gas...............................................                   500
Liquid............................................                   500
Solid.............................................                 1,000
Combination.......................................      500 (x+y)+1,000z
------------------------------------------------------------------------

where:
x is the fraction of total heat input derived from gaseous fossil fuel,
y is the fraction of total heat input derived from liquid fossil fuel, 
and
z is the fraction of total heat input derived from solid fossil fuel.

    (4) All span values computed under paragraph (b)(3) of this section 
for burning combinations of fossil fuels are rounded to the nearest 500 
ppm.
    (5) For affected facilities burning fossil fuel, alone or in 
combination with non-fossil fuel, the span value of the sulfur dioxide 
continuous monitoring system at the inlet to the sulfur dioxide control 
device is 125 percent of the maximum estimated hourly potential 
emissions of the fuel fired, and the outlet of the sulfur dioxide 
control device is 50 percent of maximum estimated hourly potential 
emissions of the fuel fired.
    (j) The owner or operator may use the following as alternatives to 
the reference methods and procedures specified in this section:
    (1) For Method 6, Method 6A or 6B (whenever Methods 6 and 3 or 3B 
data are used) or 6C may be used. Each Method 6B sample obtained over 24 
hours represents 24 1-hour averages. If Method 6A or 6B is used under 
paragraph (i) of this section, the conditions under Sec. 60.46(d)(1) 
apply; these conditions do not apply under paragraph (h) of this 
section.

    (k) The procedures specified in paragraphs (k)(1) through (3) of 
this section shall be used to determine gross output for sources 
demonstrating compliance with the output-based standard under 
Sec. 60.44a(d)(1).
    (1) The owner or operator of an affected facility with electricity

generation shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate meters for 
steam flow, temperature, and pressure; measure gross process steam 
output in joules per hour (or Btu per hour) on a continuous basis; and 
record the output of the monitor.
    (3) For affected facilities generating process steam in combination 
with electrical generation, the gross energy output is determined from 
the gross electrical output measured in accordance with paragraph (k)(1) 
of this section plus 50 percent of the gross thermal output of the 
process steam measured in accordance with paragraph (k)(2) of this 
section.
    (l) The owner or operator of an affected facility demonstrating 
compliance with the output-based standard under Sec. 60.44a(d)(1) shall 
install, certify, operate, and maintain a continuous flow monitoring 
system meeting the requirements of Performance Specification 6 of 
appendix B and procedure 1 of appendix F of this subpart, and record the 
output of the system, for measuring the flow of exhaust gases discharged 
to the atmosphere; or
    (m) Alternatively, data from a continuous flow monitoring system 
certified according to the requirements of 40 CFR 75.20, meeting the 
applicable quality control and quality assurance requirements of 40 CFR 
75.21, and validated according to 40 CFR 75.23, may be used.

Sec. 60.48a  Compliance determination procedures and methods.

    (a) In conducting the performance tests required in Sec. 60.8, the 
owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the 
methods in appendix A of this part or the methods and procedures as 
specified in this section, except as provided in Sec. 60.8(b). Section 
60.8(f) does not apply to this section for SO<INF>2</INF> and 
NO<INF>x.</INF> Acceptable alternative methods are given in paragraph 
(e) of this section.
    (b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
particulate matter standards in Sec. 60.42a as follows:
    (1) The dry basis F factor (O<INF>2</INF>) procedures in Method 19 
shall be used to compute the emission rate of particulate matter.
    (2) For the particular matter concentration, Method 5 shall be used 
at affected facilities without wet FGD systems and Method 5B shall be 
used after wet FGD systems.
    (i) The sampling time and sample volume for each run shall be at 
least 120 minutes and 1.70 dscm (60 dscf). The probe and filter holder 
heating system in the sampling train may be set to provide an average 
gas temperature of no greater than 160<plus-minus>14  deg.C 
(320<plus-minus>25  deg.F).

[[Page 121]]

    (ii) For each particulate run, the emission rate correction factor, 
integrated or grab sampling and analysis procedures of Method 3B shall 
be used to determine the O<INF>2</INF> concentration. The O<INF>2</INF> 
sample shall be obtained simultaneously with, and at the same traverse 
points as, the particulate run. If the particulate run has more than 12 
traverse points, the O<INF>2</INF> traverse points may be reduced to 12 
provided that Method 1 is used to locate the 12 O<INF>2</INF> traverse 
points. If the grab sampling procedure is used, the O<INF>2</INF> 
concentration for the run shall be the arithmetic mean of the sample 
O<INF>2</INF> concentrations at all traverse points.
    (3) Method 9 and the procedures in Sec. 60.11 shall be used to 
determine opacity.
    (c) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
SO<INF>2</INF> standards in Sec. 60.43a as follows:
    (1) The percent of potential SO<INF>2</INF> emissions 
(%P<INF>s</INF>) to the atmosphere shall be computed using the following 
equation:

%P<INF>s</INF>=[(100--%R<INF>f</INF>) (100--%R<INF>g</INF>)]/100

where:

%P<INF>s</INF>=percent of potential SO<INF>2</INF> emissions, percent.
%R<INF>f</INF>=percent reduction from fuel pretreatment, percent.
%R<INF>g</INF>=percent reduction by SO<INF>2</INF> control system, 
percent.

    (2) The procedures in Method 19 may be used to determine percent 
reduction (%R<INF>f</INF>) of sulfur by such processes as fuel 
pretreatment (physical coal cleaning, hydrodesulfurization of fuel oil, 
etc.), coal pulverizers, and bottom and flyash interactions. This 
determination is optional.
    (3) The procedures in Method 19 shall be used to determine the 
percent SO<INF>2</INF> reduction (%R<INF>g</INF>) of any SO<INF>2</INF> 
control system. Alternatively, a combination of an ``as fired'' fuel 
monitor and emission rates measured after the control system, following 
the procedures in Method 19, may be used if the percent reduction is 
calculated using the average emission rate from the SO<INF>2</INF> 
control device and the average SO<INF>2</INF> input rate from the ``as 
fired'' fuel analysis for 30 successive boiler operating days.
    (4) The appropriate procedures in Method 19 shall be used to 
determine the emission rate.
    (5) The continuous monitoring system in Sec. 60.47a (b) and (d) 
shall be used to determine the concentrations of SO<INF>2</INF> and 
CO<INF>2</INF> or O<INF>2.</INF>
    (d) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
NO<INF>x</INF> standard in Sec. 60.44a as follows:
    (1) The appropriate procedures in Method 19 shall be used to 
determine the emission rate of NO<INF>x.</INF>
    (2) The continous monitoring system in Sec. 60.47a (c) and (d) shall 
be used to determine the concentrations of NO<INF>x</INF> and 
CO<INF>2</INF> or O<INF>2.</INF>
    (e) The owner or operator may use the following as alternatives to 
the reference methods and procedures specified in this section:
    (1) For Method 5 or 5B, Method 17 may be used at facilities with or 
without wet FGD systems if the stack temperature at the sampling 
location does not exceed an average temperature of 160  deg.C (320 
deg.F). The procedures of Secs. 2.1 and 2.3 of Method 5B may be used in 
Method 17 only if it is used after wet FGD systems. Method 17 shall not 
be used after wet FGD systems if the effluent is saturated or laden with 
water droplets.
    (2) The F<INF>c</INF> factor (CO<INF>2</INF>) procedures in Method 
19 may be used to compute the emission rate of particulate matter under 
the stipulations of Sec. 60.46(d)(1). The CO<INF>2</INF> shall be 
determined in the same manner as the O<INF>2</INF> concentration.
    (f) Electric utility combined cycle gas turbines are performance 
tested for particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides using 
the procedures of Method 19. The sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides 
emission rates from the gas turbine used in Method 19 calculations are 
determined when the gas turbine is performance tested under subpart GG. 
The potential uncontrolled particulate matter emission rate from a gas 
turbine is defined as 17 ng/J (0.04 lb/million Btu) heat input.

cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility 
any gases that contain nitrogen oxides in excess of a limit determined 
by the use of the following formula:

E<INF>n</INF>=[(EL<INF>go</INF> H<INF>go</INF>)+(EL<INF>ro</INF>

    (H<INF>go</INF>+H<INF>ro</INF>+H<INF>c</INF>)

where:

E<INF>n</INF> is the nitrogen oxides emission limit (expressed as

[[Page 132]]

EL<INF>c</INF> is the appropriate emission limit from paragraph (a)(3) 
for combustion of coal, and
H<INF>c</INF> is the heat input from combustion of coal.

    (f) Any owner or operator of an affected facility that combusts 
byproduct/waste with either natural gas or oil may petition the 
Administrator within 180 days of the initial startup of the affected 
facility to establish a nitrogen oxides emission limit which shall apply 
specifically to that affected facility when the byproduct/waste is 
combusted. The petition shall include sufficient and appropriate data, 
as determined by the Administrator, such as nitrogen oxides emissions 
from the affected facility, waste composition (including nitrogen 
content), and combustion conditions to allow the Administrator to 
confirm that the affected facility is unable to comply with the emission 
limits in paragraph (e) of this section and to determine the appropriate 
emission limit for the affected facility.
    (1) Any owner or operator of an affected facility petitioning for a 
facility-specific nitrogen oxides emission limit under this section 
shall:
    (i) Demonstrate compliance with the emission limits for natural gas 
and distillate oil in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or for residual 
oil in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, as appropriate, by conducting a 
30-day performance test as provided in Sec. 60.46b(e). During the 
performance test only natural gas, distillate oil, or residual oil shall 
be combusted in the affected facility; and
    (ii) Demonstrate that the affected facility is unable to comply with 
the emission limits for natural gas and distillate oil in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section or for residual oil in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, as appropriate, when gaseous or liquid byproduct/waste is 
combusted in the affected facility under the same conditions and using 
the same technological system of emission reduction applied when 
demonstrating compliance under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section.
    (2) The nitrogen oxides emission limits for natural gas or 
distillate oil in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or for residual oil 
in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, as appropriate, shall be applicable 
to the affected facility until and unless the petition is approved by 
the Administrator. If the petition is approved by the Administrator, a 
facility-specific nitrogen oxides emission limit will be established at 
the nitrogen oxides emission level achievable when the affected facility 
is combusting oil or natural gas and byproduct/waste in a manner that 
the Administrator determines to be consistent with minimizing nitrogen 
oxides emissions.
    (g) Any owner or operator of an affected facility that combusts 
hazardous waste (as defined by 40 CFR part 261 or 40 CFR part 761) with 
natural gas or oil may petition the Administrator within 180 days of the 
initial startup of the affected facility for a waiver from compliance 
with the nitrogen oxides emission limit which applies specifically to 
that affected facility. The petition must include sufficient and 
appropriate data, as determined by the Administrator, on nitrogen oxides 
emissions from the affected facility, waste destruction efficiencies, 
waste composition (including nitrogen content), the quantity of specific 
wastes to be combusted and combustion conditions to allow the 
Administrator to determine if the affected facility is able to comply 
with the nitrogen oxides emission limits required by this section. The 
owner or operator of the affected facility shall demonstrate that when 
hazardous waste is combusted in the affected facility, thermal 
destruction efficiency requirements for hazardous waste specified in an 
applicable federally enforceable requirement preclude compliance with 
the nitrogen oxides emission limits of this section. The nitrogen oxides 
emission limits for natural gas or distillate oil in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section or for residual oil in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, as 
appropriate, are applicable to the affected facility until and unless 
the petition is approved by the Administrator. (See 40 CFR 761.70 for 
regulations applicable to the incineration of materials containing 
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's).)
    (h) For purposes of paragraph (i) of this section, the nitrogen 
oxide standards under this section apply at all times including periods 
of startup, shutdown, or malfunction.

[[Page 133]]

    (i) Except as provided under paragraph (j) of this section, 
compliance with the emission limits under this section is determined on 
a 30-day rolling average basis.
    (j) Compliance with the emission limits under this section is 
determined on a 24-hour average basis for the initial performance test 
and on a 3-hour average basis for subsequent performance tests for any 
affected facilities that:
    (1) Combust, alone or in combination, only natural gas, distillate 
oil, or residual oil with a nitrogen content of 0.30 weight percent or 
less;
    (2) Have a combined annual capacity factor of 10 percent or less for 
natural gas, distillate oil, and residual oil with a nitrogen content of 
0.30 weight percent or less; and
    (3) Are subject to a Federally enforceable requirement limiting 
operation of the affected facility to the firing of natural gas, 
distillate oil, and/or residual oil with a nitrogen content of 0.30 
weight percent or less and limiting operation of the affected facility 
to a combined annual capacity factor of 10 percent or less for natural 
gas, distillate oil, and residual oil and a nitrogen content of 0.30 
weight percent or less.
    (k) Affected facilities that meet the criteria described in 
paragraphs (j) (1), (2), and (3) of this section, and that have a heat 
input capacity of 73 MW (250 million Btu/hour) or less, are not subject 
to the nitrogen oxides emission limits under this section.
    (l) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is 
completed or is required to be completed under Sec. 60.8, whichever date 
comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility which 
commenced construction or reconstruction after July 9, 1997 shall cause 
to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any 
gases that contain nitrogen oxides (expressed as NO<INF>2</INF>) in 
excess of the following limits:
    (1) If the affected facility combusts coal, oil, or natural gas, or 
a mixture of these fuels, or with any other fuels: A limit of 86 ng/
J<INF>I</INF> (0.20 lb/million Btu) heat input unless the affected 
facility has an annual capacity factor for coal, oil, and natural gas of 
10 percent (0.10) or less and is subject to a federally enforceable 
requirement that limits operation of the facility to an annual capacity 
factor of 10 percent (0.10) or less for coal, oil, and natural gas; or
    (2) If the affected facility has a low heat release rate and 
combusts natural gas or distillate oil in excess of 30 percent of the 
heat input from the combustion of all fuels, a limit determined by use 
of the following formula:

E<INF>n</INF> = [(0.10 * H<INF>go</INF>) + (0.20 * H<INF>r</INF>)]/
    (H<INF>go</INF> + H<INF>r</INF>)

Where:

E<INF>n</INF> is the NO<INF>X</INF> emission limit, (lb/million Btu),
H<INF>go</INF> is the heat input from combustion of natural gas or 
distillate oil, and
H<INF>r</INF> is the heat input from combustion of any other fuel.

Sec. 60.45b  Compliance and performance test methods and procedures for 
sulfur dioxide.

    (a) The sulfur dioxide emission standards under Sec. 60.42b apply at 
all times.
    (b) In conducting the performance tests required under Sec. 60.8, 
the owner or operator shall use the methods and procedures in appendix A 
of this part or the methods and procedures as specified in this section, 
except as provided in Sec. 60.8(b). Section 60.8(f) does not apply to 
this section. The 30-day notice required in Sec. 60.8(d) applies only to 
the initial performance test unless otherwise specified by the 
Administrator.
    (c) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall conduct 
performance tests to determine compliance with the percent of potential 
sulfur dioxide emission rate (% P<INF>s</INF>) and the sulfur dioxide 
emission rate (E<INF>s</INF>) pursuant to Sec. 60.42b following the 
procedures listed below, except as provided under paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (1) The initial performance test shall be conducted over the first 
30 consecutive operating days of the steam generating unit. Compliance 
with the sulfur dioxide standards shall be determined using a 30-day 
average. The first operating day included in the initial performance 
test shall be scheduled within 30 days after achieving the maximum 
production rate at which the affected facility will be operated, but not 
later

[[Page 134]]

than 180 days after initial startup of the facility.
    (2) If only coal or only oil is combusted, the following procedures 
are used:
    (i) The procedures in Method 19 are used to determine the hourly 
sulfur dioxide emission rate (E<INF>ho</INF>) and the 30-day average 
emission rate (E<INF>ao</INF>). The hourly averages used to compute the 
30-day averages are obtained from the continuous emission monitoring 
system of Sec. 60.47b (a) or (b).
    (ii) The percent of potential sulfur dioxide emission rate (% 
P<INF>s</INF>) emitted to the atmosphere is computed using the following 
formula:

% P<INF>s</INF>=100 (1-% R<INF>g</INF>/100)(1-% R<INF>f</INF>/100)

where:

% R<INF>g</INF> is the sulfur dioxide removal efficiency of the control 
device as determined by Method 19, in percent.
% R<INF>f</INF> is the sulfur dioxide removal efficiency of fuel 
pretreatment as determined by Method 19, in percent.

    (3) If coal or oil is combusted with other fuels, the same 
procedures required in paragraph (c)(2) of this section are used, except 
as provided in the following:
    (i) An adjusted hourly sulfur dioxide emission rate 
(E<INF>ho</INF><SUP>o</SUP>) is used in Equation 19-19 of Method 19 to 
compute an adjusted 30-day average emission rate 
(E<INF>ao</INF><SUP>o</SUP>). The E<INF>ho</INF> is computed using the 
following formula:

E<INF>ho</INF><SUP>o</SUP>=[E<INF>ho</INF>-E<INF>w</INF>(1-
    X<INF>k</INF>)]/X<INF>k</INF>

where:

E<INF>ho</INF><SUP>o</SUP> is the adjusted hourly sulfur dioxide 
emission rate, ng/J (lb/million Btu).
E<INF>ho</INF> is the hourly sulfur dioxide emission rate, ng/J (lb/
million Btu).
E<INF>w</INF> is the sulfur dioxide concentration in fuels other than 
coal and oil combusted in the affected facility, as determined by the 
fuel sampling and analysis procedures in Method 19, ng/J (lb/million 
Btu). The value E<INF>w</INF> for each fuel lot is used for each hourly 
average during the time that the lot is being combusted.
X<INF>k</INF> is the fraction of total heat input from fuel combustion 
derived from coal, oil, or coal and oil, as determined by applicable 
procedures in Method 19.

    (ii) To compute the percent of potential sulfur dioxide emission 
rate (% P<INF>s</INF>), an adjusted % R<INF>g</INF> (% 
R<INF>g</INF><SUP>o</SUP>) is computed from the adjusted 
E<INF>ao</INF><SUP>o</SUP> from paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section and 
an adjusted average sulfur dioxide inlet rate 
(E<INF>ai</INF><SUP>o</SUP>) using the following formula:

% R<INF>g</INF><SUP>o</SUP>=100 (1.0-E<INF>ao</INF><SUP>o</SUP>/
    E<INF>ai</INF><SUP>o</SUP>)


To compute E<INF>ai</INF><SUP>o</SUP>, an adjusted hourly sulfur dioxide 
inlet rate (E<INF>hi</INF><SUP>o</SUP>) is used. The 
E<INF>hi</INF><SUP>o</SUP> is computed using the following formula:

E<INF>hi</INF><SUP>o</SUP>=[E<INF>hi</INF>-E<INF>w</INF>(1-
    X<INF>k</INF>)]/X<INF>k</INF>

where:

E<INF>hi</INF><SUP>o</SUP> is the adjusted hourly sulfur dioxide inlet 
rate, ng/J (lb/million Btu).
E<INF>hi</INF> is the hourly sulfur dioxide inlet rate, ng/J (lb/million 
Btu).

    (4) The owner or operator of an affected facility subject to 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section does not have to measure parameters 
E<INF>w</INF> or X<INF>k</INF> if the owner or operator elects to assume 
that X<INF>k</INF>=1.0. Owners or operators of affected facilities who 
assume X<INF>k</INF>=1.0 shall
    (i) Determine % P<INF>s</INF> following the procedures in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section, and
    (ii) Sulfur dioxide emissions (E<INF>s</INF>) are considered to be 
in compliance with sulfur dioxide emission limits under Sec. 60.42b.
    (5) The owner or operator of an affected facility that qualifies 
under the provisions of Sec. 60.42b(d) does not have to measure 
parameters E<INF>w</INF> or X<INF>k</INF> under paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section if the owner or operator of the affected facility elects to 
measure sulfur dioxide emission rates of the coal or oil following the 
fuel sampling and analysis procedures under Method 19.
    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (j), the owner or operator of an 
affected facility that combusts only very low sulfur oil, has an annual 
capacity factor for oil of 10 percent (0.10) or less, and is subject to 
a Federally enforceable requirement limiting operation of the affected 
facility to an annual capacity factor for oil of 10 percent (0.10) or 
less shall:
    (1) Conduct the initial performance test over 24 consecutive steam 
generating unit operating hours at full load;
    (2) Determine compliance with the standards after the initial 
performance test based on the arithmetic average of the hourly emissions 
data during each steam generating unit operating day if a continuous 
emission measurement

[[Page 135]]

system (CEMS) is used, or based on a daily average if Method 6B or fuel 
sampling and analysis procedures under Method 19 are used.
    (e) The owner or operator of an affected facility subject to 
Sec. 60.42b(d)(1) shall demonstrate the maximum design capacity of the 
steam generating unit by operating the facility at maximum capacity for 
24 hours. This demonstration will be made during the initial performance 
test and a subsequent demonstration may be requested at any other time. 
If the 24-hour average firing rate for the affected facility is less 
than the maximum design capacity provided by the manufacturer of the 
affected facility, the 24-hour average firing rate shall be used to 
determine the capacity utilization rate for the affected facility, 
otherwise the maximum design capacity provided by the manufacturer is 
used.
    (f) For the initial performance test required under Sec. 60.8, 
compliance with the sulfur dioxide emission limits and percent reduction 
requirements under Sec. 60.42b is based on the average emission rates 
and the average percent reduction for sulfur dioxide for the first 30 
consecutive steam generating unit operating days, except as provided 
under paragraph (d) of this section. The initial performance test is the 
only test for which at least 30 days prior notice is required unless 
otherwise specified by the Administrator. The initial performance test 
is to be scheduled so that the first steam generating unit operating day 
of the 30 successive steam generating unit operating days is completed 
within 30 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which the 
affected facility will be operated, but not later than 180 days after 
initial startup of the facility. The boiler load during the 30-day 
period does not have to be the maximum design load, but must be 
representative of future operating conditions and include at least one 
24-hour period at full load.
    (g) After the initial performance test required under Sec. 60.8, 
compliance with the sulfur dioxide emission limits and percent reduction 
requirements under Sec. 60.42b is based on the average emission rates 
and the average percent reduction for sulfur dioxide for 30 successive 
steam generating unit operating days, except as provided under paragraph 
(d). A separate performance test is completed at the end of each steam 
generating unit operating day after the initial performance test, and a 
new 30-day average emission rate and percent reduction for sulfur 
dioxide are calculated to show compliance with the standard.
    (h) Except as provided under paragraph (i) of this section, the 
owner or operator of an affected facility shall use all valid sulfur 
dioxide emissions data in calculating % P<INF>s</INF> and E<INF>ho</INF> 
under paragraph (c), of this section whether or not the minimum 
emissions data requirements under Sec. 60.46b are achieved. All valid 
emissions data, including valid sulfur dioxides emission data collected 
during periods of startup, shutdown and malfunction, shall be used in 
calculating % P<INF>s</INF> and E<INF>ho</INF> pursuant to paragraph (c) 
of this section.
    (i) During periods of malfunction or maintenance of the sulfur 
dioxide control systems when oil is combusted as provided under 
Sec. 60.42b(i), emission data are not used to calculate % P<INF>s</INF> 
or E<INF>s</INF> under Sec. 60.42b (a), (b) or (c), however, the 
emissions data are used to determine compliance with the emission limit 
under Sec. 60.42b(i).
    (j) The owner or operator of an affected facility that combusts very 
low sulfur oil is not subject to the compliance and performance testing 
requirements of this section if the owner or operator obtains fuel 
receipts as described in Sec. 60.49b(r).

Sec. 60.46b  Compliance and performance test methods and procedures for 
particulate matter and nitrogen oxides.

    (a) The particulate matter emission standards and opacity limits 
under Sec. 60.43b apply at all times except during periods of startup, 
shutdown, or malfunction. The nitrogen oxides emission standards under 
Sec. 60.44b apply at all times.
    (b) Compliance with the particulate matter emission standards under 
Sec. 60.43b shall be determined through performance testing as described 
in paragraph (d) of this section.

[[Page 136]]

    (c) Compliance with the nitrogen oxides emission standards under 
Sec. 60.44b shall be determined through performance testing under 
paragraph (e) or (f), or under paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section, 
as applicable.
    (d) To determine compliance with the particulate matter emission 
limits and opacity limits under Sec. 60.43b, the owner or operator of an 
affected facility shall conduct an initial performance test as required 
under Sec. 60.8 using the following procedures and reference methods:
    (1) Method 3B is used for gas analysis when applying Method 5 or 
Method 17.
    (2) Method 5, Method 5B, or Method 17 shall be used to measure the 
concentration of particulate matter as follows:
    (i) Method 5 shall be used at affected facilities without wet flue 
gas desulfurization (FGD) systems; and
    (ii) Method 17 may be used at facilities with or without wet 
scrubber systems provided the stack gas temperature does not exceed a 
temperature of 160  deg.C (320  deg.F). The procedures of sections 2.1 
and 2.3 of Method 5B may be used in Method 17 only if it is used after a 
wet FGD system. Do not use Method 17 after wet FGD systems if the 
effluent is saturated or laden with water droplets.
    (iii) Method 5B is to be used only after wet FGD systems.
    (3) Method 1 is used to select the sampling site and the number of 
traverse sampling points. The sampling time for each run is at least 120 
minutes and the minimum sampling volume is 1.7 dscm (60 dscf) except 
that smaller sampling times or volumes may be approved by the 
Administrator when necessitated by process variables or other factors.
    (4) For Method 5, the temperature of the sample gas in the probe and 
filter holder is monitored and is maintained at 160<plus-minus>14  deg.C 
(320<plus-minus>25  deg.F).
    (5) For determination of particulate matter emissions, the oxygen or 
carbon dioxide sample is obtained simultaneously with each run of Method 
5, Method 5B or Method 17 by traversing the duct at the same sampling 
location.
    (6) For each run using Method 5, Method 5B or Method 17, the 
emission rate expressed in nanograms per joule heat input is determined 
using:
    (i) The oxygen or carbon dioxide measurements and particulate matter 
measurements obtained under this section,
    (ii) The dry basis F factor, and
    (iii) The dry basis emission rate calculation procedure contained in 
Method 19.
    (7) Method 9 is used for determining the opacity of stack emissions.
    (e) To determine compliance with the emission limits for nitrogen 
oxides required under Sec. 60.44b, the owner or operator of an affected 
facility shall conduct the performance test as required under Sec. 60.8 
using the continuous system for monitoring nitrogen oxides under 
Sec. 60.48(b).
    (1) For the initial compliance test, nitrogen oxides from the steam 
generating unit are monitored for 30 successive steam generating unit 
operating days and the 30-day average emission rate is used to determine 
compliance with the nitrogen oxides emission standards under 
Sec. 60.44b. The 30-day average emission rate is calculated as the 
average of all hourly emissions data recorded by the monitoring system 
during the 30-day test period.
    (2) Following the date on which the initial performance test is 
completed or is required to be completed under Sec. 60.8 of this part, 
whichever date comes first, the owner or operator of an affected 
facility which combusts coal or which combusts residual oil having a 
nitrogen content greater than 0.30 weight percent shall determine 
compliance with the nitrogen oxides emission standards under Sec. 60.44b 
on a continuous basis through the use of a 30-day rolling average 
emission rate. A new 30-day rolling average emission rate is calculated 
each steam generating unit operating day as the average of all of the 
hourly nitrogen oxides emission data for the preceding 30 steam 
generating unit operating days.
    (3) Following the date on which the initial performance test is 
completed or is required to be completed under Sec. 60.8 of this part, 
whichever date comes first, the owner or operator of an affected 
facility which has a heat input

[[Page 137]]

capacity greater than 73 MW (250 million Btu/hour) and which combusts 
natural gas, distillate oil, or residual oil having a nitrogen content 
of 0.30 weight percent or less shall determine compliance with the 
nitrogen oxides standards under Sec. 60.44b on a continuous basis 
through the use of a 30-day rolling average emission rate. A new 30-day 
rolling average emission rate is calculated each steam generating unit 
operating day as the average of all of the hourly nitrogen oxides 
emission data for the preceding 30 steam generating unit operating days.
    (4) Following the date on which the initial performance test is 
completed or required to be completed under Sec. 60.8 of this part, 
whichever date comes first, the owner or operator of an affected 
facility which has a heat input capacity of 73 MW (250 million Btu/hour) 
or less and which combusts natural gas, distillate oil, or residual oil 
having a nitrogen content of 0.30 weight percent or less shall upon 
request determine compliance with the nitrogen oxides standards under 
Sec. 60.44b through the use of a 30-day performance test. During periods 
when performance tests are not requested, nitrogen oxides emissions data 
collected pursuant to Sec. 60.48b(g)(1) or Sec. 60.48b(g)(2) are used to 
calculate a 30-day rolling average emission rate on a daily basis and 
used to prepare excess emission reports, but will not be used to 
determine compliance with the nitrogen oxides emission standards. A new 
30-day rolling average emission rate is calculated each steam generating 
unit operating day as the average of all of the hourly nitrogen oxides 
emission data for the preceding 30 steam generating unit operating days.
    (5) If the owner or operator of an affected facility which combusts 
residual oil does not sample and analyze the residual oil for nitrogen 
content, as specified in Sec. 60.49b(e), the requirements of paragraph 
(iii) of this section apply and the provisions of paragraph (iv) of this 
section are inapplicable.
    (f) To determine compliance with the emissions limits for 
NO<INF>X</INF> required by Sec. 60.44b(a)(4) or Sec. 60.44b(l) for duct 
burners used in combined cycle systems, either of the procedures 
described in paragraph (f)(1) or (2) of this section may be used:
    (1) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall conduct the 
performance test required under Sec. 60.8 as follows:
    (i) The emissions rate (E) of NO<INF>X</INF> shall be computed using 
Equation of 1 this section:

E = Esg + (Hg /Hb)(Esg - Eg) (Eq. 1)

Where:

E = emissions rate of NO<INF>X</INF> from the duct burner, ng/J (lb/
million Btu) heat input
Esg = combined effluent emissions rate, in ng/J (lb/million Btu) heat 
input using appropriate F-Factor as described in Method 19
Hg = heat input rate to the combustion turbine, in Joules/hour (million 
Btu/hour)
Hb = heat input rate to the duct burner, in Joules/hour (million Btu/
hour)
Eg = emissions rate from the combustion turbine, in ng/J (lb/million 
Btu) heat input calculated using appropriate F-Factor as described in 
Method 19

    (ii) Method 7E of appendix A of this part shall be used to determine 
the NO<INF>X</INF> concentrations. Method 3A or 3B of appendix A of this 
part shall be used to determine oxygen concentration.
    (iii) The owner or operator shall identify and demonstrate to the 
Administrator's satisfaction suitable methods to determine the average 
hourly heat input rate to the combustion turbine and the average hourly 
heat input rate to the affected duct burner.
    (iv) Compliance with the emissions limits under Sec. 60.44b (a)(4) 
or Sec. 60.44b(l) is determined by the three-run average (nominal 1-hour 
runs) for the initial and subsequent performance tests; or
    (2) The owner or operator of an affected facility may elect to 
determine compliance on a 30-day rolling average basis by using the 
continuous emission monitoring system specified under Sec. 60.48b for 
measuring NO<INF>X</INF> and oxygen and meet the requirements of 
Sec. 60.48b. The sampling site shall be located at the outlet from the 
steam generating unit. The NO<INF>X</INF> emissions rate at the outlet 
from the steam generating unit shall constitute the NO<INF>X</INF> 
emissions rate from the duct burner of the combined cycle system.
    (g) The owner or operator of an affected facility described in 
Sec. 60.44b(j) or

[[Page 138]]

Sec. 60.44b(k) shall demonstrate the maximum heat input capacity of the 
steam generating unit by operating the facility at maximum capacity for 
24 hours. The owner or operator of an affected facility shall determine 
the maximum heat input capacity using the heat loss method described in 
sections 5 and 7.3 of the ASME Power Test Codes 4.1 (see IBR 
Sec. 60.17(h)). This demonstration of maximum heat input capacity shall 
be made during the initial performance test for affected facilities that 
meet the criteria of Sec. 60.44b(j). It shall be made within 60 days 
after achieving the maximum production rate at which the affected 
facility will be operated, but not later than 180 days after initial 
start-up of each facility, for affected facilities meeting the criteria 
of Sec. 60.44b(k). Subsequent demonstrations may be required by the 
Administrator at any other time. If this demonstration indicates that 
the maximum heat input capacity of the affected facility is less than 
that stated by the manufacturer of the affected facility, the maximum 
heat input capacity determined during this demonstration shall be used 
to determine the capacity utilization rate for the affected facility. 
Otherwise, the maximum heat input capacity provided by the manufacturer 
is used.
    (h) The owner or operator of an affected facility described in 
Sec. 60.44b(j) that has a heat input capacity greater than 73 MW (250 
million Btu/hour) shall:
    (1) Conduct an initial performance test as required under Sec. 60.8 
over a minimum of 24 consecutive steam generating unit operating hours 
at maximum heat input capacity to demonstrate compliance with the 
nitrogen oxides emission standards under Sec. 60.44b using Method 7, 7A, 
7E, or other approved reference methods; and
    (2) Conduct subsequent performance tests once per calendar year or 
every 400 hours of operation (whichever comes first) to demonstrate 
compliance with the nitrogen oxides emission standards under Sec. 60.44b 
over a minimum of 3 consecutive steam generating unit operating hours at 
maximum heat input capacity using Method 7, 7A, 7E, or other approved 
reference methods.

Sec. 60.47b  Emission monitoring for sulfur dioxide.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (f) of this section, 
the owner or operator of an affected facility subject to the sulfur 
dioxide standards under Sec. 60.42b shall install, calibrate, maintain, 
and operate continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) for measuring 
sulfur dioxide concentrations and either oxygen (O<INF>2</INF>) or 
carbon dioxide (CO<INF>2</INF>) concentrations and shall record the 
output of the systems. The sulfur dioxide and either oxygen or carbon 
dioxide concentrations shall both be monitored at the inlet and outlet 
of the sulfur dioxide control device.
    (b) As an alternative to operating CEMS as required under paragraph 
(a) of this section, an owner or operator may elect to determine the 
average sulfur dioxide emissions and percent reduction by:
    (1) Collecting coal or oil samples in an as-fired condition at the 
inlet to the steam generating unit and analyzing them for sulfur and 
heat content according to Method 19. Method 19 provides procedures for 
converting these measurements into the format to be used in calculating 
the average sulfur dioxide input rate, or
    (2) Measuring sulfur dioxide according to Method 6B at the inlet or 
outlet to the sulfur dioxide control system. An initial stratification 
test is required to verify the adequacy of the Method 6B sampling 
location. The stratification test shall consist of three paired runs of 
a suitable sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide measurement train operated 
at the candidate location and a second similar train operated according 
to the procedures in section 3.2 and the applicable procedures in 
section 7 of Performance Specification 2. Method 6B, Method 6A, or a 
combination of Methods 6 and 3 or 3B or Methods 6C

[[Page 139]]

and 3A are suitable measurement techniques. If Method 6B is used for the 
second train, sampling time and timer operation may be adjusted for the 
stratification test as long as an adequate sample volume is collected; 
however, both sampling trains are to be operated similarly. For the 
location to be adequate for Method 6B 24-hour tests, the mean of the 
absolute difference between the three paired runs must be less than 10 
percent.
    (3) A daily sulfur dioxide emission rate, E<INF>D</INF>, shall be 
determined using the procedure described in Method 6A, section 7.6.2 
(Equation 6A-8) and stated in ng/J (lb/million Btu) heat input.
    (4) The mean 30-day emission rate is calculated using the daily 
measured values in ng/J (lb/million Btu) for 30 successive steam 
generating unit operating days using equation 19-20 of Method 19.
    (c) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall obtain 
emission data for at least 75 percent of the operating hours in at least 
22 out of 30 successive boiler operating days. If this minimum data 
requirement is not met with a single monitoring system, the owner or 
operator of the affected facility shall supplement the emission data 
with data collected with other monitoring systems as approved by the 
Administrator or the reference methods and procedures as described in 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) The 1-hour average sulfur dioxide emission rates measured by the 
CEMS required by paragraph (a) of this section and required under 
Sec. 60.13(h) is expressed in ng/J or lb/million Btu heat input and is 
used to calculate the average emission rates under Sec. 60.42b. Each 1-
hour average sulfur dioxide emission rate must be based on more than 30 
minutes of steam generating unit operation and include at least 2 data 
points with each representing a 15-minute period. Hourly sulfur dioxide 
emission rates are not calculated if the affected facility is operated 
less than 30 minutes in a 1-hour period and are not counted toward 
determination of a steam generating unit operating day.
    (e) The procedures under Sec. 60.13 shall be followed for 
installation, evaluation, and operation of the CEMS.
    (1) All CEMS shall be operated in accordance with the applicable 
procedures under Performance Specifications 1, 2, and 3 (appendix B).
    (2) Quarterly accuracy determinations and daily calibration drift 
tests shall be performed in accordance with Procedure 1 (appendix F).
    (3) For affected facilities combusting coal or oil, alone or in 
combination with other fuels, the span value of the sulfur dioxide CEMS 
at the inlet to the sulfur dioxide control device is 125 percent of the 
maximum estimated hourly potential sulfur dioxide emissions of the fuel 
combusted, and the span value of the CEMS at the outlet to the sulfur 
dioxide control device is 50 percent of the maximum estimated hourly 
potential sulfur dioxide emissions of the fuel combusted.
    (f) The owner or operator of an affected facility that combusts very 
low sulfur oil is not subject to the emission monitoring requirements of 
this section if the owner or operator obtains fuel receipts as described 
in Sec. 60.49b(r).

requirements of part 75 of this chapter and is continuing to meet the 
ongoing requirements of part 75 of this chapter, that

[[Page 140]]

CEMS may be used to meet the requirements of this section, except that 
the owner or operator shall also meet the requirements of Sec. 60.49b. 
Data reported to meet the requirements of Sec. 60.49b shall not include 
data substituted using the missing data procedures in subpart D of part 
75 of this chapter, nor shall the data have been bias adjusted according 
to the procedures of part 75 of this chapter.
    (c) The continuous monitoring systems required under paragraph (b) 
of this section shall be operated and data recorded during all periods 
of operation of the affected facility except for continuous monitoring 
system breakdowns and repairs. Data is recorded during calibration 
checks, and zero and span adjustments.
    (d) The 1-hour average nitrogen oxides emission rates measured by 
the continuous nitrogen oxides monitor required by paragraph (b) of this 
section and required under Sec. 60.13(h) shall be expressed in ng/J or 
lb/million Btu heat input and shall be used to calculate the average 
emission rates under Sec. 60.44b. The 1-hour averages shall be 
calculated using the data points required under Sec. 60.13(b). At least 
2 data points must be used to calculate each 1-hour average.
    (e) The procedures under Sec. 60.13 shall be followed for 
installation, evaluation, and operation of the continuous monitoring 
systems.
    (1) For affected facilities combusting coal, wood or municipal-type 
solid waste, the span value for a continuous monitoring system for 
measuring opacity shall be between 60 and 80 percent.
    (2) For affected facilities combusting coal, oil, or natural gas, 
the span value for nitrogen oxides is determined as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                        Span values for

------------------------------------------------------------------------

where:

x is the fraction of total heat input derived from natural gas,
y is the fraction of total heat input derived from oil, and
z is the fraction of total heat input derived from coal.

    (3) All span values computed under paragraph (e)(2) of this section 
for combusting mixtures of regulated fuels are rounded to the nearest 
500 ppm.
    (f) When nitrogen oxides emission data are not obtained because of 
continuous monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks and 
zero and span adjustments, emission data will be obtained by using 
standby monitoring systems, Method 7, Method 7A, or other approved 
reference methods to provide emission data for a minimum of 75 percent 
of the operating hours in each steam generating unit operating day, in 
at least 22 out of 30 successive steam generating unit operating days.
    (g) The owner or operator of an affected facility that has a heat 
input capacity of 73 MW (250 million Btu/hour) or less, and which has an

steam ch a separate source (such as a stationary gas turbine, internal 
combustion engine, or kiln) provides exhaust gas to a steam generating 
unit.
    Coal means all solid fuels classified as anthracite, bituminous, 
subbituminous, or lignite by the American Society for Testing and 
Materials in ASTM D388-77, ``Standard Specification for Classification

refuse; and petroleum coke. Synthetic fuels derived from coal for the 
purpose of creating useful heat, including but not limited to solvent-
refined coal, gasified coal, coal-oil mixtures, and coal-water mixtures,

provides exhaust gas to a steam generating unit.
    Combustion research means the experimental firing of any fuel or 
combination of fuels in a steam generating unit for the purpose of 
conducting research and development of more efficient combustion or more 
effective prevention or control of air pollutant emissions from 
combustion, provided that, during these periods of research and 
development, the heat generated is not used for any purpose other than 
preheating combustion air for use by that steam generating unit (i.e., 
the heat generated is released to the atmosphere without being used for 
space heating, process heating, driving pumps, preheating combustion air 
for other units, generating electricity, or any other purpose).
    Conventional technology means wet flue gas desulfurization 
technology, dry flue gas desulfurization technology, atmospheric

Sec. 60.44c  Compliance and performance test methods and procedures for sulfur 
dioxide.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section and 
in Sec. 60.8(b), performance tests required under Sec. 60.8 shall be 
conducted following the procedures specified in paragraphs (b), (c), 
(d), (e), and (f) of this section, as applicable. Section 60.8(f) does 
not apply to this section. The 30-day notice required in Sec. 60.8(d) 
applies only to the initial performance test unless otherwise specified 
by the Administrator.
    (b) The initial performance test required under Sec. 60.8 shall be 
conducted over 30 consecutive operating days of the steam generating 
unit. Compliance with the percent reduction requirements and 
SO<INF>2</INF> emission limits under

[[Page 152]]

Sec. 60.42c shall be determined using a 30-day average. The first 
operating day included in the initial performance test shall be 
scheduled within 30 days after achieving the maximum production rate at 
which the affect facility will be operated, but not later than 180 days 
after the initial startup of the facility. The steam generating unit 
load during the 30-day period does not have to be the maximum design 
heat input capacity, but must be representative of future operating 
conditions.
    (c) After the initial performance test required under paragraph (b) 
and Sec. 60.8, compliance with the percent reduction requirements and 
SO<INF>2</INF> emission limits under Sec. 60.42c is based on the average 
percent reduction and the average S0<INF>2</INF> emission rates for 30 
consecutive steam generating unit operating days. A separate performance 
test is completed at the end of each steam generating unit operating 
day, and a new 30-day average percent reduction and SO<INF>2</INF> 
emission rate are calculated to show compliance with the standard.
    (d) If only coal, only oil, or a mixture of coal and oil is 
combusted in an affected facility, the procedures in Method 19 are used 
to determine the hourly SO<INF>2</INF> emission rate (E<INF>ho</INF>) 
and the 30-day average SO<INF>2</INF> emission rate (E<INF>ao</INF>). 
The hourly averages used to compute the 30-day averages are obtained 
from the continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS). Method 19 shall 
be used to calculate E<INF>ao</INF> when using daily fuel sampling or 
Method 6B.
    (e) If coal, oil, or coal and oil are combusted with other fuels:
    (1) An adjusted E<INF>ho</INF> (E<INF>ho</INF>o) is used in Equation 
19-19 of Method 19 to compute the adjusted E<INF>ao</INF> 
(E<INF>ao</INF>o). The E<INF>ho</INF>o is computed using the following 
formula:

E<INF>ho</INF>o=[E<INF>ho</INF>-E<INF>w</INF>(1-X<INF>k</INF>)]/
    X<INF>k</INF>

where:

E<INF>ho</INF>o  is the adjusted E<INF>ho</INF>, ng/J (lb/million Btu)
E<INF>ho</INF>  is the hourly SO<INF>2</INF> emission rate, ng/J (lb/
million Btu)
E<INF>w</INF>  is the SO<INF>2</INF> concentration in fuels other than 
coal and oil combusted in the affected facility, as determined by fuel 
sampling and analysis procedures in Method 9, ng/J (lb/million Btu). The 
value E<INF>w</INF> for each fuel lot is used for each hourly average 
during the time that the lot is being combusted. The owner or operator 
does not have to measure E<INF>w</INF> if the owner or operator elects 
to assume E<INF>w</INF>=0.
X<INF>k</INF>  is the fraction of the total heat input from fuel 
combustion derived from coal and oil, as determined by applicable 
procedures in Method 19.

    (2) The owner or operator of an affected facility that qualifies 
under the provisions of Sec. 60.42c(c) or (d) [where percent reduction 
is not required] does not have to measure the parameters E<INF>w</INF> 
or X<INF>k</INF> if the owner or operator of the affected facility 
elects to measure emission rates of the coal or oil using the fuel 
sampling and analysis procedures under Method 19.
    (f) Affected facilities subject to the percent reduction 
requirements under Sec. 60.42c(a) or (b) shall determine compliance with 
the SO<INF>2</INF> emission limits under Sec. 60.42c pursuant to 
paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section, and shall determine compliance 
with the percent reduction requirements using the following procedures:
    (1) If only coal is combusted, the percent of potential 
SO<INF>2</INF> emission rate is computed using the following formula:

%P<INF>s</INF>=100(1-%R<INF>g</INF>/100)(1-%R<INF>f</INF>/100)

where

%P<INF>s</INF>  is the percent of potential SO<INF>2</INF> emission 
rate, in percent
%R<INF>g</INF>  is the SO<INF>2</INF> removal efficiency of the control 
device as determined by Method 19, in percent
%R<INF>f</INF>  is the SO<INF>2</INF> removal efficiency of fuel 
pretreatment as determined by Method 19, in percent

    (2) If coal, oil, or coal and oil are combusted with other fuels, 
the same procedures required in paragraph (f)(1) of this section are 
used, except as provided for in the following:
    (i) To compute the %P<INF>s</INF>, an adjusted %R<INF>g</INF> 
(%R<INF>g</INF>o) is computed from E<INF>ao</INF>o from paragraph (e)(1) 
of this section and an adjusted average SO<INF>2</INF> inlet rate 
(E<INF>ai</INF>o) using the following formula:

%R<INF>g</INF>o=100 [1.0- E<INF>ao</INF>o/E<INF>ai</INF>o)]

where:

%R<INF>g</INF>o  is the adjusted %R<INF>g</INF>, in percent
E<INF>ao</INF>o  is the adjusted E<INF>ao</INF>, ng/J (lb/million Btu)
E<INF>ai</INF>o  is the adjusted average SO<INF>2</INF> inlet rate, ng/J 
(lb/million Btu)

    (ii) To compute E<INF>ai</INF>o, an adjusted hourly SO<INF>2</INF> 
inlet rate (E<INF>hi</INF>o) is used. The

[[Page 153]]

E<INF>hi</INF>o is computed using the following formula:

E<INF>hi</INF>o=[E<INF>hi</INF>- E<INF>w</INF> (1-X<INF>k</INF>)]/
    X<INF>k</INF>

where:

E<INF>hi</INF>o  is the adjusted E<INF>hi</INF>, ng/J (lb/million Btu)
E<INF>hi</INF>  is the hourly SO<INF>2</INF> inlet rate, ng/J (lb/
million Btu)
E<INF>w</INF>  is the SO<INF>2</INF> concentration in fuels other than 
coal and oil combusted in the affected facility, as determined by fuel 
sampling and analysis procedures in Method 19, ng/J (lb/million Btu). 
The value E<INF>w</INF> for each fuel lot is used for each hourly 
average during the time that the lot is being combusted. The owner or 
operator does not have to measure E<INF>w</INF> if the owner or operator 
elects to assume E<INF>w</INF> = O.
X<INF>k</INF>  is the fraction of the total heat input from fuel 
combustion derived from coal and oil, as determined by applicable 
procedures in Method 19.

    (g) For oil-fired affected facilities where the owner or operator 
seeks to demonstrate compliance with the fuel oil sulfur limits under 
Sec. 60.42c based on shipment fuel sampling, the initial performance 
test shall consist of sampling and analyzing the oil in the initial tank 
of oil to be fired in the steam generating unit to demonstrate that the 
oil contains 0.5 weight percent sulfur or less. Thereafter, the owner or 
operator of the affected facility shall sample the oil in the fuel tank 
after each new shipment of oil is received, as described under 
Sec. 60.46c(d)(2).
    (h) For affected facilities subject to Sec. 60.42c(h)(1), (2), or 
(3) where the owner or operator seeks to demonstrate compliance with the 
SO<INF>2</INF> standards based on fuel supplier certification, the 
performance test shall consist of the certification, the certification 
from the fuel supplier, as described under Sec. 60.48c(f)(1), (2), or 
(3), as applicable.
    (i) The owner or operator of an affected facility seeking to 
demonstrate compliance with the SO<INF>2</INF> standards under 
Sec. 60.42c(c)(2) shall demonstrate the maximum design heat input 
capacity of the steam generating unit by operating the steam generating 
unit at this capacity for 24 hours. This demonstration shall be made 
during the initial performance test, and a subsequent demonstration may 
be requested at any other time. If the demonstrated 24-hour average 
firing rate for the affected facility is less than the maximum design 
heat input capacity stated by the manufacturer of the affected facility, 
the demonstrated 24-hour average firing rate shall be used to determine 
the annual capacity factor for the affected facility; otherwise, the 
maximum design heat input capacity provided by the manufacturer shall be 
used.
    (j) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall use all 
valid SO<INF>2</INF> emissions data in calculating %P<INF>s</INF> and 
E<INF>ho</INF> under paragraphs (d), (e), or (f) of this section, as 
applicable, whether or not the minimum emissions data requirements under 
Sec. 60.46c(f) are achieved. All valid emissions data, including valid 
data collected during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, 
shall be used in calculating %P<INF>s</INF> or E<INF>ho</INF> pursuant 
to paragraphs (d), (e), or (f) of this section, as applicable.

determine compliance with the standards using the following procedures 
and reference methods.
    (1) Method 1 shall be used to select the sampling site and the 
number of traverse sampling points.
    (2) Method 3 shall be used for gas analysis when applying Method 5, 
Method 5B, or Method 17.
    (3) Method 5, Method 5B, or Method 17 shall be used to measure the 
concentration of PM as follows:
    (i) Method 5 may be used only at affected facilities without wet 
scrubber systems.
    (ii) Method 17 may be used at affected facilities with or without 
wet scrubber systems provided the stack gas temperature does not exceed 
a temperature of 160  deg.C (320  deg.F). The procedures of Sections 8.1 
and 11.1 of Method 5B may be used in Method 17 only if Method 17 is used 
in conjunction with a wet scrubber system. Method 17 shall not be used 
in conjunction with a wet

[[Page 154]]

scrubber system if the effluent is saturated or laden with water 
droplets.
    (iii) Method 5B may be used in conjunction with a wet scrubber 
system.
    (4) The sampling time for each run shall be at least 120 minutes and 
the minimum sampling volume shall be 1.7 dry standard cubic meters 
(dscm) [60 dry standard cubic feet (dscf)] except that smaller sampling 
times or volumes may be approved by the Administrator when necessitated

location.
    (7) For each run using Method 5, Method 5B, or Method 17, the 
emission rates expressed in ng/J (lb/million Btu) heat input shall be 
determined using:
    (i) The oxygen or carbon dioxide measurements and PM measurements 
obtained under this section,
    (ii) The dry basis F-factor, and
    (iii) The dry basis emission rate calculation procedure contained in

determining the opacity of stack emissions.
    (b) The owner or operator of an affected facility seeking to 
demonstrate compliance with the PM standards under Sec. 60.43c(b)(2) 
shall demonstrate the maximum design heat input capacity of the steam 
generating unit by operating the steam generating unit at this capacity 
for 24 hours. This demonstration shall be made during the initial 
performance test, and a subsequent demonstration may be requested at any 
other time. If the demonstrated 24-hour average firing rate for the 
affected facility is less than the maximum design heat input capacity 
stated by the manufacturer of the affected facility, the demonstrated 
24-hour average firing rate shall be used to determine the annual 
capacity factor for the affected facility; otherwise, the maximum design 
heat input capacity provided by the manufacturer shall be used.

Sec. 60.46c  Emission monitoring for sulfur dioxide

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, 
the owner or operator of an affected facility subject to the 
SO<INF>2</INF> emission limits under Sec. 60.42c shall install, 
calibrate, maintain, and operate a CEMS for measuring SO<INF>2</INF> 
concentrations and either oxygen or carbon dioxide concentrations at the 
outlet of the SO<INF>2</INF> control device (or the outlet of the steam 
generating unit if no SO<INF>2</INF> control device is used), and shall 
record the output of the system. The owner or operator of an affected 
facility subject to the percent reduction requirements under Sec. 60.42c 
shall measure SO<INF>2</INF> concentrations and either oxygen or carbon 
dioxide concentrations at both the inlet and outlet of the 
SO<INF>2</INF> control device.
    (b) The 1-hour average SO<INF>2</INF> emission rates measured by a 
CEMS shall be expressed in ng/J or lb/million Btu heat input and shall 
be used to calculate the average emission rates under Sec. 60.42c. Each 
1-hour average SO<INF>2</INF> emission rate must be based on at least 30 
minutes of operation and include at least 2 data points representing two 
15-minute periods. Hourly SO<INF>2</INF> emission rates are not 
calculated if the affected facility is operated less than 30 minutes in 
a 1-hour period and are not counted toward determination of a steam 
generating unit operating day.
    (c) The procedures under Sec. 60.13 shall be followed for 
installation, evaluation, and operation of the CEMS.
    (1) All CEMS shall be operated in accordance with the applicable 
procedures under Performance Specifications 1, 2, and 3 (appendix B).
    (2) Quarterly accuracy determinations and daily calibration drift 
tests shall be performed in accordance with Procedure 1 (appendix F).
    (3) For affected facilities subject to the percent reduction 
requirements under Sec. 60.42c, the span value of the SO<INF>2</INF> 
CEMS at the inlet to the SO<INF>2</INF> control device shall be 125 
percent of the maximum estimated hourly potential SO<INF>2</INF>

[[Page 155]]

emission rate of the fuel combusted, and the span value of the 
SO<INF>2</INF> CEMS at the outlet from the SO<INF>2</INF> control device 
shall be 50 percent of the maximum estimated hourly potential 
SO<INF>2</INF> emission rate of the fuel combusted.
    (4) For affected facilities that are not subject to the percent 
reduction requirements of Sec. 60.42c, the span value of the 
SO<INF>2</INF> CEMS at the outlet from the SO<INF>2</INF> control device 
(or outlet of the steam generating unit if no SO<INF>2</INF> control 
device is used) shall be 125 percent of the maximum estimated hourly 
potential SO<INF>2</INF> emission rate of the fuel combusted.
    (d) As an alternative to operating a CEMS at the inlet to the 
SO<INF>2</INF> control device (or outlet of the steam generating unit if 
no SO<INF>2</INF> control device is used) as required under paragraph 
(a) of this section, an owner or operator may elect to determine the 
average SO<INF>2</INF> emission rate by sampling the fuel prior to 
combustion. As an alternative to operating a CEMS at the outlet from the 
SO<INF>2</INF> control device (or outlet of the steam generating unit if 
no SO<INF>2</INF> control device is used) as required under paragraph 
(a) of this section, an owner or operator may elect to determine the 
average SO<INF>2</INF> emission rate by using Method 6B. Fuel sampling 
shall be conducted pursuant to either paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this 
section. Method 6B shall be conducted pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of 
this section.
    (1) For affected facilities combusting coal or oil, coal or oil 
samples shall be collected daily in an as-fired condition at the inlet 
to the steam generating unit and analyzed for sulfur content and heat 
content according the Method 19. Method 19 provides procedures for 
converting these measurements into the format to be used in calculating 
the average SO<INF>2</INF> input rate.
    (2) As an alternative fuel sampling procedure for affected 
facilities combusting oil, oil samples may be collected from the fuel 
tank for each steam generating unit immediately after the fule tank is 
filled and before any oil is combusted. The owner or operator of the 
affected facility shall analyze the oil sample to determine the sulfur 
content of the oil. If a partially empty fuel tank is refilled, a new 
sample and analysis of the fuel in the tank would be required upon 
filling. Results of the fuel analysis taken after each new shipment of 
oil is received shall be used as the daily value when calculating the 
30-day rolling average until the next shipment is received. If the fuel 
analysis shows that the sulfur content in the fuel tank is greater than 
0.5 weight percent sulfur, the owner or operator shall ensure that the 
sulfur content of subsequent oil shipments is low enough to cause the 
30-day rolling average sulfur content to be 0.5 weight percent sulfur or 
less.
    (3) Method 6B may be used in lieu of CEMS to measure SO<INF>2</INF> 
at the inlet or outlet of the SO<INF>2</INF> control system. An initial 
stratification test is required to verify the adequacy of the Method 6B 
sampling location. The stratification test shall consist of three paired 
runs of a suitable SO<INF>2</INF> and carbon dioxide measurement train 
operated at the candidate location and a second similar train operated 
according to the procedures in Sec. 3.2 and the applicable procedures in 
section 7 of Performance Specification 2 (appendix B). Method 6B, Method 
6A, or a combination of Methods 6 and 3 or Methods 6C and 3A are 
suitable measurement techniques. If Method 6B is used for the second 
train, sampling time and timer operation may be adjusted for the 
stratification test as long as an adequate sample volume is collected; 
however, both sampling trains are to be operated similarly. For the 
location to be adequate for Method 6B 24-hour tests, the mean of the 
absolute difference between the three paired runs must be less than 10 
percent (0.10).
    (e) The monitoring requirements of paragraphs (a) and (d) of this 
section shall not apply to affected facilities subject to Sec. 60.42c(h) 
(1), (2), or (3) where the owner or operator of the affected facility 
seeks to demonstrate compliance with the SO<INF>2</INF> standards based 
on fuel supplier certification, as described under Sec. 60.48c(f) (1), 
(2), or (3), as applicable.
    (f) The owner or operator of an affected facility operating a CEMS 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, or conducting as-fired fuel 
sampling pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, shall obtain 
emission data for at least 75 percent of the operating hours

[[Page 156]]

in at least 22 out of 30 successive steam generating unit operating 
days. If this minimum data requirement is not met with a single 
monitoring system, the owner or operator of the affected facility shall 
supplement the emission data with data collected with other monitoring 
systems as approved by the Administrator.

    (a) The owner or operator of any incinerator subject to the 
provisions of this part shall record the daily charging rates and hours 
of operation.


<R05>
Sec. 60.54  Test methods and procedures.

    (a) In conducting the performance tests required in Sec. 60.8, the 
owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test 
methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as 
specified in this section, except as provided in Sec. 60.8(b).
    (b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
particulate matter standard in Sec. 60.52 as follows:
    (1) The concentration (c<INF>12</INF>) of particulate matter, 
corrected to 12 percent CO<INF>2</INF>, shall be computed for each run 
using the following equation:

c<INF>12</INF> = c<INF>s</INF> (12/%CO<INF>2</INF>)

where:

c<INF>12</INF>=concentration of particulate matter, corrected to 12 
percent CO<INF>2</INF>, g/dscm (gr/dscf).
c<INF>s</INF>=concentration of particulate matter, g/dscm (gr/dscf).
%CO<INF>2</INF>=CO<INF>2</INF> concentration, percent dry basis.

    (2) Method 5 shall be used to determine the particulate matter 
concentration (c<INF>s</INF>). The sampling time and sample volume for 
each run shall be at least 60 minutes and 0.85 dscm (30 dscf).
    (3) The emission rate correction factor, integrated or grab sampling 
and analysis procedure of Method 3B shall be used to determine 
CO<INF>2</INF> concentration (%CO<INF>2</INF>).
    (i) The CO<INF>2</INF> sample shall be obtained simultaneously with, 
and at the same traverse points as, the particulate run. If the 
particulate run has more than 12 traverse points, the CO<INF>2</INF> 
traverse points may be reduced to 12 if Method 1 is used to locate the 
12 CO<INF>2</INF> traverse points. If individual CO<INF>2</INF> samples 
are taken at each traverse point, the CO<INF>2</INF>

[[Page 159]]

concentration (%CO<INF>2</INF>) used in the correction equation shall be 
the arithmetic mean of the sample CO<INF>2</INF> concentrations at all 
traverse points.
    (ii) If sampling is conducted after a wet scrubber, an ``adjusted'' 
CO<INF>2</INF> concentration [(%CO<INF>2</INF>)<INF>adj</INF>], which 
accounts for the effects of CO<INF>2</INF> absorption and dilution air, 
may be used instead of the CO<INF>2</INF> concentration determined in 
this paragraph. The adjusted CO<INF>2</INF> concentration shall be 
determined by either of the procedures in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) The owner or operator may use either of the following procedures 
to determine the adjusted CO<INF>2</INF> concentration.
    (1) The volumetric flow rates at the inlet and outlet of the wet 
scrubber and the inlet CO<INF>2</INF> concentration may be used to 
determine the adjusted CO<INF>2</INF> concentration 
[(%CO<INF>2</INF>)<INF>adj</INF>] using the following equation:

(%CO<INF>2</INF>)<INF>adj</INF>=(%CO<INF>2</INF>)<INF>di</INF> 
    (Q<INF>di</INF>/Q<INF>do</INF>)

where:

(%CO<INF>2</INF>)<INF>adj</INF>=adjusted outlet CO<INF>2</INF> 
concentration, percent dry basis.
(%CO<INF>2</INF>)<INF>di</INF>=CO<INF>2</INF> concentration measured 
before the scrubber, percent dry basis.
Q<INF>di</INF>=volumetric flow rate of effluent gas before the wet 
scrubber, dscm/min (dscf/min).
Q<INF>do</INF>=volumetric flow rate of effluent gas after the wet 
scrubber, dscm/min (dscf/min).

    (i) At the outlet, Method 5 is used to determine the volumetric flow 
rate (Q<INF>do</INF>) of the effluent gas.
    (ii) At the inlet, Method 2 is used to determine the volumetric flow 
rate (Q<INF>di</INF>) of the effluent gas as follows: Two full velocity 
traverses are conducted, one immediately before and one immediately 
after each particulate run conducted at the outlet, and the results are 
averaged.
    (iii) At the inlet, the emission rate correction factor, integrated 
sampling and analysis procedure of Method 3B is used to determine the 
CO<INF>2</INF> concentration [(%CO<INF>2</INF>)<INF>di</INF>] as 
follows: At least nine sampling points are selected randomly from the 
velocity traverse points and are divided randomly into three sets, equal 
in number of points; the first set of three or more points is used for 
the first run, the second set for the second run, and the third set for 
the third run. The CO<INF>2</INF> sample is taken simultaneously with 
each particulate run being conducted at the outlet, by traversing the 
three sampling points (or more) and sampling at each point for equal 
increments of time.
    (2) Excess air measurements may be used to determine the adjusted 
CO<INF>2</INF> concentration [(%CO<INF>2</INF>)<INF>adj</INF>] using the 
following equation:

(%CO<INF>2</INF>)<INF>adj</INF>=(%CO<INF>2</INF>)<INF>di</INF> 
    [(100+%EA<INF>i</INF>)/(100+%EA<INF>o</INF>)]

where:

(%CO<INF>2</INF>)<INF>adj</INF>=adjusted outlet CO<INF>2</INF> 
concentration, percent dry basis.
(%CO<INF>2</INF>)<INF>di</INF>=CO<INF>2</INF> concentration at the inlet 
of the wet scrubber, percent dry basis.
%EA<INF>i</INF>=excess air at the inlet of the scrubber, percent.
%EA<INF>o</INF>=excess air at the outlet of the scrubber, percent.

    (i) A gas sample is collected as in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this 
section and the gas samples at both the inlet and outlet locations are 
analyzed for CO<INF>2</INF>, O<INF>2</INF>, and N<INF>2</INF>.
    (ii) Equation 3B-3 of Method 3B is used to compute the percentages 
of excess air at the inlet and outlet of the wet scrubber.

[[Page 195]]

according to the manufacturer's instructions before each dioxin/furan 
performance test, and at least once per year.
    (7) To determine compliance with the maximum particulate matter 
control device temperature requirements under Sec. 60.53b(c), the owner 
or operator of an affected facility shall install, calibrate, maintain, 
and operate a device for measuring on a continuous basis the temperature 
of the flue gas stream at the inlet to each particulate matter control 
device utilized by the affected facility. Temperature shall be 
calculated in 4-hour block arithmetic averages.
    (8) The maximum demonstrated municipal waste combustor unit load 
shall be determined during the initial performance test for dioxins/
furans and each subsequent performance test during which compliance with 
the dioxin/furan emission limit specified in Sec. 60.52b(c) is achieved. 
The maximum demonstrated municipal waste combustor unit load shall be 
the highest 4-hour arithmetic average load achieved during four 
consecutive hours during the most recent test during which compliance 
with the dioxin/furan emission limit was achieved.
    (9) For each particulate matter control device employed at the 
affected facility, the maximum demonstrated particulate matter control 
device temperature shall be determined during the initial performance 
test for dioxins/furans and each subsequent performance test during 
which compliance with the dioxin/furan emission limit specified in

the affected facility is combusting municipal solid waste.
    (i) At least two data points per hour shall be used to calculate 
each 1-hour arithmetic average.
    (ii) At a minimum, each carbon monoxide 1-hour arithmetic average 
shall be corrected to 7 percent oxygen on an hourly basis using the 1-

    (11) All valid continuous emission monitoring system data must be 
used in calculating the parameters specified under paragraph (i) of this 
section even if the minimum data requirements of paragraph (i)(10) of 
this section are not met. When carbon monoxide continuous emission data 
are not obtained because of continuous emission monitoring system 
breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments, 
emissions data shall be obtained using other monitoring systems as 
approved by the Administrator or EPA Reference Method 10 to provide, as 
necessary, the minimum valid emission data.
    (12) Quarterly accuracy determinations and daily calibration drift 
tests for the carbon monoxide continuous emission monitoring system

maximum charging rate shall be calculated based on the maximum design 
heat input capacity of the unit and a heating value of 12,800 kilojoules 
per kilogram for combustors firing refuse-derived fuel and a heating 
value of 10,500 kilojoules

[[Page 196]]

per kilogram for combustors firing municipal solid waste that is not 
refuse-derived fuel.
    (ii) For combustors that are not designed based on heat capacity, 
the maximum charging rate shall be the maximum design charging rate.
    (2) For batch feed municipal waste combustor units, municipal waste 
combustor unit capacity shall be calculated as the maximum design amount 
of municipal solid waste that can be charged per batch multiplied by the 
maximum number of batches that could be processed in a 24-hour period. 
The maximum number of batches that could be processed in a 24-hour 
period is calculated as 24 hours divided by the design number of hours 
required to process one batch of municipal solid waste, and may include 
fractional batches (e.g., if one batch requires 16 hours, then 24/16, or 
1.5 batches, could be combusted in a 24-hour period). For batch 
combustors that are designed based on heat capacity, the design heating 
value of 12,800 kilojoules per kilogram for combustors firing refuse-
derived fuel and a heating value of 10,500 kilojoules per kilogram for 
combustors firing municipal solid waste that is not refuse-derived fuel 
shall be used in calculating the municipal waste combustor unit capacity 
in megagrams per day of municipal solid waste.

transferring ash from the municipal waste combustor unit to the area 
where ash is stored or loaded into containers or trucks.
    (2) The average duration of visible emissions per hour shall be 
calculated from the three 1-hour observations. The average shall be used 
to determine compliance with Sec. 60.55b.
    (3) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall conduct an 
initial performance test for fugitive ash emissions as required under 
Sec. 60.8 of subpart A of this part.
    (4) Following the date that the initial performance test for 
fugitive ash emissions is completed or is required to be completed under 
Sec. 60.8 of subpart A of this part for an affected facility, the owner 
or operator shall conduct a performance test for fugitive ash emissions 
on an annual basis (no more than 12 calendar months following the

    (l) The procedures specified in paragraphs (l)(1) through (l)(3) of 
this section shall be used to determine compliance with the opacity 
limit for air curtain incinerators under Sec. 60.56b.
    (1) The EPA Reference Method 9 shall be used for determining 
compliance with the opacity limit.
    (2) The owner or operator of the air curtain incinerator shall

Sec. 60.58b(g)(5)(iii) shall follow the procedures specified in 
paragraphs (m)(1) through (m)(3) of this section.
    (1) During the performance tests for dioxins/furans and mercury, as 
applicable, the owner or operator shall estimate an average carbon mass 
feed rate based on carbon injection system operating parameters such as 
the screw feeder speed, hopper volume, hopper refill frequency, or other 
parameters appropriate to the feed system being employed, as specified 
in paragraphs (m)(1)(i) and (m)(1)(ii) of this section.

management measures, taking into account the effectiveness of waste 
management measures already in place, the costs of additional measures, 
the emission reductions expected to be achieved, and any other 
environmental or energy impacts they might have. The American Hospital 
Association publication entitled ``An Ounce of Prevention: Waste 
Reduction Strategies for Health Care Facilities'' (incorporated by 
reference, see Sec. 60.17) shall be considered in the development of the 
waste management plan.

Sec. 60.56c  Compliance and performance testing.

    (a) The emission limits under this subpart apply at all times except 
during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, provided that no 
hospital waste or medical/infectious waste is charged to the affected 
facility during startup, shutdown, or malfunction.
    (b) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall conduct an 
initial performance test as required under Sec. 60.8 to determine 
compliance with the emission limits using the procedures and test 
methods listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(12) of this section. The 
use of the bypass stack during a performance test shall invalidate the 
performance test.
    (1) All performance tests shall consist of a minimum of three test 
runs conducted under representative operating conditions.
    (2) The minimum sample time shall be 1 hour per test run unless 
otherwise indicated.
    (3) EPA Reference Method 1 of appendix A of this part shall be used 
to select the sampling location and number of traverse points.
    (4) EPA Reference Method 3, 3A, or 3B of appendix A of this part 
shall be used for gas composition analysis, including measurement of 
oxygen concentration. EPA Reference Method 3, 3A, or 3B of appendix A of 
this part shall be used simultaneously with each reference method.
    (5) The pollutant concentrations shall be adjusted to 7 percent 
oxygen using the following equation:

C<INF>adj</INF>=C<INF>meas</INF> (20.9--7)/(20.9--%O<INF>2</INF>)

where:

C<INF>adj</INF>=pollutant concentration adjusted to 7 percent oxygen;
C<INF>meas</INF>=pollutant concentration measured on a dry basis (20.9--
7)=20.9 percent oxygen--7 percent oxygen (defined oxygen correction 
basis);
20.9=oxygen concentration in air, percent; and

[[Page 210]]

%O<INF>2</INF>=oxygen concentration measured on a dry basis, percent.

    (6) EPA Reference Method 5 or 29 of appendix A of this part shall be 
used to measure the particulate matter emissions.
    (7) EPA Reference Method 9 of appendix A of this part shall be used 
to measure stack opacity.
    (8) EPA Reference Method 10 or 10B of appendix A of this part shall 
be used to measure the CO emissions.
    (9) EPA Reference Method 23 of appendix A of this part shall be used 
to measure total dioxin/furan emissions. The minimum sample time shall 
be 4 hours per test run. If the affected facility has selected the toxic 
equivalency standards for dioxin/furans, under Sec. 60.52c, the 
following procedures shall be used to determine compliance:
    (i) Measure the concentration of each dioxin/furan tetra-through 
octa-congener emitted using EPA Reference Method 23.
    (ii) For each dioxin/furan congener measured in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(9)(i) of this section, multiply the congener concentration 
by its corresponding toxic equivalency factor specified in Table 2 of 
this subpart.
    (iii) Sum the products calculated in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(9)(ii) of this section to obtain the total concentration of dioxins/
furans emitted in terms of toxic equivalency.
    (10) EPA Reference Method 26 or 26A of appendix A of this part shall 
be used to measure HCl emissions. If the affected facility has selected 
the percentage reduction standards for HCl under Sec. 60.52c, the 
percentage reduction in HCl emissions (%R<INF>HCl</INF>) is computed 
using the following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR15SE97.000

Where:

%R<INF>HCl</INF>=percentage reduction of HCl emissions achieved;
E<INF>i</INF>=HCl emission concentration measured at the control device 
inlet, corrected to 7 percent oxygen (dry basis); and
E<INF>o</INF>=HCl emission concentration measured at the control device 
outlet, corrected to 7 percent oxygen (dry basis).

    (11) EPA Reference Method 29 of appendix A of this part shall be 
used to measure Pb, Cd, and Hg emissions. If the affected facility has 
selected the percentage reduction standards for metals under 
Sec. 60.52c, the percentage reduction in emissions (%R<INF>metal</INF>) 
is computed using the following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.251

Where:

%R<INF>metal</INF>=percentage reduction of metal emission (Pb, Cd, or 
Hg) achieved;
E<INF>i</INF>=metal emission concentration (Pb, Cd, or Hg) measured at 
the control device inlet, corrected to 7 percent oxygen (dry basis); and
E<INF>o</INF>=metal emission concentration (Pb, Cd, or Hg) measured at 
the control device outlet, corrected to 7 percent oxygen (dry basis).

    (12) The EPA Reference Method 22 of appendix A of this part shall be 
used to determine compliance with the fugitive ash emission limit under 
Sec. 60.52c(c). The minimum observation time shall be a series of three 
1-hour observations.
    (c) Following the date on which the initial performance test is 
completed or is required to be completed under Sec. 60.8, whichever date 
comes first, the owner or operator of an affected facility shall:
    (1) Determine compliance with the opacity limit by conducting an 
annual performance test (no more than 12 months following the previous 
performance test) using the applicable procedures and test methods 
listed in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) Determine compliance with the PM, CO, and HCl emission limits by 
conducting an annual performance test (no more than 12 months following 
the previous performance test) using the applicable procedures and test 
methods listed in paragraph (b) of this section. If all three 
performance tests over a 3-year period indicate compliance with the 
emission limit for a pollutant (PM, CO, or HCl), the owner or operator 
may forego a performance test for that pollutant for the subsequent 2 
years. At a minimum, a performance test for PM, CO, and HCl shall be 
conducted every third year (no more than 36 months following the 
previous performance test). If a performance test conducted every third 
year indicates compliance with the emission limit for a pollutant (PM,

[[Page 211]]

CO, or HCl), the owner or operator may forego a performance test for 
that pollutant for an additional 2 years. If any performance test 
indicates noncompliance with the respective emission limit, a 
performance test for that pollutant shall be conducted annually until 
all annual performance tests over a 3-year period indicate compliance 
with the emission limit. The use of the bypass stack during a 
performance test shall invalidate the performance test.
    (3) For large HMIWI, determine compliance with the visible emission 
limits for fugitive emissions from flyash/bottom ash storage and 
handling by conducting a performance test using EPA Reference Method 22 
on an annual basis (no more than 12 months following the previous 
performance test).
    (4) Facilities using a CEMS to demonstrate compliance with any of 
the emission limits under Sec. 60.52c shall:
    (i) Determine compliance with the appropriate emission limit(s) 
using a 12-hour rolling average, calculated each hour as the average of 
the previous 12 operating hours (not including startup, shutdown, or 
malfunction).
    (ii) Operate all CEMS in accordance with the applicable procedures 
under appendices B and F of this part.

dry scrubber followed by a fabric filter, a wet scrubber, or a dry 
scrubber followed by a fabric filter and wet scrubber shall:
    (1) Establish the appropriate maximum and minimum operating 
parameters, indicated in Table 3 of this subpart for each control 
system, as site specific operating parameters during the initial 
performance test to determine compliance with the emission limits; and
    (2) Following the date on which the initial performance test is 
completed or is required to be completed under Sec. 60.8, whichever date 
comes first, ensure that the affected facility does not operate above 
any of the applicable maximum operating parameters or below any of the 
applicable minimum operating parameters listed in Table 3 of this 
subpart and measured as 3-hour rolling averages (calculated each hour as 
the average of the previous 3 operating hours) at all times except

Acceptable alternative methods and procedures are given in paragraph (c) 
of this section.
    (b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
NO<INF>x</INF> standard in Sec. 60.72 as follows:
    (1) The emission rate (E) of NO<INF>x</INF> shall be computed for 
each run using the following equation:

E=(C<INF>s</INF> Q<INF>sd</INF>)/(P K)

where:

E=emission rate of NO<INF>x</INF> as NO<INF>2</INF>, kg/metric ton (lb/

concentration of each grab sample. Method 1 shall be used to select the 
sampling site, and the sampling point shall be the centroid of the stack 
or duct or at a point no closer to the walls than 1 m (3.28 ft). Four 
grab samples shall be taken at approximately 15-minute intervals. The 
arithmetic mean of the four sample concentrations shall constitute the 
run value (C<INF>s</INF>).
    (3) Method 2 shall be used to determine the volumetric flow rate 
(Q<INF>sd</INF>) of the effluent gas. The measurement site shall be the 
same as for the NO<INF>x</INF> sample. A velocity traverse shall be made 
once per run within the hour that the NO<INF>x</INF> samples are taken.
    (4) The methods of Sec. 60.73(c) shall be used to determine the 
production rate (P) of 100 percent nitric acid for each run. Material 
balance over the production system shall be used to confirm the 
production rate.
    (c) The owner or operator may use the following as alternatives to 
the reference methods and procedures specified in this section:
    (1) For Method 7, Method 7A, 7B, 7C, or 7D may be used. If Method 7C 
or 7D is used, the sampling time shall be at least 1 hour.
    (d) The owner or operator shall use the procedure in Sec. 60.73(b) 
to determine the conversion factor for converting the monitoring data to 
the units of the standard.

Sec. 60.84  Emission monitoring.

    (a) A continuous monitoring system for the measurement of sulfur 
dioxide shall be installed, calibrated, maintained, and operated by the 
owner or operator. The pollutant gas used to prepare calibration gas 
mixtures under Performance Specification 2 and for calibration checks 
under Sec. 60.13(d), shall be sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>). Method 8 
shall be used for conducting monitoring system performance evaluations 
under Sec. 60.13(c) except that only the sulfur dioxide portion of the 
Method 8 results shall be used. The span value shall be set at 1000 ppm 
of sulfur dioxide.
    (b) The owner or operator shall establish a conversion factor for 
the purpose of converting monitoring data into units of the applicable 
standard (kg/metric ton, lb/ton). The conversion factor shall be 
determined, as a minimum, three times daily by measuring the 
concentration of sulfur dioxide entering the converter using suitable 
methods (e.g., the Reich test, National Air Pollution Control 
Administration Publication No. 999-AP-13) and calculating the 
appropriate conversion factor for each eight-hour period as follows:
CF=k[(1.000-0.015r)/(r-s)]
where:
CF=conversion factor (kg/metric ton per ppm, lb/ton per ppm).
k=constant derived from material balance. For determining CF in metric 
units, k=0.0653. For determining CF in English units, k=0.1306.
r=percentage of sulfur dioxide by volume entering the gas converter. 
Appropriate corrections must be made for air injection plants subject to 
the Administrator's approval.
s=percentage of sulfur dioxide by volume in the emissions to the 
atmosphere determined by the continuous monitoring system required under 
paragraph (a) of this section.

    (c) The owner or operator shall record all conversion factors and 
values under paragraph (b) of this section from which they were computed 
(i.e., CF, r, and s).
    (d) Alternatively, a source that processes elemental sulfur or an 
ore that contains elemental sulfur and uses air to supply oxygen may use 
the following continuous emission monitoring approach and calculation 
procedures in determining SO<INF>2</INF> emission rates in terms of the 
standard. This procedure is not required, but is an alternative that 
would alleviate problems encountered in the measurement of gas 
velocities or production rate. Continuous emission monitoring systems 
for measuring SO<INF>2</INF>, O<INF>2</INF>, and CO<INF>2</INF> (if 
required) shall be installed, calibrated, maintained, and operated by 
the owner or operator and subjected to the certification procedures in 
Performance Specifications 2 and 3. The calibration procedure and span 
value for the SO<INF>2</INF> monitor shall be as specified in paragraph 
(b) of this section. The span value for CO<INF>2</INF> (if required) 
shall be 10 percent and for O<INF>2</INF> shall be 20.9 percent (air). A 
conversion factor based on process rate data is not necessary. Calculate 
the SO<INF>2</INF> emission rate as follows:

E<INF>s</INF>=(C<INF>s</INF> S)/[0.265-(0.126 %O<INF>2</INF>)-(A 
    %CO<INF>2</INF>)]

where:

E<INF>s</INF>=emission rate of SO<INF>2</INF>, kg/metric ton (lb/ton) of 
100 percent of H<INF>2</INF>SO<INF>4</INF> produced.
C<INF>s</INF>=concentration of SO<INF>2</INF>, kg/dscm (lb/dscf).
S=acid production rate factor, 368 dscm/metric ton (11,800 dscf/ton) of 
100 percent H<INF>2</INF>SO<INF>4</INF> produced.
%O<INF>2</INF>=oxygen concentration, percent dry basis.
A=auxiliary fuel factor,
    =0.00 for no fuel.
    =0.0226 for methane.
    =0.0217 for natural gas.
    =0.0196 for propane.
    =0.0172 for No 2 oil.
    =0.0161 for No 6 oil.
    =0.0148 for coal.
    =0.0126 for coke.
%CO<INF>2</INF>= carbon dioxide concentration, percent dry basis.

    Note: It is necessary in some cases to convert measured 
concentration units to other units for these calculations:

Use the following table for such conversions:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
              From--                        To--           Multiply by--

ppm (SO<INF>2</INF>).........................  lb/scf..............      1.660x10<SUP>-7</SUP>
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) For the purpose of reports under Sec. 60.7(c), periods of excess 
emissions

[[Page 222]]

shall be all three-hour periods (or the arithmetic average of three 
consecutive one-hour periods) during which the integrated average sulfur 
dioxide emissions exceed the applicable standards under Sec. 60.82.

hr).
P=production rate of 100 percent H<INF>2</INF>SO<INF>4</INF>, metric 
ton/hr (ton/hr).
K=conversion factor, 1000 g/kg (1.0 lb/lb).

    (2) Method 8 shall be used to determine the acid mist and 
SO<INF>2</INF> concentrations (C's) and the volumetric flow rate 
(Q<INF>sd</INF>) of the effluent gas. The moisture content may be 
considered to be zero. The sampling time and sample volume for each run 
shall be at least 60 minutes and 1.15 dscm (40.6 dscf).
    (3) Suitable methods shall be used to determine the production rate 
(P) of 100 percent H<INF>2</INF>SO<INF>4</INF> for each run. Material 
balance over the production system shall be used to confirm the 
production rate.
    (4) Method 9 and the procedures in Sec. 60.11 shall be used to 
determine opacity.
    (c) The owner or operator may use the following as alternatives to 
the reference methods and procedures specified in this section:
    (1) If a source processes elemental sulfur or an ore that contains 
elemental sulfur and uses air to supply oxygen, the following procedure 
may be used instead of determining the volumetric flow rate and 
production rate:
    (i) The integrated technique of Method 3 is used to determine the 
O<INF>2</INF> concentration and, if required, CO<INF>2</INF> 
concentration.
    (ii) The SO<INF>2</INF> or acid mist emission rate is calculated as 
described in Sec. 60.84(d), substituting the acid mist concentration for 
C<INF>s</INF> as appropriate.

    (2) Method 5B or 5F is to be used to determine particulate matter 
emissions and associated moisture content from affected facilities 
without wet FGD systems; only Method 5B is to be used after wet FGD 
systems. The sampling time for each run shall be at least 60 minutes and 
the sampling rate shall be at least 0.015 dscm/min (0.53 dscf/min), 
except that shorter sampling times may be approved by the Administrator 
when process variables or other factors preclude sampling for at least 
60 minutes.
    (3) The coke burn-off rate (R<INF>c</INF>) shall be computed for 
each run using the following equation:

R<INF>c</INF> = K<INF>1</INF>Q<INF>r</INF> (%CO<INF>2</INF> + %CO) - 
    (K<INF>2</INF>Q<INF>a</INF> - K<INF>3</INF>Q<INF>r</INF>) ((%CO / 2)

(hr-dscf-%)].
K<INF>2</INF> = Material balance and conversion factor, 2.088 x 
10<SUP>-3</SUP> (Mg-min)/(hr-dscm-%) [6.52 x 10<SUP>-5</SUP> (ton-min)/
(hr-dscf-%)].

10<SUP>-5</SUP> (Mg-min)/(hr-dscm-%) [3.1 x 10<SUP>-6</SUP> (ton-min)/
(hr-dscf-%)].

    (i) Method 2 shall be used to determine the volumetric flow rate 
(Q<INF>r</INF>).
    (ii) The emission correction factor, integrated sampling and 
analysis procedure of Method 3B shall be used to determine

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.002

Where:


[[Page 230]]


E<INF>s</INF> = Emission rate of PM allowed, kg/Mg (lb/ton) of coke 
burn-off in catalyst regenerator.
F=Emission standard, 1.0 kg/Mg (2.0 lb/ton) of coke burn-off in catalyst 
regenerator.

H = Heat input rate from solid or liquid fossil fuel, million J/hr 
(million Btu/hr).
R<INF>c</INF> = Coke burn-off rate, Mg coke/hr (ton coke/hr).

    (2) Procedures subject to the approval of the Administrator shall be 
used to determine the heat input rate.
    (3) The procedure in paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall be used 
to determine the coke burn-off rate (R<INF>c</INF>).
    (d) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the CO 
standard in Sec. 60.103(a) by using the integrated sampling technique of 
Method 10 to determine the CO concentration (dry basis). The sampling 
time for each run shall be 60 minutes.
    (e)(1) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
H<INF>2</INF>S standard in Sec. 60.104(a)(1) as follows: Method 11, 15, 
15A, or 16 shall be used to determine the H<INF>2</INF>S concentration. 
The gases entering the sampling train should be at about atmospheric 
pressure. If the pressure in the refinery fuel gas lines is relatively 
high, a flow control valve may be used to reduce the pressure. If the 
line pressure is high enough to operate the sampling train without a 
vacuum pump, the pump may be eliminated from the sampling train. The 
sample shall be drawn from a point near the centroid of the fuel gas 
line.
    (i) For Method 11, the sampling time and sample volume shall be at 
least 10 minutes and 0.010 dscm (0.35 dscf). Two samples of equal 
sampling times shall be taken at about 1-hour intervals. The arithmetic 
average of these two samples shall constitute a run. For most fuel 
gases, sampling times exceeding 20 minutes may result in depletion of 
the collection solution, although fuel gases containing low 
concentrations of H<INF>2</INF>S may necessitate sampling for longer 
periods of time.
    (ii) For Method 15 or 16, at least three injects over a 1-hour 
period shall constitute a run.
    (iii) For Method 15A, a 1-hour sample shall constitute a run.
    (2) Where emissions are monitored by Sec. 60.105(a)(3), compliance 
with Sec. 60.105(a)(1) shall be determined using Method 6 or 6C and 
Method 3 or 3A. A 1-hour sample shall constitute a run. Method 6 samples 
shall be taken at a rate of approximately 2 liters/min. The ppm 
correction factor (Method 6) and the sampling location in paragraph 
(f)(1) of this section apply. Method 4 shall be used to determine the 
moisture content of the gases. The sampling point for Method 4 shall be 
adjacent to the sampling point for Method 6 or 6C.
    (f) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
SO<INF>2</INF> and the H<INF>2</INF>S and reduced sulfur standards in 
Sec. 60.104(a)(2) as follows:
    (1) Method 6 shall be used to determine the SO<INF>2</INF> 
concentration. The concentration in mg/dscm obtained by Method 6 or 6C 
is multiplied by 0.3754 to obtain the concentration in ppm. The sampling 
point in the duct shall be the centroid of the cross section if the 
cross-sectional area is less than 5.00 m<SUP>2</SUP> (53.8 
ft<SUP>2</SUP>) or at a point no closer to the walls than 1.00 m (39.4 
in.) if the cross-sectional area is 5.00 m<SUP>2</SUP> or more and the 
centroid is more than 1 m from the wall. The sampling time and sample 
volume shall be at least 10 minutes and 0.010 dscm (0.35 dscf) for each 
sample. Eight samples of equal sampling times shall be taken at about 
30-minute intervals. The arithmetic average of these eight samples shall 
constitute a run. For Method 6C, a run shall consist of the arithmetic 
average of four 1-hour samples. Method 4 shall be used to determine the 
moisture content of the gases. The sampling point for Method 4 shall be 
adjacent to the sampling point for Method 6 or 6C. The sampling time for 
each sample shall be equal to the time it takes for two Method 6 
samples. The moisture content from this sample shall be used to correct 
the corresponding Method 6 samples for moisture. For documenting the 
oxidation efficiency of the control device for reduced sulfur compounds, 
Method 15 shall be used following the procedures of paragraph (f)(2) of 
this section.
    (2) Method 15 shall be used to determine the reduced sulfur and 
H<INF>2</INF> S concentrations. Each run shall consist of 16 samples 
taken over a minimum of 3 hours. The sampling point shall be the

[[Page 231]]

same as that described for Method 6 in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. 
To ensure minimum residence time for the sample inside the sample lines, 
the sampling rate shall be at least 3.0 lpm (0.10 cfm). The 
SO<INF>2</INF> equivalent for each run shall be calculated after being 
corrected for moisture and oxygen as the arithmetic average of the 
SO<INF>2</INF> equivalent for each sample during the run. Method 4 shall 
be used to determine the moisture content of the gases as the paragraph 
(f)(1) of this section. The sampling time for each sample shall be equal 
to the time it takes for four Method 15 samples.
    (3) The oxygen concentration used to correct the emission rate for 
excess air shall be obtained by the integrated sampling and analysis 
procedure of Method 3 or 3A. The samples shall be taken simultaneously 
with the SO<INF>2</INF>, reduced sulfur and H<INF>2</INF>S, or moisture 
samples. The SO<INF>2</INF>, reduced sulfur, and H<INF>2</INF>S samples 
shall be corrected to zero percent excess air using the equation in 
paragraph (h)(6) of this section.
    (g) Each performance test conducted for the purpose of determining 
compliance under Sec. 60.104(b) shall consist of all testing performed 
over a 7-day period using Method 6 or 6C and Method 3 or 3A. To 
determine compliance, the arithmetic mean of the results of all the 
tests shall be compared with the applicable standard.
    (h) For the purpose of determining compliance with 
Sec. 60.104(b)(1), the following calculation procedures shall be used:
    (1) Calculate each 1-hour average concentration (dry, zero percent 
oxygen, ppmv) of sulfur dioxide at both the inlet and the outlet to the 
add-on control device as specified in Sec. 60.13(h). These calculations 
are made using the emission data collected under Sec. 60.105(a).
    (2) Calculate a 7-day average (arithmetic mean) concentration of 
sulfur dioxide for the inlet and for the outlet to the add-on control 
device using all of the 1-hour average concentration values obtained 
during seven successive 24-hour periods.
    (3) Calculate the 7-day average percent reduction using the 
following equation:


Rso<INF>2</INF> = 100(Cso<INF>2</INF>(i)-Cso<INF>2</INF>(o))/
Cso<INF>2</INF>(i)

where:

Rso<INF>2</INF> = 7-day average sulfur dioxide emission reduction, 
percent
Cso<INF>2</INF>(i) = sulfur dioxide emission concentration determined in 
Sec. 60.106(h)(2) at the inlet to the add-on control device, ppmv
Cso<INF>2</INF>(o) = sulfur dioxide emission concentration determined in 
Sec. 60.106(h)(2) at the outlet to the add-on control device, ppmv
100 = conversion factor, decimal to percent

    (4) Outlet concentrations of sulfur dioxide from the add-on control 
device for compliance with the 50 ppmv standard, reported on a dry, 
O<INF>2</INF>-free basis, shall be calculated using the procedures 
outlined in Sec. 60.106(h)(1) and (2) above, but for the outlet monitor 
only.
    (5) If supplemental sampling data are used for determining the 7-day 
averages under paragraph (h) of this section and such data are not 
hourly averages, then the value obtained for each supplemental sample 
shall be assumed to represent the hourly average for each hour over 
which the sample was obtained.
    (6) For the purpose of adjusting pollutant concentrations to zero 
percent oxygen, the following equation shall be used:


C<INF>adj</INF> = C<INF>meas </INF>[20.9<INF>c</INF>/(20.9-
%O<INF>2</INF>)]

where:

C<INF>adj</INF> = pollutant concentration adjusted to zero percent 
oxygen, ppm or g/dscm
C<INF>meas</INF> = pollutant concentration measured on a dry basis, ppm 
or g/dscm
20.9<INF>c</INF> = 20.9 percent oxygen-0.0 percent oxygen (defined 
oxygen correction basis), percent
20.9 = oxygen concentration in air, percent
%O<INF>2</INF> = oxygen concentration measured on a dry basis, percent

    (i) For the purpose of determining compliance with 
Sec. 60.104(b)(2), the following reference methods and calculation 
procedures shall be used except as provided in paragraph (i)(12) of this 
section:
    (1) One 3-hour test shall be performed each day.
    (2) For gases released to the atmosphere from the fluid catalytic 
cracking unit catalyst regenerator:

fiber filter between the probe and first impinger. The probe liner and 
glass fiber filter temperature shall be maintained above 160  deg.C (320 
 deg.F). The isopropanol impinger shall be eliminated. Sample recovery 
procedures described in Method 8 for container No. 1 shall be 
eliminated. The heated glass fiber filter also shall be excluded; 
however, rinsing of all connecting glassware after the heated glass 
fiber filter shall be retained and included in container No. 2. Sampled 
volume shall be at least 1 dscm.
    (4) For Method 3, the integrated sampling technique shall be used.
    (5) Sampling time for each run shall be at least 3 hours.
    (6) All testing shall be performed at the same location. Where the 
gases discharged by the fluid catalytic cracking unit catalyst 
regenerator pass through an incinerator-waste heat boiler in which 
auxiliary or supplemental gaseous, liquid, or solid fossil fuel is 
burned, testing shall be conducted at a point between the regenerator 
outlet and the incinerator-waste heat boiler. An alternative sampling 
location after the waste heat boiler may be used if alternative coke 
burn-off rate equations, and, if requested, auxiliary/supplemental fuel 
SO<INF>X</INF> credits, have been submitted to and approved by the 
Administrator prior to sampling.

(i)(6) of this section applies.
    (8) Calculate the concentration of sulfur oxides as sulfur dioxide 
using equation 8-3 in Section 6.5 of Method 8 to calculate and report 
the total concentration of sulfur oxides as sulfur dioxide

Where:

E<INF>SOx</INF> = sulfur oxides emission rate calculated as sulfur 
dioxide, kg/hr (lb/hr)
C<INF>SOx</INF> = sulfur oxides emission concentration calculated as 
sulfur dioxide, g/dscm (gr/dscf)

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.004

Where:

R<INF>SOx</INF> = Sulfur oxides emissions calculated as kg sulfur 
dioxide per Mg (lb/ton) coke burn-off.
E<INF>SOx</INF> = Sulfur oxides emission rate calculated as sulfur 
dioxide, kg/hr (lb/hr).
R<INF>c</INF> = Coke burn-off rate, Mg/hr (ton/hr).

    (11) Calculate the 7-day average sulfur oxides emission rate as 
sulfur dioxide per Mg (ton) of coke burn-off by dividing the sum of the 
individual daily rates by the number of daily rates summed.
    (12) An owner or operator may, upon approval by the Administrator, 
use an alternative method for determining compliance with 
Sec. 60.104(b)(2), as provided in Sec. 60.8(b). Any requests for 
approval must include data to demonstrate to the Administrator that the 
alternative method would produce results adequate for the determination 
of compliance.
    (j) For the purpose of determining compliance with 
Sec. 60.104(b)(3), the following analytical methods and calculation 
procedures shall be used:
    (1) One fresh feed sample shall be collected once per 8-hour period.
    (2) Fresh feed samples shall be analyzed separately by using any one 
of the following applicable analytical test methods: ASTM D129-64, 78, 
or 95, ASTM D1552-83 or 95, ASTM D2622-87, 94, or 98, or ASTM D1266-87, 
91, or 98. (These methods are incorporated by reference: see 
Sec. 60.17.) The applicable range of some of these ASTM methods is not 
adequate to measure the levels of sulfur in some fresh feed samples. 
Dilution of samples prior to analysis with verification of the dilution 
ratio

[[Page 233]]

is acceptable upon prior approval of the Administrator.
    (3) If a fresh feed sample cannot be collected at a single location, 
then the fresh feed sulfur content shall be determined as follows:
    (i) Individual samples shall be collected once per 8-hour period for 
each separate fresh feed stream charged directly into the riser or 
reactor of the fluid catalytic cracking unit. For each sample location 
the fresh feed volumetric flow rate at the time of collecting the fresh 
feed sample shall be measured and recorded. The same method for 
measuring volumetric flow rate shall be used at all locations.
    (ii) Each fresh feed sample shall be analyzed separately using the 
methods specified under paragraph (j)(2) of this section.
    (iii) Fresh feed sulfur content shall be calculated for each 8-hour 
period using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.005

where:

S<INF>f</INF> = fresh feed sulfur content expressed in percent by weight 
of fresh feed.
n = number of separate fresh feed streams charged directly to the riser 
or reactor of the fluid catalytic cracking unit.
Q<INF>f</INF> = total volumetric flow rate of fresh feed charged to the 
fluid catalytic cracking unit.
S<INF>i</INF> = fresh feed sulfur content expressed in percent by weight 
of fresh feed for the ``ith'' sampling location.
Q<INF>i</INF> = volumetric flow rate of fresh feed stream for the 
``ith'' sampling location.

    (4) Calculate a 7-day average (arithmetic mean) sulfur content of 
the fresh feed using all of the fresh feed sulfur content values 
obtained during seven successive 24-hour periods.
    (k) The test methods used to supplement continuous monitoring system 
data to meet the minimum data requirements in Sec. 60.104(d) will be 
used as described below or as otherwise approved by the Administrator.
    (1) Methods 6, 6B, or 8 are used. The sampling location(s) are the 
same as those specified for the monitor.
    (2) For Method 6, the minimum sampling time is 20 minutes and the 
minimum sampling volume is 0.02 dscm (0.71 dscf) for each sample. 
Samples are taken at approximately 60-minute intervals. Each sample 
represents a 1-hour average. A minimum of 18 valid samples is required 
to obtain one valid day of data.
    (3) For Method 6B, collection of a sample representing a minimum of 
18 hours is required to obtain one valid day of data.
    (4) For Method 8, the procedures as outlined in this section are 
used. The equivalent of 16 hours of sampling is required to obtain one 
valid day of data.

Sec. 60.113a  Testing and procedures.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 60.8(b) compliance with the standard 
prescribed in Sec. 60.112a shall be determined as follows or in 
accordance with an equivalent procedure as provided in Sec. 60.114a.
    (1) The owner or operator of each storage vessel to which this 
subpart applies which has an external floating roof shall meet the 
following requirements:
    (i) Determine the gap areas and maximum gap widths between the 
primary seal and the tank wall and between the secondary seal and the 
tank wall according to the following frequency:
    (A) For primary seals, gap measurements shall be performed within 60 
days of the initial fill with petroleum liquid and at least once every 
five years thereafter. All primary seal inspections or gap measurements 
which require the removal or dislodging of the secondary seal shall be 
accomplished as rapidly as possible and the secondary seal shall be 
replaced as soon as possible.
    (B) For secondary seals, gap measurements shall be performed within 
60 days of the initial fill with petroleum liquid and at least once 
every year thereafter.
    (C) If any storage vessel is out of service for a period of one year 
or more, subsequent refilling with petroleum liquid shall be considered 
initial fill for the purposes of paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A) and 
(a)(1)(i)(B) of this section.
    (D) Keep records of each gap measurement at the plant for a period 
of at least 2 years following the date of measurement. Each record shall 
identify the vessel on which the measurement was performed and shall 
contain the date of the seal gap measurement, the raw data obtained in 
the measurement process required by paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section 
and the calculation required by paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section.

[[Page 241]]

    (E) If either the seal gap calculated in accord with paragraph 
(a)(1)(iii) of this section or the measured maximum seal gap exceeds the 
limitations specified by Sec. 60.112a of this subpart, a report shall be 
furnished to the Administrator within 60 days of the date of 
measurements. The report shall identify the vessel and list each reason 
why the vessel did not meet the specifications of Sec. 60.112a. The 
report shall also describe the actions necessary to bring the storage 
vessel into compliance with the specifications of Sec. 60.112a.
    (ii) Determine gap widths in the primary and secondary seals 
individually by the following procedures:
    (A) Measure seal gaps, if any, at one or more floating roof levels 
when the roof is floating off the roof leg supports.
    (B) Measure seal gaps around the entire circumference of the tank in 
each place where a \1/8\<gr-thn-eq> diameter uniform probe passes freely 
(without forcing or binding against seal) between the seal and the tank 
wall and measure the circumferential distance of each such location.
    (C) The total surface area of each gap described in paragraph 
(a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section shall be determined by using probes of 
various widths to accurately measure the actual distance from the tank 
wall to the seal and multiplying each such width by its respective 
circumferential distance.
    (iii) Add the gap surface area of each gap location for the primary 
seal and the secondary seal individually. Divide the sum for each seal 
by the nominal diameter of the tank and compare each ratio to the 
appropriate ratio in the standard in Sec. 60.112a(a)(1)(i) and 
Sec. 60.112a(a)(1)(ii).
    (iv) Provide the Administrator 30 days prior notice of the gap 
measurement to afford the Administrator the opportunity to have an 
observer present.
    (2) The owner or operator of each storage vessel to which this 
subpart applies which has a vapor recovery and return or disposal system 
shall provide the following information to the Administrator on or 
before the date on which construction of the storage vessel commences:
    (i) Emission data, if available, for a similar vapor recovery and 
return or disposal system used on the same type of storage vessel, which 
can be used to determine the efficiency of the system. A complete 
description of the emission measurement method used must be included.
    (ii) The manufacturer's design specifications and estimated emission 
reduction capability of the system.
    (iii) The operation and maintenance plan for the system.
    (iv) Any other information which will be useful to the Administrator 
in evaluating the effectiveness of the system in reducing VOC emissions.

Sec. 60.114a  Alternative means of emission limitation.

    (a) If, in the Administrator's judgment, an alternative means of 
emission limitation will achieve a reduction in emissions at least 
equivalent to the reduction in emissions achieved by any requirement in 
Sec. 60.112a, the Administrator will publish in the Federal Register a 
notice permitting the use of the alternative means for purposes of 
compliance with that requirement.
    (b) Any notice under paragraph (a) of this section will be published 
only after notice and an opportunity for a hearing.
    (c) Any person seeking permission under this section shall submit to 
the Administrator a written application including:
    (1) An actual emissions test that uses a full-sized or scale-model 
storage vessel that accurately collects and measures all VOC emissions 
from a given control device and that accurately simulates wind and 
accounts for other emission variables such as temperature and barometric 
pressure.
    (2) An engineering evaluation that the Administrator determines is 
an accurate method of determining equivalence.
    (d) The Administrator may condition the permission on requirements 
that may be necessary to ensure operation and maintenance to achieve the 
same emissions reduction as specified in Sec. 60.112a.

[[Page 242]]

    (e) The primary vapor-mounted seal in the ``Volume-Maximizing Seal'' 
manufactured by R.F.I. Services Corporation is approved as equivalent to 
the vapor-mounted seal required by Sec. 60.112a(a)(1)(i) and must meet 
the gap criteria specified in Sec. 60.112a(a)(1)(i)(B). There shall be 
no gaps between the tank wall and any secondary seal used in conjunction 
with the primary seal in the ``Volume-Maximizing Seal''.

<R05>
Sec. 60.113b  Testing and procedures.

    The owner or operator of each storage vessel as specified in 
Sec. 60.112b(a) shall meet the requirements of paragraph (a), (b), or 
(c) of this section. The applicable paragraph for a particular storage 
vessel depends on the control equipment installed to meet the 
requirements of Sec. 60.112b.
    (a) After installing the control equipment required to meet 
Sec. 60.112b(a)(1) (permanently affixed roof and internal floating 
roof), each owner or operator shall:
    (1) Visually inspect the internal floating roof, the primary seal, 
and the secondary seal (if one is in service), prior to filling the 
storage vessel with VOL. If there are holes, tears, or other openings in 
the primary seal, the secondary seal, or the seal fabric or defects in 
the internal floating roof, or both, the owner or operator shall repair 
the items before filling the storage vessel.
    (2) For Vessels equipped with a liquid-mounted or mechanical shoe 
primary seal, visually inspect the internal floating roof and the 
primary seal or the secondary seal (if one is in service) through 
manholes and roof hatches on the fixed roof at least once every 12 
months after initial fill. If the internal floating roof is not resting 
on the surface of the VOL inside the storage vessel, or there is liquid 
accumulated on the roof, or the seal is detached, or there are holes or 
tears in the seal fabric, the owner or operator shall repair the items 
or empty and remove the storage vessel from service within 45 days. If a 
failure that is detected during inspections required in this paragraph 
cannot be repaired within 45

[[Page 247]]

days and if the vessel cannot be emptied within 45 days, a 30-day 
extension may be requested from the Administrator in the inspection 
report required in Sec. 60.115b(a)(3). Such a request for an extension 
must document that alternate storage capacity is unavailable and specify 
a schedule of actions the company will take that will assure that the 
control equipment will be repaired or the vessel will be emptied as soon 
as possible.
    (3) For vessels equipped with a double-seal system as specified in 
Sec. 60.112b(a)(1)(ii)(B):
    (i) Visually inspect the vessel as specified in paragraph (a)(4) of 
this section at least every 5 years; or
    (ii) Visually inspect the vessel as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section.
    (4) Visually inspect the internal floating roof, the primary seal, 
the secondary seal (if one is in service), gaskets, slotted membranes 
and sleeve seals (if any) each time the storage vessel is emptied and 
degassed. If the internal floating roof has defects, the primary seal 
has holes, tears, or other openings in the seal or the seal fabric, or 
the secondary seal has holes, tears, or other openings in the seal or 
the seal fabric, or the gaskets no longer close off the liquid surfaces 
from the atmosphere, or the slotted membrane has more than 10 percent 
open area, the owner or operator shall repair the items as necessary so 
that none of the conditions specified in this paragraph exist before 
refilling the storage vessel with VOL. In no event shall inspections 
conducted in accordance with this provision occur at intervals greater 
than 10 years in the case of vessels conducting the annual visual 
inspection as specified in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3)(ii) of this 
section and at intervals no greater than 5 years in the case of vessels 
specified in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.
    (5) Notify the Administrator in writing at least 30 days prior to 
the filling or refilling of each storage vessel for which an inspection 
is required by paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(4) of this section to afford 
the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present. If the 
inspection required by paragraph (a)(4) of this section is not planned 
and the owner or operator could not have known about the inspection 30 
days in advance or refilling the tank, the owner or operator shall 
notify the Administrator at least 7 days prior to the refilling of the 
storage vessel. Notification shall be made by telephone immediately 
followed by written documentation demonstrating why the inspection was 
unplanned. Alternatively, this notification including the written 
documentation may be made in writing and sent by express mail so that it 
is received by the Administrator at least 7 days prior to the refilling.
    (b) After installing the control equipment required to meet 
Sec. 60.112b(a)(2) (external floating roof), the owner or operator 
shall:
    (1) Determine the gap areas and maximum gap widths, between the 
primary seal and the wall of the storage vessel and between the 
secondary seal and the wall of the storage vessel according to the 
following frequency.
    (i) Measurements of gaps between the tank wall and the primary seal 
(seal gaps) shall be performed during the hydrostatic testing of the 
vessel or within 60 days of the initial fill with VOL and at least once 
every 5 years thereafter.
    (ii) Measurements of gaps between the tank wall and the secondary 
seal shall be performed within 60 days of the initial fill with VOL and 
at least once per year thereafter.
    (iii) If any source ceases to store VOL for a period of 1 year or 
more, subsequent introduction of VOL into the vessel shall be considered 
an initial fill for the purposes of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(ii) 
of this section.
    (2) Determine gap widths and areas in the primary and secondary 
seals individually by the following procedures:
    (i) Measure seal gaps, if any, at one or more floating roof levels 
when the roof is floating off the roof leg supports.
    (ii) Measure seal gaps around the entire circumference of the tank 
in each place where a 0.32-cm diameter uniform probe passes freely 
(without forcing or binding against seal) between the seal and the wall 
of the storage vessel and measure the circumferential distance of each 
such location.

[[Page 248]]

    (iii) The total surface area of each gap described in paragraph 
(b)(2)(ii) of this section shall be determined by using probes of 
various widths to measure accurately the actual distance from the tank 
wall to the seal and multiplying each such width by its respective 
circumferential distance.
    (3) Add the gap surface area of each gap location for the primary 
seal and the secondary seal individually and divide the sum for each 
seal by the nominal diameter of the tank and compare each ratio to the 
respective standards in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (4) Make necessary repairs or empty the storage vessel within 45 
days of identification in any inspection for seals not meeting the 
requirements listed in (b)(4) (i) and (ii) of this section:
    (i) The accumulated area of gaps between the tank wall and the 
mechanical shoe or liquid-mounted primary seal shall not exceed 212 
Cm\2\ per meter of tank diameter, and the width of any portion of any 
gap shall not exceed 3.81 cm.
    (A) One end of the mechanical shoe is to extend into the stored 
liquid, and the other end is to extend a minimum vertical distance of 61 
cm above the stored liquid surface.
    (B) There are to be no holes, tears, or other openings in the shoe, 
seal fabric, or seal envelope.
    (ii) The secondary seal is to meet the following requirements:
    (A) The secondary seal is to be installed above the primary seal so 
that it completely covers the space between the roof edge and the tank 
wall except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (B) The accumulated area of gaps between the tank wall and the 
secondary seal shall not exceed 21.2 cm<SUP>2</SUP> per meter of tank 
diameter, and the width of any portion of any gap shall not exceed 1.27 
cm.
    (C) There are to be no holes, tears, or other openings in the seal 
or seal fabric.
    (iii) If a failure that is detected during inspections required in 
paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 60.113b(b) cannot be repaired within 45 days 
and if the vessel cannot be emptied within 45 days, a 30-day extension 
may be requested from the Administrator in the inspection report 
required in Sec. 60.115b(b)(4). Such extension request must include a 
demonstration of unavailability of alternate storage capacity and a 
specification of a schedule that will assure that the control equipment 
will be repaired or the vessel will be emptied as soon as possible.
    (5) Notify the Administrator 30 days in advance of any gap 
measurements required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section to afford the 
Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present.
    (6) Visually inspect the external floating roof, the primary seal, 
secondary seal, and fittings each time the vessel is emptied and 
degassed.
    (i) If the external floating roof has defects, the primary seal has 
holes, tears, or other openings in the seal or the seal fabric, or the 
secondary seal has holes, tears, or other openings in the seal or the 
seal fabric, the owner or operator shall repair the items as necessary 
so that none of the conditions specified in this paragraph exist before 
filling or refilling the storage vessel with VOL.
    (ii) For all the inspections required by paragraph (b)(6) of this 
section, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in writing 
at least 30 days prior to the filling or refilling of each storage 
vessel to afford the Administrator the opportunity to inspect the 
storage vessel prior to refilling. If the inspection required by 
paragraph (b)(6) of this section is not planned and the owner or 
operator could not have known about the inspection 30 days in advance of 
refilling the tank, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator 
at least 7 days prior to the refilling of the storage vessel. 
Notification shall be made by telephone immediately followed by written 
documentation demonstrating why the inspection was unplanned. 
Alternatively, this notification including the written documentation may 
be made in writing and sent by express mail so that it is received by 
the Administrator at least 7 days prior to the refilling.
    (c) The owner or operator of each source that is equipped with a 
closed vent system and control device as required in Sec. 60.112b (a)(3) 
or (b)(2) (other than a flare) is exempt from Sec. 60.8 of

[[Page 249]]

the General Provisions and shall meet the following requirements.
    (1) Submit for approval by the Administrator as an attachment to the 
notification required by Sec. 60.7(a)(1) or, if the facility is exempt 
from Sec. 60.7(a)(1), as an attachment to the notification required by 
Sec. 60.7(a)(2), an operating plan containing the information listed 
below.
    (i) Documentation demonstrating that the control device will achieve 
the required control efficiency during maximum loading conditions. This 
documentation is to include a description of the gas stream which enters 
the control device, including flow and VOC content under varying liquid 
level conditions (dynamic and static) and manufacturer's design 
specifications for the control device. If the control device or the 
closed vent capture system receives vapors, gases, or liquids other than 
fuels from sources that are not designated sources under this subpart, 
the efficiency demonstration is to include consideration of all vapors, 
gases, and liquids received by the closed vent capture system and 
control device. If an enclosed combustion device with a minimum 
residence time of 0.75 seconds and a minimum temperature of 816  deg.C 
is used to meet the 95 percent requirement, documentation that those 
conditions will exist is sufficient to meet the requirements of this 
paragraph.
    (ii) A description of the parameter or parameters to be monitored to 
ensure that the control device will be operated in conformance with its 
design and an explanation of the criteria used for selection of that 
parameter (or parameters).
    (2) Operate the closed vent system and control device and monitor 
the parameters of the closed vent system and control device in 
accordance with the operating plan submitted to the Administrator in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unless the plan was 
modified by the Administrator during the review process. In this case, 
the modified plan applies.
    (d) The owner or operator of each source that is equipped with a 
closed vent system and a flare to meet the requirements in Sec. 60.112b 
(a)(3) or (b)(2) shall meet the requirements as specified in the general 
control device requirements, Sec. 60.18 (e) and (f).

<R05>
Sec. 60.114b  Alternative means of emission limitation.

    (a) If, in the Administrator's judgment, an alternative means of 
emission limitation will achieve a reduction in emissions at least 
equivalent to the reduction in emissions achieved by any requirement in 
Sec. 60.112b, the Administrator will publish in the Federal Register a 
notice permitting the use of the alternative means for purposes of 
compliance with that requirement.
    (b) Any notice under paragraph (a) of this section will be published 
only after notice and an opportunity for a hearing.
    (c) Any person seeking permission under this section shall submit to 
the Administrator a written application including:
    (1) An actual emissions test that uses a full-sized or scale-model 
storage vessel that accurately collects and measures all VOC emissions 
from a given control device and that accurately simulates wind and 
accounts for other emission variables such as temperature and barometric 
pressure.
    (2) An engineering evaluation that the Administrator determines is 
an accurate method of determining equivalence.
    (d) The Administrator may condition the permission on requirements 
that may be necessary to ensure operation and maintenance to achieve the 
same emissions reduction as specified in Sec. 60.112b.

Sec. 60.116b  Monitoring of operations.

    (a) The owner or operator shall keep copies of all records required 
by this section, except for the record required by paragraph (b) of this 
section, for at least 2 years. The record required by paragraph (b) of 
this section will be kept for the life of the source.
    (b) The owner or operator of each storage vessel as specified in 
Sec. 60.110b(a) shall keep readily accessible records showing the 
dimension of the storage vessel and an analysis showing the capacity of 
the storage vessel. Each storage vessel with a design capacity less than 
75 m<SUP>3</SUP> is subject to no provision of this subpart other than 
those required by this paragraph.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, 
the owner or operator of each storage vessel either with a design 
capacity greater than or equal to 151 m<SUP>3</SUP> storing a liquid 
with a maximum true vapor pressure greater than or equal to 3.5 kPa or 
with a design capacity greater than or equal to 75 m<SUP>3</SUP> but 
less than 151 m<SUP>3</SUP> storing a liquid with a maximum true vapor 
pressure greater than or equal to 15.0 kPa shall maintain a record of 
the VOL stored, the period of storage, and the maximum true vapor 
pressure of that VOL during the respective storage period.
    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, the owner 
or operator of each storage vessel either with a design capacity greater 
than or equal to 151 m<SUP>3</SUP> storing a liquid with a maximum true 
vapor pressure that is normally less than 5.2 kPa or with a design 
capacity greater than or equal to 75 m<SUP>3</SUP> but less than 151 
m<SUP>3</SUP> storing a liquid with a maximum true vapor pressure that 
is normally less than 27.6 kPa shall notify the Administrator within 30 
days when the maximum true vapor pressure of the liquid exceeds the 
respective maximum true vapor vapor pressure values for each volume 
range.
    (e) Available data on the storage temperature may be used to 
determine the maximum true vapor pressure as determined below.
    (1) For vessels operated above or below ambient temperatures, the 
maximum true vapor pressure is calculated based upon the highest 
expected calendar-month average of the storage temperature. For vessels 
operated at ambient temperatures, the maximum true vapor pressure is 
calculated based upon the maximum local monthly average ambient 
temperature as reported by the National Weather Service.
    (2) For crude oil or refined petroleum products the vapor pressure 
may be obtained by the following:
    (i) Available data on the Reid vapor pressure and the maximum 
expected storage temperature based on the highest expected calendar-
month average temperature of the stored product may be used to determine 
the maximum true vapor pressure from nomographs contained in API 
Bulletin 2517 (incorporated by reference--see Sec. 60.17), unless the 
Administrator specifically requests that the liquid be sampled, the 
actual storage temperature determined, and the Reid vapor pressure 
determined from the sample(s).
    (ii) The true vapor pressure of each type of crude oil with a Reid 
vapor pressure less than 13.8 kPa or with physical properties that 
preclude determination by the recommended method is to be determined 
from available data and recorded if the estimated maximum true vapor 
pressure is greater than 3.5 kPa.
    (3) For other liquids, the vapor pressure:
    (i) May be obtained from standard reference texts, or
    (ii) Determined by ASTM D2879-83, 96, or 97 (incorporated by 
reference--see Sec. 60.17); or
    (iii) Measured by an appropriate method approved by the 
Administrator; or
    (iv) Calculated by an appropriate method approved by the 
Administrator.
    (f) The owner or operator of each vessel storing a waste mixture of 
indeterminate or variable composition shall be subject to the following 
requirements.
    (1) Prior to the initial filling of the vessel, the highest maximum 
true vapor pressure for the range of anticipated liquid compositions to 
be stored will be determined using the methods described in paragraph 
(e) of this section.

[[Page 252]]

    (2) For vessels in which the vapor pressure of the anticipated 
liquid composition is above the cutoff for monitoring but below the 
cutoff for controls as defined in Sec. 60.112b(a), an initial physical 
test of the vapor pressure is required; and a physical test at least 
once every 6 months thereafter is required as determined by the 
following methods:
    (i) ASTM D2879-83, 96, or 97 (incorporated by reference--see 
Sec. 60.17); or
    (ii) ASTM D323-82 or 94 (incorporated by reference--see Sec. 60.17); 
or
    (iii) As measured by an appropriate method as approved by the

    (a) In conducting the performance tests required in Sec. 60.8, the 
owner or operator shall use as reference methods

[[Page 259]]

and procedures the test methods in Appendix A of this part or other 
methods and procedures as specified in this section, except as provided 
in Sec. 60.8(b).
    (b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
particulate matter standards in Sec. 60.142a as follows:
    (1) Start and end times of each steel production cycle during each 
run shall be recorded (see Sec. 60.145a (c) and (d) for the definitions 
of start and end times of a cycle).
    (2) Method 5 shall be used to determine the particulate matter 
concentration. Sampling shall be conducted only during the steel 
production cycle and for a sufficient number of steel production cycles 
to obtain a total sample volume of at least 5.67 dscm (200 dscf) for 
each run.
    (3) Method 9 and the procedures of Sec. 60.11 shall be used to 
determine opacity, except sections 2.4 and 2.5 of Method 9 shall be 
replaced with the following instructions for recording observations and 
reducing data:
    (i) Section 2.4. Opacity observations shall be recorded to the 
nearest 5 percent at 15-second intervals. During the initial performance 
test conducted pursuant to Sec. 60.8, observations shall be made and 
recorded in this manner for a minimum of three steel production cycles. 
During any subsequent compliance test, observations may be made for any 
number of steel production cycles, although, where conditions permit, 
observations will generally be made for a minimum of three steel 
production cycles.
    (ii) Section 2.5. Opacity shall be determined as an average of 12 
consecutive observations recorded at 15-second intervals. For each steel 
production cycle, divide the observations recorded into sets of 12 
consecutive observations. Sets need not be consecutive in time, and in 
no case shall two sets overlap. For each set of 12 observations, 
calculate the average by summing the opacity of 12 consecutive 
observations and dividing this sum by 12.
    (c) In complying with the requirements of Sec. 60.143a(c), the owner 
or operator shall conduct an initial test as follows:
    (1) For devices that monitor and record the exhaust ventilation 
rate, compare velocity readings recorded by the monitoring device 
against the velocity readings obtained by Method 2. Take Method 2 
readings at a point or points that would properly characterize the 
monitoring device's performance and that would adequately reflect the 
various rates of exhaust ventilation. Obtain readings at sufficient 
intervals to obtain 12 pairs of readings for each duct of the secondary 
emission capture system. Compare the averages of the two sets to 
determine whether the monitoring device velocity is within 
<plus-minus>10 percent of the Method 2 average.
    (2) For devices that monitor the level of exhaust ventilation and 
record only step changes when a set point rate is reached, compare step 
changes recorded by the monitoring device against the velocity readings 
obtained by Method 2. Take Method 2 readings at a point or points that 
would properly characterize the performance of the monitoring device and 
that would adequately reflect the various rates of exhaust ventilation. 
Obtain readings at sufficient intervals to obtain 12 pairs of readings 
for each duct of the secondary emission capture system. Compare the 
averages of the two sets to determine whether the monitoring device step 
change is within <plus-minus>10 percent of the setpoint rate.
    (d) To comply with Sec. 60.143a(d) or (e), the owner or operator 
shall use the monitoring device of Sec. 60.143a(a) to determine the 
exhaust ventilation rates or levels during the particulate matter runs. 
Each owner or operator shall then use these rates or levels to determine 
the 3-hour averages required by Sec. 60.143a(d) and (e).

Sec. 60.145a  Compliance provisions.

    (a) When determining compliance with mass and visible emission 
limits specified in Sec. 60.142a(a) (2) and (3), the owner or operator 
of a BOPF shop that normally operates two furnaces with overlapping 
cycles may elect to operate only one furnace. If an owner or operator 
chooses to shut down one furnace, he shall be allowed a reasonable time 
period to adjust his production schedule before the compliance tests are 
conducted. The owner or operator of an affected facility may also elect 
to

[[Page 260]]

suspend shop operations not subject to this subpart during compliance 
testing.
    (b) During compliance testing for mass and visible emission 
standards, if an owner or operator elects to shut down one furnace in a 
shop that normally operates two furnaces with overlapping cycles, the 
owner or operator shall operate the secondary emission control system 
for the furnace being tested at exhaust ventilation rates or levels for 
each duct of the secondary emission control system that are appropriate 
for single-furnace operation. Following the compliance test, the owner 
or operator shall operate the secondary emission control system at 
exhaust ventilation rates or levels for each duct of the system that are 
no lower than 90 percent of the exhaust ventilation values established 
during the most recent compliance test.
    (c) For the purpose of determining compliance with visible and mass 
emission standards, a steel production cycle begins when the scrap or 
hot metal is charged to the vessel (whichever operation occurs first) 
and terminates 3 minutes after slag is emptied from the vessel into the 
slag pot. Consecutive steel production cycles are not required for the 
purpose of determining compliance. Where a hot metal transfer or 
skimming station is an affected facility, the steel production cycle 
also includes the hot metal transfer or skimming operation for the next 
steel production cycle for the affected vessel. Visible emission 
observations for both hot metal transfer and skimming operations begin 
with the start of the operation and terminate 3 minutes after completion 
of the operation.
    (d) For the purpose of determining compliance with visible emission 
standards specified in Sec. 60.142a(a) (1) and (3), the starting and 
stopping times of regulated process operations shall be determined and 
the starting and stopping times of visible emissions data sets shall be 
determined accordingly.
    (e) To determine compliance with Sec. 60.142a(a)(1), select the data 
sets yielding the highest and second highest 3-minute average opacities 
for each steel production cycle. Compliance is achieved if the highest 
3-minute average for each cycle observed is less than 20 percent and the 
second highest 3-minute average is 10 percent or less.
    (f) To determine compliance with Sec. 60.142(a)(2), determine the 
concentration of particulate matter in exhaust gases exiting the 
secondary emission collection device with Method 5. Compliance is 
achieved if the concentration of particulate matter does not exceed 23 
mg/dscm (0.010 gr/dscf).
    (g) To determine compliance with Sec. 60.142a(a)(3), construct 
consecutive 3-minute averages for each steel production cycle. 
Compliance is achieved if no 3-minute average is more than 5 percent.

Sec. 60.8(c). The owner or operator shall give the Administrator at 
least 15 days advance notice of each test. The Administrator may require 
additional testing under section 114 of the Clean Air Act.
    (d) An owner or operator may petition the Administrator to establish 
an alternative testing requirement that requires testing less frequently 
than once each month for a primary control system or an anode bake 
plant. If the owner or operator show that emissions from the primary 
control system or the anode bake plant have low variability during day-
to-day operations, the Administrator may establish such an alternative 
testing requirement. The alternative testing requirement shall include a 
testing schedule and, in the case of a primary control system, the 
method to be used to determine primary control system emissions for the 
purpose of performance tests. The Administrator shall publish the 
alternative testing requirement in the Federal Register.
    (1) Alternative testing requirements are established for Anaconda 
Aluminum Company's Sebree plant in Henderson, Kentucky: The anode bake 
plant and primary control system are to be tested once a year rather 
than once a month.
    (2) Alternative testing requirements are established for Alumax of 
South Carolina's Mt. Holly Plant in Mt. Holly, South Carolina: The anode 
bake plant and primary control system are to be tested once a year 
rather than once a month.

of material tapped (slag or product.)
    (4) All furnace power input data obtained under paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (5) All flow rate data obtained under paragraph (c) of this section 
or all fan motor power consumption and pressure drop data obtained under 
paragraph (e) of this section.
    (b) The owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart 
shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a device to measure and 
continuously record the furnace power input. The furnace power input may 
be measured at the output or input side of the transformer. The device 
must have an accuracy of <plus-minus>5 percent over its operating range.
    (c) The owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart 
shall install, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring device that 
continuously measures and records the volumetric flow rate through each 
separately ducted hood of the capture system, except as provided under 
paragraph (e) of this section. The owner or operator of an electric 
submerged arc furnace that is equipped with a water cooled cover which 
is designed to contain and prevent escape of the generated gas and 
particulate matter shall monitor only the volumetric flow rate through 
the capture system for control of emissions from the tapping station. 
The owner or operator may install the monitoring device(s) in any 
appropriate location in the exhaust duct such that reproducible flow 
rate monitoring will result. The flow rate monitoring device must have 
an accuracy of <plus-minus>10 percent over its normal operating range 
and must be calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 
Administrator may require the owner or operator to demonstrate the 
accuracy of the monitoring device relative to Methods 1 and 2 of 
appendix A to this part.
    (d) When performance tests are conducted under the provisions of 
Sec. 60.8 of this part to demonstrate compliance with the standards 
under Secs. 60.262(a) (4) and (5), the volumetric flow rate through each 
separately ducted hood of the capture system must be determined using 
the monitoring device required under paragraph (c) of this section. The 
volumetric flow rates must be determined for furnace power input levels 
at 50 and 100 percent of the nominal rated capacity of the electric 
submerged arc

[[Page 285]]

furnace. At all times the electric submerged arc furnace is operated, 
the owner or operator shall maintain the volumetric flow rate at or 
above the appropriate levels for that furnace power input level 
determined during the most recent performance test. If emissions due to 
tapping are captured and ducted separately from emissions of the 
electric submerged arc furnace, during each tapping period the owner or 
operator shall maintain the exhaust flow rates through the capture 
system over the tapping station at or above the levels established 
during the most recent performance test. Operation at lower flow rates 
may be considered by the Administrator to be unacceptable operation and 
maintenance of the affected facility. The owner or operator may request 
that these flow rates be reestablished by conducting new performance 
tests under Sec. 60.8 of this part.
    (e) The owner or operator may as an alternative to paragraph (c) of 
this section determine the volumetric flow rate through each fan of the 
capture system from the fan power consumption, pressure drop across the 
fan and the fan performance curve. Only data specific to the operation 
of the affected electric submerged arc furnace are acceptable for 
demonstration of compliance with the requirements of this paragraph. The 
owner or operator shall maintain on file a permanent record of the fan 
performance curve (prepared for a specific temperature) and shall:
    (1) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a device to 
continuously measure and record the power consumption of the fan motor 
(measured in kilowatts), and
    (2) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a device to 
continuously measure and record the pressure drop across the fan. The 
fan power consumption and pressure drop measurements must be 
synchronized to allow real time comparisions of the data. The monitoring 
devices must have an accuracy of <plus-minus>5 percent over their normal 
operating ranges.
    (f) The volumetric flow rate through each fan of the capture system 
must be determined from the fan power consumption, fan pressure drop, 
and fan performance curve specified under paragraph (e) of this section, 
during any performance test required under Sec. 60.8 to demonstrate 
compliance with the standards under Secs. 60.262(a)(4) and (5). The 
owner or operator shall determine the volumetric flow rate at a 
representative temperature for furnace power input levels of 50 and 100 
percent of the nominal rated capacity of the electric submerged arc 
furnace. At all times the electric submerged arc furnace is operated, 
the owner or operator shall maintain the fan power consumption and fan 
pressure drop at levels such that the volumetric flow rate is at or 
above the levels established during the most recent performance test for 
that furnace power input level. If emissions due to tapping are captured 
and ducted separately from emissions of the electric submerged arc 
furnace, during each tapping period the owner or operator shall maintain 
the fan power consumption and fan pressure drop at levels such that the 
volumetric flow rate is at or above the levels established during the 
most recent performance test. Operation at lower flow rates may be 
considered by the Administrator to be unacceptable operation and 
maintenance of the affected facility. The owner or operator may request 
that these flow rates be reestablished by conducting new performance 
tests under Sec. 60.8. The Administrator may require the owner or 
operator to verify the fan performance curve by monitoring necessary fan 
operating parameters and determining the gas volume moved relative to 
Methods 1 and 2 of appendix A to this part.
    (g) All monitoring devices required under paragraphs (c) and (e) of 
this section are to be checked for calibration annually in accordance 
with the procedures under Sec. 60.13(b).


<R05>
Sec. 60.266  Test methods and procedures.

    (a) During any performance test required in Sec. 60.8, the owner or 
operator shall not allow gaseous diluents to be added to the effluent 
gas stream after the fabric in an open pressurized fabric filter 
collector unless the total gas volume flow from the collector is 
accurately determined and considered in the determination of emissions.
    (b) In conducting the performance tests required in Sec. 60.8, the 
owner or operator shall use as reference methods

[[Page 286]]

specified in sections 2.1.2 and 2.1.6 are not to be used when the carbon 
monoxide content of the gas stream exceeds 10 percent by volume, dry 
basis. If a flare is used to comply with Sec. 60.263, the sampling site 
shall be upstream of the flare. The sampling time shall include an 
integral number of furnace cycles.
    (i) When sampling emissions from open electric submerged arc 
furnaces with wet scrubber control devices, sealed electric submerged 
arc furnaces, or semienclosed electric arc furnaces, the sampling time 
and sample volume for each run shall be at least 60 minutes and 1.80 
dscm (63.6 dscf).
    (ii) When sampling emissions from other types of installations, the 
sampling time and sample volume for each run shall be at least 200 
minutes and 5.66 dscm (200 dscf).
    (3) The measurement device of Sec. 60.265(b) shall be used to 
determine the average furnace power input (P) during each run.
    (4) Method 9 and the procedures in Sec. 60.11 shall be used to 
determine opacity.
    (5) The emission rate correction factor, integrated sampling 
procedure of Method 3B shall be used to determine the CO concentration. 
The sample shall be taken simultaneously with each particulate matter 
sample.
    (d) During the particulate matter run, the maximum open hood area 
(in hoods with segmented or otherwise moveable sides) under which the 
process is expected to be operated and remain in compliance with all 
standards shall be recorded. Any future operation of the hooding system 
with open areas in excess of the maximum is not permitted.

Sec. 60.273  Emission monitoring.

    (a) A continuous monitoring system for the measurement of the 
opacity of emissions discharged into the atmosphere from the control 
device(s) shall be installed, calibrated, maintained, and operated by 
the owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart.
    (b) For the purpose of reports under Sec. 60.7(c), all six-minute 
periods during which the average opacity is three percent or greater 
shall indicate a period of excess emission, and shall be reported to the 
Administrator semi-annually.
    (c) A continuous monitoring system is not required on any modular, 
multiple-stack, negative-pressure or positive-pressure fabric filter if 
observations of the opacity of the visible emissions from the control 
device are performed by a certified visible emission observer as 
follows: Visible emission observations shall be conducted at least once 
per day when the furnace is operating in the melting and refining 
period. These observations shall be taken in accordance with Method 9, 
and, for at least three 6-minute periods, the opacity shall be recorded 
for any point(s) where visible emissions are observed. Where it is 
possible to determine that a number of visible emission sites relate to 
only one incident of the visible emission, only one set of three 6-
minute observations will be required. In this case, Method 9 
observations must be made for the site of highest opacity that directly 
relates to the cause (or location) of visible emissions observed during 
a single incident. Records shall be maintained of any 6-minute average 
that is in excess of the emission limit specified in Sec. 60.272(a) of 
this subpart.
    (d) A furnace static pressure monitoring device is not required on 
any EAF equipped with a DEC system if observations of shop opacity are 
performed by a certified visible emission observer as follows: Shop 
opacity observations shall be conducted at least once per day when the 
furnace is operating in the meltdown and refining period. Shop opacity 
shall be determined as the arithmetic average of 24 or more consecutive 
15-second opacity observations of emissions from the shop taken in 
accordance with Method 9. Shop opacity shall be recorded for any 
point(s) where visible emissions are observed in proximity to an 
affected EAF. Where it is possible to determine that a number of visible 
emission sites relate to only one incident of visible emissions, only 
one observation of shop opacity will be required. In this case, the shop 
opacity observations must be made for the site of highest opacity that 
directly relates to the cause (or location) of visible emissions 
observed during a single incident.

Sec. 60.274  Monitoring of operations.

    (a) The owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart 
shall maintain records daily of the following information:
    (1) Time and duration of each charge;
    (2) Time and duration of each tap;
    (3) All flow rate data obtained under paragraph (b) of this section, 
or equivalent obtained under paragraph (d) of this section; and
    (4) All pressure data obtained under paragraph (f) of this section.
    (b) Except as provided under paragraph (d) of this section, the 
owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall check 
and record on a once-per-shift basis furnace static pressure (if a DEC 
system is in use, and a furnace static pressure gauge is installed 
according to paragraph (f) of this section) and either: check and record 
the control system fan motor amperes and damper positions on a once-per-
shift basis; install, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring device that 
continuously records the volumetric flow rate through each separately

[[Page 289]]

ducted hood; or install, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring device 
that continuously records the volumetric flow rate at the control device 
inlet and check and record damper positions on a once-per-shift basis. 
The monitoring device(s) may be installed in any appropriate location in 
the exhaust duct such that reproducible flow rate monitoring will 
result. The flow rate monitoring device(s) shall have an accuracy of 
<plus-minus>10 percent over its normal operating range and shall be 
calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 
Administrator may require the owner or operator to demonstrate the 
accuracy of the monitoring device(s) relative to Methods 1 and 2 of 
appendix A of this part.
    (c) When the owner or operator of an EAF is required to demonstrate 
compliance with the standards under Sec. 60.272(a)(3) and at any other 
time the Administrator may require that (under section 114 of the Act, 
as amended) either: the control system fan motor amperes and all damper 
positions; the volumetric flow rate through each separately ducted hood; 
or the volumetric flow rate at the control device inlet and all damper 
positions shall be determined during all periods in which a hood is 
operated for the purpose of capturing emissions from the EAF subject to 
paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section. The owner or operator may 
petition the Administrator for reestablishment of these parameters 
whenever the owner or operator can demonstrate to the Administrator's 
satisfaction that the EAF operating conditions upon which the parameters 
were previously established are no longer applicable. The values of 
these parameters as determined during the most recent demonstration of 
compliance shall be maintained at the appropriate level for each 
applicable period. Operation at other than baseline values may be 
subject to the requirements of Sec. 60.276(a).
    (d) The owner or operator may petition the Administrator to approve 
any alternative method that will provide a continuous record of 
operation of each emission capture system.
    (e) The owner or operator shall perform monthly operational status 
inspections of the equipment that is important to the performance of the 
total capture system (i.e., pressure sensors, dampers, and damper 
switches). This inspection shall include observations of the physical 
appearance of the equipment (e.g., presence of hole in ductwork or 
hoods, flow constrictions caused by dents or accumulated dust in 
ductwork, and fan erosion). Any deficiencies shall be noted and proper 
maintenance performed.
    (f) Except as provided for under Sec. 60.273(d), where emissions 
during any phase of the heat time are controlled by use of a direct 
shell evacuation system, the owner or operator shall install, calibrate, 
and maintain a monitoring device that continuously records the pressure 
in the free space inside the EAF. The pressure shall be recorded as 15-
minute integrated averages. The monitoring device may be installed in 
any appropriate location in the EAF or DEC duct prior to the 
introduction of ambient air such that reproducible results will be 
obtained. The pressure monitoring device shall have an accuracy of 
<plus-minus>5 mm of water gauge over its normal operating range and 
shall be calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions.
    (g) Except as provided for under Sec. 60.273(d), when the owner or 
operator of an EAF is required to demonstrate compliance with the 
standard under Sec. 60.272(a)(3) and at any other time the Administrator 
may require (under section 114 of the Act, as amended), the pressure in 
the free space inside the furnace shall be determined during the 
meltdown and refining period(s) using the monitoring device under 
paragraph (f) of this section. The owner or operator may petition the 
Administrator for reestablishment of the 15-minute integrated average 
pressure whenever the owner or operator can demonstrate to the 
Administrator's satisfaction that the EAF operating conditions upon 
which the pressures were previously established are no longer 
applicable. The pressure determined during the most recent demonstration 
of compliance shall be maintained at all times the EAF is operating in a 
meltdown and refining period. Operation at higher pressures may be 
considered by the Administrator to be unacceptable operation and 
maintenance of the affected facility.

[[Page 290]]

    (h) Where the capture system is designed and operated such that all 
emissions are captured and ducted to a control device, the owner or 
operator shall not be subject to the requirements of this section.
    (i) During any performance test required under Sec. 60.8, and for 
any report thereof required by Sec. 60.276(c) of this subpart or to 
determine compliance with Sec. 60.272(a)(3) of this subpart, the owner 
or operator shall monitor the following information for all heats 
covered by the test:

methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as 
specified in this section, except as provided in Sec. 60.8(b).
    (e) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
particulate matter standards in Sec. 60.272 as follows:
    (1) Method 5 shall be used for negative-pressure fabric filters and 
other types of control devices and Method 5D shall be used for positive-
pressure fabric filters to determine the particular matter concentration 
and, if applicable, the volumetric flow rate of the effluent gas. The 
sampling time and sample volume for each run shall be at least 4 hours 
and 4.5 dscm (160 dscf) and, when a single EAF is sampled, the sampling 
time shall include an integral number of heats.
    (2) When more than one control device serves the EAF(s) being 
tested, the concentration of particulate matter shall be determined 
using the following equation:

[[Page 291]]

    (f) To comply with Sec. 60.274 (c), (f), (g), and (i), the owner or 
operator shall obtain the information in these paragraphs during the 
particulate matter runs.
    (g) Where emissions from any EAF(s) are combined with emissions from 
facilities not subject to the provisions of this subpart but controlled 
by a common capture system and control device, the owner or operator may 
use any of the following procedures during a performance test:
    (1) Base compliance on control of the combined emissions.
    (2) Utilize a method acceptable to the Administrator which 
compensates for the emissions from the facilities not subject to the 
provisions of this subpart.
    (3) Any combination of the criteria of paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) 
of this section.
    (h) Where emissions from any EAF(s) are combined with emissions from

furnace is operating in the melting and refining period. These 
observations shall be taken in accordance with Method 9, and, for at 
least three 6-minute periods, the opacity shall be recorded for any 
point(s) where visible emissions are observed. Where it is possible to 
determine that a number of visible emission sites relate to only one 
incident of the visible emissions, only one set of three 6-minute 
observations will be required. In this case, Method 9 observations must 
be made for the site of highest opacity that directly relates to the 
cause (or location) of visible emissions observed during a single 
incident. Records shall be maintained of any 6-minute average that is in 
excess of the emission limit specified in Sec. 60.272(a) of this 
subpart.
    (j) Unless the presence of inclement weather makes concurrent 
testing infeasible, the owner or operator shall conduct concurrently the 
performance tests required under Sec. 60.8 to demonstrate compliance 
with Sec. 60.272(a) (1), (2), and (3) of this subpart.

a continuous monitoring system for the measurement of the opacity of 
emissions discharged into the atmosphere

[[Page 294]]

from the control device(s) shall be installed, calibrated, maintained, 
and operated by the owner or operator subject to the provisions of this 
subpart.
    (b) No continuous monitoring system shall be required on any control 
device serving the dust-handling system.
    (c) A continuous monitoring system for the measurement of opacity is 
not required on modular, multiple-stack, negative-pressure or positive-
pressure fabric filters if observations of the opacity of the visible 
emissions from the control device are performed by a certified visible 
emission observer as follows: Visible emission observations are 
conducted at least once per day when the furnace is operating in the 
melting and refining period. These observations shall be taken in 
accordance with Method 9, and, for at least three 6-minute periods, the 
opacity shall be recorded for any point(s) where visible emissions are 
observed. Where it is possible to determine that a number of visible 
emission sites relate to only one incident of the visible emissions, 
only one set of three 6-minute observations will be required. In this 
case, Method 9 observations must be made for the site of highest opacity 
that directly relates to the cause (or location) of visible emissions 
observed during a single incident. Records shall be maintained of any 6-
minute average that is in excess of the emission limit specified in 
Sec. 60.272a(a) of this subpart.
    (d) A furnace static pressure monitoring device is not required on 
any EAF equipped with a DEC system if observations of shop opacity are 
performed by a certified visible emission observer as follows: Shop 
opacity observations shall be conducted at least once per day when the 
furnace is operating in the meltdown and refining period. Shop opacity 
shall be determined as the arithmetic average of 24 consecutive 15-
second opacity observations of emissions from the shop taken in 
accordance with Method 9. Shop opacity shall be recorded for any 
point(s) where visible emissions are observed. Where it is possible to 
determine that a number of visible emission sites relate to only one 
incident of visible emissions, only one observation of shop opacity will 
be required. In this case, the shop opacity observations must be made 
for the site of highest opacity that directly relates to the cause (or 
location) of visible emissions observed during a single incident.

Sec. 60.274a  Monitoring of operations.

    (a) The owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart 
shall maintain records of the following information:
    (1) All data obtained under paragraph (b) of this section; and
    (2) All monthly operational status inspections performed under 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) Except as provided under paragraph (d) of this section, the 
owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall check 
and record on a once-per-shift basis the furnace static pressure (if DEC 
system is in use, and a furnace static pressure gauge is installed 
according to paragraph (f) of this section) and either: check and record 
the control system fan motor amperes and damper position on a once-per-
shift basis; install, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring device that 
continuously records the volumetric flow rate through each separately 
ducted hood; or install, calibrate, and maintain a monitoring device 
that continuously records the volumetric flow rate at the control device 
inlet and check and record damper positions on a once-per-shift basis. 
The monitoring device(s) may be installed in any appropriate location in 
the exhaust duct such that reproducible flow rate monitoring will 
result. The flow rate monitoring device(s) shall have an accuracy of 
<plus-minus>10 percent over its normal operating range and shall be 
calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 
Administrator may require the owner or operator to demonstrate the 
accuracy of the monitoring device(s) relative to Methods 1 and 2 of 
appendix A of this part.
    (c) When the owner or operator of an EAF is required to demonstrate 
compliance with the standards under Sec. 60.272a(a)(3), and at any other 
time that the Administrator may require (under section 114 of the Act, 
as amended), either the control system fan

[[Page 295]]

motor amperes and all damper positions or the volumetric flow rate 
through each separately ducted hood shall be determined during all 
periods in which a hood is operated for the purpose of capturing 
emissions from the affected facility subject to paragraph (b)(1) or 
(b)(2) of this section. The owner or operator may petition the 
Administrator for reestablishment of these parameters whenever the owner 
or operator can demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that the 
affected facility operating conditions upon which the parameters were 
previously established are no longer applicable. The values of these 
parameters as determined during the most recent demonstration of 
compliance shall be maintained at the appropriate level for each 
applicable period. Operation at other than baseline values may be 
subject to the requirements of Sec. 60.276a(c).
    (d) The owner or operator shall perform monthly operational status 
inspections of the equipment that is important to the performance of the 
total capture system (i.e., pressure sensors, dampers, and damper 
switches). This inspection shall include observations of the physical 
appearance of the equipment (e.g., presence of holes in ductwork or 
hoods, flow constrictions caused by dents or accumulated dust in 
ductwork, and fan erosion). Any deficiencies shall be noted and proper 
maintenance performed.
    (e) The owner or operator may petition the Administrator to approve 
any alternative to monthly operational status inspections that will 
provide a continuous record of the operation of each emission capture 
system.
    (f) Except as provided for under Sec. 60.273a(d), if emissions 
during any phase of the heat time are controlled by the use of a DEC 
system, the owner or operator shall install, calibrate, and maintain a 
monitoring device that allows the pressure in the free space inside the 
EAF to be monitored. The pressure shall be recorded as 15-minute 
integrated averages. The monitoring device may be installed in any 
appropriate location in the EAF or DEC duct prior to the introduction of 
ambient air such that reproducible results will be obtained. The 
pressure monitoring device shall have an accuracy of <plus-minus>5 mm of 
water gauge over its normal operating range and shall be calibrated 
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
    (g) Except as provided for under Sec. 60.273a(d), when the owner or 
operator of an EAF controlled by a DEC is required to demonstrate 
compliance with the standard under Sec. 60.272a(a)(3), and at any other 
time the Administrator may require (under section 114 of the Clean Air 
Act, as amended), the pressure in the free space inside the furnace 
shall be determined during the meltdown and refining period(s) using the 
monitoring device required under paragraph (f) of this section. The 
owner or operator may petition the Administrator for reestablishment of 
the pressure whenever the owner or operator can demonstrate to the 
Administrator's satisfaction that the EAF operating conditions upon 
which the pressures were previously established are no longer 
applicable. The pressure determined during the most recent demonstration 
of compliance shall be maintained at all times when the EAF is operating 
in a meltdown and refining period. Operation at higher pressures may be 
considered by the Administrator to be unacceptable operation and 
maintenance of the affected facility.
    (h) During any performance test required under Sec. 60.8, and for 
any report thereof required by Sec. 60.276a(f) of this subpart, or to 
determine compliance with Sec. 60.272a(a)(3) of this subpart, the owner 
or operator shall monitor the following information for all heats 
covered by the test:
    (1) Charge weights and materials, and tap weights and materials;
    (2) Heat times, including start and stop times, and a log of process 
operation, including periods of no operation during testing and the 
pressure inside an EAF when direct-shell evacuation control systems are 
used;
    (3) Control device operation log; and
    (4) Continuous opacity monitor or Method 9 data.

nitrogen content of the fuel being fired.
    (b) In conducting the performance tests required in Sec. 60.8, the 
owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test 
methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as 
specified in this section, except as provided for in Sec. 60.8(b). 
Acceptable alternative methods and procedures are given in paragraph (f) 
of this section.
    (c) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide standards in Secs. 60.332 and 
60.333(a) as follows:
    (1) The nitrogen oxides emission rate (NO<INF>x</INF>) shall be 
computed for each run using the following equation:

NO<INF>x</INF>=(NO<INF>xo</INF>) (P<INF>r</INF>/P<INF>o</INF>) 
    <SUP>0.5</SUP> e<SUP>19(Ho--0.00633)</SUP> (288  deg.K/
    T<INF>a</INF>) <SUP>1.53</SUP>

where:

NO<INF>X</INF> = emission rate of NO<INF>X</INF> at 15 percent O2 and 
ISO standard ambient conditions, ppm by volume.
NO<INF>X</INF> = observed NO<INF>X</INF> concentration, ppm by volume at 
15 percent O<INF>2.</INF>
P<INF>r</INF>=reference combustor inlet absolute pressure at 101.3 
kilopascals ambient pressure, mm Hg.

determine the fuel consumption and the water-to-fuel ratio necessary to 
comply with Sec. 60.332 at 30, 50, 75, and 100 percent of peak load or 
at four points in the normal operating range of the gas turbine, 
including the minimum point in the range and peak load. All loads shall 
be corrected to ISO conditions using the appropriate equations supplied 
by the manufacturer.
    (3) Method 20 shall be used to determine the nitrogen oxides, sulfur 
dioxide, and oxygen concentrations. The span values shall be 300 ppm of 
nitrogen oxide and 21 percent oxygen. The

[[Page 319]]

NO<INF>x</INF> emissions shall be determined at each of the load 
conditions specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (d) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the sulfur 
content standard in Sec. 60.333(b) as follows: ASTM D 2880-71, 78, or 96 
shall be used to determine the sulfur content of liquid fuels and ASTM D 
1072-80 or 90 (Reapproved 1994), D 3031-81, D 4084-82 or 94, or D 3246-
81, 92, or 96 shall be used for the sulfur content of gaseous fuels 
(incorporated by reference-see Sec. 60.17). The applicable ranges of 
some ASTM methods mentioned above are not adequate to measure the levels 
of sulfur in some fuel gases. Dilution of samples before analysis (with 
verification of the dilution ratio) may be used, subject to the approval 
of the Administrator.
    (e) To meet the requirements of Sec. 60.334(b), the owner or 
operator shall use the methods specified in paragraphs (a) and (d) of 
this section to determine the nitrogen and sulfur contents of the fuel 
being burned. The analysis may be performed by the owner or operator, a 
service contractor retained by the owner or operator, the fuel vendor, 
or any other qualified agency.
    (f) The owner or operator may use the following as alternatives to 
the reference methods and procedures specified in this section:
    (1) Instead of using the equation in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, manufacturers may develop ambient condition correction factors 
to adjust the nitrogen oxides emission level measured by the performance 
test as provided in Sec. 60.8 to ISO standard day conditions. These 
factors are developed for each gas turbine model they manufacture in 
terms of combustion inlet pressure, ambient air pressure, ambient air 
humidity, and ambient air temperature. They shall be substantiated with 
data and must be approved for use by the Administrator before the 
initial performance test required by Sec. 60.8. Notices of approval of 
custom ambient condition correction factors will be published in the 
Federal Register.

device to comply with the applicable emission limit specified under 
Sec. 60.392.
    (i) Calculate the volume weighted average mass of VOC per volume of 
applied coating solids for each calendar month for each affected 
facility. The owner or operator shall determine the

[[Page 329]]

composition of the coatings by formulation data supplied by the 
manufacturer of the coating or from data determined by an analysis of 
each coating, as received, by Method 24. The Administrator may require 
the owner or operator who uses formulation data supplied by the 
manufacturer of the coating to determine data used in the calculation of 
the VOC content of coatings by Method 24 or an equivalent or alternative 
method. The owner or operator shall determine from company records on a 
monthly basis the volume of coating consumed, as received, and the mass 
of solvent used for thinning purposes. The volume weighted average of 
the total mass of VOC per volume of coating solids used each calendar 
month will be determined by the following procedures.
    (A) Calculate the mass of VOC used in each calendar month for each 
affected facility by the following equation where ``n'' is the total 
number of coatings used and ``m'' is the total number of VOC solvents 
used:

    (C) Select the appropriate transfer efficiency (T) from the 
following tables for each surface coating operation:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               Transfer
                     Application method                       efficiency

Air Atomized Spray (solvent-borne coating)..................        0.50
Manual Electrostatic Spray..................................        0.75
Automatic Electrostatic Spray...............................        0.95
Electrodeposition...........................................        1.00
------------------------------------------------------------------------


The values in the table above represent an overall system efficiency 
which includes a total capture of purge. If a spray system uses line 
purging after each vehicle and does not collect any of the purge 
material, the following table shall be used:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               Transfer

Manual Electrostatic Spray..................................        0.62
Automatic Electrostatic Spray...............................        0.75
------------------------------------------------------------------------


If the owner or operator can justify to the Administrator's satisfaction 
that other values for transfer efficiencies are appropriate, the 
Administrator will approve their use on a case-by-case basis.
    (1) When more than one application method (l) is used on an 
individual surface coating operation, the owner or operator shall 
perform an analysis to determine an average transfer efficiency by the 
following equation where ``n'' is the total number of coatings used and 
``p'' is the total number of application methods:

equation where ``n'' is the total number of stacks entering the control 
device and ``p'' is the total number of stacks not connected to the 
control device:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.011


If the owner can justify to the Administrator's satisfaction that 
another method will give comparable results, the Administrator will 
approve its use on a case-by-case basis.
    (1) In subsequent months, the owner or operator shall use the most 
recently determined capture fraction for the performance test.
    (B) Determines the destruction efficiency of the control device 
using values of the volumetric flow rate of the gas streams and the VOC 
content (as carbon) of each of the gas streams in and out of the device 
by the following equation where ``n'' is the total number of stacks 
entering the control device and ``m'' is the total number of stacks 
leaving the control device:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.014

    (1) In subsequent months, the owner or operator shall use the most 
recently determined VOC destruction efficiency for the performance test.
    (C) If an emission control device controls the emissions from more 
than one affected facility, the owner or operator shall measure the VOC 
concentration (C<INF>bi</INF>) in the effluent gas entering the control 
device (in parts per million by volume) and the volumetric flow rate 
(Q<INF>bi</INF>) of the effluent gas (in dry standard cubic meters per 
hour) entering the device through each stack. The destruction or removal 
efficiency determined using these data shall be applied to each affected 
facility served by the control device.
    (iii) If the volume weighted average mass of VOC per volume of 
applied solids emitted after the control device (N) calculated on a 
calendar month basis is less than or equal to the applicable emission 
limit specified in Sec. 60.392, the affected facility is in compliance. 
Each monthly calculation is a performance test for the purposes of this 
subpart.
    (3) The owner or operator shall use the following procedures for 
each affected facility which uses a capture system and a control device 
that recovers the VOC (e.g., carbon adsorber) to comply with the 
applicable emission limit specified under Sec. 60.392.
    (i) Calculate the mass of VOC (M<INF>o</INF>+M<INF>d</INF>) used 
during each calendar month for each affected facility as described under 
Sec. 60.393(c)(1)(i).

provided in Sec. 60.8 shall be used to conduct performance tests.
    (1) Method 24 or an equivalent or alternative method approved by the 
Administrator shall be used for the determination of the data used in 
the calculation of the VOC content of the coatings used for each 
affected facility. Manufacturers' formulation data is approved by the 
Administrator as an alternative method to Method 24. In the event of 
dispute, Method 24 shall be the referee method.
    (2) Method 25 or an equivalent or alternative method approved by the 
Administrator shall be used for the determination of the VOC 
concentration in the effluent gas entering and leaving the emission 
control device for each stack equipped with an emission control device 
and in the effluent gas leaving each stack not equipped with a control 
device.
    (3) The following methods shall be used to determine the volumetric 
flow rate in the effluent gas in a stack:
    (i) Method 1 for sample and velocity traverses,
    (ii) Method 2 for velocity and volumetric flow rate,
    (iii) Method 3 for gas analysis, and
    (iv) Method 4 for stack gas moisture.
    (b) For Method 24, the coating sample must be a 1-liter sample taken 
in a 1-liter container.
    (c) For Method 25, the sampling time for each of three runs must be 
at least one hour. The minimum sample volume must be 0.003 dscm except 
that shorter sampling times or smaller volumes, when necessitated by 
process variables or other factors, may be approved by the 
Administrator. The Administrator will approve the sampling of 
representative stacks on a case-by-case basis if the owner or operator 
can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the 
testing of representative stacks would yield results comparable to those 
that would be obtained by testing all stacks.

Sec. 60.432  Standard for volatile organic compounds.

    During the period of the performance test required to be conducted 
by Sec. 60.8 and after the date required for completion of the test, no 
owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall cause 
to be discharged into the atmosphere from any affected facility VOC 
equal to more than 16 percent of the total mass of VOC solvent and water 
used at that facility during any one performance averaging period. The 
water used includes only that water contained in the waterborne raw inks 
and related coatings and the water added for dilution with waterborne 
ink systems.


<R05>
Sec. 60.433  Performance test and compliance provisions.

    (a) The owner or operator of any affected facility (or facilities) 
shall conduct performance tests in accordance with Sec. 60.8, under the 
following conditions:
    (1) The performance averaging period for each test is 30 consecutive 
calendar days and not an average of three separate runs as prescribed 
under Sec. 60.8(f).
    (2) Except as provided under paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, 
if affected facilities routinely share the same raw ink storage/handling 
system with existing facilities, then temporary measurement procedures 
for segregating the raw inks, related coatings, VOC solvent, and water 
used at the affected facilities must be employed during the test. For 
this case, an overall emission percentage for the combined facilities as 
well as for only the affected facilities must be calculated during the 
test.
    (3) For the purpose of measuring bulk storage tank quantities of 
each color of raw ink and each related coating used, the owner or 
operator of any affected facility shall install, calibrate, maintain, 
and continuously operate during the test one or more:
    (i) Non-resettable totalizer metering device(s) for indicating the 
cumulative liquid volumes used at each affected facility; or
    (ii) Segregated storage tanks for each affected facility to allow 
determination of the liquid quantities used by measuring devices other 
than the press meters required under item (i) of this article; or
    (iii) Storage tanks to serve more than one facility with the liquid 
quantities used determined by measuring devices other than press meters, 
if facilities are combined as decribed under paragraph (d), (f), or (g) 
of this section.
    (4) The owner or operator may choose to install an automatic 
temperature compensator with any liquid metering

[[Page 346]]

device used to measure the raw inks, related coatings, water, or VOC 
solvent used, or VOC solvent recovered.
    (5) Records of the measured amounts used at the affected facility 
and the liquid temperature at which the amounts were measured are 
maintained for each shipment of all purchased material on at least a 
weekly basis for:
    (i) The raw inks and related coatings used;
    (ii) The VOC and water content of each raw ink and related coating 
used as determined according to Sec. 60.435;
    (iii) The VOC solvent and water added to the inks used;
    (iv) The VOC solvent used as a cleaning agent; and
    (v) The VOC solvent recovered.
    (6) The density variations with temperature of the raw inks, related 
coatings, VOC solvents used, and VOC solvent recovered are determined by 
the methods stipulated in Sec. 60.435(d).
    (7) The calculated emission percentage may be reported as rounded-
off to the nearest whole number.
    (8) Printing press startups and shutdowns are not included in the 
exemption provisions under Sec. 60.8(c). Frequent periods of press 
startups and shutdowns are normal operations and constitute 
representative conditions for the purpose of a performance test.
    (b) If an affected facility uses waterborne ink systems or a 
combination of waterborne and solvent-borne ink systems with a solvent 
recovery system, compliance is determined by the following procedures, 
except as provided in paragraphs (d), (e), (f), and (g) of this section:
    (1) The mass of VOC in the solvent-borne and waterborne raw inks and 
related coatings used is determined by the following equation:

where ``k'' if the total number of VOC solvents, miscellaneous solvent-
borne waste inks, and waste VOC solvents measured as recovered by volume 
with different densities.

    (6) The average VOC emission percentage for the affected facility is 
determined by the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.020

    (c) If an affected facility controlled by a solvent recovery system 
uses only solvent-borne ink systems, the owner or operator may choose to 
determine compliance on a direct mass or a density-corrected liquid 
volume basis. Except as provided in paragraphs (d), (e), (f), and (g) of 
this section, compliance is determined as follows:
    (1) On a direct mass basis, compliance is determined according to 
paragraph (b) of this section, except that the water term, 
M<INF>v</INF>, does not apply.
    (2) On a density-corrected liquid volume basis, compliance is 
determined by the following procedures:
    (i) A base temperature corresponding to that for the largest 
individual amount of VOC solvent used or recovered from the affected 
facility, or other reference temperature, is chosen by the owner or 
operator.
    (ii) The corrected liquid volume of VOC in the raw inks and related

borne waste inks, and waste VOC solvents measured as recovered by volume 
with different densities.

    (v) The average VOC emission percentage for the affected facility is 
determined by the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.024

    (d) If two or more affected facilities are controlled by the same 
solvent recovery system, compliance is determined by the procedures 
specified in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, whichever applies, 
except that (L<INF>t</INF>)<INF>a</INF> and (L<INF>r</INF>)<INF>a</INF>, 
(M<INF>t</INF>)<INF>a</INF>, (M<INF>r</INF>)<INF>a</INF>, and 
(M<INF>v</INF>)<INF>a</INF>, are the collective amounts of VOC solvent 
and water corresponding to all the affected

[[Page 348]]

facilities controlled by that solvent recovery system. The average VOC 
emission percentage for each of the affected facilities controlled by 
that same solvent recovery system is assumed to be equal.
    (e) Except as provided under paragraph (f) of this section, if an 
existing facility (or facilities) and an affected facility (or 
facilities) are controlled in common by the same solvent recovery 
system, the owner or operator shall determine compliance by conducting a 
separate emission test on the existing facility (or facilities) and then 
conducting a performance test on the combined facilities as follows:
    (1) Before the initial startup of the affected facility (or 
facilities) and at any other time as requested by the Administrator, the 
owner or operator shall conduct emission test(s) on the existing 
facility (or facilities) controlled by the subject solvent recovery 
system. The solvent recovery system must handle VOC emissions from only 
the subject existing facility (or facilities), not from affected 
facilities, during the emission test.
    (2) During the emission test, the affected facilities are subject to 
the standard stated in Sec. 60.432.
    (3) The emission test is conducted over a 30 consecutive calendar 
day averaging period according to the conditions stipulated in 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section, except that the 
conditions pertain to only existing facilities instead of affected 
facilities.
    (4) The owner or operator of the existing facility (or facilities) 
shall provide the Administrator at least 30 days prior notice of the 
emission test to afford the Administrator the opportunity to have an 
observer present.
    (5) The emission percentage for the existing facility (or 
facilities) during the emission test is determined by one of the 
following procedures:
    (i) If the existing facility (or facilities) uses a combination of 
waterborne and solvent-borne ink systems, the average VOC emission 
percentage must be determined on a direct mass basis according to 
paragraph (b) or (d) of this section, whichever applies, with the 
following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.025

where the water and VOC solvent amounts pertain to only existing 
facilities.

    (ii) If the existing facility (or facilities) uses only solvent-
borne ink systems, the owner or operator may choose to determine the 
emission percentage either on a direct mass basis or a density-corrected 
liquid volume basis according to paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, 
whichever applies. On a direct mass basis, the average VOC emission 
percentage is determined by the equation presented in article (i) of 
this paragraph. On a density-corrected liquid volume basis, the average 
VOC emission percentage is determined by the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.026

where the VOC solvent amounts pertain to only existing facilities.

    (6) The owner or operator of the existing facility (or facilities) 
shall furnish the Administrator a written report of the results of the 
emission test.
    (7) After completion of the separate emission test on the existing 
facility (or facilities), the owner or operator shall conduct 
performance test(s) on the combined facilities with the solvent recovery 
system handling VOC emissions from both the existing and affected 
facilities.
    (8) During performance test(s), the emission percentage for the 
existing facility (or facilities), P<INF>e</INF>, is assumed to be equal 
to that determined in the latest emission test. The administrator may 
request additional emission tests if any physical or operational changes 
occur to any of the subject existing facilities.
    (9) The emission percentage for the affected facility (or 
facilities) during performance test(s) with both existing and affected 
facilities connected to the solvent recovery system is determined by one 
of the following procedures:
    (i) If any of the combined facilities uses both waterborne and 
solvent-borne ink systems, the average VOC emission percentage must be 
determined on a direct mass basis according to paragraph (b) or (d) of 
this section,

[[Page 349]]

whichever applies, with the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.027

where (M<INF>t</INF>)<INF>b</INF> and (M<INF>r</INF>)<INF>b</INF> are 
the collective VOC solvent amounts pertaining to all the combined 
facilities.

    (ii) If all of the combined facilities use only solvent-borne ink 
systems, the owner or operator may choose to determine performance of 
the affected facility (or facilities) either on a direct mass basis or a 
density-corrected liquid volume basis according to paragraph (c) or (d) 
of this section, whichever applies. On a direct mass basis, the average 
VOC emission percentage is determined by the equation presented in 
article (i) of this paragraph. On a density-corrected liquid volume 
basis, the average VOC emission percentage is determined by the 
following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.028

where (L<INF>t</INF>)<INF>b</INF> and (L<INF>r</INF>)<INF>b</INF> are 
the collective VOC solvent amounts pertaining to all the combined 
facilities.

    (f) The owner or operator may choose to show compliance of the 
combined performance of existing and affected facilities controlled in 
common by the same solvent recovery system. A separate emission test for 
existing facilities is not required for this option. The combined 
performance is determined by one of the following procedures:
    (1) If any of the combined facilities uses both waterborne and 
solvent-borne ink systems, the combined average VOC emission percentage 
must be determined on a direct mass basis according to paragraph (b) or 
(d) of this section, whichever applies, with the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.308

    (2) If all of the combined facilities use only solvent-borne ink 
systems, the owner or operator may choose to determine performance 
either on a direct mass basis or a density-corrected liquid volume basis 
according to paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, whichever applies. On 
a direct mass basis, the average VOC emission percentage is determined 
by the equation presented in article (i) of this paragraph. On a 
density-corrected liquid volume basis, the average VOC emission 
percentage is determined by the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.029

    (g) If all existing and affected facilities located within the same 
plant boundary use waterborne ink systems or solvent-borne ink systems 
with solvent recovery systems, the owner or operator may choose to show 
compliance on a plantwide basis for all the existing and affected 
facilities together. No separate emission tests on existing facilities 
and no temporary segregated liquid measurement procedures for affected 
facilities are required for this option. The plantwide performance is 
determined by one of the following procedures:
    (1) If any of the facilities use waterborne ink systems, the total 
plant average VOC emission percentage must be determined on a direct 
mass basis according to paragraph (b) of this section with the following 
equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.030

Where (M<INF>t</INF>)<INF>f</INF> and (M<INF>v</INF>)<INF>f</INF> are 
the collective VOC solvent and water amounts used at all the subject 
plant facilities during the performance test.

    (2) If all of the plant facilities use only solvent-borne ink 
systems, the owner or operator may choose to determine performance 
either on a direct mass basis or a density-corrected liquid volume basis 
according to paragraph (c) of this section. On a direct mass basis, the 
total plant average VOC emission percentage is determined by the 
equation presented in article (i) of this paragraph. On a density-
corrected liquid volume basis, the total plant average VOC emission 
percentage is determined by the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.031

Sec. 60.434  Monitoring of operations and recordkeeping.

    (a) After completion of the performance test required under 
Sec. 60.8, the owner or operator of any affected facility using 
waterborne ink systems or solvent-borne ink systems with solvent 
recovery systems shall record the amount of solvent and water used, 
solvent recovered, and estimated emission percentage for each 
performance averaging period and shall maintain these records for 2 
years. The emission percentage is estimated as follows:
    (1) The performance averaging period for monitoring of proper 
operation and maintenance is a calendar month or 4 consecutive weeks, at 
the option of the owner or operator.
    (2) If affected facilities share the same raw ink storage/handling 
system with existing facilities, solvent and water used, solvent 
recovered, and emission percentages for the combined facilities may be 
documented. Separate emission percentages for only the affected 
facilities are not required in this case. The combined emission 
percentage is compared to the overall average for the existing and 
affected facilities' emission percentage determined during the most 
recent performance test.
    (3) Except as provided in article (4) of this paragraph, 
temperatures and liquid densities determined during the most recent 
performance test are used to calculate corrected volumes and mass 
quantities.
    (4) The owner or operator may choose to measure temperatures for 
determination of actual liquid densities during each performance 
averaging period. A different base temperature may be used for each 
performance averaging period if desired by the owner or operator.
    (5) The emission percentage is calculated according to the 
procedures under Sec. 60.433 (b) through (g), whichever applies, or by a 
comparable calculation which compares the total solvent recovered to the 
total solvent used at the affected facility.

    (2) Compute the weighted average by the following equation:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.032
    
    (3) For each affected facility where the value of G is less than or 
equal to 0.20 kg VOC per kg of coating solids applied, the affected 
facility is in compliance with Sec. 60.442(a)(1).
    (b) To determine compliance with Sec. 60.442(a)(2), the owner or 
operator shall calculate the required overall VOC emission reduction 
according to the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.033


If R<INF>q</INF> is less than or equal to 90 percent, then the required 
overall VOC emission reduction is R<INF>q.</INF> If R<INF>q</INF> is 
greater than 90 percent, then the required overall VOC emission 
reduction is 90 percent.
    (c) Where compliance with the emission limits specified in 
Sec. 60.442(a)(2) is achieved through the use of a solvent recovery 
system, the owner or operator shall determine the overall VOC emission 
reduction for a one calendar month period by the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.034


If the R value is equal to or greater than the R<INF>q</INF> value 
specified in paragraph (b) of this section, then compliance with 
Sec. 60.442(a)(2) is demonstrated.

[[Page 353]]

    (d) Where compliance with the emission limit specified in 
Sec. 60.442(a)(2) is achieved through the use of a solvent destruction 
device, the owner or operator shall determine calendar monthly 
compliance by comparing the monthly required overall VOC emission 
reduction specified in paragraph (b) of this section to the overall VOC 
emission reduction demonstrated in the most recent performance test 
which complied with Sec. 60.442(a)(2). If the monthly required overall 
VOC emission reduction is less than or equal to the overall VOC 
reduction of the most recent performance test, the affected facility is 
in compliance with Sec. 60.442(a)(2).
    (e) Where compliance with Sec. 60.442(a)(2) is achieved through the 
use of a solvent destruction device, the owner or operator shall 
continuously record the destruction device combustion temperature during 
coating operations for thermal incineration destruction devices or the 
gas temperature upstream and downstream of the incinerator catalyst bed 
during coating operations for catalytic incineration destruction 
devices. For thermal incineration destruction devices the owner or 
operator shall record all 3-hour periods (during actual coating 
operations) during which the average temperature of the device is more 
than 28  deg.C (50  deg.F) below the average temperature of the device 
during the most recent performance test complying with 
Sec. 60.442(a)(2). For catalytic incineration destruction devices, the 
owner or operator shall record all 3-hour periods (during actual coating 
operations) during which the average temperature of the device 
immediately before the catalyst bed is more than 28  deg.C (50  deg.F) 
below the average temperature of the device during the most recent 
performance test complying with Sec. 60.442(a)(2), and all 3-hour 
periods (during actual coating operations) during which the average 
temperature difference across the catalyst bed is less than 80 percent 
of the average temperature difference of the device during the most 
recent performance test complying with Sec. 60.442(a)(2).
    (f) After the initial performance test required for all affected 
facilities under Sec. 60.8, compliance with the VOC emission limitation 
and percentage reduction requirements under Sec. 60.442 is based on the 
average emission reduction for one calendar month. A separate compliance 
test is completed at the end of each calendar month after the initial 
performance test, and a new calendar month's average VOC emission 
reduction is calculated to show compliance with the standard.
    (g) If a common emission control device is used to recover or 
destroy solvent from more than one affected facility, the performance of 
that control device is assumed to be equal for each of the affected 
facilities. Compliance with Sec. 60.442(a)(2) is determined by the 
methods specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and is 
performed simultaneously on all affected facilities.
    (h) If a common emission control device is used to recover solvent 
from an existing facility (or facilities) as well as from an affected 
facility (or facilities), the overall VOC emission reduction for the 
affected facility (or facilities), for the purpose of compliance, shall 
be determined by the following procedures:
    (1) The owner or operator of the existing facility (or facilities) 
shall determine the mass of solvent recovered for a calendar month 
period from the existing facility (or facilities) prior to the 
connection of the affected facility (or facilities) to the emission 
control device.
    (2) The affected facility (or facilities) shall then be connected to 
the emission control device.
    (3) The owner or operator shall determine the total mass of solvent 
recovered from both the existing and affected facilities over a calendar 
month period. The mass of solvent determined in paragraph (h)(1) of this 
section from the existing facility shall be subtracted from the total 
mass of recovered solvent to obtain the mass of solvent recovered from 
the affected facility (or facilities). The overall VOC emission 
reduction of the affected facility (or facilities) can then be 
determined as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (i) If a common emission control device(s) is used to destruct 
solvent from an existing facility (or facilities) as

[[Page 354]]

well as from an affected facility (or facilities), the overall VOC 
emission reduction for the affected facility (or facilities), for the 
purpose of compliance, shall be determined by the following procedures:
    (1) The owner or operator shall operate the emission control device 
with both the existing and affected facilities connected.
    (2) The concentration of VOC (in parts per million by volume) after 
the common emission control device shall be determined as specified in 
Sec. 60.444(c). This concentration is used in the calculation of 
compliance for both the existing and affected facilities.
    (3) The volumetric flow out of the common control device 
attributable to the affected facility (or facilities) shall be 
calculated by first determining the ratio of the volumetric flow 
entering the common control device attributable to the affected facility 
(facilities) to the total volumetric flow entering the common control 
device from both existing and affected facilities. The multiplication of 
this ratio by the total volumetric flow out of the common control device 
yields the flow attributable to the affected facility (facilities). 
Compliance is determined by the use of the equation specified in 
Sec. 60.444(c).
    (j) Startups and shutdowns are normal operation for this source 
category. Emissions from these operations are to be included when 
determining if the standard specified at Sec. 60.442(a)(2) is being 
attained.

enclosure is totally capturing fugitive VOC emissions, then no 
additional total enclosure will be required for the performance test.
    (iii) For each affected facility where the value of R is greater 
than or equal to the value of R<INF>q</INF> calculated in 
Sec. 60.443(b), compliance with Sec. 60.442(a)(2) is demonstrated.


<R05>

    (f) The owner or operator of an affected facility controlled by a 
catalytic incineration solvent destruction device shall install, 
calibrate, maintain, and operate a monitoring device which continuously 
indicates and records the gas temperature both upstream and downstream 
of the catalyst bed.
    (g) The owner or operator of an affected facility controlled by a 
solvent destruction device which uses a hood or enclosure to capture 
fugitive VOC emissions shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a 
monitoring device which continuously indicates that the hood or

<R05>
Sec. 60.446  Test methods and procedures.

    (a) The VOC content per unit of coating solids applied and 
compliance with Sec. 60.422(a)(1) shall be determined by either Method 
24 and the equations specified in Sec. 60.443 or by manufacturers' 
formulation data. In the event of any inconsistency between a Method 24 
test and manufacturers' formulation data, the Method 24 test will 
govern. The Administrator may require an owner or operator to perform 
Method 24 tests during such months as he deems appropriate. For Method 
24, the coating sample must be a one liter sample taken into a one liter 
container at a point where the sample will be representative of the 
coating applied to the web substrate.
    (b) Method 25 shall be used to determine the VOC concentration, in 
parts per million by volume, of each effluent gas stream entering and 
exiting the solvent destruction device or its equivalent, and each 
effluent gas stream emitted directly to the atmosphere. Methods 1, 2, 3, 
and 4 shall be used to determine the sampling location, volumetric 
flowrate, molecular weight, and moisture of all sampled gas streams. For 
Method 25, the sampling time for each of three runs must be at least 1 
hour. The minimum sampling volume

[[Page 356]]

must be 0.003 dscm except that shorter sampling times or smaller 
volumes, when necessitated by process variables or other factors, may be 
approved by the Administrator.
    (c) If the owner or operator can demonstrate to the Administrator's 
satisfaction that testing of representative stacks yields results 
comparable to those that would be obtained by testing all stacks, the 
Administrator will approve testing of representative stacks on a case-
by-case basis.

Sec. 60.453  Performance test and compliance provisions.

    (a) Sections 60.8 (d) and (f) do not apply to the performance test 
procedures required by this subpart.
    (b) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall conduct an 
initial performance test as required under Sec. 60.8(a) and thereafter a 
performance test each calendar month for each affected facility 
according to the procedures in this paragraph.
    (1) An owner or operator shall use the following procedures for any 
affected facility that does not use a capture system and control device 
to comply with the emissions limit specified under Sec. 60.452. The 
owner or operator shall determine the composition of the coatings by 
formulation data supplied by the coating manufacturer or by analysis of 
each coating, as received, using Method 24. The Administrator may 
require the owner or operator who uses formulation data supplied by the 
coating manufacturer to determine the VOC content of coatings using 
Method 24. The owner or operator shall determine the volume of coating 
and the mass of VOC-solvent used for thinning purposes from company 
records on a monthly basis. If a common coating distribution system 
serves more than one affected facility or serves both affected and 
existing facilities, the owner or operator shall estimate the volume of 
coatings used at each facility, by using the average dry weight of 
coating and the surface area coated by each affected and existing 
facility or by other procedures acceptable to the Administrator.
    (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section, the 
weighted average of the total mass of VOC's consumed per unit volume of 
coating solids applied each calendar month will be determined as 
follows.
    (A) Calculate the mass of VOC's consumed (M<INF>o</INF> + 
M<INF>d</INF>) during the calendar month for each affected facility by 
the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.035

([Sigma]L<INF>dj</INF>D<INF>dj</INF> will be 0 if no VOC-solvent is 
    added to the coatings, as received)

where:

n is the number of different coatings used during the calendar month, 
and
m is the number of different VOC-solvents added to coatings during the 
calendar month.

    (B) Calculate the total volume of coating solids used 
(L<INF>s</INF>) in the calendar month for each affected facility by the 
following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.036

where n is the number of different coatings used during the calendar 
month.

    (C) Select the appropriate transfer efficiency from Table 1. If the 
owner or operator can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the 
Administrator that transfer efficiencies other than those shown are 
appropriate, the Administrator will approve their use on a case-by-case 
basis. Transfer efficiencies for application methods not listed shall be 
determined by the Administrator on a case-by-case basis. An owner or 
operator must submit sufficient data for the Administrator to judge the 
accuracy of the transfer efficiency claims.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Where more than one application method is used within a single 
surface coating operation, the owner or operator shall determine the 
composition and volume of each coating applied by each method through a 
means acceptable to the Administrator and compute the weighted average 
transfer efficiency by the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.012

where:

n is the number of coatings (or input streams) used, and
m is the number of application methods used.

    (D) Calculate the volume-weighted average mass of VOC's consumed per 
unit volume of coating solids applied (G) during the calendar month for 
each affected facility by the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.038

    (ii) Calculate the volume-weighted average of VOC emissions to the 
atmosphere (N) during the calendar month for each affected facility by 
the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.039

    (iii) Where the volume-weighted average mass of VOC's discharged to 
the atmosphere per unit volume of coating solids applied (N) is equal to 
or less than 0.90 kilogram per liter, the affected facility is in 
compliance.
    (iv) If each individual coating used by an affected facility has a 
VOC content, as received, which when divided by the lowest transfer 
efficiency at which the coating is applied, results in a value equal to 
or less than 0.90 kilogram per liter, the affected facility is in 
compliance, provided no VOC's are added to the coating during 
distribution or application.
    (2) An owner or operator shall use the following procedures for any 
affected facility that uses a capture system and a control device that 
destroys VOC's (e.g., incinerator) to comply with the emission limit 
specified under Sec. 60.452.
    (i) Determine the overall reduction efficiency (R) for the capture 
system and control device. For the initial performance test the overall 
reduction efficiency (R) shall be determined as prescribed in A, B, and 
C below. In subsequent months, the owner or operator may use the most 
recently determined overall reduction efficiency (R) for the performance 
test, providing control device and capture system operating conditions 
have not changed. The procedure in A, B, and C, below, shall be repeated 
when directed by the Administrator or when the owner or operator elects 
to operate the control device or capture system at conditions different 
from the initial performance test.
    (A) Determine the fraction (F) of total VOC's emitted by an affected 
facility that enters the control device using the following equation:

    (iv) If each individual coating used by an affected facility has a 
VOC content, as received, that is equal to or less than 0.28 kg/l of 
coating solids, the

[[Page 365]]

affected facility is in compliance provided no VOC's are added to the 
coatings during distribution or application.
    (2) An owner or operator shall use the following procedures for each 
affected facility that continuously uses a capture system and a control 
device that destroys VOC's (e.g., incinerator) to comply with the 
emission limit specified under Sec. 60.462(a) (2) or (3).
    (i) Determine the overall reduction efficiency (R) for the capture 
system and control device.

For the initial performance test, the overall reduction efficiency (R) 
shall be determined as prescribed in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) (A), (B), and 
(C) of this section. In subsequent months, the owner or operator may use 
the most recently determined overall reduction efficiency (R) for the 
performance test, providing control device and capture system operating 
conditions have not changed. The procedure in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) (A), 
(B), and (C) of this section, shall be repeated when directed by the 
Administrator or when the owner or operator elects to operate the 
control device or capture system at conditions different from the 
initial performance test.
    (A) Determine the fraction (F) of total VOC's emitted by an affected 
facility that enters the control device using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.035

                                                              Equation 6

Where:

n is the number of gas streams entering the control device, and
m is the number of gas streams leaving the control device and entering 
the atmosphere.


The owner or operator of the affected facility shall construct the VOC 
emission reduction system so that all volumetric flow rates and total 
VOC emissions can be accurately determined by the applicable test 
methods and procedures specified in Sec. 60.466. The owner or operator 
of the affected facility shall construct a temporary enclosure around 
the coating applicator and flashoff area during the performance test for 
the purpose of evaluating the capture efficiency of the system. The 
enclosure must be maintained at a negative pressure to ensure that all 
VOC emissions are measurable. If a permanent enclosure exists in the 
affected facility prior to the performance test and the Administrator is 
satisfied that the enclosure is adequately containing VOC emissions, no 
additional enclosure is required for the performance test.
    (C) Determine overall reduction efficiency (R) using the following 
equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.045


If the overall reduction efficiency (R) is equal to or greater than 
0.90, the affected facility is in compliance and no further computations 
are necessary. If the overall reduction efficiency (R) is less than 
0.90, the average total VOC emissions to the atmosphere per unit volume 
of coating solids applied (N) shall be computed as follows.
    (ii) Calculate the volume-weighted average of the total mass of

atmosphere for each calendar month (N) is less than or equal to 0.14 kg/
l of coating solids applied, the affected facility is in compliance. 
Each monthly calculation is a performance test.
    (3) An owner or operator shall use the following procedure for each 
affected facility that uses a control device that recovers the VOC's 
(e.g., carbon adsorber) to comply with the applicable emission limit 
specified under Sec. 60.462(a) (2) or (3).

device (R) for each calendar month for each affected facility using the 
following equation:

0.90, the average total VOC emissions to the atmosphere per unit volume 
of coating solids applied (N) must be computed as follows.

(B) and (C) of this section.
    (v) Calculate the volume-weighted average mass of VOC's emitted to 
the atmosphere (N) for each calendar month for each affected facility 
using equation (8).
    (vi) If the weighted average mass of VOC's emitted to the atmosphere 
for each calendar month (N) is less than or equal to 0.14 kg/l of 
coating solids applied, the affected facility is in compliance. Each 
monthly calculation is a performance test.
    (4) An owner or operator shall use the following procedures for each 
affected facility that intermittently uses a capture system and a 
control device to comply with the emission limit specified in 
Sec. 60.462(a)(4).

owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall 
include the following data in the initial compliance report required by 
Sec. 60.8:

[[Page 369]]

    (1) The overall VOC destruction rate used to attain compliance with 
Sec. 60.462(a)(2), (3), or (4) and the calculated emission limit used to 
attain compliance with Sec. 60.462(a)(4); and
    (2) The combustion temperature of the thermal incinerator or the gas 
temperature, both upstream and downstream of the incinerator catalyst 
bed, used to attain compliance with Sec. 60.462(a)(2), (3), or (4).
    (c) Following the initial performance test, the owner or operator of 
an affected facility shall identify, record, and submit a written report 
to the Administrator every calendar quarter of each instance in which 
the volume-weighted average of the local mass of VOC's emitted to the 
atmosphere per volume of applied coating solids (N) is greater than the 
limit specified under Sec. 60.462. If no such instances have occurred 
during a particular quarter, a report stating this shall be submitted to 
the Administrator semiannually.
    (d) The owner or operator of each affected facility shall also 
submit reports at the frequency specified in Sec. 60.7(c) when the 
incinerator temperature drops as defined under Sec. 60.464(c). If no 
such periods occur, the owner or operator shall state this in the 
report.
    (e) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart 
shall maintain at the source, for a period of at least 2 years, records 
of all data and calculations used to determine monthly VOC emissions 
from each affected facility and to determine the monthly emission limit, 
where applicable. Where compliance is achieved through the use of 
thermal incineration, each owner or operator shall maintain, at the 
source, daily records of the incinerator combustion temperature. If 
catalytic incineration is used, the owner or operator shall maintain at 
the source daily records of the gas temperature, both upstream and 
downstream of the incinerator catalyst bed.

    (a) The reference methods in appendix A to this part, except as 
provided under Sec. 60.8(b), shall be used to determine compliance with 
Sec. 60.462 as follows:
    (1) Method 24, or data provided by the formulator of the coating, 
shall be used for determining the VOC content of each coating as applied 
to the surface of the metal coil. In the event of a dispute, Method 24 
shall be the reference method. When VOC content of waterborne coatings, 
determined by Method 24, is used to determine compliance of affected 
facilities, the results of the Method 24 analysis shall be adjusted as 
described in Section 12.6 of Method 24;
    (2) Method 25, both for measuring the VOC concentration in each gas 
stream entering and leaving the control device on each stack equipped 
with an emission control device and for measuring the VOC concentration 
in each gas stream emitted directly to the atmosphere;
    (3) Method 1 for sample and velocity traverses;
    (4) Method 2 for velocity and volumetric flow rate;
    (5) Method 3 for gas analysis; and
    (6) Method 4 for stack gas moisture.
    (b) For Method 24, the coating sample must be at least a 1-liter 
sample taken at a point where the sample will be representative of the 
coating as applied to the surface of the metal coil.
    (c) For Method 25, the sampling time for each of three runs is to be 
at least 60 minutes, and the minimum sampling volume is to be at least 
0.003 dscm (0.11 dscf); however, shorter sampling times or smaller 
volumes, when necessitated by process variables or other factors, may be 
approved by the Administrator.
    (d) The Administrator will approve testing of representative stacks 
on a case-by-case basis if the owner or operator can demonstrate to the 
satisfaction of the Administrator that testing of representative stacks 
yields results comparable to those that would be obtained by testing all 
stacks.

Sec. 60.474  Test methods and procedures.

    (a) For saturators, the owner or operator shall conduct performance 
tests required in Sec. 60.8 as follows:
    (1) If the final product is shingle or mineral-surfaced roll 
roofing, the tests shall be conducted while 106.6-kg (235-lb) shingle is 
being produced.
    (2) If the final product is saturated felt or smooth-surfaced roll 
roofing, the tests shall be conducted while 6.8-kg (15-lb) felt is being 
produced.
    (3) If the final product is fiberglass shingle, the test shall be 
conducted while a nominal 100-kg (220-lb) shingle is being produced.
    (b) In conducting the performance tests required in Sec. 60.8, the 
owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test 
methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as 
specified in this section, except as provided in Sec. 60.8(b).
    (c) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
particulate matter standards in Sec. 60.472 as follows:
    (1) The emission rate (E) of particulate matter shall be computed 
for each run using the following equation:

E=(c<INF>s</INF> Q<INF>sd</INF>)/(PK)

where:

E=emission rate of particulate matter, kg/Mg (lb/ton).
c<INF>s</INF>=concentration of particulate matter, g/dscm (gr/dscf).
Q<INF>sd</INF>=volumetric flow rate of effluent gas, dscm/hr (dscf/hr).
P=asphalt roofing production rate or asphalt charging rate, Mg/hr (ton/
hr).
K=conversion factor, 1000 g/kg [7000 (gr/lb)].

    (2) Method 5A shall be used to determine the particulate matter 
concentration (c<INF>s</INF>) and volumetric flow rate (Q<INF>sd</INF>) 
of the effluent gas. For a saturator, the sampling time and sample 
volume for each run shall be at least 120 minutes and 3.00 dscm (106 
dscf), and for the blowing still, at least 90 minutes or the duration of 
the coating blow or non-coating blow, whichever is greater, and 2.25 
dscm (79.4 dscf).
    (3) For the saturator, the asphalt roofing production rate (P) for 
each run shall be determined as follows: The amount of asphalt roofing 
produced on the shingle or saturated felt process lines shall be 
obtained by direct measurement. The asphalt roofing production rate is 
the amount produced divided by the time taken for the run.
    (4) For the blowing still, the asphalt charging rate (P) shall be 
computed for each run using the following equation:

P=(Vd)/(K' [thetas])

where:

P=asphalt charging rate to blowing still, Mg/hr (ton/hr).
V=volume of asphalt charged, m<SUP>3</SUP> (ft<SUP>3</SUP>).
d=density of asphalt, kg/m<SUP>3</SUP> (lb/ft\3\).
K'=conversion factor, 1000 kg/Mg (2000 lb/ton).
[thetas]=duration of test run, hr.

    (i) The volume (V) of asphalt charged shall be measured by any means 
accurate to within 10 percent.
    (ii) The density (d) of the asphalt shall be computed using the 
following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.015

Where:

d = Density of the asphalt, kg/m\3\ (lb/ft\3\)
K<INF>1</INF> = 1056.1 kg/m\3\ (metric units)
    = 64.70 lb/ft\3\ (English Units)
K<INF>2</INF> = 0.6176 kg/(m\3\  deg.C) (metric units)
    = 0.0694 lb/(ft\3\  deg.F) (English Units)
T<INF>i</INF> = temperature at the start of the blow,  deg.C (  deg.F)

    (5) Method 9 and the procedures in Sec. 60.11 shall be used to 
determine opacity.
    (d) The Administrator will determine compliance with the standards 
in Sec. 60.472(a)(3) by using Method 22, modified so that readings are 
recorded every

[[Page 373]]

15 seconds for a period of consecutive observations during 
representative conditions (in accordance with Sec. 60.8(c)) totaling 60 
minutes. A performance test shall consist of one run.
    (e) The owner or operator shall use the monitoring device in 
Sec. 60.473 (a) or (b) to monitor and record continuously the 
temperature during the particulate matter run and shall report the 
results to the Administrator with the performance test results.
    (f) If at a later date the owner or operator believes that the 
emission limits in Sec. 60.472(a) and (b) are being met even though one 
of the conditions listed in this paragraph exist, he may submit a 
written request to the Administrator to repeat the performance test and 
procedure outlined in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (1) The temperature measured in accordance with Sec. 60.473(a) is 
exceeding that measured during the performance test.
    (2) The temperature measured in accordance with Sec. 60.473(b) is 
lower than that measured during the performance test.
    (g) If fuel oil is to be used to fire an afterburner used to control 
emissions from a blowing still, the owner or operator may petition the 
Administrator in accordance with Sec. 60.11(e) of the General Provisions 
to establish an opacity standard for the blowing still that will be the 
opacity standard when fuel oil is used to fire the afterburner. To 
obtain this opacity standard, the owner or operator must request the 
Administrator to determine opacity during an initial, or subsequent, 
performance test when fuel oil is used to fire the afterburner. Upon 
receipt of the results of the performance test, the Administrator will 
make a finding concerning compliance with the mass standard for the 
blowing still. If the Administrator finds that the facility was in 
compliance with the mass standard during the performance test but failed 
to meet the zero opacity standard, the Administrator will establish and 
promulgate in the Federal Register an opacity standard for the blowing 
still that will be the opacity standard when fuel oil is used to fire 
the afterburner. When the afterburner is fired with natural gas, the 
zero percent opacity remains the applicable opacity standard.

standards in Secs. 60.482, 60.483, and 60.484 as follows:
    (1) Method 21 shall be used to determine the presence of leaking 
sources. The instrument shall be calibrated before use each day of its 
use by the procedures specified in Method 21. The following calibration 
gases shall be used:
    (i) Zero air (less than 10 ppm of hydrocarbon in air); and
    (ii) A mixture of methane or n-hexane and air at a concentration of 
about, but less than, 10,000 ppm methane or n-hexane.

4, 60.482-7(f), and 60.482-10(e) as follows:
    (1) The requirements of paragraph (b) shall apply.
    (2) Method 21 shall be used to determine the background level. All 
potential leak interfaces shall be traversed as close to the interface 
as possible. The arithmetic difference between the maximum concentration 
indicated by the instrument and the background level is compared with 
500 ppm for determining compliance.
    (d) The owner or operator shall test each piece of equipment unless 
he demonstrates that a process unit is not in VOC service, i.e., that 
the VOC content would never be reasonably expected to exceed 10 percent 
by weight. For purposes of this demonstration, the following methods and 
procedures shall be used:
    (1) Procedures that conform to the general methods in ASTM E260-73, 
91,

[[Page 385]]

or 96, E168-67, 77, or 92, E169-63, 77, or 93 (incorporated by 
reference--see Sec. 60.17) shall be used to determine the percent VOC 
content in the process fluid that is contained in or contacts a piece of 
equipment.
    (2) Organic compounds that are considered by the Administrator to 
have negligible photochemical reactivity may be excluded from the total 
quantity of organic compounds in determining the VOC content of the 
process fluid.
    (3) Engineering judgment may be used to estimate the VOC content, if 
a piece of equipment had not been shown previously to be in service. If 
the Administrator disagrees with the judgment, paragraphs (d) (1) and 
(2) of this section shall be used to resolve the disagreement.
    (e) The owner or operator shall demonstrate that an equipment is in 
light liquid service by showing that all the following conditions apply:
    (1) The vapor pressure of one or more of the components is greater 
than 0.3 kPa at 20  deg.C (1.2 in. H<INF>2</INF>O at 68  deg.F). 
Standard reference texts or ASTM D2879-83, 96, or 97 (incorporated by 
reference--see Sec. 60.17) shall be used to determine the vapor 
pressures.
    (2) The total concentration of the pure components having a vapor 
pressure greater than 0.3 kPa at 20  deg.C (1.2 in. H<INF>2</INF>O at 68 
 deg.F) is equal to or greater than 20 percent by weight.
    (3) The fluid is a liquid at operating conditions.
    (f) Samples used in conjunction with paragraphs (d), (e), and (g) of 
this section shall be representative of the process fluid that is 
contained in or contacts the equipment or the gas being combusted in the 
flare.
    (g) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
standards of flares as follows:
    (1) Method 22 shall be used to determine visible emissions.

(incorporated by reference--see Sec. 60.17) shall be used to determine 
the concentration of sample component ``i.''
    (6) ASTM D2382-76 or 88 or D4809-95 (incorporated by reference--see

Sec. 60.488  Reconstruction.

    For the purposes of this subpart:
    (a) The cost of the following frequently replaced components of the 
facility shall not be considered in calculating either the ``fixed 
capital cost of the new components'' or the ``fixed capital costs that 
would be required to construct a comparable new facility'' under 
Sec. 60.15: pump seals, nuts and bolts, rupture disks, and packings.
    (b) Under Sec. 60.15, the ``fixed capital cost of new components'' 
includes the fixed capital cost of all depreciable components (except 
components specified in Sec. 60.488 (a)) which are or will be replaced 
pursuant to all continuous programs of component replacement which are 
commenced within any 2-year period following the applicability date for 
the appropriate subpart. (See the ``Applicability and designation of 
affected facility'' section of the appropriate subpart.) For purposes of 
this paragraph, ``commenced'' means that an owner or operator has 
undertaken a continuous program of component replacement or that an 
owner or operator has entered into a contractual obligation to undertake 
and complete, within a reasonable time, a continuous program of 
component replacement.

                            Coating Industry

    Source: 48 FR 38737, Aug. 25, 1983, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 60.490  Applicability and designation of affected facility.

    (a) The provisions of this subpart apply to the following affected 
facilities in beverage can surface coating lines: each exterior base 
coat operation, each overvarnish coating operation, and each inside 
spray coating operation.
    (b) The provisions of this subpart apply to each affected facility 
which is identified in paragraph (a) of this section and commences 
construction, modification, or reconstruction after November 26, 1980.


<R05>
Sec. 60.491  Definitions.

    (a) All terms which are used in this subpart and are not defined 
below are given the same meaning as in the Act and subpart A of this 
part.
    (1) Beverage can means any two-piece steel or aluminum container in 
which soft drinks or beer, including malt liquor, are packaged. The 
definition does not include containers in which fruit or vegetable 
juices are packaged.
    (2) Exterior base coating operation means the system on each 
beverage can surface coating line used to apply a coating to the 
exterior of a two-piece beverage can body. The exterior base coat 
provides corrosion resistance and a background for lithography or 
printing operations. The exterior base coat operation consists of the 
coating application station, flashoff area, and curing oven. The 
exterior base coat may be pigmented or clear (unpigmented).
    (3) Inside spray coating operation means the system on each beverage 
can surface coating line used to apply a coating to the interior of a 
two-piece beverage can body. This coating provides a protective film 
between the contents of the beverage can and the metal can body. The 
inside spray coating operation consists of the coating application 
station, flashoff area, and curing oven. Multiple applications of an 
inside spray coating are considered to be a single coating operation.

[[Page 392]]

    (4) Overvarnish coating operation means the system on each beverage 
can surface coating line used to apply a coating over ink which reduces 
friction for automated beverage can filling equipment, provides gloss, 
and protects the finished beverage can body from abrasion and corrosion. 
The overvarnish coating is applied to two-piece beverage can bodies. The 
overvarnish coating operation consists of the coating application 
station, flashoff area, and curing oven.
    (5) Two-piece can means any beverage can that consists of a body 
manufactured from a single piece of steel or aluminum and a top. 
Coatings for a two-piece can are usually applied after fabrication of 
the can body.
    (6) VOC content means all volatile organic compounds (VOC) that are 
in a coating. VOC content is expressed in terms of kilograms of VOC per 
liter of coating solids.
    (b) Notations used under Sec. 60.493 of this subpart are defined

Sec. 60.8(f) does not apply to the performance test procedures required 
by this subpart.

[[Page 393]]

    (b) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall conduct an 
initial performance test as required under Sec. 60.8(a) and thereafter a 
performance test each calendar month for each affected facility.
    (1) The owner or operator shall use the following procedures for 
each affected facility that does not use a capture system and a control 
device to comply with the emission limit specified under Sec. 60.492. 
The owner or operator shall determine the VOC-content of the coatings 
from formulation data supplied by the manufacturer of the coating or by 
an analysis of each coating, as received, using Method 24. The 
Administrator may require the owner or operator who uses formulation 
data supplied by the manufacturer of the coating to determine the VOC 
content of coatings using Method 24 or an equivalent or alternative 
method. The owner or operator shall determine from company records the 
volume of coating and the mass of VOC-solvent added to coatings. If a 
common coating distribution system serves more than one affected 
facility or serves both affected and exiting facilities, the owner or 
operator shall estimate the volume of coating used at each facility by 
using the average dry weight of coating, number of cans, and size of 
cans being processed by each affected and existing facility or by other 
procedures acceptable to the Administrator.
    (i) Calculate the volume-weighted average of the total mass of VOC 
per volume of coating solids used during the calendar month for each 
affected facility, except as provided under paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this 
section. The volume-weighted average of the total mass of VOC per volume 
of coating solids used each calendar month will be determined by the 
following procedures.
    (A) Calculate the mass of VOC used (M<INF>o</INF>+M<INF>d</INF>)

added to the coatings, as received.] where n is the number of different 
coatings used during the calendar month and m is the number of different 
diluent VOC-solvents used during the calendar month.

    (B) Calculate the total volume of coating solids used 
(L<INF>s</INF>) in the calendar month for the affected facility by the 
following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.059

where n is the number of different coatings used during the calendar 
month.

    (C) Calculate the volume-weighted average mass of VOC per volume of 
solids used (G) during the calendar month for the affected facility by 
the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.018

    (ii) Calculate the volume-weighted average of VOC emissions 
discharged to the atmosphere (N) during the calendar month for the 
affected facility by the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.061

    (iii) Where the value of the volume-weighted average mass of VOC per 
volume of solids discharged to the atmosphere (N) is equal to or less 
than the applicable emission limit specified under Sec. 60.492, the 
affected facility is in compliance.
    (iv) If each individual coating used by an affected facility has a 
VOC content equal to or less than the limit specified under Sec. 60.492, 
the affected facility is in compliance provided no VOC-solvents are 
added to the coating during distribution or application.
    (2) An owner or operator shall use the following procedures for each 
affected facility that uses a capture system and a control device that 
destroys VOC

[[Page 394]]

(e.g., incinerator) to comply with the emission limit specified under 
Sec. 60.492.
    (i) Determine the overall reduction efficiency (R) for the capture 
system and control device.

For the initial performance test, the overall reduction efficiency (R) 
shall be determined as prescribed in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) (A), (B), and 
(C) of this section. In subsequent months, the owner or operator may use 
the most recently determined overall reduction efficiency for the 
performance test providing control device and capture system operating 
conditions have not changed. The procedure in paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (A), 
(B), and (C) of this section, shall be repeated when directed by the 
Administrator or when the owner or operator elects to operate the 
control device or capture system at conditions different from the 
initial performance test.
    (A) Determine the fraction (F) of total VOC used by the affected 
facility that enters the control device using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.062

where H<INF>e</INF> an H<INF>h</INF> shall be determined by a method 
that has been previously approved by the Administrator. The owner or 
operator may use the values of S<INF>e</INF> and S<INF>h</INF> specified 
in Table 1 or other values determined by a method that has been 
previously approved by the Administrator.

    (a) The reference methods in appendix A to this part, except as 
provided in Sec. 60.8, shall be used to conduct performance tests.
    (1) Method 24, an equivalent or alternative method approved by the 
Administrator, or manufacturers' formulation data from which the VOC 
content of the coatings used for each affected facility can be 
calculated. In the event of a dispute, Method 24 data shall govern. When 
VOC content of water-borne coatings, determined from data generated by 
Method 24, is used to determine compliance of affected facilities, the 
results of the Method 24 analysis shall be adjusted as described in 
Section 12.6 of Method 24.
    (2) Method 25 or an equivalent or alternative method for the 
determination of the VOC concentration in the effluent gas entering and 
leaving the control device for each stack equipped with an emission 
control device. The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator at 
least 30 days in advance of any State test using Method 25. The 
following reference methods are to be used in conjunction with Method 
25:
    (i) Method 1 for sample and velocity traverses,
    (ii) Method 2 for velocity and volumetric flow rate,
    (iii) Method 3 for gas analysis, and
    (iv) Method 4 for stack gas moisture.
    (b) For Method 24, the coating sample must be a 1-litre sample 
collected in a 1-litre container at a point where the sample will be 
representative of the coating material.

[[Page 397]]

    (c) For Method 25, the sampling time for each of three runs must be 
at least 1 hour. The minimum sample volume must be 0.003 dscm except 
that shorter sampling times or smaller volumes, when necessitated by 
process variables or other factors, may be approved by the 
Administrator. The Administrator will approve the sampling of 
representative stacks on a case-by-case basis if the owner or operator 
can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the 
testing of representative stacks would yield results comparable to those 
that would be obtained by testing all stacks.

Sec. 60.503  Test methods and procedures.

    (a) In conducting the performance tests required in Sec. 60.8, the 
owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test 
methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as 
specified in this section, except as provided in Sec. 60.8(b). The 
three-run requirement of Sec. 60.8(f) does not apply to this subpart.
    (b) Immediately before the performance test required to determine 
compliance with Sec. 60.502 (b), (c), and (h), the owner or operator 
shall use Method 21 to monitor for leakage of vapor all potential 
sources in the terminal's vapor collection system equipment while a 
gasoline tank truck is being loaded. The owner or operator shall repair 
all leaks with readings of 10,000 ppm (as methane) or greater before 
conducting the performance test.
    (c) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
standards in Sec. 60.502 (b) and (c) as follows:
    (1) The performance test shall be 6 hours long during which at least 
300,000 liters of gasoline is loaded. If this is not possible, the test 
may be continued the same day until 300,000 liters of gasoline is loaded 
or the test may be resumed the next day with another complete 6-hour 
period. In the latter case, the 300,000-liter criterion need not be met. 
However, as much as possible, testing should be conducted during the 6-
hour period in which the highest throughput normally occurs.
    (2) If the vapor processing system is intermittent in operation, the 
performance test shall begin at a reference vapor holder level and shall 
end at the same reference point. The test shall include at least two 
startups and shutdowns of the vapor processor. If this does not occur 
under automatically controlled operations, the system shall be manually 
controlled.
    (3) The emission rate (E) of total organic compounds shall be 
computed using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.063

where:

E=emission rate of total organic compounds, mg/liter of gasoline loaded.
V<INF>esi</INF>=volume of air-vapor mixture exhausted at each interval 
``i'', scm.
C<INF>ei</INF>=concentration of total organic compounds at each interval 
``i'', ppm.
L=total volume of gasoline loaded, liters.
n=number of testing intervals.
i=emission testing interval of 5 minutes.

[[Page 400]]

K=density of calibration gas, 1.83x10<SUP>6</SUP> for propane and 
2.41x10<SUP>6</SUP> for butane, mg/scm.

    (4) The performance test shall be conducted in intervals of 5 
minutes. For each interval ``i'', readings from each measurement shall 
be recorded, and the volume exhausted (V<INF>esi</INF>) and the 
corresponding average total organic compounds concentration 
(C<INF>ei</INF>) shall be determined. The sampling system response time 
shall be considered in determining the average total organic compounds 
concentration corresponding to the volume exhausted.
    (5) The following methods shall be used to determine the volume 
(V<INF>esi</INF>) air-vapor mixture exhausted at each interval:
    (i) Method 2B shall be used for combustion vapor processing systems.
    (ii) Method 2A shall be used for all other vapor processing systems.
    (6) Method 25A or 25B shall be used for determining the total 
organic compounds concentration (C<INF>ei</INF>) at each interval. The 
calibration gas shall be either propane or butane. The owner or operator 
may exclude the methane and ethane content in the exhaust vent by any 
method (e.g., Method 18) approved by the Administrator.
    (7) To determine the volume (L) of gasoline dispensed during the 
performance test period at all loading racks whose vapor emissions are 
controlled by the processing system being tested, terminal records or 
readings from gasoline dispensing meters at each loading rack shall be 
used.
    (d) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
standard in Sec. 60.502(h) as follows:
    (1) A pressure measurement device (liquid manometer, magnehelic 
gauge, or equivalent instrument), capable of measuring up to 500 mm of 
water gauge pressure with <plus-minus>2.5 mm of water precision, shall 
be calibrated and installed on the terminal's vapor collection system at 
a pressure tap located as close as possible to the connection with the 
gasoline tank truck.
    (2) During the performance test, the pressure shall be recorded 
every 5 minutes while a gasoline truck is being loaded; the highest 
instantaneous pressure that occurs during each loading shall also be 
recorded. Every loading position must be tested at least once during the 
performance test.

emission limits as determined by the test methods and procedures in 
Sec. 60.534:
    (1) An affected facility equipped with a catalytic combustor shall 
not discharge into the atmosphere any gases which contain particulate 
matter in excess of a weighted average of 4.1 g/hr (0.009 lb/hr). 
Particulate emissions during any test run at any burn rate that is 
required to be used in the weighted average shall not exceed the value 
calculated for ``C'' (rounded to 2 significant figures) calculated using 
the following equation:

    (i) At burn rates less than or equal to 2.82 kg/hr (6.2 lb/hr),
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.019
    
Where:

BR = Burn rate in kg/hr (lb/hr)
K<INF>1</INF> = 3.55 g/kg (0.00355 lb/lb)
K<INF>2</INF> = 4.98 g/hr (0.0.011 lb/hr)

    (ii) At burn rates greater than 2.82 kg/hr (6.2 lb/hr), C = 15 g/hr 
(0.033 lb/hr).
    (2) An affected facility not equipped with a catalytic combustor 
shall not discharge into the atmosphere any gases which contain 
particulate matter in excess of a weighted average of 7.5 g/hr (0.017 
lb/hr). Particulate emissions shall not exceed 15 g/hr (0.033 lb/hr) 
during any test run at a burn rate less than or equal to 1.5 kg/hr (3.3 
lb/hr) that is required to be used in the weighted average and 
particulate emissions shall not exceed 18 g/hr (0.040 lb/hr) during any 
test run at a burn rate greater than 1.5 kg/hr (3.3 lb/hr) that is 
required to be used in the weighted average.

is replaced.
    (e)(1) The Administrator shall issue a certificate of compliance for 
a model line if he determines, based on all information submitted by the 
applicant and any other relevant information available to him, that:
    (i) A valid certification test has demonstrated that the wood heater 
representative of the model line complies with the applicable 
particulate emission limits in Sec. 60.532,
    (ii) Any tolerances or materials for components listed in paragraph 
(k) (2) or (3) of this section that are different

[[Page 405]]

from those specified in those paragraphs may not reasonably be 
anticipated to cause wood heaters in the model line to exceed the 
applicable emission limits, and
    (iii) The requirements of paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (m) of this 
section have been met. The program described under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) 
of this section shall be deemed a tolerance specified in the certified 
design.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (3) Upon denying certification under this paragraph, the 
Administrator shall give written notice to the manufacturer setting 
forth the basis for his determination.
    (f) To be valid, a certification test must be:
    (1) Announced to the Administrator in accordance with 
Sec. 60.534(e),
    (2) Conducted by a testing laboratory accredited by the 
Administrator pursuant to Sec. 60.535,
    (3) Conducted on a wood heater similar in all material respects to 
other wood heaters of the model line that is to be certified, and
    (4) Conducted in accordance with the test methods and procedures 
specified in Sec. 60.534.
    (g) To have a wood heater model certified under Sec. 60.533(e) to 
meet the emission limits in Sec. 60.532(b), a manufacturer must enter 
into a contract with the accredited laboratory that performed the 
certification test, under which the laboratory will:
    (1) Conduct the random compliance audit test at no cost to the 
manufacturer if EPA selects that laboratory to conduct the test, or
    (2) Pay the manufacturer the reasonable cost of a random compliance 
audit test (as determined by EPA) if EPA selects any other laboratory to 
conduct the test.
    (h) [Reserved]
    (i) An applicant for certification may apply for a waiver of the 
requirement to submit the results of a certification test pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section, if the wood heaters of the model line 
are similar in all material respects to another model line that has 
already been issued a certificate of compliance. A manufacturer that 
seeks a waiver of certification testing must identify the model line 
that has been certified, and must submit a copy of an agreement with the 
owner of the design permitting the applicant to produce wood heaters of 
that design.
    (j)(1) Unless revoked sooner by the Administrator, a certificate of 
compliance shall be valid:
    (i) [Reserved]
    (ii) For five years from the date of issuance, for a model line 
certified as meeting emission limits in Sec. 60.532(b).
    (2) Upon application for renewal of certification by the 
manufacturer, the Administrator may waive the requirement for 
certification testing upon determining that the model line continues to 
meet the requirements for certification in paragraph (e) of this 
section, or that a waiver of certification is otherwise appropriate.
    (3) Upon waiving certification testing under paragraph (j)(2) of 
this section, the Administrator shall give written notice to the 
manufacturer setting forth the basis for his determination.
    (k)(1) A model line must be recertified whenever any change is made 
in the design submitted pursuant to Sec. 60.533(b)(3) that is presumed 
to affect the particulate emission rate for that model line. The 
Administrator may waive this requirement upon written request by the 
manufacturer, if he determines that the change may not reasonably be 
anticipated to cause wood heaters in the model line to exceed the 
applicable emission limits. The granting of such a waiver does not 
relieve the manufacturer of any compliance obligations under this 
subpart.
    (2) Any change in the indicated tolerances of any of the following 
components (where such components are applicable) is presumed to affect 
particulate emissions if that change exceeds <plus-minus>0.64 cm 
(<plus-minus>\1/4\ inch) for any linear dimension and <plus-minus>5 
percent for any cross-sectional area relating to air introduction 
systems and catalyst bypass gaps unless other dimensions and cross-
sectional areas are previously approved by the Administrator under 
paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section:
    (i) Firebox: Dimensions,
    (ii) Air introduction systems: Cross-sectional area of restrictive 
air inlets, outlets, and location, and method of control,

[[Page 406]]

    (iii) Baffles: Dimensions and locations,
    (iv) Refractory/insulation: Dimensions and location,
    (v) Catalyst: Dimensions and location,
    (vi) Catalyst bypass mechanism and, for model lines certified to 
meet the emissions limits in Sec. 60.532(b), catalyst bypass gap 
tolerances (when bypass mechanism is in closed position): Dimensions, 
cross-sectional area, and location,
    (vii) Flue gas exit: Dimensions and location,
    (viii) Door and catalyst bypass gaskets: Dimensions and fit,
    (ix) Outer shielding and coverings: Dimensions and location,
    (x) Fuel feed system: For wood heaters that are designed primarily 
to burn wood pellets and other wood heaters equipped with a fuel feed 
system, the fuel feed rate, auger motor design and power rating, and the 
angle of the auger to the firebox, and
    (xi) Forced air combustion system: For wood heaters so equipped, the 
location and horsepower of blower motors and the fan blade size.
    (3) Any change in the materials used for the following components is 
presumed to affect emissions:
    (i) Refractory/insulation or
    (ii) Door and catalyst bypass gaskets.
    (4) A change in the make, model, or composition of a catalyst is 
presumed to affect emissions, unless the change has been approved in 
advance by the Administrator, based on test data that demonstrate that 
the replacement catalyst is equivalent to or better than the original 
catalyst in terms of particulate emission reduction.
    (l)(1) The Administrator may revoke certification if he determines 
that the wood heaters being produced in that model line do not comply 
with the requirements of this section or Sec. 60.532. Such a 
determination shall be based on all available evidence, including:
    (i) Test data from a retesting of the original unit on which the 
certification test was conducted,
    (ii) A finding that the certification test was not valid. The 
finding must be based on problems or irregularities with the 
certification test or its documentation, but may be supplemented by 
other information.
    (iii) A finding that the labeling of the wood heater does not comply 
with the requirements of Sec. 60.536,
    (iv) Failure by the manufacturer to comply with reporting and 
recordkeeping requirements under Sec. 60.537,
    (v) Physical examination showing that a significant percentage of 
production units inspected are not similar in all material respects to 
the representative affected facility submitted for testing, or
    (vi) Failure of the manufacturer to conduct a quality assurance 
program in conformity with paragraph (o) of this section.
    (2) Revocation of certification under this paragraph shall not take 
effect until the manufacturer concerned has been given written notice by 
the Administrator setting forth the basis for the proposed determination 
and an opportunity to request a hearing under Sec. 60.539.
    (3) Determination to revoke certification based upon audit testing 
shall be made only in accordance with paragraph (p) of this section.
    (m) A catalytic wood heater shall be equipped with a permanent 
provision to accommodate a commercially available temperature sensor 
which can monitor combustor gas stream temperatures within or 
immediately downstream [within 2.54 centimeters (1 inch)] of the 
combustor surface.
    (n) Any manufacturer of an affected facility subject under 
Sec. 60.530(b) to the applicable emission limits of this subpart that 
does not belong to a model line certified under this section shall cause 
that facility to be tested in an accredited laboratory in accordance 
with paragraphs (f) (1), (2), and (4) of this section before it leaves 
the manufacturer's possession and shall report the results to the 
Administrator.
    (o)(1) For each certified model line, the manufacturer shall conduct 
a quality assurance program which satisfies the following requirements:
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (o)(5) of this section, the 
manufacturer or his authorized representative shall inspect at least one 
from every 150 units produced within a model line to determine that the 
wood heater is

[[Page 407]]

within applicable tolerances for all components that affect emissions as 
listed in paragraph (k)(2) of this section.
    (3)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (o)(3)(iii) or (o)(5) of this 
section, the manufacturer or his authorized representative shall conduct 
an emission test on a randomly selected affected facility produced 
within a model line certified under Sec. 60.533 (e) or (h), on the 
following schedule:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   If weighted average          If yearly production per model is--

                           not to exceed once      triennially
                           every 10,000 stoves.    (whichever is more
                                                   frequent).
Within 30% of std.......  Every 5,000 stoves....  Every 5,000 stoves or
                                                   annually (whichever
                                                   is more frequent).
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) Emission tests shall be conducted in conformity with 
Sec. 60.534(a), using either approved method for measuring particulate 
matter (as provided in Sec. 60.534). The manufacturer shall notify EPA 
by U.S. mail that an emissions test required pursuant to this paragraph 
will be conducted within one week of the mailing of the notification.
    (iii) If the manufacturer stated pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of 
this section that the firebox or any firebox component would be composed 
of a different material than the material used in the wood heater on 
which certification testing was performed, the first test shall be 
performed before 1,000 wood heaters are produced. The manufacturer shall 
submit a report of the results of this emission test to the 
Administrator within 45 days of the completion of testing.
    (4) The manufacturer shall take remedial measures, as appropriate, 
when inspection or testing pursuant to paragraph (o) of this section 
indicates that affected facilities within the model line are not within 
applicable tolerances or do not comply with the applicable emission 
limit. Manufacturers shall record the problem identified, the extent of 
the problem, the remedial measures taken, and the effect of such 
remedial measures as projected by the manufacturer or determined by any 
additional testing.
    (5)(i) If two consecutive passing tests are conducted under either 
paragraph (o) (2) or (3) of this section, the required frequency of 
testing under the applicable paragraph shall be modified as follows: 
Skip every other required test.
    (ii) If five consecutive passing tests are conducted under the 
modified schedule provided for in Paragraph (o)(5)(i) of this section, 
the required frequency of testing under the applicable paragraph shall 
be further modified as follows: Skip three consecutive required tests 
after each required test that is conducted.
    (iii) Testing shall resume on the frequency specified in the 
paragraph (o) (2) or (3), as applicable, if a test failure results 
during any test conducted under a modified schedule.
    (6) If emissions tests under paragraph (o) of this section are 
conducted at an altitude different from the altitude at which 
certification tests were conducted, and are not conducted under 
pressurized conditions, the results shall be adjusted for altitude in 
accordance with paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section.
    (p)(1)(i) The Administrator shall after July 1, 1990, select for 
random compliance audit testing certified wood heater model lines that 
have not already been subject to a random compliance audit under this 
paragraph. The Administrator shall not select more than one model line 
under this program for every five model lines for which certification is 
granted under Sec. 60.533(e) to meet the emission limits in 
Sec. 60.532(b). No accredited laboratory shall test or bear the expense 
of testing, as provided in the contract described in paragraph (g) of 
this section, more than one model line from every five model lines 
tested by the laboratory for which certification was granted. The 
Administrator shall use a procedure that ensures that the selection 
process is random.
    (ii) The Administrator may, by means of a neutral selection scheme, 
select model lines certified under Sec. 60.533(e) or Sec. 60.533(h) for 
selective enforcement audit testing under this paragraph. Prior to July 
1, 1990, the Administrator shall only select a model line for a 
selective enforcement

[[Page 408]]

audit on the basis of information indicating that affected facilities 
within the model line may exceed the applicable emission limit in 
Sec. 60.532.
    (2) The Administrator shall randomly select for audit testing five 
production wood heaters from each model line selected under paragraph 
(p)(1) of this section. These wood heaters shall be selected from 
completed units ready for shipment from the manufacturer's facility 
(whether or not the units are in a package or container). The wood 
heaters shall be sealed upon selection and remain sealed until they are 
tested or until the audit is completed. The wood heaters shall be 
numbered in the order that they were selected.
    (3)(i) The Administrator shall test, or direct the manufacturer to 
test, the first of the five wood heaters selected under paragraph (p)(2) 
of this section in a laboratory accredited under Sec. 60.535 that is 
selected pursuant to paragraph (p)(4) of this section.
    (ii) The expense of the random compliance audit test shall be the 
responsibility of the wood heater manufacturer. A manufacturer may 
require the laboratory that performed the certification test to bear the 
expense of a random compliance audit test by means of the contract 
required under paragraph (g) of this section. If the laboratory with 
which the manufacturer had a contract has ceased business due to 
bankruptcy or is otherwise legally unable to honor the contract, the 
Administrator will not select any of that manufacturer's model lines for 
which certification testing has been conducted by that laboratory for a 
random compliance audit test.
    (iii) The test shall be conducted using the same test method and 
procedure used to obtain certification. If the certification test 
consisted of more than one particulate sampling test method, the 
Adminstrator may use either one of these methods for the purpose of 
audit testing. If the test is performed in a pressure vessel, air 
pressure in the pressure vessel shall be maintained within 1 percent of 
the average of the barometric pressures recorded for each individual 
test run used to calculate the weighted average emission rate for the 
certification test. The Administrator shall notify the manufacturer at 
least one week prior to any test under this paragraph, and allow the 
manufacturer and/or his authorized representatives to observe the test.
    (4)(i) Except as provided in this paragraph, the Administrator may 
select any accredited laboratory for audit testing.
    (ii)(A) The Administrator shall select the accredited laboratory 
that performed the test used to obtain certification for audit testing, 
until the Administrator has amended this subpart, based upon a 
determination pursuant to paragraph (p)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, to 
allow testing at another laboratory. If another laboratory is selected 
pursuant to this paragraph, and the overall precision of the test method 
and procedure is greater than <plus-minus>1 gram per hour 
(<plus-minus>0.0022 lb per hour) of the weighted average at laboratories 
below 304 meters (1,000 feet) elevation (or equivalent), the 
interlaboratory component of the precision shall be added to the 
applicable emissions standard for the purposes of this paragraph.
    (B) [Reserved]
    (iii) The Administrator shall not select an accredited laboratory 
that is located at an elevation more than 152 meters (500 feet) higher 
than the elevation of the laboratory which performed the test used to 
obtain certification, unless the audit test is performed in a pressure 
vessel.
    (5)(i) If emissions from a wood heater tested under paragraph (p)(3) 
of this section exceed the applicable weighted average emission limit by 
more than 50 percent, the Administrator shall so notify the manufacturer 
that certification for that model line is suspended effective 72 hours 
from the receipt of the notice, unless the suspension notice is 
withdrawn by the Administrator. The suspension shall remain in effect 
until withdrawn by the Administrator, or 30 days from its effective date 
(if a revocation notice under paragraph (p)(5)(ii) of this section is 
not issued within that period), or the date of final agency action on 
revocation, whichever occurs earlier.
    (ii)(A) If emissions from a wood heater tested under paragraph 
(p)(3) of this section exceed the applicable weighted average emission 
limit, the Administrator shall notify the manufacturer

[[Page 409]]

that certification is revoked for that model line.
    (B) A revocation notice under paragraph (p)(5)(ii)(A) shall become 
final and effective 60 days after receipt by the manufacturer, unless it 
is withdrawn, a hearing is requested under Sec. 60.539, or the deadline 
for requesting a hearing is extended.
    (C) The Administrator may extend the deadline for requesting a 
hearing for up to 60 days for good cause.
    (D) A manufacturer may extend the deadline for requesting a hearing 
for up to six months, by agreeing to a voluntary suspension of 
certification.
    (iii) Any notification under paragraph (p)(5)(i) or (p)(5)(ii) of 
this section shall include a copy of a preliminary test report from the 
accredited laboratory. The accredited laboratory shall provide a 
preliminary test report to the Administrator within 10 days of the 
completion of testing, if a wood heater exceeds the applicable emission 
limit in Sec. 60.532. The laboratory shall provide the Administrator and 
the manufacturer, within 30 days of the completion of testing, all 
documentation pertaining to the test, including the complete test report 
and raw data sheets, laboratory technician notes, and test results for 
all test runs.
    (iv) Upon receiving notification of a test failure under paragraph 
(p)(5)(ii) of this section, the manufacturer may submit some or all of 
the remaining four wood heaters selected under paragraph (p)(2) of this 
section for testing at his own expense, in the order they were selected 
by the Administrator, at the laboratory that performed the emissions 
test for the Administrator.
    (v) Whether or not the manufacturer proceeds under paragraph 
(p)(5)(iv) of this section, the manufacturer may submit any relevant 
information to the Administrator, including any other test data 
generated pursuant to this subpart. The manufacturer shall pay the 
expense of any testing performed for him.
    (vi) The Administrator shall withdraw any notice issued under 
paragraph (p)(5)(ii) of this section if tests under paragraph (p)(5)(iv) 
of this section show either--
    (A) That all four wood heaters tested for the manufacturer met the 
applicable weighted average emission limits, or
    (B) That the second and third wood heaters selected met the 
applicable weighted average emission limits and the average of all three 
weighted averages (including the original audit test) was below the 
applicable weighted average emission limits.
    (vii) The Administrator may withdraw any proposed revocation, if the 
Administrator finds that an audit test failure has been rebutted by 
information submitted by the manufacturer under paragraph (p)(5)(iv) of 
this section and/or (p)(5)(v) of this section or by any other relevant 
information available to him.
    (viii) Any withdrawal of a proposed revocation shall be accompanied 
by a document setting forth its basis.

Sec. 60.534  Test methods and procedures.

    Test methods and procedures in appendix A of this part, except as 
provided under Sec. 60.8(b), shall be used to determine compliance with 
the standards and requirements for certification under Secs. 60.532 and 
60.533 as follows:
    (a) Method 28 shall be used to establish the certification test 
conditions and the particulate matter weighted emission values.
    (b) Emission concentrations may be measured with either:
    (1) Method 5G, if a dilution tunnel sampling location is used, or
    (2) Method 5H, if a stack location is used.
    (c) Method 28A shall be used to determine that a wood combustion 
unit qualifies under the definition of wood heater in Sec. 60.531(a). If 
such a determination is necessary, this test shall be conducted by an 
accredited laboratory.
    (d) Appendix J is used as an optional procedure in establishing the 
overall thermal efficiency of wood heaters. (To be proposed separately.)
    (e)(1) The manufacturer of an affected facility shall notify the 
Administrator of the date that certification testing is scheduled to 
begin. (A notice

[[Page 410]]

from the testing lab containing the information required in 
Sec. 60.533(f)(1) may be used to satisfy this requirement.) This notice 
shall be at least 30 days before the start of testing. The notification 
of testing shall be in writing, and include the manufacturer's name and 
address, the testing laboratory's name, the model name and number (or, 
if unavailable, some other way to distinguish between models), and the 
dates of testing.
    (2) Any emission testing conducted on the wood heater for which 
notice was delivered shall be presumed to be certification testing if 
such testing occurs on or after the scheduled date of testing and before 
a test report is submitted to the Administrator. If certification 
testing is interrupted for more than 24 hours, the laboratory shall 
notify the Administrator by telephone, as soon as practicable, and also 
by letter, stating why the testing was interrupted and when it is 
expected to be resumed.
    (3) A manufacturer or laboratory may change the date that testing is 
scheduled to begin by notifying the Administrator at least 14 days 
before the start of testing. Notification of schedule change shall be 
made at least two working days prior to the originally scheduled test 
date. This notice of rescheduling shall be made by telephone or other 
expeditious means and shall be documented in writing and sent 
concurrently.
    (4) A model line may be withdrawn from testing before the 
certification test is complete, provided the wood heater is sealed in 
accordance with Sec. 60.535(g). The manufacturer shall notify the 
Administrator 30 days before the resumption of testing.
    (5) The manufacturer or laboratory shall notify the Administrator if 
a test is not completed within the time allotted as set forth in the 
notice of testing. The notification shall be made by the end of the 
allotted testing period by telephone or other expeditious means, and 
documented in writing sent concurrently, and shall contain the dates 
when the test will be resumed. Unless otherwise approved by the 
Administrator, failure to conduct a certification test as scheduled 
without notifying the Administrator of any schedule change 14 days prior 
to the schedule or revised test dates will result in voiding the 
notification. In the case of a voided notification, the manufacturer 
shall provide the Administrator with a second notification at least 30 
days prior to the new test dates. The Administrator may waive the 
requirement for advance notice for test resumptions.
    (f) The testing laboratory shall allow the manufacturer to observe 
certification testing. However, manufacturers shall not involve 
themselves in the conduct of the test after the pretest burn (as defined 
by EPA Method 28) has begun. Communications between the manufacturer and 
laboratory personnel regarding operation of the wood heater shall be 
limited to written communications transmitted prior to the first pretest 
burn of the certification series. Written communications between the 
manufacturer and laboratory personnel may be exchanged during the 
certification test only if deviations from the test procedures are 
observed that constitute improper conduct of the test. All 
communications shall be included in the test documentation required to 
be submitted under Sec. 60.533(b)(4) and shall be consistent with 
instructions provided in the owner's manual required under 
Sec. 60.536(k), except to the extent that they address details of the 
certification tests that would not be relevant to owners.

Sec. 60.539  Hearing and appeal procedures.

    (a)(1) In any case where the Administrator--
    (i) Denies an application under Sec. 60.530(c) or Sec. 60.533(e),
    (ii) Issues a notice of revocation of certification under 
Sec. 60.533(l),
    (iii) Denies an application for laboratory accreditation under 
Sec. 60.535, or
    (iv) Issues a notice of revocation of laboratory accreditation under 
Sec. 60.535(e), the manufacturer or laboratory affected may request a 
hearing under this section within 30 days following receipt of the 
required notification of the action in question.
    (2) In any case where the Administrator issues a notice of 
revocation under Sec. 60.533(p), the manufacturer may request a hearing 
under this section with the time limits set out in Sec. 60.533(p)(5).
    (b) Any hearing request shall be in writing, shall be signed by an 
authorized representative of the petitioning manufacturer or laboratory, 
and shall include a statement setting forth with particularity the 
petitioner's objection to the Administrator's determination or proposed 
determination.
    (c)(1) Upon receipt of a request for a hearing under paragraph (a) 
of this section, the Administrator shall request the Chief 
Administrative Law Judge to designate an Administrative Law Judge as 
Presiding Officer for the hearing. If the Chief Administrative Law Judge 
replies that no Administrative Law Judge is available to perform this

not had any prior responsibility for the matter under review, and who is 
not subject to the direct control or supervision of someone who has had 
such responsibility.
    (2) The hearing shall commence as soon as practicable at a time and 
place fixed by the Presiding Officer.
    (3)(i) A motion for leave to intervene in any proceeding conducted 
under this section must set forth the grounds for the proposed 
intervention, the position and interest of the movant and the likely 
impact that intervention will have on the expeditious progress of the 
proceeding. Any person already a party to the proceeding may file an 
answer to a motion to intervene, making specific reference to the 
factors set forth in the foregoing sentence and paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of 
this section within ten (10) days after service of the motion for leave 
to intervene.
    (ii) A motion for leave to intervene in a proceeding must ordinarily 
be filed before the first prehearing conference or, in the absence of a 
prehearing conference, prior to the setting of a time and place for a 
hearing. Any motion filed after that time must include, in addition to 
the information set forth in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, a 
statement of good cause for the failure to file in a timely manner. The 
intervenor shall be bound by any agreements, arrangements and other 
matters previously made in the proceeding.
    (iii) A motion for leave to intervene may be granted only if the 
movant demonstrates that his presence in the proceeding would not unduly 
prolong or otherwise prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the 
original parties, and that movant may be adversely affected by a final 
order. The intervenor shall become a full party to the proceeding upon 
the granting of leave to intervene.
    (iv) Persons not parties to the proceeding may move for leave to 
file amicus curiae briefs. The movant shall state his interest and the 
reasons why the proposed amicus brief is desirable. If the motion is 
granted, the Presiding Officer or Administrator shall issue an order 
setting the time for filing such brief. An amicus curia may participate 
in any briefing after his motion is granted, and shall be served with 
all briefs, reply briefs, motions, and orders relating to issues to be

    (5) All written statements, charts, tabulations, and similar data 
offered in evidence at the hearings shall, upon a showing satisfactory 
to the Presiding Officer of their authenticity, relevancy, and 
materiality, be received in evidence and shall constitute a part of the 
record.
    (h)(1) The Presiding Officer shall make an initial decision which 
shall include written findings and conclusions and the reasons or basis 
therefor on all the material issues of fact, law, or discretion 
presented on the record. The findings, conclusions, and written decision 
shall be provided to the parties and made a part of the record. The 
initial decision shall become the decision of the Environmental Appeals 
Board without further proceedings unless there is an appeal to the 
Environmental Appeals Board or motion for review by the Environmental 
Appeals Board. Except as provided in paragraph (h)(3) of this section, 
any such appeal shall be taken within 20 days of the date the initial 
decision was filed.
    (2) The Administrator delegates authority to the Environmental 
Appeals Board to issue final decisions in appeals filed under this 
section. An appeal directed to the Administrator, rather than to the 
Environmental Appeals Board, will not be considered. This delegation of 
authority to the Environmental Appeals Board does not preclude the 
Environmental Appeals Board from referring an appeal or a motion filed 
under this part to the Administrator for decision when the Environmental 
Appeals Board, in its discretion, deems it appropriate to do so. When an 
appeal or motion is referred to the Administrator, all parties shall be 
so notified and the rules in this section referring to the Environmental 
Appeals Board shall be interpreted as referring to the Administrator. On 
appeal from or review of the initial decision, the Environmental Appeals 
Board shall have all the powers that it would have in making the initial 
decision including the discretion to require or allow briefs, oral 
argument, the taking

[[Page 419]]

of additional evidence or the remanding to the Presiding Officer for 
additional proceedings. The decision by the Environmental Appeals Board 
shall include written findings and conclusions and the reasons or basis 
therefor on all the material issues of fact, law, or discretion 
presented on the appeal or considered in the review.

Sec. 60.541  Definitions.

    (a) All terms that are used in this subpart and are not defined 
below are given the same meaning as in the Act and in subpart A of this 
part.
    Bead means rubber-covered strands of wire, wound into a circular 
form, which ensure a seal between a tire and the rim of the wheel onto 
which the tire is mounted.
    Bead cementing operation means the system that is used to apply 
cement to the bead rubber before or after it is wound into its final 
circular form. A bead cementing operation consists of a cement 
application station, such as a dip tank, spray booth and nozzles, cement 
trough and roller or swab applicator, and all other equipment necessary 
to apply cement to wound beads or bead rubber and to allow evaporation 
of solvent from cemented beads.
    Component means a piece of tread, combined tread/sidewall, or 
separate sidewall rubber, or other rubber strip that is combined into 
the sidewall of a finished tire.
    Drying area means the area where VOC from applied cement or green 
tire sprays is allowed to evaporate.
    Enclosure means a structure that surrounds a VOC (cement, solvent, 
or spray) application area and drying area, and that captures and 
contains evaporated VOC and vents it to a control device. Enclosures may 
have permanent and temporary openings.
    Green tire means an assembled, uncured tire.
    Green tire spraying operation means the system used to apply a mold 
release agent and lubricant to the inside and/or outside of green tires 
to facilitate the curing process and to prevent rubber from sticking to 
the curing press. A green tire spraying operation consists of a booth 
where spraying is performed, the spray application station, and related 
equipment, such as the lubricant supply system.
    Michelin-A operation means the operation identified as Michelin-A in 
the Emission Standards and Engineering Division confidential file as 
referenced in Docket A-80-9, Entry II-B-12.
    Michelin-B operation means the operation identified as Michelin-B in 
the Emission Standards and Engineering Division confidential file as 
referenced in Docket A-80-9, Entry II-B-12.
    Michelin-C-automatic operation means the operation identifed as 
Michelin-C-automatic in the Emission Standards and Engineering Division 
confidential file as referenced in Docket A-80-9, Entry II-B-12.

35 days (utilizing a 4-4-5-week recordkeeping and reporting schedule).
    Organic solvent-based green tire spray means any mold release agent 
and lubricant applied to the inside or outside of green tires that 
contains more than 12 percent, by weight, of VOC as sprayed.
    Permanent opening means an opening designed into an enclosure to 
allow tire components to pass through the enclosure by conveyor or other 
mechanical means, to provide access for permanent mechanical or 
electrical equipment, or to direct air flow into the enclosure. A 
permanent opening is not equipped with a door or other means of 
obstruction of air flow.
    Sidewall cementing operation means the system used to apply cement 
to a continuous strip of sidewall component or any other continuous 
strip component (except combined tread/sidewall component) that is 
incorporated into the sidewall of a finished tire. A sidewall cementing 
operation consists of a cement application station and all other 
equipment, such as the cement supply system and feed and takeaway 
conveyors, necessary to apply cement to sidewall strips or other 
continuous strip component (except combined tread/sidewall component) 
and to allow evaporation of solvent from the cemented rubber.
    Temporary opening means an opening into an enclosure that is 
equipped with a means of obstruction, such as a door, window, or port, 
that is normally closed.
    Tire means any agricultural, airplane, industrial, mobile home, 
light-duty truck and/or passenger vehicle tire that has a bead diameter 
less than

[[Page 421]]

or equal to 0.5 meter (m) (19.7 inches) and a cross section dimension 
less than or equal to 0.325 m (12.8 in.), and that is mass produced in 
an assembly-line fashion.
    Tread end cementing operation means the system used to apply cement 
to one or both ends of the tread or combined tread/sidewall component. A 
tread end cementing operation consists of a cement application station 
and all other equipment, such as the cement supply system and feed and 
takeaway conveyors, necessary to apply cement to tread ends and to allow 
evaporation of solvent from the cemented tread ends.
    Undertread cementing operation means the system used to apply cement 
to a continuous strip of tread or combined tread/sidewall component. An 
undertread cementing operation consists of a cement application station 
and all other equipment, such as the cement supply system and feed and 
takeaway conveyors, necessary to apply cement to tread or combined 
tread/sidewall strips and to allow evaporation of solvent from the 
cemented tread or combined tread/sidewall.
    VOC emission control device means equipment that destroys or 
recovers VOC.
    VOC emission reduction system means a system composed of an 
enclosure, hood, or other device for containment and capture of VOC 
emissions and a VOC emission control device.
    Water-based green tire spray means any mold release agent and 
lubricant applied to the inside or outside of green tires that contains 
12 percent or less, by weight, of VOC as sprayed.

Sec. 60.543  Performance test and compliance provisions.

    (a) Section 60.8(d) does not apply to the monthly performance test 
procedures required by this subpart. Section 60.8(d) does apply to 
initial performance tests and to the performance tests specified under 
paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section. Section 60.8(f) does not 
apply when Method 24 is used.
    (b) Performance tests shall be conducted as follows:
    (1) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall conduct an 
initial performance test, as required under Sec. 60.8(a), except as 
described under paragraph (j) of this section. The owner or operator of 
an affected facility shall thereafter conduct a performance test each 
month, except as described under paragraphs (b)(4), (g)(1), and (j) of 
this section. Initial and monthly performance tests shall be conducted 
according to the procedures in this section.
    (2) The owner or operator of an affected facility who elects to use 
a VOC emission reduction system with a control device that destroys VOC 
(e.g., incinerator), as described under paragraphs (f) and (g) of this 
section, shall repeat the performance test when directed by the 
Administrator or when the owner or operator elects to operate the 
capture system or control device at conditions different from the most 
recent determination of overall reduction efficiency. The performance 
test shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures described 
under paragraphs (f)(2) (i) through (iv) of this section.
    (3) The owner or operator of an affected facility who seeks to 
comply with the equipment design and performance specifications, as 
described under paragraph (j) of this section, shall repeat the 
performance test when directed by the Administrator or when the owner or 
operator elects to operate the capture system or control device at

[[Page 424]]

conditions different from the most recent determination of control 
device efficiency or measurement of capture system retention time or 
face velocity. The performance test shall be conducted in accordance 
with the procedures described under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this 
section.
    (4) The owner or operator of each tread end cementing operation and 
each green tire spraying operation using only water-based sprays (inside 
and/or outside) containing less than 1.0 percent, by weight, of VOC is 
not required to conduct a monthly performance test as described in 
paragraph (d) of this section. In lieu of conducting a monthly 
performance test, the owner or operator of each tread end cementing 
operation and each green tire spraying operation shall submit 
formulation data or the results of Method 24 analysis annually to verify 
the VOC content of each tread end cement and each green tire spray 
material, provided the spraying formulation has not changed during the 
previous 12 months. If the spray material formulation changes, 
formulation data or Method 24 analysis of the new spray shall be 
conducted to determine the VOC content of the spray and reported within 
30 days as required under Sec. 60.546(j).
    (c) For each undertread cementing operation, each sidewall cementing 
operation, each green tire spraying operation where organic solvent-
based sprays are used, each Michelin-A operation, each Michelin-B 
operation, and each Michelin-C-automatic operation where the owner or 
operator seeks to comply with the uncontrolled monthly VOC use limits, 
the owner or operator shall use the following procedure to determine 
compliance with the applicable (depending upon duration of compliance 
period) uncontrolled monthly VOC use limit specified under 
Sec. 60.542(a) (1)(ii), (2)(ii), (6)(ii), (7)(iv), (8)(ii), (9)(ii), and 
(10)(ii). If both undertread cementing and sidewall cementing are 
performed at the same affected facility during a month, then the kg/mo 
limit specified under Sec. 60.542(a)(1)(ii) shall apply for that month.
    (1) Determine the density and weight fraction VOC (including 
dilution VOC) of each cement or green tire spray from its formulation or 
by analysis of the cement or green tire spray using Method 24. If a 
dispute arises, the Administrator may require an owner or operator who 
used formulation data to analyze the cement or green tire spray using 
Method 24.
    (2) Calculate the total mass of VOC used at the affected facility 
for the month (M<INF>o</INF>) by the following procedure:
    (i) For each affected facility for which cement or green tire spray 
is delivered in batch or via a distribution system that serves only the 
affected facility:

Where:

``a'' equals the number of different cements or green tire sprays used 
during the month that are delivered in batch or via a distribution 
system that serves only a single affected facility.

    (ii) For each affected facility for which cement or green tire spray 
is delivered via a common distribution system that also serves other 
affected or existing facilities:
    (A) Calculate the total mass of VOC used for all of the facilities 
served by the common distribution system for the month (M):

Where:

``b'' equals the number of different cements or green tire sprays used 
during the month that are delivered via a common distribution system 
that also serves other affected or existing facilities.

    (B) Determine the fraction (F<INF>o</INF>) of M used at the affected 
facility by comparing the production records and process specifications 
for the material cemented or sprayed at the affected facility for the 
month to the production records and process specifications for the 
material cemented or sprayed at all other facilities served by the 
common distribution system for the month or by another procedure 
acceptable to the Administrator.
    (C) Calculate the total monthly mass of VOC used at the affected 
facility for the month (M<INF>o</INF>):

(T<INF>d</INF>).
    (d) For each tread end cementing operation and each green tire 
spraying operation where water-based cements or sprays containing 1.0 
percent, by weight, of VOC or more are used (inside and/or outside) that 
do not use a VOC emission reduction system, the owner or operator shall 
use the following procedure to determine compliance with the VOC 
emission per tire limit specified under Sec. 60.542 (a)(3), (a)(5)(i),

procedure:
    (i) For a trend end cementing operation, T<INF>o</INF> equals the 
number of tread or combined tread/sidewall components that receive an 
application of tread end cement for the month.
    (ii) For a green tire spraying operation that uses water-based 
inside green tire sprays, T<INF>o</INF> equals the number of green tires 
that receive an application of water-based inside green tire spray for 
the month.
    (iii) For a green tire spraying operation that uses water-based 
outside green tire sprays, T<INF>o</INF> equals the number of green 
tires that receive an application of water-based outside green tire 
spray for the month.
    (4) Calculate the mass of VOC used per tire cemented or sprayed at 
the affected facility for the month (G):

    (e) For each bead cementing operation that does not use a VOC 
emission reduction system, the owner or operator shall use the following 
procedure to determine compliance with the VOC emission per bead limit 
specified under Sec. 60.542(a)(4).
    (1) Determine the density and weight fraction VOC as specified under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (2) Calculate the total mass of VOC used at the affected facility 
for the month (M<INF>o</INF>) as specified under paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section.

month.
    (4) Calculate the mass of VOC used per bead cemented at the affected 
facility for the month (G<INF>b</INF>):
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.065

    (5) Calculate the mass of VOC emitted per bead cemented at the 
affected facility for the month (N<INF>b</INF>):

    (f) For each tread end cementing operation and each bead cementing 
operation that uses a VOC emission reduction system with a control 
device that destroys VOC (e.g., incinerator), the owner or operator 
shall use the following procedure to determine compliance with the 
emission limit specified under Sec. 60.542(a) (3) and (4).
    (1) Calculate the mass of VOC used per tire cemented at the affected 
facility for the month (G), as specified under paragraphs (d) (1) 
through (4) of this section, or mass of VOC used per bead cemented at 
the affected facility for the month (G<INF>b</INF>), as specified under 
paragraphs (e) (1) through (4) of this section.
    (2) Calculate the mass of VOC emitted per tire cemented at the 
affected facility for the month (N) or mass of VOC emitted per bead 
cemented for the affected facility for the month (N<INF>b</INF>):

N = G (1-R)

For the initial performance test, the overall reduction efficiency (R) 
shall be determined as prescribed under paragraphs (f)(2) (i) through 
(iv) of this section. After the initial performance

[[Page 426]]

test, the owner or operator may use the most recently determined overall 
reduction efficiency (R) for the performance test. No monthly 
performance tests are required. The performance test shall be repeated 
during conditions described under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (i) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall construct a 
temporary enclosure around the application and drying areas during the 
performance test for the purpose of capturing fugitive VOC emissions. 
The enclosure must be maintained at a negative pressure to ensure that 
all evaporated VOC are measurable. Determine the fraction 
(F<INF>c</INF>) of total VOC used at the affected facility that enters 
the control device:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.040

Where:

``m'' is the number of vents from the affected facility to the control 
device, and ``n'' is the number of vents from the affected facility to 
the atmosphere and from the temporary enclosure.

    (ii) Determine the destruction efficiency of the control device (E) 
by using values of the volumetric flow rate of each of the gas streams 
and the VOC content (as carbon) of each of the gas streams in and out of 
the control device:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.041

Where:

``m'' is the number of vents from the affected facility to the control 
device, and ``p'' is the number of vents after the control device.

    (iii) Determine the overall reduction efficiency (R):

R = EF<INF>c</INF>

    (iv) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall have the 
option of substituting the following procedure as an acceptable 
alternative to the requirements prescribed under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of 
this section. This alternative procedure is acceptable only in cases 
where a single VOC is used and is present in the capture system. The 
average capture efficiency value derived from a minimum of three runs 
shall constitute a test.
    (A) For each run, ``i,'' measure the mass of the material containing 
a single VOC used. This measurement shall be made using a scale that has 
both a calibration and a readability to within 1 percent of the mass 
used during the run. This measurement may be made by filling the direct 
supply reservoir (e.g., trough, tray, or drum that is integral to the 
operation) and related application equipment (e.g., rollers, pumps, 
hoses) to a marked level at the start of the run and then refilling to 
the same mark from a more easily weighed container (e.g., separate 
supply drum) at the end of the run. The change in mass of the supply 
drum would equal the mass of material used from the direct supply 
reservoir. Alternatively, this measurement may be made by weighing the 
direct supply reservoir at the start and end of the run or by weighing 
the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the 
start and end of the run. The change in mass would equal the mass of the 
material used in the run. If only the direct supply reservoir is 
weighed, the amount of material in or on the related application 
equipment must be the same at the start and end of the run. All 
additions of VOC containing material made to the direct supply reservoir 
during a run must be properly accounted for in determining the mass of 
material used during that run.
    (B) For each run, ``i,'' measure the mass of the material containing 
a single VOC which is present in the direct supply reservoir and related 
application equipment at the start of the run, unless the ending weight 
fraction VOC in the material is greater than or equal to 98.5 percent of 
the starting weight fraction VOC in the material, in which case, this 
measurement is not required. This measurement may be made directly by 
emptying the direct supply reservoir and related application equipment 
and then filling them to a marked level from an easily weighed

[[Page 427]]

container (e.g. separate supply drum). The change in mass of the supply 
drum would equal the mass of material in the filled direct supply 
reservoir and related application equipment. Alternatively, this 
measurement may be made by weighing the direct supply reservoir and 
related application equipment at the start of the run and subtracting 
the mass of the empty direct supply reservoir and related application 
equipment (tare weight).
    (C) For each run, ``i,'' the starting weight fraction VOC in the 
material shall be determined by Method 24 analysis of a sample taken 
from the direct supply reservoir at the beginning of the run.
    (D) For each run, ``i,'' the ending weight fraction VOC in the 
material shall be determined by Method 24 analysis of a sample taken 
from the direct supply reservoir at the end of the run.
    (E) For each run, ``i,'' in which the ending weight fraction VOC in 
the material is greater than or equal to 98.5 percent of the starting 
weight fraction VOC in the material, calculate the mass of the single 
VOC used (Mi) by multiplying the mass of the material used in the run by 
the starting weight fraction VOC of the material used in the run.
    (F) For each run, ``i,'' in which the ending weight fraction VOC in 
the material is less than 98.5 percent of the starting weight fraction 
VOC in the material, calculate the mass of the single VOC used 
(M<INF>i</INF>) as follows:
    (1) Calculate the mass of VOC present in the direct supply reservoir 
and related application equipment at the start of the run by multiplying 
the mass of material in the direct supply reservoir and related 
application equipment at the start of the run by the starting weight 
fraction VOC in the material for that run.
    (2) Calculate the mass of VOC present in the direct supply reservoir 
and related application equipment at the end of the run by multiplying 
the mass of material in the direct supply reservoir and related 
application equipment at the end of the run by the ending weight 
fraction VOC in the material for that run. The mass of material in the 
direct supply reservoir and related application equipment at the end of 
the run shall be calculated by subtracting the mass of material used in 
the run from the mass of material in the direct supply reservoir and 
related application equipment at the start of the run.
    (3) The mass of the single VOC used (M<INF>i</INF>) equals the mass 
of VOC present in the direct supply reservoir and related application 
equipment at the start of the run minus the mass of VOC present in the 
direct supply reservoir and related application eqiupment at the end of 
the run.
    (G) If Method 25A is used to determine the concentration of the 
single VOC in the capture system, then calculate the capture efficiency 
(FC<INF>i</INF>) for each run, ``i,'' as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.042

Where:

C<INF>i</INF> = Average concentration of the single VOC in the capture 
system during run ``i'' (parts per million by volume) corrected for 
background VOC (see Sec. 60.547(a)(5)).
W = Molecular weight of the single VOC, mg/mg-mole (lb/lb-mole).
V = The volume occupied by one mole of ideal gas at standard conditions 
[20  deg.C, 760 mm Hg] on a wet basis, 2.405 x 10<SUP>-5</SUP> 
m<SUP>3</SUP>/mg-mole (385.3 ft<SUP>3</SUP>/lb-mole).
Q<INF>i</INF> = Volumetric flow in the capture system during run i, on a 
wet basis, adjusted to standard conditions, m<SUP>3</SUP> 
(ft<SUP>3</SUP>) (see Sec. 60.547(a)(5)).
10<SUP>6</SUP> = ppm per unity.
M<INF>i</INF> = Mass of the single VOC used during run i, mg (lb).

    (H) If Method 25 is used to determine the concentration of the 
single VOC in the capture system, then calculate the capture efficiency 
(FC<INF>i</INF>) for each run, ``i,'' as follows:

[[Page 428]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.043

Where: C<INF>i</INF> = Average concentration of the single VOC in the 
capture system during run ``i'' (parts per million, as carbon, by 
volume) corrected for background VOC (see Sec. 60.547(a)(5)).
W = Molecular weight of the single VOC, mg/mg-mole (lb/lb-mole).
V = The volume occupied by one mole of ideal gas at standard conditions 
[20  deg.C, 760 mm Hg] on a wet basis, 2.405 x 10<SUP>-5</SUP> 
m<SUP>3</SUP>/mg-mole (385.3 ft<SUP>3</SUP>/lb-mole).
Q<INF>i</INF> = Volumetric flow in the capture system during run i, on a 
wet basis, adjusted to standard conditions, m<SUP>3</SUP> 
(ft<SUP>3</SUP>) (see Sec. 60.547(a)(5)).
10<SUP>6</SUP> = ppm per unity.
M<INF>i</INF> = Mass of the single VOC used during run i, mg (lb).
NC = Number of carbon atoms in one molecule of the single VOC.

    (I) Calculate the average capture efficiency value, F<INF>c</INF> as 
follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.044

Where:

``n'' equals the number of runs made in the test (n [ge] 3). In cases 
where an alternative procedure in this paragraph is used, the 
requirements in paragraphs (f)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section remain 
unchanged.

    (g) For each undertread cementing operation, each sidewall cementing 
operation, each green tire spraying operation where organic solvent-
based sprays are used, each Michelin-A operation, each Michelin-B 
operation, and each Michelin-C-automatic operation that uses a VOC 
emission reduction system with a control device that destroys VOC (e.g., 
incinerator), the owner or operator shall use the following procedure to 
determine compliance with the percent emission reduction requirement 
specified under Sec. 60.542 (a) (1)(i), (2)(i), (6)(i), (7)(iii), 
(8)(i), (9)(i), and (10)(i).
    (1) For the initial performance test, the overall reduction 
efficiency (R) shall be determined as prescribed under paragraphs (f)(2) 
(i) through (iii) of this section. The performance test shall be 
repeated during conditions described under paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section. No monthly performance tests are required.
    (h) For each tread end cementing operation and each bead cementing 
operation that uses a VOC emission reduction system with a control 
device that recovers VOC (e.g., carbon adsorber), the owner or operator 
shall use the following procedure to determine compliance with the 
emission limit specified under Sec. 60.542(a) (3) and (4).
    (1) Calculate the mass of VOC used per tire cemented at the affected 
facility for the month (G), as specified under paragraphs (d) (1) 
through (4) of this section, or mass of VOC used per bead cemented at 
the affected facility for the month (G<INF>b</INF>), as specified under 
paragraphs (e) (1) through (4) of this section.
    (2) Calculate the total mass of VOC recovered from the affected 
facility for the month (M<INF>r</INF>):

               M<INF>r</INF> = L<INF>r</INF> D<INF>r</INF>

    (3) Calculate the overall reduction efficiency for the VOC emission 
reduction system (R) for the month:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.066

    (4) Calculate the mass of VOC emitted per tire cemented at the 
affected facility for the month (N) or mass of VOC emitted per bead 
cemeted at the affected facility for the month (N<INF>b</INF>):

[[Page 429]]

                               N = G (1-R)

                   N<INF>b</INF> = G<INF>b</INF> (1-R)

    (i) For each undertread cementing operation, each sidewall cemeting 
operation, each green tire spraying operation where organic solvent-
based sprays are used, each Michelin-A operation, each Michelin-B 
operation, and each Michelin-C-automatic operation that uses a VOC 
emission reduction system with a control device that recovers (VOC) 
(e.g., carbon adsorber), the owner or operator shall use the following 
procedure to determine compliance with the percent reduction requirement 
specified under Sec. 60.542(a) (1)(i), (2)(i), (6)(i), (7)(iii), (8)(i), 
(9)(i), and (10)(i).
    (1) Determine the density and weight fraction VOC as specified under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (2) Calculate the total mass of VOC used at the affected facility 
for the month (M<INF>o</INF>) as described under paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section.
    (3) Calculate the total mass of VOC recovered from the affected

    (j) Rather than seeking to demonstrate compliance with the 
provisions of Sec. 60.542(a) (1)(i), (2)(i), (6)(i), (7)(iii), or (9)(i) 
using the performance test procedures described under paragraphs (g) and 
(i) of this section, an owner or operator of an undertread cementing 
operation, sidewall cementing operation, green tire spraying operation 
where organic solvent-based sprays are used, or Michelin-B operation 
that use a VOC emission reduction system may seek to demonstrate 
compliance by meeting the equipment design and performance 
specifications listed under paragraphs (j)(1), (2), and (4) through (6) 
or under paragraphs (j)(1) and (3) through (6) of this section, and by 
conducting a control device efficiency performance test to determine 
compliance as described under paragraph (j)(7) of this section. The 
owner or operator shall conduct this performance test of the control 
device efficiency no later than 180 days after initial startup of the 
affected facility, as specified under Sec. 60.8(a). Meeting the capture 
system design and performance specifications, in conjunction with 
operating a 95 percent efficient control device, is an acceptable means 
of demonstrating compliance with the standard. Therefore, the 
requirement for the initial performance test on the enclosure, as 
specified under Sec. 60.8(a), is waived. No monthly performance tests 
are required.
    (1) For each undertread cementing operation, each sidewall cementing 
operation, and each Michelin-B operation, the cement application and 
drying area shall be contained in an enclosure that meets the criteria 
specified under paragraphs (j) (2), (4), and (5) of this section; for 
each green tire spraying operation where organic solvent-based sprays 
are used, the spray application and drying area shall be contained in an 
enclosure that meets the criteria specified under paragraphs (j) (3), 
(4), and (5) of this section.
    (2) The drying area shall be enclosed between the application area 
and the water bath or to the extent necessary to contain all tire 
components for at least 30 seconds after cement application, whichever 
distance is less.
    (3) Sprayed green tires shall remain in the enclosure for a minimum 
of 30 seconds after spray application.
    (4) A minimum face velocity of 30.5 meters (100 feet) per minute 
shall be maintained continuously through each permanent opening into the 
enclosure when all temporary enclosure openings are closed. The cross-
sectional area of each permanent opening shall be divided into at least 
12 equal areas, and a velocity measurement shall be performed at the 
centroid of each equal area with an anemometer or similar velocity 
monitoring device; the face velocity of each permanent opening is the 
average value of the velocity measurements taken. The monitoring device 
shall be calibrated and operated according to the manufacturer's 
instructions.

Temporary enclosure openings shall remain closed at all times except 
when worker access is necessary.
    (5) The total area of all permanent openings into the enclosure 
shall not

[[Page 430]]

exceed the area that would be necessary to maintain the VOC 
concentration of the exhaust gas stream at 25 percent of the lower 
explosive limit (LEL) under the following conditions:
    (i) The facility is operating at the maximum solvent use rate;
    (ii) The face velocity through each permanent opening is 30.5 meters 
(100 feet) per minute; and
    (iii) All temporary openings are closed.
    (6) All captured VOC are ducted to a VOC emission control device 
that is operated on a continuous basis and that achieves at least a 95 
percent destruction or recovery efficiency.
    (7) The efficiency of the control device (E) for the initial 
performance test is determined by using values of the volumetric flow 
rate of each of the gas streams and the VOC content (as carbon) of each 
of the gas streams in and out of the control device as described under 
paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section. The control device efficiency 
shall be redetermined during conditions specified under paragraph (b)(3) 
of this section.
    (k) Each owner or operator of an affected facility who initially 
elected to be subject to the applicable percent emission reduction 
requirement specified under Sec. 60.542(a)(1)(i), (2)(i), (6)(i), 
(7)(iii), (8)(i), (9)(i), or (10)(i) and who later seeks to comply with 
the applicable total (uncontrolled) monthly VOC use limit specified 
under Sec. 60.542(a)(1)(ii), (2)(ii), (6)(ii), (7)(iv), (8)(ii), 
(9)(ii), or (10)(ii) shall demonstrate, using the procedures described 
under paragraph (c) of this section, that the total VOC use at the 
affected facility has not exceeded the applicable total (uncontrolled) 
monthly VOC use limit during each of the last 6 months of operation. The 
owner or operator shall be subject to the applicable percent emission 
reduction requirement until the conditions of this paragraph and 
Sec. 60.546(h) are satisfied.
    (l) In determining compliance for each undertread cementing 
operation, each sidewall cementing operation, each green tire spraying 
operation, each Michelin-A operation, each Michelin-B operation, and 
each Michelin-C-automatic operation, the owner or operator shall include

Where: ``n'' equals the number of different cements or sprays used 
during the month.

    (ii) For each affected facility for which cement is delivered via a 
common distribution system which also serves other affected or existing 
facilities.
    (A) Calculate the total mass (M) of VOC used for all of the

Where: ``n'' equals the number of different cements or sprays used 
during the month.

    (B) Determine the fraction (F<INF>o</INF>) of ``M'' used by the 
affected facility by comparing the production records and process 
specifications for the material cemented at the affected facility for 
the month to the production records and process specifications for the 
material cemented at all other facilities

of undertread cement.
    (ii) For sidewall cementing, T<INF>o</INF> equals the number of 
sidewall components which receive an application of sidewall cement, 
divided by 2.

Sec. 60.547  Test methods and procedures.

    (a) The test methods in appendix A to this part, except as provided 
under Sec. 60.8(b), shall be used to determine compliance with 
Sec. 60.542(a) as follows:
    (1) Method 24 or formulation data for the determination of the VOC 
content of cements or green tire spray materials. In the event of 
dispute, Method 24 shall be the reference method. For Method 24, the 
cement or green tire spray sample shall be a 1-liter sample collected in 
a 1-liter container at a point where the sample will be representative 
of the material as applied in the affected facility.
    (2) Method 25 as the reference method for the determination of the 
VOC concentrations in each stack, both entering and leaving an emission 
control device. The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator at 
least 30 days in advance of any test by Method 25. For Method 25, the 
sampling time for each of three runs shall be at least 1 hour. Method 1 
shall be used to select the sampling site, and the sampling point shall 
be the centroid of the duct or at a point no closer to the walls than 
1.0 meter (3.3 feet). The minimum sample volume shall be 0.003 dry 
standard cubic meter (dscm) (0.11 dry standard cubic feet (dscf)) except 
that shorter sampling times or smaller volumes, when necessitated by 
process variables or other factors, may be approved by the 
Administrator.
    (3) Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D, as appropriate, as the reference method 
for determination of the flow rate of the stack gas. The measurement 
site shall be the same as for the Method 25 sampling. A velocity 
traverse shall be made once per run within the hour that the Method 25 
sample is taken.
    (4) Method 4 for determination of stack gas moisture.
    (5) Method 25 or Method 25A for determination of the VOC 
concentration in a capture system prior to a control device when only a 
single VOC is present (see Sec. 60.543 (f)(2)(iv)(G) and (f)(2)(iv)(H)). 
The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator at least 30 days in 
advance of any test by either Method 25 or Method 25A. Method 1 shall be 
used to select the sampling site and the sampling point shall be the 
centroid of the duct or at a point no closer to the walls than 1.0 meter 
(3.3 feet). Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D, as appropriate, shall be used as 
the test method for the concurrent determination of gas flow rate in the 
capture system.
    (i) For Method 25, the sampling time for each run shall be at least 
1 hour. For each run, a concurrent sample shall be taken immediately 
upwind of the application area to determine the background VOC 
concentration of air drawn into the capture system. Subtract this 
reading from the reading obtained in the capture system for that run. 
The minimum sample volume shall be 0.003 dry standard cubic meter (dscm) 
(0.11 dry standard cubic feet (dscf)) except that shorter sampling times 
or smaller volumes, when necessitated by process variable or other 
factors, may be approved by the Administrator. Use Method 3 to determine 
the moisture content of the stack gas.
    (ii) For Method 25A, the sampling time for each run shall be at 
least 1 hour. Instrument calibration shall be

[[Page 436]]

performed by the procedure given in Method 25A using the single VOC 
present in the capture system. A different calibration gas may be used 
if the results are corrected using an experimentally determined response 
factor comparing the alternative calibration gas to the single VOC used 
in the process. After the instrument has been calibrated, determine the 
background VOC concentration of the air drawn into the capture system 
immediately upwind of the application area for each run. The instrument 
does not need to be recalibrated for the background measurement. 
Subtract this reading from the reading obtained in the capture system 
for that run. The Method 25A results shall only be used in the 
alternative procedure for determination of capture efficiency described 
under Sec. 60.543(f)(2)(iv)(G).

         (VOC) Emissions from the Polymer Manufacturing Industry

    Source: 55 FR 51035, Dec. 11, 1990, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 60.560  Applicability and designation of affected facilities.

    (a) Affected facilities. The provisions of this subpart apply to 
affected facilities involved in the manufacture of polypropylene, 
polyethylene, polystyrene, or poly (ethylene terephthalate) as defined 
in Sec. 60.561 of this subpart. The affected facilities designated below 
for polypropylene and polyethylene are inclusive of all equipment used 
in the manufacture of these polymers, beginning with raw materials 
preparation and ending with product storage, and cover all emissions 
emanating from such equipment.
    (1) For process emissions from any polypropylene and polyethylene 
manufacturing process that uses a continuous process, the affected 
facilities are each of the following process sections: each raw 
materials preparation section, each polymerization reaction section, 
each material recovery section, each product finishing section, and each 
product storage section. These process sections are affected facilities 
for process emissions that are emitted continuously and for process 
emissions that are emitted intermittently.
    (2) For process emissions from polystyrene manufacturing processes 
that use a continuous process, the affected facilities are each material 
recovery section. These process sections are affected facilities for 
only those process emissions that are emitted continuously.
    (3) For process emissions from poly(ethylene terephthalate) 
manufacturing processes that use a continuous process, the affected 
facilities are each polymerization reaction section. If the process uses 
dimethyl terephthalate, then each material recovery section is also an 
affected facility. If the process uses terephthalic acid, then each raw 
materials preparation section is also an affected facility. These 
process sections are affected facilities for only those process 
emissions that are emitted continuously.
    (4) For VOC emissions from equipment leaks from polypropylene, 
polyethylene, and polystyrene (including expandable polystyrene) 
manufacturing processes, the affected facilities are each group of 
fugitive emissions equipment (as defined in Sec. 60.561) within any 
process unit (as defined in Sec. 60.561). This subpart does not apply to 
VOC emissions from equipment leaks from poly(ethylene terephthalate) 
manufacturing processes.
    (i) Affected facilities with a design capacity to produce less than 
1,000 Mg/yr (1,102 ton/yr) shall be exempt from Sec. 60.562-2.

[[Page 437]]

    (ii) Addition or replacement of equipment for the purposes of 
improvement which is accomplished without a capital expenditure shall 
not by itself be considered a modification under Sec. 60.562-2.
    (b) Applicability dates. The applicability date identifies when an 
affected facility becomes subject to a standard. Usually, a standard has 
a single applicability date. However, some polypropylene and 
polyethylene affected facilities have a September 30, 1987, 
applicability date and others have a January 10, 1989, applicability 
date. The following paragraphs identify the applicability dates for all 
affected facilities subject to this subpart.
    (1) Polypropylene and polyethylene. Each process section in a 
polypropylene or polyethylene production process is a potential affected 
facility for both continuous and intermittent emissions. The 
applicability date depends on when the process section was constructed, 
modified, or reconstructed and, in some instances, on the type of 
production process.
    (i) The applicability date for any polypropylene or polyethylene 
affected facility that is constructed, modified, or reconstructed after 
January 10, 1989, regardless of the type of production process being 
used, is January 10, 1989.
    (ii) Only some polypropylene or polyethylene process sections that 
are constructed, modified, or reconstructed on or before January 10, 
1989, but after September 30, 1987, are affected facilities. These 
process sections (and the type of emissions to be controlled) are 
identified by an ``x'' in Table 1. The applicability date for the 
process sections (and the emissions to be controlled) that are 
identified by an ``x'' in Table 1 is September 30, 1987. Since the 
affected facilities that have a September 30, 1987, applicability date 
are determined by the type of production process (e.g., liquid phase, 
gas phase), each owner or operator shall identify the particular 
production process that applies to his or her particular process.

<SUP>a</SUP> ``Uncontrolled emission rate'' refers to the emission rate of a vent
  stream that vents directly to the atmosphere and to the emission rate
  of a vent stream to the atmosphere that would occur in the absence of
  any add-on control devices but after any material recovery devices
  that constitute part of the normal material recovery operations in a
  process line where potential emissions are recovered for recycle or
  resale.
<SUP>b</SUP> Emission rate applies to continuous emissions only.
<SUP>c</SUP> Emission rate applies to intermittent emissions only.
<SUP>d</SUP> Total emission rate for non-emergency intermittent emissions from raw
  materials preparation, polymerization reaction, material recovery,
  product finishing, and product storage process sections.
<SUP>e</SUP> See footnote d.
<SUP>f</SUP> Emission rate applies to both continuous and intermittent emissions.
 <SUP>g</SUP> Emission rate applies to non-emergency intermittent emissions only.
 <SUP>h</SUP> Applies to modified or reconstructed affected facilities only.
 <SUP>i</SUP> Includes emissions from the cooling water tower.

[[Page 439]]

 
 <SUP>j</SUP> Applies to a process line producing low viscosity poly(ethylene
  terephthlalate).
 <SUP>k</SUP> Applies to a process line producing high viscosity poly(ethylene
  terephathalate).
 <SUP>l</SUP> See footnote m.
 <SUP>m</SUP> Applies to the sum of emissions to the atmosphere from the
  polymerization reaction section (including emissions from the cooling
  tower) and the raw materials preparation section (i.e., the
  esterifiers).

    (e)(1) Modified or reconstructed affected facilities at polystyrene 
and poly(ethylene terephthalate) plants with uncontrolled emission rates 
at or below those identified in Table 2 are exempt from the requirements 
of Sec. 60.562-1 unless and until its uncontrolled emission rate exceeds 
that rate listed for it in Table 2. This exemption does not apply to new 
polystyrene or poly(ethylene terephthalate) affected facilities.
    (2) Emissions from modified or reconstructed affected facilities 
that are controlled by an existing control device and that have 
uncontrolled emission rates greater than the uncontrolled threshold 
emission rates identified in Table 2 are exempt from the requirements of 
Sec. 60.562-1 unless and until the existing control device is modified, 
reconstructed, or replaced.
    (f) No process section of an experimental process line is considered 
an affected facility for continuous or intermittent process emissions.
    (g) Individual vent streams that emit continuous emissions with 
uncontrolled annual emissions of less than 1.6 Mg/yr (1.76 ton/yr) or 
with a weight percent TOC of less than 0.10 percent from a new, 
modified, or reconstructed polypropylene or polyethylene affected 
facility are exempt from the requirements of Sec. 60.562-1(a)(1). If at 
a later date, an individual stream's uncontrolled annual emissions 
become 1.6 Mg/yr (1.76 ton/yr) or greater (if the stream was exempted on 
the basis of the uncontrolled annual emissions exemption) or VOC 
concentration becomes 0.10 weight percent or higher (if the stream was 
exempted on the basis of the VOC concentration exemption), then the 
stream is subject to the requirements of Sec. 60.562-1.
    (h) Emergency vent streams, as defined in Sec. 60.561, from a new, 
modified, or reconstructed polypropylene or polyethylene affected 
facility are exempt from the requirements of Sec. 60.562-1(a)(2).
    (i) An owner or operator of a polypropylene or polyethylene affected 
facility that commenced construction, modification, or reconstruction 
after September 30, 1987, and on or before January 10, 1989, and that is 
in a process line in which more than one type of polyolefin (i.e., 
polypropylene, low density polyethylene, high density polyethylene, or 
their copolymers) is produced shall select one of the polymer/production 
process combinations in Table 1 for purposes of determining applicable 
affected facilities and uncontrolled threshold emissions rates.
    (j) Alternative means of compliance--(1) Option to comply with part 
65. Owners or operators may choose to comply with 40 CFR part 65, 
subpart G, for continuous process vents that are subject to this 
subpart, that choose to comply with Sec. 60.562-1(a)(1)(i)(A), (B), or 
(C) as allowed in Sec. 60.562-1(a)(1) and (b)(1)(iii). The requirements 
of 40 CFR part 65, subpart G, satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c) 
of this section and Secs. 60.563 through 60.566, except for 
Sec. 60.565(g)(1). Other provisions applying to owners or operators who 
choose to comply with 40 CFR part 65 are provided in 40 CFR 65.1.
    (2) Part 60, subpart A. Owners or operators who choose to comply 
with 40 CFR part 65, subpart G, must also comply with Secs. 60.1, 60.2, 
60.5, 60.6, 60.7(a)(1) and (4), 60.14, 60.15, and 60.16 for those 
process vents. All sections and paragraphs of subpart A of this part 
that are not mentioned in this paragraph (j)(2) do not apply to owners 
or operators of process vents complying with 40 CFR part 65, subpart G, 
except that provisions required to be met prior to implementing 40 CFR 
part 65 still apply. Owners and operators who choose to comply with 40 
CFR part 65, subpart G, must comply with 40 CFR part 65, subpart A.
    (3) Initial startup notification. Each owner or operator subject to 
the provisions of this subpart that chooses to comply with 40 CFR part 
65, subpart G, at initial startup shall notify the Administrator of the 
specific provisions of 40 CFR part 65, subpart G, with

[[Page 440]]

which the owner or operator has elected to comply. Notification shall be 
submitted with the notification of initial startup required by 40 CFR 
65.5(b).

    (Note: The numerical emission limits in these standards are 
expressed in terms of total organic compounds, measured as total organic 
compounds less methane and ethane.)

Sec. 60.561  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, all terms not defined herein shall have the 
meaning given them in the Act, in subpart A of part 60, or in subpart VV 
of part 60, and the following terms shall have the specific meanings 
given them.
    Boiler means any enclosed combustion device that extracts useful 
energy in the form of steam.
    Capital expenditure means, in addition to the definition in 40 CFR 
60.2, an expenditure for a physical or operational change to an existing 
facility that exceeds P, the product of the facility's replacement cost, 
R, and an adjusted annual asset guideline repair allowance, A, as 
reflected by the following equation: P = R x A, where
    (a) The adjusted annual asset guideline repair allowance, A, is the 
product of the percent of the replacement cost, Y, and the applicable 
basic annual asset guideline repair allowance, B, as reflected by the 
following equation: A = Y x (B / 100);
    (b) The percent Y is determined from the following equation: Y = 1.0 
- 0.57 log X, where X is 1986 minus the year of construction; and
    (c) The applicable basic annual asset guideline repair allowance, B, 
is equal to 12.5.
    Car-sealed means, for purposes of these standards, a seal that is 
placed on the device used to change the position of a valve (e.g., from 
opened to closed) such that the position of the valve cannot be changed 
without breaking the seal and requiring the replacement of the old seal 
once broken with a new seal.
    Closed vent system means a system that is not open to the atmosphere 
and that is composed of piping, connections, and, if necessary, flow 
inducing devices that transport gas or vapor from a piece or pieces of 
equipment to a control device.
    Continuous emissions means any gas stream containing VOC that is 
generated essentially continuously when the process line or any piece of 
equipment in the process line is operating.
    Continuous process means a polymerization process in which reactants 
are introduced in a continuous manner and products are removed either 
continuously or intermittently at regular intervals so that the process 
can be operated and polymers produced essentially continuously.
    Control device means an enclosed combustion device, vapor recovery 
system, or flare.
    Copolymer means a polymer that has two different repeat units in its 
chain.
    Decomposition means, for the purposes of these standards, an event 
in a polymerization reactor that advances to the point where the 
polymerization reaction becomes uncontrollable, the polymer begins to 
break down (decompose), and it becomes necessary to relieve the reactor 
instantaneously in order to avoid catastrophic equipment damage or 
serious adverse personnel safety consequences.
    Decomposition emissions refers to those emissions released from a 
polymer production process as the result of a decomposition or during 
attempts to prevent a decomposition.
    Emergency vent stream means, for the purposes of these standards, an 
intermittent emission that results from a decomposition, attempts to 
prevent decompositions, power failure, equipment failure, or other 
unexpected cause that requires immediate venting of gases from process 
equipment in order to avoid safety hazards or equipment damage. This 
includes intermittent vents that occur from process equipment where 
normal operating parameters (e.g., pressure or temperature) are exceeded 
such that the process equipment can not be returned to normal operating 
conditions using the design features of the system and venting must 
occur to avoid equipment failure or adverse safety personnel 
consequences and to minimize adverse effects of the runaway reaction. 
This does not include intermittent vents

[[Page 441]]

that are designed into the process to maintain normal operating 
conditions of process vessels including those vents that regulate normal 
process vessel pressure.
    End finisher means a polymerization reaction vessel operated under 
very low pressures, typically at pressures of 2 mm Hg (1 in. 
H<INF>2</INF>O) or less, in order to produce high viscosity 
poly(ethylene terephthalate). An end finisher is preceded in a high 
viscosity poly(ethylene terephthalate) process line by one or more 
polymerization vessels operated under less severe vacuums, typically 
between 5 and 10 mm Hg (3 and 5 in. H<INF>2</INF>O). A high viscosity 
poly(ethylene terephthalate) process line may have one or more end 
finishers.
    Existing control device means, for the purposes of these standards, 
an air pollution control device that has been in operation on or before 
September 30, 1987, or that has been in operation between September 30, 
1987, and January 10, 1989, on those continuous or intermittent 
emissions from a process section that is marked by an ``--'' in Table 1 
of this subpart.
    Existing control device is reconstructed means, for the purposes of 
these standards, the capital expenditure of at least 50 percent of the 
replacement cost of the existing control device.
    Existing control device is replaced means, for the purposes of these 
standards, the replacement of an existing control device with another 
control device.

agent has been added using either an in-situ suspension process or a 
post-impregnation suspension process.
    Experimental process line means a polymer or copolymer manufacturing 
process line with the sole purpose of operating to evaluate polymer 
manufacturing processes, technologies, or products. An experimental 
process line does not produce a polymer or resin that is sold or that is 
used as a raw material for nonexperimental process lines.
    Flame zone means that portion of the combustion chamber in a boiler 
occupied by the flame envelope.
    Fugitive emissions equipment means each pump, compressor, pressure 
relief device, sampling connection system, open-ended valve or line, 
valve, and flange or other connector in VOC service and any devices or 
systems required by subpart VV of this part.
    Gas phase process means a polymerization process in which the 
polymerization reaction is carried out in the gas phase; i.e., the 
monomer(s) are gases in a fluidized bed of catalyst particles and 
granular polymer.
    High density polyethylene (HDPE) means a thermoplastic polymer or 
copolymer comprised of at least 50 percent ethylene by weight and having 
a density of greater than 0.940 gm/cm\3\3 (58.7 lb/ft\3\).
    High pressure process means the conventional production process for 
the manufacture of low density polyethylene in which a reaction pressure 
of about 15,000 psig (103,000 kPa gauge) or greater is used.
    High viscosity poly(ethylene terephthalate) means poly(ethylene 
terephthalate) that has an intrinsic viscosity of 0.9 or higher and is 
used in such applications as tire cord and seat belts.
    Incinerator means an enclosed combustion device that is used for 
destroying VOC.
    In-situ suspension process means a manufacturing process in which 
styrene, blowing agent, and other raw materials are added together 
within a reactor for the production of expandable polystyrene.
    Intermittent emissions means those gas streams containing VOC that 
are generated at intervals during process line operation and includes 
both planned and emergency releases.
    Liquid phase process means a polymerization process in which the 
polymerization reaction is carried out in the liquid phase; i.e., the 
monomer(s) and any catalyst are dissolved, or suspended in a liquid 
solvent.
    Liquid phase slurry process means a liquid phase polymerization 
process in which the monomer(s) are in solution (completely dissolved) 
in a liquid solvent, but the polymer is in the form of solid particles 
suspended in the liquid reaction mixture during the polymerization 
reaction; sometimes called a particle form process.

[[Page 442]]

    Liquid phase solution process means a liquid phase polymerization 
process in which both the monomer(s) and polymer are in solution 
(completely dissolved) in the liquid reaction mixture.
    Low density polyethylene (LDPE) means a thermoplastic polymer or 
copolymer comprised of at least 50 percent ethylene by weight and having 
a density of 0.940 g/cm\3\ (58.7 lb/ft\3\) or less.

of low density polyethylene in which a reaction pressure markedly below 
that used in a high pressure process is used. Reaction pressure of 
current low pressure processes typically go up to about 300 psig (2,070 
kPa gauge).
    Low viscosity poly(ethylene terephthalate) means a poly(ethylene 
terephthalate) that has an intrinsic viscosity of less than 0.75 and is 
used in such applications as clothing, bottle, and film production.
    Material recovery section means the equipment that recovers 
unreacted or by-product materials from any process section for return to 
the process line, off-site purification or treatment, or sale. Equipment 
designed to separate unreacted or by-product material from the polymer 
product are to be included in this process section, provided at least 
some of the material is recovered for reuse in the process, off-site 
purification or treatment, or sale, at the time the process section 
becomes an affected facility. Otherwise such equipment are to be 
assigned to one of the other process sections, as appropriate. Equipment 
that treats recovered materials are to be included in this process 
section, but equipment that also treats raw materials are not to be 
included in this process section. The latter equipment are to be 
included in the raw materials preparation section. If equipment is used 
to return unreacted or by-product material directly to the same piece of 
process equipment from which it was emitted, then that equipment is 
considered part of the process section that contains the process 
equipment. If equipment is used to recover unreacted or by-product 
material from a process section and return it to another process section 
or a different piece of process equipment in the same process section or 
sends it off-site for purification, treatment, or sale, then such 
equipment are considered part of a material recovery section. Equipment 
used for the on-site recovery of ethylene glycol from poly(ethylene 
terephthalate) plants, however, are not included in the material 
recovery section, but are covered under the standards applicable to the 
polymerization reaction section (Sec. 60.562-1(c)(1)(ii)(A) or 
(2)(ii)(A)).
    Operating day means, for the purposes of these standards, any 
calendar day during which equipment used in the manufacture of polymer 
was operating for at least 8 hours or one labor shift, whichever is 
shorter. Only operating days shall be used in determining compliance 
with the standards specified in Sec. 60.562-1(c)(1)(ii)(B), (1)(ii)(C), 
(2)(ii)(B), and (2)(ii)(C). Any calendar day in which equipment is used 
for less than 8 hours or one labor shift, whichever is less, is not an 
``operating day'' and shall not be used as part of the rolling 14-day 
period for determining compliance with the standards specified in 
Sec. 60.562-1(c)(1)(ii)(B), (1)(ii)(C), (2)(ii)(B), and (2)(ii)(C).
    Polyethylene means a thermoplastic polymer or copolymer comprised of 
at least 50 percent ethylene by weight; see low density polyethylene and 
high density polyethylene.
    Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) means a polymer or copolymer 
comprised of at least 50 percent bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-terephthalate 
(BHET) by weight.
    Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) manufacture using dimethyl 
terephthalate means the manufacturing of poly(ethylene terephthalate) 
based on the esterification of dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) with 
ethylene glycol to form the intermediate monomer bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-
terephthalate (BHET) that is subsequently polymerized to form PET.
    Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) manufacture using terephthalic 
acid means the manufacturing of poly(ethylene terephthalate) based on 
the esterification reaction of terephthalic acid (TPA) with ethylene 
glycol to form the intermediate monomer bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-
terephthalate (BHET) that is subsequently polymerized to form PET.

[[Page 443]]

    Polymerization reaction section means the equipment designed to 
cause monomer(s) to react to form polymers, including equipment designed 
primarily to cause the formation of short polymer chains (oligomers or 
low polymers), but not including equipment designed to prepare raw 
materials for polymerization, e.g., esterification vessels. For the 
purposes of these standards, the polymerization reaction section begins 
with the equipment used to transfer the materials from the raw materials 
preparation section and ends with the last vessel in which 
polymerization occurs. Equipment used for the on-site recovery of 
ethylene glycol from poly(ethylene terephthalate) plants, however, are 
included in this process section, rather than in the material recovery 
process section.
    Polypropylene (PP) means a thermoplastic polymer or copolymer 
comprised of at least 50 percent propylene by weight.
    Polystyrene (PS) means a thermoplastic polymer or copolymer 
comprised of at least 80 percent styrene or para-methylstyrene by 
weight.
    Post-impregnation suspension process means a manufacturing process 
in which polystyrene beads are first formed in a suspension process, 
washed, dried, or otherwise finished and then added with a blowing agent 
to another reactor in which the beads and blowing agent are reacted to 
produce expandable polystyrene.
    Process heater means a device that transfers heat liberated by 
burning fuel to fluids contained in tubular coils, including all fluids 
except water that is heated to produce steam.
    Process line means a group of equipment assembled that can operate 
independently if supplied with sufficient raw materials to produce 
polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene, (general purpose, crystal, or 
expandable) or poly(ethylene terephthalate) or one of their copolymers. 
A process line consists of the equipment in the following process 
sections (to the extent that these process sections are present at a 
plant): raw materials preparation, polymerization reaction, product 
finishing, product storage, and material recovery.
    Process section means the equipment designed to accomplish a general 
but well-defined task in polymer production. Process sections include 
raw materials preparation, polymerization reaction, material recovery, 
product finishing, and product storage and may be dedicated to a single 
process line or common to more than one process line.
    Process unit means equipment assembled to perform any of the 
physical and chemical operations in the production of polypropylene, 
polyethylene, polystyrene, (general purpose, crystal, or expandable), or 
poly(ethylene terephthalate) or one of their copolymers. A process unit 
can operate independently if supplied with sufficient feed or raw 
materials and sufficient storage facilities for the product. Examples of 
process units are raw materials handling and monomer recovery.
    Product finishing section means the equipment that treats, shapes, 
or modifies the polymer or resin to produce the finished end product of 
the particular facility, including equipment that prepares the product 
for product finishing. For the purposes of these standards, the product 
finishing section begins with the equipment used to transfer the 
polymerized product from the polymerization reaction section and ends 
with the last piece of equipment that modifies the characteristics of 
the polymer. Product finishing equipment may accomplish product 
separation, extruding and pelletizing, cooling and drying, blending, 
additives introduction, curing, or annealing. Equipment used to separate 
unreacted or by-product material from the product are to be included in 
this process section, provided the material separated from the polymer 
product is not recovered at the time the process section becomes an 
affected facility. If the material is being recovered, then the 
separation equipment are to be included in the material recovery 
section. Product finishing does not include polymerization, the physical 
mixing of the pellets to obtain a homogenous mixture of the polymer 
(except as noted below), or the shaping (such as fiber spinning, 
molding, or fabricating) or modification (such as fiber stretching and 
crimping) of the finished end product. If physical

[[Page 444]]

mixing occurs in equipment located between product finishing equipment 
(i.e., before all the chemical and physical characteristics have been 
``set'' by virtue of having passed through the last piece of equipment 
in the product finishing section), then such equipment are to be 
included in this process section. Equipment used to physically mix the 
finished product that are located after the last piece of equipment in 
the product finishing section are part of the product storage section.
    Product storage section means the equipment that is designed to 
store the finished polymer or resin end product of the particular 
facility. For the purposes of these standards, the product storage 
section begins with the equipment used to transfer the finished product 
out of the product finishing section and ends with the containers used 
to store the final product. Any equipment used after the product 
finishing section to recover unreacted or by-product material are to be 
considered part of a material recovery section. Product storage does not 
include any intentional modification of the characteristics of any 
polymer or resin product, but does include equipment that provide a 
uniform mixture of product, provided such equipment are used after the 
last product finishing piece of equipment. This process section also 
does not include the shipment of a finished polymer or resin product to 
another facility for further finishing or fabrication.
    Raw materials preparation section means the equipment located at a 
polymer manufacturing plant designed to prepare raw materials, such as 
monomers and solvents, for polymerization. For the purposes of these 
standards, this process section begins with the equipment used to 
transfer raw materials from storage and recovered material from material 
recovery process sections, and ends with the last piece of equipment 
that prepares the material for polymerization. The raw materials 
preparation section may include equipment that accomplishes 
purification, drying, or other treatment of raw materials or of raw and 
recovered materials together, activation of catalysts, and 
esterification including the formation of some short polymer chains 
(oligomers), but does not include equipment that is designed primarily 
to accomplish the formation of oligomers, the treatment of recovered 
materials alone, or the storage of raw materials.
    Recovery system means an individual unit or series of material 
recovery units, such as absorbers, condensers, and carbon adsorbers, 
used for recovering volatile organic compounds.
    Total organic compounds (TOC) means those compounds measured 
according to the procedures specified in Sec. 60.564.
    Vent stream means any gas stream released to the atmosphere directly 
from an emission source or indirectly either through another piece of 
process equipment or a material recovery device that constitutes part of 
the normal recovery operations in a polymer process line where potential 
emissions are recovered for recycle or resale, and any gas stream 
directed to an air pollution control device. The emissions released from 
an air pollution control device are not considered a vent stream unless, 
as noted above, the control device is part of the normal material 
recovery operations in a polymer process line where potential emissions 
are recovered for recycle or resale.
    Volatile organic compounds (VOC) means, for the purposes of these 
standards, any reactive organic compounds as defined in Sec. 60.2 
Definitions.

Sec. 60.562-1  Standards: Process     emissions.

    (a) Polypropylene, low density polyethylene, and high density 
polyethylene. Each owner or operator of a polypropylene, low density 
polyethylene, or high density polyethylene process line containing a 
process section subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply 
with the provisions in this section on and after the date on which the 
initial performance test required by Sec. 60.8 is completed, but not 
later than 60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which 
the affected facility will be operated, or 180 days after initial 
startup whichever comes first.

[[Page 445]]

    (1) Continuous emissions. For each vent stream that emits continuous 
emissions from an affected facility as defined in Sec. 60.560(a)(1), the 
owner or operator shall use the procedures identified in paragraphs 
(a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section for determining which continuous 
emissions are to be controlled and which level of control listed in 
paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is to be met. The owner or operator 
shall use the procedures identified in paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) 
of this section each time a process section is constructed, modified, or 
reconstructed at the plant site.
    (i) Level of control Continuous emission streams determined to be 
subject to control pursuant to the procedures identified in paragraphs 
(a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section, as applicable, shall meet one of 
the control levels identified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) (A) through (D) of 
this section. The procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this 
section identify which level of control may be met. The level of control 
identified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(D) of this section is limited to 
certain continuous emission streams, which are identified through the 
procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section.
    (A) Reduce emissions of total organic compounds (minus methane and 
ethane) (TOC) by 98 weight percent, or to a concentration of 20 parts 
per million by volume (ppmv) on a dry basis, whichever is less 
stringent. The TOC is expressed as the sum of the actual compounds, not 
carbon equivalents. If an owner or operator elects to comply with the 20 
ppmv standard, the concentration shall include a correction to 3 percent 
oxygen only when supplemental combustion air is used to combust the vent 
stream.
    (B) Combust the emissions in a boiler or process heater with a 
design heat input capacity of 150 million Btu/hour or greater by 
introducing the vent stream into the flame zone of the boiler or process 
heater. (Note: A boiler or process heater of lesser design heat capacity 
may be used, but must demonstrate compliance with paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) 
of this section.)
    (C) Combust the emissions in a flare that meets the conditions 
specified in Sec. 60.18. If the flare is used to control both continuous 
and intermittent emissions, the flare shall meet the conditions 
specified in Sec. 60.18 at all times (i.e., which controlling continuous 
emissions alone or when controlling both continuous and intermittent 
emissions).
    (D) Vent the emissions to a control device located on the plant 
site.
    (ii) Uncontrolled Continuous Emissions. For each vent stream that 
emits continuous emissions from an affected facility as defined in 
Sec. 60.560(a)(1) and that is not controlled in an existing control 
device, the owner or operator shall use the procedures identified in 
Table 3 to identify those continuous emissions from each constructed, 
modified, or reconstructed affected facility that are to be controlled. 
The owner shall include in the procedure all uncontrolled continuous 
vent streams from previously constructed, modified, or reconstructed 
affected facilities at the plant site each time a process section is 
constructed, modified, or reconstructed at the plant site. In applying 
the procedures shown in Table 3, the stream characteristics may be 
either measured or calculated as specified in Sec. 60.564(d). For 
modified or reconstructed affected facilities, these stream 
characteristics are to be determined after a modification or 
reconstruction determination has been made by the Administrator, but 
before any actual changes have been undertaken, and then again after the 
actual changes have been made. Figure 1 provides a summary overview of 
the control determination procedure described in Table 3.

    (iii) Controlled Continuous Emissions. For each vent stream that 
emits continuous emissions from an affected facility as defined in 
Sec. 60.560(a)(1) and that is controlled in an existing control device, 
each owner or operator shall determine whether the emissions entering 
the control device are greater

[[Page 449]]

than or equal to the calculated threshold emissions (CTE) level, which 
is to be calculated using the TOC concentration of the inlet vent stream 
and the equations in footnote b of Table 3. If the inlet stream's TOC 
concentration is equal to or greater than 20 weight percent, the 
calculated threshold emissions level is 18.2 Mg/yr (20.1 ton/yr). If 
multiple emission streams are vented to the control device, the 
individual streams are not to be separated into individual weight 
percent ranges for calculation purposes as would be done for 
uncontrolled emission streams. Emissions vented to an existing control 
device are required to be controlled as described in paragraphs 
(a)(1)(iii) (A) and (B) of this section. Figure 2 illustrates the 
control determination procedure for controlled continuous emissions.

[[Page 450]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.049

    (A) If the annual emissions of the stream entering the control 
device are equal to or greater than the CTE levels, then compliance with 
one of the requirements identified in Sec. 60.562-1(a)(1)(i) (A), (B), 
or (C) is required at such time the control device is reconstructed or 
replaced or has its operating conditions modified as a result of State 
or local regulations (including changes in the operating permit) 
including those instances where the control device is reconstructed, 
replaced, or modified in its operation at the same time the existing 
process section

[[Page 451]]

is modified or reconstructed and becomes an affected facility. If the 
existing control device already complies with one of the requirements 
identified in Sec. 60.562-1(a)(1)(i) (A), (B), or (C), no further 
control is required.
    (B) If the annual emissions of the stream entering the control 
device are less than the CTE level, then the requirements of 
Sec. 60.562-1(a)(1)(i) (A), (B), or (C) are not applicable at that time. 
However, if the control device is replaced, reconstructed, or modified 
at a later date, each owner or operator shall reevaluate the 
applicability of these standards. This is done by combining with the 
vent stream entering the control device any uncontrolled vent streams in 
the same weight percent range as the controlled vent stream and 
determining whether the annual emissions of the stream entering the 
control device plus the applicable uncontrolled vent streams are greater 
than or equal to the CTE level, which is based on the weighted TOC 
concentration of the controlled vent stream and the uncontrolled vent 
streams. If the annual emissions entering the control device (including 
the applicable uncontrolled vent streams) are greater than or equal to 
the CTE level, then compliance with one of the requirements identified 
in Sec. 60.562-1(a)(1)(i) (A), (B), or (C) is required at that time for 
both the controlled and uncontrolled vent streams. If the annual 
emissions are less than the CTE level, compliance with these standards 
is again not required at such time. However, if the control device is 
again replaced, reconstructed, or modified, each owner or operator shall 
repeat this determination procedure.
    (2) Intermittent emissions. The owner or operator shall control each 
vent stream that emits intermittent emissions from an affected facility 
as defined in Sec. 60.560-1(a)(1) by meeting one of the control 
requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii) of this 
section. If a vent stream that emits intermittent emissions is 
controlled in an existing flare, incinerator, boiler, or process heater, 
the requirements of this paragraph are waived until such time the 
control device is reconstructed or replaced or is modified in its 
operating conditions as a result of State or local regulation, including 
changes in the operating permit. This paragraph does not apply to 
emergency vent streams exempted by Sec. 60.560(h) and as defined in 
Sec. 60.561.
    (i) Combust the emissions in a flare that is:
    (A) Designed for and operated with no visible emissions, except for 
periods not to exceed a total of 5 minutes during any 2 consecutive 
hours,
    (B) Operated with a flame present at all times, and
    (C) Designed to maintain a stable flame.
    (ii) Combust the emissions in an incinerator, boiler, or process 
heater. Such emissions shall be introduced into the flame zone of a 
boiler or process heater.
    (b) Polystyrene. Each owner or operator of a polystyrene process 
line containing process sections subject to the provisions of this 
subpart shall comply with the provisions in this section on and after 
the date on which the initial performance test required by Sec. 60.8 is 
completed, but not later than 60 days after achieving the maximum 
production rate at which the affected facility will be operated, or 180 
days after initial startup, whichever comes first. Each owner or 
operator of a polystyrene process line using a continuous process shall:
    (1) Limit the continuous TOC emissions from the material recovery 
section by complying with one of the following:
    (i) Not allow continuous TOC emissions to be greater than 0.0036 kg 
TOC/Mg (0.0072 lb TOC/ton) product; or
    (ii) Not allow the outlet gas stream temperature from each final 
condenser in the material recovery section to exceed -25  deg.C (-13 
deg.F). For purposes of this standard, temperature excursions above this 
limit shall not be considered a violation when such excursions occur 
during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction; or
    (iii) Comply with Sec. 60.562-1(a)(1)(i) (A), (B), or (C).
    (2) If continuous TOC emissions from the material recovery section 
are routed through an existing emergency vapor recovery system, then 
compliance with these standards is required when the emergency vapor 
recovery

[[Page 452]]

system undergoes modification, reconstruction, or replacement. In such 
instances, compliance with these standards shall be achieved no later 
than 180 days after completion of the modification, reconstruction, or 
replacement.
    (c) Poly(ethylene terephthalate). Each owner or operator of a 
poly(ethylene terephthalate) process line containing process sections 
subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with the 
provisions in this section on and after the date on which the initial 
performance test required by Sec. 60.8 is completed, but not later than 
60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which the 
affected facility will be operated, or 180 days after initial startup, 
whichever comes first.
    (1) Each owner or operator of a PET process line using a dimethyl 
terephthalate process shall:
    (i) Limit the continuous TOC emissions from the material recovery 
section (i.e., methanol recovery) by complying with one of the 
following:
    (A) Not allow the continuous TOC emissions to be greater than 0.018 
kg TOC/Mg (0.036 lb TOC/ton) product; or
    (B) Not allow the outlet gas stream temperature from each final 
condenser in the material recovery section (i.e., methanol recovery) to 
exceed +3  deg.C (+37  deg.F). For purposes of this standard, 
temperature excursions above this limit shall not be considered a 
violation when such excursions occur during periods of startup, 
shutdown, or malfunction.
    (ii) Limit the continuous TOC emissions and, if steam-jet ejectors 
are used to provide vacuum to the polymerization reactors, the ethylene 
glycol concentration from the polymerization reaction section by 
complying with the appropriate standard set forth below. The ethylene 
glycol concentration limits specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) (B) and 
(C) of this section shall be determined by the procedures specified in 
Sec. 60.564(j).
    (A) Not allow continuous TOC emissions from the polymerization 
reaction section (including emissions from any equipment used to further 
recover the ethylene glycol, but excluding those emissions from the 
cooling tower) to be greater than 0.02 kg TOC/Mg (0.04 lb TOC/ton) 
product; and
    (B) If steam-jet ejectors are used as vacuum producers and a low 
viscosity product is being produced using single or multiple end 
finishers or a high viscosity product is being produced using a single 
end finisher, maintain the concentration of ethylene glycol in the 
liquid effluent exiting the vacuum system servicing the polymerization 
reaction section at or below 0.35 percent by weight, averaged on a daily 
basis over a rolling 14-day period of operating days; or
    (C) If steam-jet ejectors are used as vacuum producers and a high 
viscosity product is being produced using multiple end finishers, 
maintain an ethylene glycol concentration in the cooling tower at or 
below 6.0 percent by weight, averaged on a daily basis over a rolling 
14-day period of operating days.
    (2) Each owner or operator of a PET process line using a 
terephthalic acid process shall:
    (i) Not allow the continuous TOC emissions from the esterification 
vessels in the raw materials preparation section to be greater than 0.04 
kg TOC/Mg (0.08 lb TOC/ton) product.
    (ii) Limit the continuous TOC emissions and, if steam-jet ejectors 
are used to provide vaccum to the polymerization reactors, the ethylene 
glycol concentration from the polymerization reaction section by 
complying with the appropriate standard set forth below. The ethylene 
glycol concentration limits specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) (B) and 
(C) of this section shall be determined by the procedures specified in 
Sec. 60.564(j).
    (A) Not allow continuous TOC emissions from the polymerization 
reaction section (including emissions from any equipment used to further 
recover the ethylene glycol, but excluding those emissions from the 
cooling tower) to be greater than 0.02 kg TOC/Mg (0.04 lb TOC/ton) 
product; and
    (B) If steam-jet ejectors are used as vacuum producers and a low 
viscosity product is being produced using single or multiple end 
finishers or a high viscosity product is being produced using a single 
end finisher, maintain the concentration of ethylene glycol in the

[[Page 453]]

liquid effluent exiting the vacuum system servicing the polymerization 
reaction section at or below 0.35 percent by weight, averaged on a daily 
basis over a rolling 14-day period of operating days; or
    (C) If steam-jet ejectors are used as vacuum producers and a high 
viscosity product is being produced using multiple end finishers, 
maintain an ethylene glycol concentration in the cooling tower at or 
below 6.0 percent by weight, averaged on a daily basis over a rolling 
14-day period of operating days.
    (d) Closed vent systems and control devices used to comply with this 
subpart shall be operated at all times when emissions may be vented to 
them.
    (e) Vent systems that contain valves that could divert a vent stream 
from a control device shall have car-sealed opened all valves in the 
vent system from the emission source to the control device and car-
sealed closed all valves in vent system that would lead the vent stream 
to the atmosphere, either directly or indirectly, bypassing the control 
device.

Sec. 60.562-2  Standards: Equipment leaks of VOC.

    (a) Each owner or operator of an affected facility subject to the 
provisions of this subpart shall comply with the requirements specified 
in Sec. 60.482-1 through Sec. 60.482-10 as soon as practicable, but no 
later than 180 days after initial startup, except that indications of 
liquids dripping from bleed ports in existing pumps in light liquid 
service are not considered to be a leak as defined in Sec. 60.482-
2(b)(2). For purposes of this standard, a ``bleed port'' is a 
technologically-required feature of the pump whereby polymer fluid used 
to provide lubrication and/or cooling of the pump shaft exits the pump, 
thereby resulting in a visible leak of fluid. This exemption expires 
when the existing pump is replaced or reconstructed.
    (b) An owner or operator may elect to comply with the requirements 
specified in Sec. 60.483-1 and Sec. 60.483-2.
    (c) An owner or operator may apply to the Administrator for a 
determination of equivalency for any means of emission limitation that 
achieves a reduction in emissions of VOC at least equivalent to the 
reduction in emissions of VOC achieved by the controls required in this 
subpart. In doing so, the owner or operator shall comply with 
requirements specified in Sec. 60.484.
    (d) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart 
shall comply with the provisions specified in Sec. 60.485 except an 
owner or operator may use the following provision in addition to 
Sec. 60.485(e): Equipment is in light liquid service if the percent 
evaporated is greater than 10 percent at 150  deg.C (302  deg.F) as 
determined by ASTM Method D86-78, 82, 90, 95, or 96 (incorporated by 
reference as specified in Sec. 60.17).
    (e) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart 
shall comply with Sec. 60.486 and Sec. 60.487.

controlling both continuous and intermittent emissions.
    (ii) A thermocouple or equivalent monitoring device to indicate the 
presence of a flame at each pilot light, if used to comply with 
Sec. 60.562-1(a)(2).
    (3) If a boiler or process heater is used:
    (i) If the boiler or process heater has a heat input design capacity

Sec. 60.564  Test methods and procedures.

    (a) In conducting the performance tests required in Sec. 60.8, the 
owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test 
methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures 
specified in this section, except as provided under Sec. 60.8(b). Owners 
or operators complying with Sec. 60.562-1(a)(1)(i)(D) need not perform a 
performance test on the control device, provided the control device is 
not used to comply with any other requirement of Sec. 60.562-1(a).
    (1) Whenever changes are made in production capacity, feedstock type 
or catalyst type, or whenever there is replacement, removal, or addition 
of a control device, each owner or operator shall conduct a performance 
test according to the procedures in this section as appropriate, in 
order to determine compliance with Sec. 60.562-1.
    (2) Where a boiler or process heater with a design heat input 
capacity of 150 million Btu/hour or greater is used, the requirement for 
an initial performance test is waived, in accordance with Sec. 60.8(b). 
However, the Administrator reserves the option to require testing at 
such other times as may be required, as provided for in Sec. 114 of the 
Act.
    (3) The owner or operator shall determine the average organic 
concentration for each performance test run using the equipment 
described in Sec. 60.563(a)(4). The average organic concentration shall 
be determined from measurements taken at least every 15 minutes during 
each performance test run. The average of the three runs shall be the 
base value for the monitoring program.
    (4) When an absorber is the final unit in the system, the owner or 
operator shall determine the average specific gravity for each 
performance test run using specific gravity monitoring equipment 
described in Sec. 60.563(a)(5). An average specific gravity shall be 
determined from measurements taken at least every 15 minutes during each 
performance test run. The average of the three runs shall be the base 
value for the monitoring program.
    (5) When a condenser is the final unit in the system, the owner or 
operator shall determine the average outlet temperature for each 
performance test run using the temperature monitoring equipment 
described in Sec. 60.563(a)(1). An average temperature shall be 
determined from measurements taken at least every 15 minutes during each 
performance test run while the vent stream is normally routed and 
constituted. The average of the three runs shall be the base value for 
the monitoring program.
    (b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
emission concentration standard in Sec. 60.562-1 (a)(1)(i)(A) or 
(b)(1)(iii) if applicable [if not, see paragraph (c) of this section] as 
follows:
    (1) The TOC concentration is the sum of the individual components 
and shall be computed for each run using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.072

where:

C<INF>TOC</INF> = Concentration of TOC (minus methane and ethane), dry 
basis, ppmv.
C<INF>j</INF> = the concentration of sample component j, ppm.
n = Number of components in the sample.

    (i) Method 18 shall be used to determine the concentration of each 
individual organic component (C<INF>j</INF>) in the gas stream. Method 1 
or 1A, as appropriate, shall be used to determine the sampling site at 
the outlet of the control device. Method 4 shall be used to determine 
the moisture content, if necessary.
    (ii) The sampling time for each run shall be 1 hour in which either 
an integrated sample or four grab samples shall be taken. If grab 
sampling is used, then the samples shall be taken at 15 minute 
intervals.
    (2) If supplemental combustion air is used, the TOC concentration 
shall be corrected to 3 percent oxygen and shall be computed using the 
following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.073

where:

C<INF>CORR = </INF> Concentration of TOC corrected to 3 percent oxygen, 
dry basis, ppm by volume.

[[Page 456]]

C<INF>MEAS</INF> = Concentration of TOC (minus methane and ethane), dry 
basis, ppm by volume, as calculated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
%O<INF>2d</INF> = Concentration of O<INF>2</INF>, dry basis, percent by 
volume.


The emission rate correction factor, integrated sampling and analysis 
procedure of Method 3 shall be used to determine the oxygen 
concentration (%O<INF>2d</INF>). The sampling site shall be the same as 
that of the TOC sample and the samples shall be taken during the same 
time that the TOC samples are taken.
    (c) If paragraph (b) of this section is not applicable, then the 
owner or operator shall determine compliance with the percent emission 
reduction standard in Sec. 60.562-1 (a)(1)(i)(A) or (b)(1)(iii) as 
follows:
    (1) The emission reduction of TOC (minus methane and ethane) shall 
be determined using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.075

where:

P = Percent emission reduction, by weight.
E<INF>inlet</INF> = Mass rate of TOC entering the control device, kg 
TOC/hr (lb TOC/hr).
E<INF>outlet</INF> = Mass rate of TOC, discharged to the atmosphere, kg 
TOC/hr (lb TOC/hr).

    (2) The mass rates of TOC (E<INF>i</INF>, E<INF>o</INF>) shall be 
computed using the following equations:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.076

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.074

where:

C<INF>ij</INF>,C<INF>oj</INF> = Concentration of sample component ``j'' 
of the gas stream at the inlet and outlet of the control device, 
respectively, dry basis, ppmv.
M<INF>ij</INF>,M<INF>oj</INF> = Molecular weight of sample component 
``j'' of the gas stream at the inlet and outlet of the control device 
respectively, g/g-mole (lb/lb-mole).
Q<INF>i</INF>,Q<INF>o</INF> = Flow rate of the gas stream at the inlet 
and outlet of the control device, respectively, dscm/hr (dscf/hr).
K<INF>1</INF> = 4.157 x 10<SUP>-8</SUP> [(kg)/g-mole)]/[(g)(ppm)(dscm)] 
{5.711x10<SUP>-15</SUP> [(lb)/(lb-mole)]/(lb)(ppm)(dscf)]{time} 

    (i) Method 18 shall be used to determine the concentration of each 
individual organic component (C<INF>ij</INF>, C<INF>oj</INF>) in the gas 
stream. Method 1 or 1A, as appropriate, shall be used to determine the 
inlet and outlet sampling sites. The inlet site shall be before the 
inlet of the control device and after all product recovery units.
    (ii) Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D, as appropriate, shall be used to 
determine the volumetric flow rates (Q<INF>i</INF>, Q<INF>o</INF>). If 
necessary, Method 4 shall be used to determine the moisture content. 
Both determinations shall be compatible with the Method 18 
determinations.
    (iii) Inlet and outlet samples shall be taken simultaneously. The 
sampling time for each run shall be 1 hour in which either an integrated 
sample or four grab samples shall be taken. If grab sampling is used, 
then the samples shall be taken at 15 minute intervals.
    (d) An owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
individual stream exemptions in Sec. 60.560(g) and the procedures 
specified in Table 3 for compliance with Sec. 60.562-1(a)(1) as 
identified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section. An owner or 
operator using the procedures specified in Sec. 60.562-1(a)(1) for 
determining which continuous process emissions are to be controlled may 
use calculations demonstrated to be sufficiently accurate as to preclude 
the necessity of actual testing for purposes of calculating the 
uncontrolled annual emissions and weight percent of TOC. Owners or 
operators seeking to exempt streams under Sec. 60.560(g) must use the 
appropriate test procedures specified in this section.
    (1) The uncontrolled annual emissions of the individual vent stream 
shall be determined using the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.020

Where:

E<INF>unc</INF> = uncontrolled annual emissions, Mg/yr (ton/yr)
C<INF>j</INF> = concentration of sample component j of the gas stream, 
dry basis, ppmv

[[Page 457]]

M<INF>j</INF> = molecular weight of sample component j of the gas 
stream, g/g-mole (lb/lb-mole)
Q = flow rate of the gas stream, dscm/hr (dscf/hr)

    (i) Method 18 shall be used to determine the concentration of each 
individual organic component (C<INF>j</INF>) in the gas stream. Method 1 
or 1A, as appropriate, shall be used to determine the sampling site. If 
the gas stream is controlled in an existing control device, the sampling 
site shall be before the inlet of the control device and after all 
product recovery units.
    (ii) Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D, as appropriate, shall be used to 
determine the volumetric flow rate (Q). If necessary, Method 4 shall be 
used to determine the moisture content. Both determinations shall be 
compatible with the Method 18 determinations.
    (iii) The sampling time for each run shall be 1 hour in which either 
an integrated sample or four grab samples shall be taken. If grab 
sampling is used, then the samples shall be taken at 15 minute 
intervals.
    (2) The weight percent VOC of the uncontrolled individual vent 
stream shall be determined using the following equation:

stream, dry basis, ppmv.
M<INF>j</INF>=Molecular weight of sample TOC component ``j'' of the gas 
stream, g/g-mole (1b/1b-mole).
MW<INF>gas</INF>=Average molecular weight of the entire gas stream, g/g-
mole (1b/1b-mole).

    (i) Method 18 shall be used to determine the concentration of each 
individual organic component (C<INF>j</INF>) in the gas stream. Method 1 
or 1A, as appropriate, shall be used to determine the sampling site. If 
the gas stream is controlled in an existing control device, the sampling 
site shall be before the inlet of the control device and after all 
product recovery units. If necessary, Method 4 shall be used to 
determine the moisture content. This determination shall be compatible 
with the Method 18 determinations.
    (ii) The average molecular weight of the gas stream shall be 
determined using methods approved by the Administrator. If the carrier 
component of the gas stream is nitrogen, then an average molecular 
weight of 28 g/g-mole (lb/lb-mole) may be used in lieu of testing. If 
the carrier component of the gas stream is air, then an average 
molecular weight of 29 g/g-mole (lb/lb-mole) may be used in lieu of 
testing.
    (iii) The sampling time for each run shall be 1 hour in which either 
an integrated sample or four grab samples shall be taken. If grab 
sampling is used, then the samples shall be taken at 15 minute 
intervals.
    (e) The owner or operator shall determine compliance of flares with 
the visible emission and flare provisions in Sec. 60.562-1 as follows:
    (1) Method 22 shall be used to determine visible emissions. The 
observation period for each run shall be 2 hours.
    (2) The monitoring device of Sec. 60.563(b)(2) shall be used to 
determine whether a flame is present.
    (f) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the net 
heating value provisions in Sec. 60.18 as referenced by Sec. 60.562-
1(a)(1)(i)(C). The net heating value of the process vent stream being 
combusted in a flare shall be computed as follows:

Where:

H<INF>T</INF> = Vent stream net heating value, MJ/scm (Btu/scf), where 
the net enthalpy per mole of offgas is based on combustion at 25  deg.C

for determining the volume corresponding to one mole is 20  deg.C (68 
deg.F).
K<INF>3</INF> = 1.74 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> (1/ppm)(g-mole/scm)(MJ/kcal) 
(metric units), where standard temperature for (g-mole/scm) is 20 
deg.C.
= 4.67 x 10<SUP>-6</SUP> (1/ppm)(lb-mole/scf)(Btu/kcal) (English units) 
where standard temperature for (lb/mole/scf) is 68  deg.F.
C<INF>j</INF> = Concentration on a wet basis of compound j in ppm.

(kcal/(lb-mole)), based on combustion at 25  deg.C and 760 mm Hg (77 
deg.F and 30 in. Hg).

    (1) Method 18 shall be used to determine the concentration of each 
individual organic component (C<INF>j</INF>) in the gas stream. Method 1 
or 1A, as appropriate, shall be used to determine the sampling site to 
the inlet of the flare. Using this same sample, ASTM D1946-77 or 90 
(Reapproved 1994) (incorporated by reference--see Sec. 60.17) shall be 
used to determine the hydrogen and carbon monoxide content.
    (2) The sampling time for each run shall be 1 hour in which either 
an integrated sample or four grab samples shall be taken. If grab 
sampling is used, then the samples shall be taken at 15 minute 
intervals.
    (3) Published or calculated values shall be used for the net heats 
of combustion of the sample components. If values are not published or 
cannot be calculated, ASTM D2382-76 or 88 or D4809-95 (incorporated by 
reference--see Sec. 60.17) may be used to determine the net heat of 
combustion of component ``j.''
    (g) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the exit 
velocity provisions in Sec. 60.18 as referenced by Sec. 60.562-
1(a)(1)(i)(C) as follows:
    (1) If applicable, the net heating value (H<INF>T</INF>) of the 
process vent shall be determined according to the procedures in 
paragraph (f) of this section to determine the applicable velocity 
requirements.
    (2) If applicable, the maximum permitted velocity (V<INF>max</INF>) 
for steam-assisted and nonassisted flares shall be computed using the 
following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.022

Where:

V<INF>max</INF> = Maximum permitted velocity, m/sec (ft/sec)
K<INF>4</INF> = 28.8 (metric units), 1212 (English units)

H<INF>T</INF> = The net heating value as determined in paragraph (f) of 
this section, MJ/scm (Btu/scf).

    (3) The maximum permitted velocity, V<INF>max</INF>, for air-
assisted flares shall be determined by the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.023

Where:

V<INF>max</INF> = Maximum permitted velocity, m/sec (ft/sec).
K<INF>6</INF> = 8.706 m/sec (metric units)
     = 28.56 ft/sec (English units)
K<INF>7</INF> = 0.7084 [(m/sec)/MJ/scm)] (metric units)
     = 0.00245 [(ft/sec)/Btu/scf)] (English units)
H<INF>T</INF> = The net heating value as determined in paragraph (f) of 
this section, MJ/scm (Btu/scf).

    (4) The actual exit velocity of a flare shall be determined by 
dividing the volumetric flow rate (in units of standard temperature and 
pressure), as determined by Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D as appropriate, by 
the unobstructed (free) cross sectional area of the flare tip.
    (h) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the mass 
emission per mass product standards in Secs. 60.560(d) and (e) and in 
Secs. 60.562-1(b)(1)(i), (c)(1)(i)(A), (c)(1)(ii)(A), (c)(2)(i), and 
(c)(2)(ii)(A).
    (1) The emission rate of TOC shall be computed using the following 
equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.024

Where:

ER<INF>TOC</INF> = Emission rate of total organic compounds (minus 
methane and ethane), kg TOC/Mg (lb TOC/ton) product
E<INF>TOC</INF> = Emission rate of total organic compounds (minus 
methane and ethane) in the sample, kg/hr (lb/hr)
P<INF>p</INF> = The rate of polymer production, kg/hr (lb/hr)
K<INF>5</INF> = 1,000 kg/Mg (metric units)
     = 2,000 lb/ton (English units)

    (2) The mass rate of TOC, E<INF>TOC</INF>, shall be determined 
according to the procedures, as appropriate, in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section. The sampling site for determining compliance with Secs. 60.560 
(d) and (e) shall be before any add-on control devices and after all 
product recovery devices. Otherwise, the sampling site shall be at the 
outlet of the control device.
    (3) The rate of polymer production, P<INF>p</INF>, shall be 
determined by dividing the weight of polymer pulled (in kg (lb)) from 
the process line during the performance test by the number of hours 
taken to perform the performance test. The weight of polymer pulled 
shall be determined by direct measurement or,

[[Page 459]]

subject to prior approval by the Administrator, computed from materials 
balance by good engineering practice.
    (i) The owner or operator shall determine continuous compliance with 
the temperature requirements in Secs. 60.562-1(b)(1)(ii) and 60.562-
1(c)(1)(i)(B) by using the temperature monitoring equipment described in 
Sec. 60.563(a)(1). An average temperature shall be determined from 
measurements taken at least every 15 minutes every three hours while the 
vent stream is normally routed and constituted. Each three-hour period 
constitutes a performance test.
    (j) For purposes of determining compliance with Sec. 60.562-1(c) 
(1)(ii)(B), (1)(ii)(C), (2)(ii)(B), or (2)(ii)(C), the ethylene glycol 
concentration in either the cooling tower or the liquid effluent from 
steam-jet ejectors used to produce a vacuum in the polymerization 
reactors, whichever is applicable, shall be determined:
    (1) Using procedures that conform to the methods described in ASTM 
D2908-74 or 91, ``Standard Practice for Measuring Volatile Organic 
Matter in Water by Aqueous-Injection Gas Chromatography'' (incorporated 
by reference--see Sec. 60.17), except as provided in paragraph (j)(2) of 
this section:
    (i) At least one sample per operating day shall be collected using 
the grab sampling procedures of ASTM D3370-76 or 96a, ``Standard 
Practices for Sampling Water'' (incorporated by reference--see 
Sec. 60.17). An average ethylene glycol concentration by weight shall be 
calculated on a daily basis over a rolling 14-day period of operating 
days, except as provided in paragraphs (j)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this 
section. Each daily average ethylene glycol concentration so calculated 
constitutes a performance test. Exceedance of the standard during the 
reduced testing program specified in paragraphs (j)(1) (ii) and (iii) of 
this section is a violation of these standards.
    (ii) For those determining compliance with Sec. 60.562-1(c) 
(1)(ii)(B) or (2)(ii)(B), the owner or operator may elect to reduce the 
sampling program to any 14 consecutive day period once every two 
calendar months, if at least seventeen consecutive 14-day rolling 
average concentrations immediately preceding the reduced sampling 
program are each less than 0.10 weight percent ethylene glycol. If the 
average concentration obtained over the 14 day sampling during the 
reduced testing period exceeds the upper 95 percent confidence interval 
calculated from the most recent test results in which no one 14-day 
average exceeded 0.10 weight percent ethylene glycol, then the owner or 
operator shall reinstitute a daily sampling program. A reduced sampling 
program can be reinstituted if the requirements specified in this 
paragraph are met.
    (iii) For those determining compliance with Sec. 60.562-
1(c)(1)(ii)(C) or (c)(2)(ii)(C), the owner or operator may elect to 
reduce the sampling program to any 14 consecutive day period once every 
two calendar months, if at least seventeen consecutive 14-day rolling 
average concentrations immediately preceding the reduced sampling 
program are each less than 1.8 weight percent ethylene glycol. If the 
average concentration obtained over the 14 day sampling during the 
reduced test period exceeds the upper 95 percent confidence interval 
calculated from the most recent test results in which no one 14-day 
average exceeded 1.8 weight percent ethylene glycol, then the owner or 
operator shall reinstitute a daily sampling program. A reduced program 
can be reinstituted if the requirements specified in this paragraph are 
met.
    (iv) The upper 95 percent confidence interval shall be calculated 
using the equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.025

Where:

X<INF>i</INF> = daily ethylene glycol concentration for each day used to 
calculate the 14-day rolling average used in test results to justify 
implementing the reduced testing program.
n = number of ethylene glycol concentrations.

    (2) Measuring an alternative parameter, such as carbon oxygen demand 
or biological oxygen demand, that is demonstrated to be directly 
proportional to

[[Page 460]]

the ethylene glycol concentration. Such parameter shall be measured 
during the initial 14-day performance test during which the facility is 
shown to be in compliance with the ethylene glycol concentration 
standard whereby the ethylene glycol concentration is determined using 
the procedures described in paragraph (j)(1) of this section. The 
alternative parameter shall be measured on a daily basis and the average 
value of the alternative parameter shall be calculated on a daily basis 
over a rolling 14-day period of operating days. Each daily average value 
of the alternative parameter constitutes a performance test.

Sec. 60.582  Standard for volatile organic compounds.

    (a) On and after the date on which the performance test required by 
Sec. 60.8 has been completed, each owner or operator subject to this 
subpart shall either:
    (1) Use inks with a weighted average VOC content less than 1.0 
kilogram VOC per kilogram ink solids at each affected facility, or

affected facility.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 60.583  Test methods and procedures.

    (a) Methods in appendix A of this part, except as provided under 
Sec. 60.8(b), shall be used to determine compliance with Sec. 60.582(a) 
as follows:
    (1) Method 24 for analysis of inks. If nonphotochemically reactive 
solvents are used in the inks, standard gas

[[Page 466]]

chromatographic techniques may be used to identify and quantify these 
solvents. The results of Method 24 may be adjusted to subtract these 
solvents from the measured VOC content.
    (2) Method 25A for VOC concentration (the calibration gas shall be 
propane);
    (3) Method 1 for sample and velocity traverses;
    (4) Method 2 for velocity and volumetric flow rates;
    (5) Method 3 for gas analysis;
    (6) Method 4 for stack gas moisture.
    (b) To demonstrate compliance with Sec. 60.582(a)(1), the owner or 
operator of an affected facility shall determine the weighted average 
VOC content of the inks according to the following procedures:
    (1) Determine and record the VOC content and amount of each ink used 
at the print head, including the VOC content and amount of diluent 
solvent, for any time periods when VOC emission control equipment is not 
used.
    (2) Compute the weighted average VOC content by the following 
equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.050

    (3) The weighted average VOC content of the inks shall be calculated 
over a period that does not exceed one calendar month, or four 
consecutive weeks. A facility that uses an accounting system based on 
quarters consisting of two 28 calendar day periods and one 35 calendar 
day period may use an averaging period of 35 calendar days four times 
per year, provided the use of such an accounting system is documented in 
the initial performance test.
    (4) Each determination of the weighted average VOC content shall 
constitute a performance test for any period when VOC emission control 
equipment is not used. Results of the initial performance test must be 
reported to the Administrator. Method 24 or ink manufacturers' 
formulation data along with plant blending records (if plant blending is 
done) may be used to determine VOC content. The Administrator may 
require the use of Method 24 if there is a question concerning the 
accuracy of the ink manufacturer's data or plant blending records.
    (5) If, during the time periods when emission control equipment is 
not used, all inks used contain less than 1.0 kilogram VOC per kilogram 
ink solids, the owner or operator is not required to calculate the 
weighted average VOC content, but must verify and record the VOC content 
of each ink (including any added dilution solvent) used as determined by 
Method 24, ink manufacturers' formulation data, or plant blending 
records.
    (c) To demonstrate compliance with Sec. 60.582(a)(1), the owner or 
operator may determine the weighted average VOC content using an 
inventory system.
    (1) The inventory system shall accurately account to the nearest 
kilogram for the VOC content of all inks and dilution solvent used, 
recycled, and discarded for each affected facility during the averaging 
period. Separate records must be kept for each affected facility.
    (2) To determine VOC content of inks and dilution solvent used or 
recycled, Method 24 or ink manufacturers' formulation data must be used 
in combination with plant blending records (if plant blending is done) 
or inventory records or purchase records for new inks or dilution 
solvent.
    (3) For inks to be discarded, only Method 24 shall be used to 
determine the VOC content. Inks to be discarded may be combined prior to 
measurement of volume or weight and testing by Method 24.
    (4) The Administrator may require the use of Method 24 if there is a 
question concerning the accuracy of the ink manufacturer's data or plant 
records.

[[Page 467]]

    (5) The Administrator shall approve the inventory system of 
accounting for VOC content prior to the initial performance test.
    (d) To demonstrate compliance with Sec. 60.582(a)(2), the owner or 
operator of an affected facility controlled by a solvent recovery 
emission control device or an incineration control device shall conduct 
a performance test to determine overall VOC emission control efficiency 
according to the following procedures:
    (1) The performance test shall consist of three runs. Each test run 
must last a minimum of 30 minutes and shall continue until the printing 
operation is interrupted or until 180 minutes of continuous operation 
occurs. During each test run, the print line shall be printing 
continuously and operating normally. The VOC emission reduction 
efficiency achieved for each test run is averaged over the entire test 
run period.
    (2) VOC concentration values at each site shall be measured 
simultaneously.
    (3) The volumetric flow rate shall be determined from one Method 2 
measurement for each test run conducted immediately prior to, during, or 
after that test run. Volumetric flow rates at each site do not need to 
be measured simultaneously.
    (4) In order to determine capture efficiency from an affected 
facility, all fugitive VOC emissions from the affected facility shall be 
captured and vented through stacks suitable for measurement. During a 
performance test, the owner or operator of an affected facility located 
in an area with other sources of VOC shall isolate the affected facility 
from other sources of VOC. These two requirements shall be accomplished 
using one of the following methods:
    (i) Build a permanent enclosure around the affected facility;
    (ii) Build a temporary enclosure around the affected facility and 
duplicate, to an extent that is reasonably feasible, the ventilation 
conditions that are in effect when the affected facility is not enclosed 
(one way to do this is to divide the room exhaust rate by the volume of 
the room and then duplicate that quotient or 20 air changes per hour, 
whichever is smaller, in the temporary enclosure); or
    (iii) Shut down all other sources of VOC and continue to exhaust 
fugitive emissions from the affected facility through any building 
ventilation system and other room exhausts such as print line ovens and 
embossers.
    (5) For each affected facility, compliance with Sec. 60.582(a)(2) 
has been demonstrated if the average value of the overall control 
efficiency (EF) for the three runs is equal to or greater than 85 
percent. An overall control efficiency is calculated for each run as 
follows:
    (i) For efficiency of the emission control device,

    (ii) For efficiency of the vapor capture system,

of printing operation when the average temperature of the exhaust gases 
is more than 28  deg.C (50  deg.F) below the average temperature 
demonstrated during the most recent performance test.
    (c) The owner or operator of an affected facility controlled by a 
catalytic incineration emission control device shall install, calibrate, 
operate, and maintain monitoring devices that continuously measure and 
record the gas temperatures both upstream and downstream of the catalyst 
bed and shall comply with the following requirements:
    (1) Each continuous monitoring device shall be calibrated annually 
and have an accuracy of <plus-minus>0.75 percent of the temperature 
being measured, expressed in degrees Celsius, or <plus-minus>2.5  deg.C, 
whichever is greater.
    (2) During the performance test, the owner or operator shall 
determine and record the average gas temperature both upstream and 
downstream of the catalyst bed. After the performance test, the owner or 
operator shall determine and record, in addition to the record made by 
the continuous monitoring device, the average temperatures for each 3-
hour clock period of printing operation when the average temperature of 
the gas stream before the catalyst bed is more than 28  deg.C below the 
average temperature demonstrated during the most recent performance test 
or the average temperature difference across the catalyst bed is less 
than 80 percent of the average temperature difference of the device

Sec. 60.593  Exceptions.

    (a) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart 
may comply with the following exceptions to the provisions of subpart 
VV.
    (b)(1) Compressors in hydrogen service are exempt from the 
requirements of Sec. 60.592 if an owner or operator demonstrates that a 
compressor is in hydrogen service.
    (2) Each compressor is presumed not be be in hydrogen service unless 
an owner or operator demonstrates that the piece of equipment is in 
hydrogen service. For a piece of equipment to be considered in hydrogen 
service, it must be determined that the percent hydrogen content can be 
reasonably expected always to exceed 50 percent by volume. For purposes 
of determining the percent hydrogen content in the process fluid that is 
contained in or contacts a compressor, procedures that conform to the 
general method described in ASTM E260-73, 91, or 96, E168-67, 77, or 92, 
or E169-63, 77, or 93 (incorporated by reference as specified in 
Sec. 60.17) shall be used.
    (3)(i) An owner or operator may use engineering judgment rather than 
procedures in paragraph (b)(2) of this section to demonstrate that the 
percent content exceeds 50 percent by volume, provided the engineering 
judgment demonstrates that the content clearly exceeds 50 percent by 
volume. When an owner or operator and the Administrator do not agree on 
whether a piece of equipment is in hydrogen service, however, the 
procedures in paragraph (b)(2) shall be used to resolve the 
disagreement.
    (ii) If an owner or operator determines that a piece of equipment is 
in hydrogen service, the determination can be revised only after 
following the procedures in paragraph (b)(2).
    (c) Any existing reciprocating compressor that becomes an affected 
facility under provisions of Sec. 60.14 or Sec. 60.15 is exempt from 
Sec. 60.482 (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (h) provided the owner or 
operator demonstrates that recasting the distance piece or replacing the 
compressor are the only options available to bring the compressor into

<R05>
Sec. 60.603  Performance test and compliance provisions.

    (a) Section 60.8(f) does not apply to the performance test 
procedures required by this subpart.
    (b) Each owner or operator of an affected facility shall determine 
compliance with the applicable standard in Sec. 60.602(a) by determining 
and recording monthly the VOC emissions per unit mass solvent feed from 
each affected facility for the current and preceding 5 consecutive 
calendar months and using these values to calculate the 6-month average 
emissions. Each calculation is considered a performance test. The owner 
or operator of an affected facility shall use the following procedure to 
determine VOC emissions for each calendar month;
    (1) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate monitoring devices 
that continuously measure and permanently record for each calendar month 
the amount of makeup solvent and solvent feed. These values shall be 
used in calculating VOC emissions according to paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section. All monitoring devices, meters, and peripheral equipment shall 
be calibrated and any error recorded. Total compounded error of the flow 
measuring and recording devices shall not exceed 1 percent accuracy over 
the operating range. As an alternative to measuring solvent feed, the 
owner or operator may:
    (i) Measure the amount of recovered solvent returned to the solvent 
feed storage tanks, and use the following equation to determine the 
amount of solvent feed:

Solvent Feed=Makeup Solvent+Recovered
Solvent+Change in the Amount of Solvent
Contained in the Solvent Feed Holding Tank.

    (ii) Measure and record the amount of polymer introduced into the 
affected facility and the solvent-to-polymer ratio of the spinning 
solutions, and use the following equation to determine the amount of 
solvent feed:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.083

where subscript ``i'' denotes each particular spinning solution used 
during the test period; values of ``i'' vary from one to the total 
number of spinning solutions, ``n,'' used during the calendar month.

    (2) VOC emissions shall be determined each calendar month by use of 
the following equations:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16NO91.084

where all values are for the calendar month only and where
E = VOC Emissions, in kg/Mg (lb/ton) solvent;
S<INF>V</INF> = Measured or calculated volume of solvent feed, in liters 
(gallons);
S<INF>W</INF> = Weight of solvent feed, in Mg (ton);
M<INF>V</INF> = Measured volume of makeup solvent, in liters (gallons);
M<INF>W</INF> = Weight of makeup, in kg (lb);
N = Allowance for nongaseous losses, 13 kg/Mg (26 lb/ton) solvent feed;
S<INF>P</INF> = Fraction of measured volume that is actual solvent 
(excludes water);

[[Page 473]]

D = Density of the solvent, in kg/liter (lb/gallon);
K = Conversion factor, 1,000 kg/Mg (2,000 lb/ton);
I = Allowance for solvent inventory variation or changes in the amount 
of solvent contained in the affected facility, in kg/Mg (lb/ton) solvent 
feed (may be positive or negative);
I<INF>S</INF> = Amount of solvent contained in the affected facility at 
the beginning of the test period, as determined by the owner or 
operator, in kg (lb);
I<INF>E</INF> = Amount of solvent contained in the affected facility at 
the close of the test period, as determined by the owner or operator, in 
kg (lb).

    (3) N, as used in the equation in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, 
equals 13 kg/Mg (26 lb/ton) solvent feed to the spinning solution 
preparation system and precipitation bath. This value shall be used in 
all cases unless an owner or operator demonstrates to the satisfaction 
of the Administrator that greater nongaseous losses occur at the 
affected facility. In this case, the greater value may be substituted in 
the equation.

Sec. 60.604  Reporting requirements.

    (a) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall submit a 
written report to the Administrator of the following:
    (1) The results of the initial performance test; and
    (2) The results of subsequent performance tests that indicate that 
VOC emissions exceed the standards in Sec. 60.602. These reports shall 
be submitted quarterly at 3-month intervals after the initial 
performance test. If no exceedances occur during a particular quarter, a 
report stating this shall be submitted to the Administrator 
semiannually.
    (b) Solvent-spun synthetic fiber producing facilities exempted from 
these standards in Sec. 60.600(a) (those producing less than 500 Mg (551 
ton) annually) shall report to the Administrator within 30 days whenever 
extruded fiber for the preceding 12 calendar months exceeds 500 Mg (551 
ton).
    (c) The requirements of this section remain in force until and 
unless EPA, in delegating enforcement authority to a State under section 
111(c) of the Act, approves reporting requirements or an alternate means 
of compliance surveillance adopted by such State. In that event, 
affected sources within the State will be relieved of the obligation to 
comply with this section, provided that they comply with the 
requirements established by the State.

owner or operator has elected to comply. Notification shall be submitted 
with the notifications of initial startup required by 40 CFR 65.5(b).

    Note: The intent of these standards is to minimize the emissions of 
VOC through the application of BDT. The numerical emission limits in 
these standards are expressed in terms of total organic compounds (TOC), 
measured as TOC minus methane and ethane. This emission limit reflects 
the performance of BDT.

of the recalculation and shall conduct a performance test according to 
the methods and procedures required by Sec. 60.614 to determine 
compliance with Sec. 60.612(a). Performance tests must be conducted as 
soon as possible after the process change but no later than 180 days 
from the time of the process change.

Sec. 60.624  Test methods and procedures.

    Each owner or operator of an affected facility subject to the 
provisions of Sec. 60.622(a) shall perform an initial test to verify 
that the flow rate of recovered solvent from the solvent recovery dryer 
at the termination of the recovery cycle is no greater than 0.05 liters

monitored for their final recovered solvent flow rate. The suggested 
point for measuring the flow rate of recovered solvent is the outlet of 
the solvent-water separator. Near the end of the recovery cycle, the 
entire flow of recovered solvent should be diverted to a graduated 
cylinder. As the recovered solvent collects in the graduated cylinder, 
the elapsed time is monitored and recorded in periods of greater than or 
equal to 1 minute. At the same time, the volume of solvent in the 
graduated cylinder is monitored and recorded to determine the volume of 
recovered solvent that is collected during each time period. The 
recovered solvent flow rate is calculated by dividing the volume of 
solvent collected per period by the length of time elapsed during the 
period and converting the result with appropriate factors into units of 
liters per minute. The recovery cycle and the monitoring procedure 
should continue until the flow rate of solvent is less than or equal to 
0.05 liter per minute. The type of articles cleaned and the total length 
of the cycle should then be recorded.

Sec. 60.644  Test methods and procedures.

    (a) In conducting the performance tests required in Sec. 60.8, the 
owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test 
methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as 
specified in this section, except as provided in paragraph Sec. 60.8(b).
    (b) During a performance test required by Sec. 60.8, the owner or 
operator shall determine the minimum required reduction efficiencies (Z) 
of SO<INF>2</INF> emissions as required in Sec. 60.642 (a) and (b) as 
follows:
    (1) The average sulfur feed rate (X) shall be computed as follows:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.030
    
Where:

X = average sulfur feed rate, Mg/D (LT/D).
Q<INF>a</INF> = average volumetric flow rate of acid gas from sweetening 
unit, dscm/day (dscf/day).
Y = average H<INF>2</INF>S concentration in acid gas feed from 
sweetening unit, percent by volume, expressed as a decimal.
K = (32 kg S/kg-mole)/((24.04 dscm/kg-mole)(1000 kg S/ Mg)) = 1.331 x 
10<SUP>-3</SUP> Mg/dscm, for metric units
    = (32 lb S/lb-mole)/((385.36 dscf/lb-mole)(2240 lb S/long ton))
    = 3.707 x 10<SUP>-5</SUP> long ton/dscf, for English units.

    (2) The continuous readings from the process flowmeter shall be used 
to determine the average volumetric flow rate (Q<INF>a</INF>) in dscm/
day (dscf/day) of the acid gas from the sweetening unit for each run.
    (3) The Tutwiler procedure in Sec. 60.648 or a chromatographic 
procedure following ASTM E-260 (incorporated by reference--see 
Sec. 60.17) shall be used to determine the H<INF>2</INF>S concentration 
in the acid gas feed from the sweetening unit. At least one sample per 
hour (at equally spaced intervals) shall be taken during each 4-hour 
run. The arithmetic mean of all samples shall be the average 
H<INF>2</INF>S concentration (Y) on a dry basis for the run. By 
multiplying the result from the Tutwiler procedure by 1.62 x 
10<SUP>-3</SUP>, the units gr/100 scf are converted to volume percent.
    (4) Using the information from paragraphs (b) (1) and (3), Tables 1 
and 2 shall be used to determine the required initial (Z<INF>i</INF>) 
and continuous (Z<INF>c</INF>) reduction efficiencies of SO<INF>2</INF> 
emissions.
    (c) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
SO<INF>2</INF> standards in Sec. 60.642 (a) or (b) as follows:
    (1) The emission reduction efficiency (R) achieved by the sulfur 
recovery technology shall be computed for each run using the following 
equation:

R=(100 S)/(S+E)

    (2) The level indicators or manual soundings shall be used to 
measure the liquid sulfur accumulation rate in the product storage 
tanks. Readings taken at the beginning and end of each run, the tank 
geometry, sulfur density at the storage temperature, and sample duration 
shall be used to determine the sulfur production rate (S) in kg/hr (lb/
hr) for each run.
    (3) The emission rate of sulfur shall be computed for each run as 
follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.031

Where:

E = emission rate of sulfur per run, kg/hr.
C<INF>e</INF> = concentration of sulfur equivalent (SO<INF>2</INF> + 
reduced sulfur), g/dscm (lb/dscf).
Q<INF>sd</INF> = volumetric flow rate of effluent gas, dscm/hr (dscf/
hr).
K<INF>1</INF> = conversion factor, 1000 g/kg (7000 gr/lb).

    (4) The concentration (C<INF>e</INF>) of sulfur equivalent shall be 
the sum of the SO<INF>2</INF> and TRS concentrations, after being 
converted to sulfur equivalents. For each run and each of the test 
methods specified in this paragraph (c) of this section, the sampling 
time shall be at

[[Page 496]]

least 4 hours. Method 1 shall be used to select the sampling site. The 
sampling point in the duct shall be at the centroid of the cross-section 
if the area is less than 5 m<SUP>2</SUP> (54 ft<SUP>2</SUP>) or at a 
point no closer to the walls than 1 m (39 in.) if the cross-sectional 
area is 5 m<SUP>2</SUP> or more, and the centroid is more than 1 m (39 
in.) from the wall.
    (i) Method 6 shall be used to determine the SO<INF>2</INF> 
concentration. Eight samples of 20 minutes each shall be taken at 30-
minute intervals. The arithmetic average shall be the concentration for 
the run. The concentration shall be multiplied by 0.5 x 
10<SUP>-</SUP>\3\ to convert the results to sulfur equivalent.
    (ii) Method 15 shall be used to determine the TRS concentration from 
reduction-type devices or where the oxygen content of the effluent gas 
is less than 1.0 percent by volume. The sampling rate shall be at least 
3 liters/min (0.1 ft<SUP>3</SUP>/min) to insure minimum residence time 
in the sample line. Sixteen samples shall be taken at 15-minute 
intervals. The arithmetic average of all the samples shall be the 
concentration for the run. The concentration in ppm reduced sulfur as 
sulfur shall be multiplied by 1.333 x 10<SUP>-3</SUP> to convert the 
results to sulfur equivalent.
    (iii) Method 16A or 15 shall be used to determine the reduced sulfur 
concentration from oxidation-type devices or where the oxygen content of 
the effluent gas is greater than 1.0 percent by volume. Eight samples of 
20 minutes each shall be taken at 30-minute intervals. The arithmetic 
average shall be the concentration for the run. The concentration in ppm 
reduced sulfur as sulfur shall be multiplied by 1.333 x 10<SUP>-3</SUP> 
to convert the results to sulfur equivalent.
    (iv) Method 2 shall be used to determine the volumetric flow rate of 
the effluent gas. A velocity traverse shall be conducted at the 
beginning and end of each run. The arithmetic average of the two 
measurements shall be used to calculate the volumetric flow rate 
(Q<INF>sd</INF>) for the run. For the determination of the effluent gas 
molecular weight, a single integrated sample over the 4-hour period may 
be taken and analyzed or grab samples at 1-hour intervals may be taken, 
analyzed, and averaged. For the moisture content, two samples of at 
least 0.10 dscm (3.5 dscf) and 10 minutes shall be taken at the 
beginning of the 4-hour run and near the end of the time period. The 
arithmetic average of the two runs shall be the moisture content for the 
run.
    (d) To comply with Sec. 60.646(d), the owner or operator shall 
obtain the information required by using the monitoring devices in 
paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 60.646  Monitoring of emissions and operations.

    (a) The owner or operator subject to the provisions of Sec. 60.642 
(a) or (b) shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate monitoring 
devices or perform measurements to determine the following operations 
information on a daily basis:
    (1) The accumulation of sulfur product over each 24-hour period: The 
monitoring method may incorporate the use of an instrument to measure 
and record the liquid sulfur production rate, or may be a procedure for 
measuring and recording the sulfur liquid levels in the storage tanks 
with a level indicator or by manual soundings, with subsequent 
calculation of the sulfur production rate based on the tank geometry, 
stored sulfur density, and elapsed time between readings. The method 
shall be designed to be accurate within <plus-minus>2 percent of the 24-
hour sulfur accumulation.
    (2) The H<INF>2</INF>S concentration in the acid gas from the 
sweetening unit for each 24-hour period: At least one sample per 24-hour 
period shall be collected and analyzed using the method specified in 
Sec. 60.644(b)(1). The Administrator may require the owner or operator 
to demonstrate that the H<INF>2</INF>S concentration obtained from one 
or more samples over a 24-hour period is within <plus-minus>20 percent 
of the average of 12 samples collected at equally spaced intervals 
during the 24-hour period. In instances where the H<INF>2</INF>S 
concentration of a single sample is not within <plus-minus>20 percent of 
the

[[Page 497]]

average of the 12 equally spaced samples, the Administrator may require 
a more frequent sampling schedule.
    (3) The average acid gas flow rate from the sweetening unit: The 
owner or operator shall install and operate a monitoring device to 
continuously measure the flow rate of acid gas. The monitoring device 
reading shall be recorded at least once per hour during each 24-hour 
period. The average acid gas flow rate shall be computed from the 
individual readings.
    (4) The sulfur feed rate (X): For each 24-hour period, X shall be 
computed using the equation in Sec. 60.644(b)(3).
    (5) The required sulfur dioxide emission reduction efficiency for 
the 24-hour period: The sulfur feed rate and the H<INF>2</INF>S 
concentration in the acid gas for the 24-hour period as applicable, 
shall be used to determine the required reduction efficiency in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 60.642(b).
    (b) Where compliance is achieved through the use of an oxidation 
control system or a reduction control system followed by a continually 
operated incineration device, the owner or operator shall install, 
calibrate, maintain, and operate monitoring devices and continuous 
emission monitors as follows:
    (1) A continuous monitoring system to measure the total sulfur 
emission rate (E) of SO<INF>2</INF> in the gases discharged to the 
atmosphere. The SO<INF>2</INF> emission rate shall be expressed in terms 
of equivalent sulfur mass flow rates (kg/hr (lb/hr)). The span of this 
monitoring system shall be set so that the equivalent emission limit of 
Sec. 60.642(b) will be between 30 percent and 70 percent of the 
measurement range of the instrument system.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section: A 
monitoring device to measure the temperature of the gas leaving the 
combustion zone of the incinerator, if compliance with Sec. 60.642(a) is 
achieved through the use of an oxidation control system or a reduction 
control system followed by a continually operated incineration device. 
The monitoring device shall be certified by the manufacturer to be 
accurate to within <plus-minus>1 percent of the temperature being 
measured.

When performance tests are conducted under the provision of Sec. 60.8 to 
demonstrate compliance with the standards under Sec. 60.642, the 
temperature of the gas leaving the incinerator combustion zone shall be 
determined using the monitoring device. If the volumetric ratio of 
sulfur dioxide to sulfur dioxide plus total reduced sulfur (expressed as 
SO<INF>2</INF>) in the gas leaving the incinerator is [lE]0.98, then 
temperature monitoring may be used to demonstrate that sulfur dioxide 
emission monitoring is sufficient to determine total sulfur emissions. 
At all times during the operation of the facility, the owner or operator 
shall maintain the average temperature of the gas leaving the combustion 
zone of the incinerator at or above the appropriate level determined 
during the most recent performance test to ensure the sulfur compound 
oxidation criteria are met. Operation at lower average temperatures may 
be considered by the Administrator to be unacceptable operation and 
maintenance of the affected facility. The owner or operator may request 
that the minimum incinerator temperature be reestablished by conducting 
new performance tests under Sec. 60.8.
    (3) Upon promulgation of a performance specification of continuous 
monitoring systems for total reduced sulfur compounds at sulfur recovery 
plants, the owner or operator may, as an alternative to paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section, install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous 
emission monitoring system for total reduced sulfur compounds as 
required in paragraph (d) of this section in addition to a sulfur 
dioxide emission monitoring system. The sum of the equivalent sulfur 
mass emission rates from the two monitoring systems shall be used to 
compute the total sulfur emission rate (E).
    (c) Where compliance is achieved through the use of a reduction 
control system not followed by a continually operated incineration 
device, the owner or operator shall install, calibrate, maintain, and 
operate a continuous monitoring system to measure the emission rate of 
reduced sulfur compounds as SO<INF>2</INF> equivalent in the gases 
discharged to the atmosphere. The SO<INF>2</INF> equivalent compound 
emission

[[Page 498]]

rate shall be expressed in terms of equivalent sulfur mass flow rates 
(kg/hr (lb/hr)). The span of this monitoring system shall be set so that 
the equivalent emission limit of Sec. 60.642(b) will be between 30 and 
70 percent of the measurement range of the system. This requirement 
becomes effective upon promulgation of a performance specification for 
continuous monitoring systems for total reduced sulfur compounds at 
sulfur recovery plants.
    (d) For those sources required to comply with paragraph (b) or (c) 
of this section, the average sulfur emission reduction efficiency 
achieved (R) shall be calculated for each 24-hour clock internal. The 
24-hour interval may begin and end at any selected clock time, but must 
be consistent. The 24-hour average reduction efficiency (R) shall be 
computed based on the 24-hour average sulfur production rate (S) and 
sulfur emission rate (E), using the equation in Sec. 60.644(c)(1).
    (1) Data obtained from the sulfur production rate monitoring device 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section shall be used to determine S.
    (2) Data obtained from the sulfur emission rate monitoring systems 
specified in paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section shall be used to 
calculate a 24-hour average for the sulfur emission rate (E). The 
monitoring system must provide at least one data point in each 
successive 15-minute interval. At least two data points must be used to 
calculate each 1-hour average. A minimum of 18 1-hour averages must be 
used to compute each 24-hour average.
    (e) In lieu of complying with (b) or (c) of this section, those 
sources with a design capacity of less than 152 Mg/D (150 LT/D) of 
H<INF>2</INF>S expressed as sulfur may calculate the sulfur emission 
reduction efficiency achieved for each 24-hour period by:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.032

Where:

R = The sulfur dioxide removal efficiency achieved during the 24-hour 
period, percent.
K<INF>2</INF> = Conversion factor, 0.02400 Mg/D per kg/hr (0.01071 LT/D 
per lb/hr).
S = The sulfur production rate during the 24-hour period, kg/hr (lb/hr).
X = The sulfur feed rate in the acid gas, Mg/D (LT/D).

    (f) The monitoring devices required in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(3) and 
(c) of this section shall be calibrated at least annually according to 
the manufacturer's specifications, as required by Sec. 60.13(b).
    (g) The continuous emission monitoring systems required in 
paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(3), and (c) of this section shall be subject to 
the emission monitoring requirements of Sec. 60.13 of the General 
Provisions. For conducting the continuous emission monitoring system 
performance evaluation required by Sec. 60.13(c), Performance 
Specification 2 shall apply, and Method 6 shall be used for systems 
required by paragraph (b) of this section.

the most recent performance test in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 60.646(b)(2). Each 24-hour period must consist of at least 96 
temperature measurements equally spaced over the 24 hours.

burette, with two-way glass stopcock at bottom and three-way stopcock at 
top which connect either with inlet tubulature or glass-stoppered 
cylinder, 10 ml capacity, graduated in 0.1 ml subdivision; rubber tubing 
connecting burette with leveling bottle.

and 20 to 25 g cp potassium iodide for each liter of solution. Dissolve 
KI in as little water as necessary; dissolve iodine in concentrated KI 
solution, make up to proper volume, and store in glass-stoppered brown 
glass bottle.
    (2) Standard iodine solution, 1 ml=0.001771 g I. Transfer 33.7 ml of 
above 0.1N stock solution into a 250 ml volumetric flask; add water to 
mark and mix well. Then, for 100 ml sample of gas, 1 ml of standard 
iodine solution is equivalent to 100 grains H<INF>2</INF>S per cubic 
feet of gas.
    (3) Starch solution. Rub into a thin paste about one teaspoonful of 
wheat starch with a little water; pour into about a pint of boiling 
water; stir; let cool and decant off clear solution. Make fresh solution 
every few days.
    (d) Procedure. Fill leveling bulb with starch solution. Raise (L), 
open cock (G), open (F) to (A), and close (F) when solutions starts to 
run out of gas inlet. Close (G). Purge gas sampling line and connect 
with (A). Lower (L) and open (F) and (G). When liquid level is several 
ml past the 100 ml mark, close (G) and (F), and disconnect sampling 
tube. Open (G) and bring starch solution to 100 ml mark by raising (L); 
then close (G). Open (F) momentarily, to bring gas in burette to 
atmospheric pressure, and close (F). Open (G), bring liquid level down 
to 10 ml mark by lowering (L). Close (G), clamp rubber tubing near (E) 
and disconnect it from burette. Rinse graduated cylinder with a standard 
iodine solution (0.00171 g I per ml); fill cylinder and record reading. 
Introduce successive small amounts of iodine thru (F); shake well after 
each addition; continue until a faint permanent blue color is obtained. 
Record reading; subtract from previous reading, and call difference D.
    (e) With every fresh stock of starch solution perform a blank test 
as follows: introduce fresh starch solution into burette up to 100 ml 
mark. Close (F) and (G). Lower (L) and open (G). When liquid level 
reaches the 10 ml mark, close (G). With air in burette, titrate as 
during a test and up to same end point. Call ml of iodine used C. Then,

Grains H<INF>2</INF>S per 100 cubic foot of gas=100     (D--C)


[[Page 500]]


    (f) Greater sensitivity can be attained if a 500 ml capacity 
Tutwiler burette is used with a more dilute (0.001N) iodine solution. 
Concentrations less than 1.0 grains per 100 cubic foot can be determined 
in this way. Usually, the starch-iodine end point is much less distinct, 
and a blank determination of end point, with H<INF>2</INF>S-free gas or 
air, is required.

Sec. 60.661  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, all terms not defined here shall have the 
meaning given them in the Act and in subpart A of part 60, and the 
following terms shall have the specific meanings given them.
    Batch distillation operation means a noncontinuous distillation 
operation in which a discrete quantity or batch of liquid feed is 
charged into a distillation unit and distilled at one time. After the 
initial charging of the liquid feed, no additional liquid is added 
during the distillation operation.
    Boiler means any enclosed combustion device that extracts useful 
energy in the form of steam.
    By compound means by individual stream components, not carbon 
equivalents.
    Continuous recorder means a data recording device recording an 
instantaneous data value at least once every 15 minutes.
    Distillation operation means an operation separating one or more 
feed stream(s) into two or more exit stream(s), each exit stream having 
component concentrations different from those in the feed stream(s). The 
separation is achieved by the redistribution of the components between 
the liquid and vapor-phase as they approach equilibrium within the 
distillation unit.
    Distillation unit means a device or vessel in which distillation 
operations occur, including all associated internals (such as trays or 
packing) and accessories (such as reboiler, condenser, vacuum pump, 
steam jet, etc.), plus any associated recovery system.

occupied by the flame envelope.
    Flow indicator means a device which indicates whether gas flow is 
present in a vent stream.
    Halogenated vent stream means any vent stream determined to have a 
total

[[Page 502]]

concentration (by volume) of compounds containing halogens of 20 ppmv

water that is heated to produce steam.
    Process unit means equipment assembled and connected by pipes or 
ducts to produce, as intermediates or final products, one or more of the 
chemicals in Sec. 60.667. A process unit can operate independently if 
supplied with sufficient fuel or raw materials and sufficient product 
storage facilities.
    Product means any compound or chemical listed in Sec. 60.667 that is 
produced for sale as a final product as that chemical, or for use in the 
production of other chemicals or compounds. By-products, co-products, 
and intermediates are considered to be products.
    Recovery device means an individual unit of equipment, such as an 
absorber, carbon adsorber, or condenser, capable of and used for the 
purpose of recovering chemicals for use, reuse, or sale.
    Recovery system means an individual recovery device or series of 
such devices applied to the same vent stream.
    Total organic compounds (TOC) means those compounds measured 
according to the procedures in Sec. 60.664(b)(4). For the purposes of

emissions rate as required in Sec. 60.664(d)(5) and Sec. 60.664(e); and 
TOC concentration as required in Sec. 60.665(b)(4) and 
Sec. 60.665(g)(4), those compounds which the Administrator has 
determined do not contribute appreciably to the formation of ozone are 
to be excluded. The compounds to be excluded are identified in 
Environmental Protection Agency's statements on ozone abatement policy 
for State Implementation Plans (SIP) revisions (42 FR 35314; 44 FR 
32042; 45 FR 32424; 45 FR 48942).
    TRE index value means a measure of the supplemental total resource 
requirement per unit reduction of TOC associated with an individual 
distillation vent stream, based on vent stream flow rate, emission rate 
of TOC net heating value, and corrosion properties (whether or not the 
vent stream is halogenated), as quantified by the equation given under 
Sec. 60.664(e).
    Vent stream means any gas stream discharged directly from a 
distillation facility to the atmosphere or indirectly to the atmosphere 
after diversion through other process equipment. The vent stream 
excludes relief valve discharges and equipment leaks including, but not 
limited to, pumps, compressors, and valves.


<R05>

the affected facility is normally conducted through the final recovery 
device.
    (A) The sampling site for vent stream flow rate and molar 
composition shall be prior to the final recovery device and prior to the

stream and at the outlet of the final recovery device.
    (C) This efficiency is applied to the TOC concentration measured 
prior to the final recovery device and prior to the introduction of the 
nondistillation stream to determine the concentration of TOC in the 
distillation vent stream from the final recovery device. This 
concentration of TOC is then used to perform the calculations outlined

    (2) The molar composition of the process vent stream shall be 
determined as follows:
    (i) Method 18 to measure the concentration of TOC including those 
containing halogens.
    (ii) ASTM D1946-77 or 90 (Reapproved 1994) (incorporation by 
reference as specified in Sec. 60.17 of this part) to measure the 
concentration of carbon monoxide and hydrogen.
    (iii) Method 4 to measure the content of water vapor.

[[Page 506]]

    (3) The volumetric flow rate shall be determined using Method 2, 2A, 
2C, or 2D, as appropriate.
    (4) The net heating value of the vent stream shall be calculated 
using the following equation:

where:

H<INF>T</INF> = Net heating value of the sample, MJ/scm (Btu/scf), where 
the net enthalpy per mole of vent stream is based on combustion at 25 
deg.C and 760 mm Hg (77  deg.F and 30 in. Hg), but the standard 
temperature for determining the volume corresponding to one mole is 20 
deg.C (68  deg.F).
K<INF>1</INF> = 1.74 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> (1/ppm) (g-mole/scm) (MJ/kcal) 
(metric units), where standard temperature for (g-mole/scm) is 20

    (g) Each owner or operator of an affected facility seeking to comply 
with Sec. 60.660(c)(4) or Sec. 60.662(c) shall recalculate the TRE index 
value for that affected facility whenever process changes are made. 
Examples of process changes include changes in production capacity, 
feedstock type, or catalyst type, or whenever there is replacement, 
removal, or addition of recovery equipment. The TRE index value shall be 
recalculated based on test data, or on best engineering estimates of the 
effects of the change to the recovery system.
    (1) Where the recalculated TRE index value is less than or equal to 
1.0, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator within 1 week 
of the recalculation and shall conduct a performance test according to 
the methods and procedures required by Sec. 60.664 in order to determine 
compliance with Sec. 60.662(a). Performance tests must be conducted as 
soon as possible after the process change but no later than 180 days 
from the time of the process change.
    (2) Where the initial TRE index value is greater than 8.0 and the 
recalculated TRE index value is less than or equal to 8.0 but greater 
than 1.0, the owner or operator shall conduct a performance test in 
accordance with Secs. 60.8 and 60.664 and shall comply with

unless EPA, in delegating enforcement authority to a State under section 
111(c) of the Act, approves reporting requirements or an alternative 
means of compliance surveillance adopted by such State. In that event, 
affected sources within the State will be relieved of the obligation to

following August 31, 1983.


<R05>
Sec. 60.674  Monitoring of operations.

    The owner or operator of any affected facility subject to the 
provisions of this subpart which uses a wet scrubber to control 
emissions shall install, calibrate, maintain and operate the following 
monitoring devices:
    (a) A device for the continuous measurement of the pressure loss of

<R05>
Sec. 60.675  Test methods and procedures.

    (a) In conducting the performance tests required in Sec. 60.8, the 
owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test 
methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as 
specified in this section, except as provided in Sec. 60.8(b). 
Acceptable alternative methods and procedures are given in paragraph (e) 
of this section.
    (b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the 
particulate matter standards in Sec. 60.672(a) as follows:
    (1) Method 5 or Method 17 shall be used to determine the particulate 
matter concentration. The sample volume shall be at least 1.70 dscm (60 
dscf). For Method 5, if the gas stream being sampled is at ambient 
temperature, the sampling probe and filter may be operated without 
heaters. If the gas stream is above ambient temperature, the sampling 
probe and filter may be operated at a temperature high enough, but no 
higher than 121  deg.C (250  deg.F), to prevent water condensation on 
the filter.
    (2) Method 9 and the procedures in Sec. 60.11 shall be used to 
determine opacity.
    (c)(1) In determining compliance with the particulate matter 
standards in Sec. 60.672 (b) and (c), the owner or operator shall use 
Method 9 and the procedures in Sec. 60.11, with the following additions:
    (i) The minimum distance between the observer and the emission 
source shall be 4.57 meters (15 feet).
    (ii) The observer shall, when possible, select a position that 
minimizes interference from other fugitive emission sources (e.g., road 
dust). The required observer position relative to the sun (Method 9, 
Section 2.1) must be followed.
    (iii) For affected facilities using wet dust suppression for 
particulate matter control, a visible mist is sometimes generated by the 
spray. The water mist must not be confused with particulate matter 
emissions and is not to be considered a visible emission. When a water 
mist of this nature is present, the observation of emissions is to be 
made at a point in the plume where the mist is no longer visible.
    (2) In determining compliance with the opacity of stack emissions 
from any baghouse that controls emissions only from an individual 
enclosed storage bin under Sec. 60.672(f) of this subpart, using Method 
9, the duration of the Method 9 observations shall be 1 hour (ten 6-
minute averages).
    (3) When determining compliance with the fugitive emissions standard 
for any affected facility described under Sec. 60.672(b) of this 
subpart, the duration of the Method 9 observations may be reduced from 3 
hours (thirty 6-minute averages) to 1 hour (ten 6-minute averages) only 
if the following conditions apply:
    (i) There are no individual readings greater than 10 percent 
opacity; and
    (ii) There are no more than 3 readings of 10 percent for the 1-hour 
period.
    (4) When determining compliance with the fugitive emissions standard 
for any crusher at which a capture system is not used as described under 
Sec. 60.672(c) of this subpart, the duration of the Method 9 
observations may be reduced from 3 hours (thirty 6-minute averages) to 1 
hour (ten 6-minute averages) only if the following conditions apply:
    (i) There are no individual readings greater than 15 percent 
opacity; and
    (ii) There are no more than 3 readings of 15 percent for the 1-hour 
period.
    (d) In determining compliance with Sec. 60.672(e), the owner or 
operator shall use Method 22 to determine fugitive emissions. The 
performance test shall be conducted while all affected facilities inside 
the building are operating. The performance test for each building shall 
be at least 75 minutes in duration, with each side of the building and 
the roof being observed for at least 15 minutes.

[[Page 522]]

    (e) The owner or operator may use the following as alternatives to 
the reference methods and procedures specified in this section:
    (1) For the method and procedure of paragraph (c) of this section, 
if emissions from two or more facilities continuously interfere so that 
the opacity of fugitive emissions from an individual affected facility 
cannot be read, either of the following procedures may be used:
    (i) Use for the combined emission stream the highest fugitive 
opacity standard applicable to any of the individual affected facilities 
contributing to the emissions stream.
    (ii) Separate the emissions so that the opacity of emissions from 
each affected facility can be read.
    (f) To comply with Sec. 60.676(d), the owner or operator shall 
record the measurements as required in Sec. 60.676(c) using the 
monitoring devices in Sec. 60.674 (a) and (b) during each particulate 
matter run and shall determine the averages.
    (g) If, after 30 days notice for an initially scheduled performance 
test, there is a delay (due to operational problems, etc.) in conducting 
any rescheduled performance test required in this section, the owner or 
operator of an affected facility shall submit a notice to the 
Administrator at least 7 days prior to any rescheduled performance test.
    (h) Initial Method 9 performance tests under Sec. 60.11 of this part 
and Sec. 60.675 of this subpart are not required for:
    (1) Wet screening operations and subsequent screening operations, 
bucket elevators, and belt conveyors that process saturated material in 
the production line up to, but not including the next crusher, grinding 
mill or storage bin.
    (2) Screening operations, bucket elevators, and belt conveyors in 
the production line downstream of wet mining operations, that process 
saturated materials up to the first crusher, grinding mill, or storage 
bin in the production line.

a screening operation, bucket elevator, or belt conveyor that processes 
unsaturated material but subsequently processes saturated material shall 
submit a report of this change within 30 days following such change. 
This screening operation, bucket elevator, or belt conveyor is then 
subject to the no visible emission limit in Sec. 60.672(h).
    (h) The subpart A requirement under Sec. 60.7(a)(2) for notification 
of the anticipated date of initial startup of an affected facility shall

    (1) The emission rate (E) of particulate matter shall be computed 
for each run using the following equation:

E=(C<INF>t</INF> Q<INF>sd</INF>)/(P<INF>avg</INF> K)

where:

E = emission rate of particulate matter, kg/Mg (lb/ton).
C<INF>t</INF> = concentration of particulate matter, g/dscm (gr/dscf).
Q<INF>sd</INF> = volumetric flow rate of effluent gas, dscm/hr (dscf/

shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate according to 
manufacturer's specifications the following equipment, unless 
alternative monitoring procedures or requirements are approved for that 
facility by the Administrator.
    (1) Where a thermal incinerator is used for VOC emission reduction, 
a temperature monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder 
shall be used to measure the temperature of the gas stream in the 
combustion zone of the incinerator. The temperature monitoring device 
shall have an accuracy of <plus-minus>1 percent of the temperature being 
measured, expressed in  deg.C, or <plus-minus>0.5  deg.C (0.9  deg.F), 
whichever is greater.
    (2) Where a catalytic incinerator is used for VOC emission 
reduction, temperature monitoring devices, each equipped with a 
continuous recorder shall be used to measure the temperature in the gas 
stream immediately before and after the catalyst bed of the incinerator. 
The temperature monitoring devices shall have an accuracy of 
<plus-minus>1 percent of the temperature being measured, expressed in 
deg.C, or <plus-minus>0.5  deg.C (0.9  deg.F), whichever is greater.
    (3) Where a carbon adsorber is used for VOC emissions reduction, a 
monitoring device that continuously indicates and records the VOC 
concentration level or reading of organics in the exhaust gases of the 
control device outlet gas stream or inlet and outlet gas stream shall be 
used.
    (i) For a carbon adsorption system that regenerates the carbon bed 
directly onsite, a monitoring device that continuously indicates and 
records the volatile organic compound concentration level or reading of 
organics in the exhaust gases of the control device outlet gas stream or 
inlet and outlet gas stream shall be used.
    (ii) For a carbon adsorption system that does not regenerate the 
carbon bed directly onsite in the control device (e.g., a carbon 
canister), the concentration level of the organic compounds in the 
exhaust vent stream from the carbon adsorption system shall be monitored 
on a regular schedule, and the existing carbon shall be replaced with 
fresh carbon immediately when carbon breakthrough is indicated. The 
device shall be monitored on a daily basis or at intervals no greater 
than 20 percent of the design carbon replacement interval, whichever is 
greater. As an alternative to

[[Page 532]]

conducting this monitoring, an owner or operator may replace the carbon 
in the carbon adsorption system with fresh carbon at a regular 
predetermined time interval that is less than the carbon replacement 
interval that is determined by the maximum design flow rate and organic 
concentration in the gas stream vented to the carbon adsorption system.
    (4) Where a flare is used for VOC emission reduction, the owner or 
operator shall comply with the monitoring requirements of 40 CFR 
60.18(f)(2).
    (b) Where a VOC recovery device other than a carbon adsorber is used 
to meet the requirements specified in Sec. 60.692-5(a), the owner or 
operator shall provide to the Administrator information describing the 
operation of the control device and the process parameter(s) that would 
indicate proper operation and maintenance of the device. The 
Administrator may request further information and will specify 
appropriate monitoring procedures or requirements.
    (c) An alternative operational or process parameter may be monitored 
if it can be demonstrated that another parameter will ensure that the 
control device is operated in conformance with these standards and the 
control device's design specifications.

requirements of Sec. 60.692-2, Sec. 60.692-3, Sec. 60.692-4, 
Sec. 60.692-5, or Sec. 60.693, the owner or operator shall inspect such 
equipment for indications of potential emissions, defects, or other 
problems that may cause the requirements of this subpart not to be met. 
Points of inspection shall include, but are not limited to, seals, 
flanges, joints, gaskets, hatches, caps, and plugs.
    (b) The owner or operator of each source that is equipped with a 
closed vent system and control device as required in Sec. 60.692-5 
(other than a flare) is exempt from Sec. 60.8 of the General Provisions 
and shall use Method 21 to measure the emission concentrations, using 
500 ppm as the no detectable emission limit. The instrument shall be 
calibrated each day before using. The calibration gases shall be:
    (1) Zero air (less than 10 ppm of hydrocarbon in air), and
    (2) A mixture of either methane or n-hexane and air at a 
concentration of approximately, but less than, 10,000 ppm methane or n-
hexane.
    (c) The owner or operator shall conduct a performance test 
initially, and at other times as requested by the Administrator, using 
the test methods and procedures in Sec. 60.18(f) to determine compliance 
of flares.
    (d) After installing the control equipment required to meet 
Sec. 60.693-2(a) or whenever sources that have ceased to treat refinery 
wastewater for a period of 1 year or more are placed back into service, 
the owner or operator shall determine compliance with the standards in 
Sec. 60.693-2(a) as follows:
    (1) The maximum gap widths and maximum gap areas between the primary 
seal and the separator wall and between the secondary seal and the 
separator wall shall be determined individually within 60 calendar days 
of the initial installation of the floating roof and introduction of 
refinery wastewater or 60 calendar days after the equipment is placed 
back into service using the following procedure when the separator is 
filled to the design operating level and when the roof is floating off 
the roof supports.
    (i) Measure seal gaps around the entire perimeter of the separator 
in each place where a 0.32 cm (0.125 in.) diameter uniform probe passes 
freely (without forcing or binding against seal) between the seal and 
the wall of the separator and measure the gap width and perimetrical 
distance of each such location.
    (ii) The total surface area of each gap described in (d)(1)(i) of 
this section shall be determined by using probes of various widths to 
measure accurately the actual distance from the wall to the seal and 
multiplying each such width by its respective perimetrical distance.
    (iii) Add the gap surface area of each gap location for the primary 
seal and the secondary seal individually, divide

[[Page 533]]

the sum for each seal by the nominal perimeter of the separator basin 
and compare each to the maximum gap area as specified in Sec. 60.693-2.
    (2) The gap widths and total gap area shall be determined using the 
procedure in paragraph (d)(1) of this section according to the following 
frequency:
    (i) For primary seals, once every 5 years.
    (ii) For secondary seals, once every year.

Sec. 60.701  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, all terms not defined here shall have the 
meaning given them in the Act and in subpart A of part 60, and the 
following terms shall have the specific meanings given them.
    Batch operation means any noncontinuous reactor process that is not 
characterized by steady-state conditions and in which reactants are not 
added and products are not removed simultaneously.

[[Page 538]]

    Boiler means any enclosed combustion device that extracts useful 
energy in the form of steam and is not an incinerator.
    By compound means by individual stream components, not carbon 
equivalents.
    Car-seal means a seal that is placed on a device that is used to 
change the position of a valve (e.g., from opened to closed) in such a 
way that the position of the valve cannot be changed without breaking 
the seal.
    Combustion device means an individual unit of equipment, such as an 
incinerator, flare, boiler, or process heater, used for combustion of a 
vent stream discharged from the process vent.
    Continuous recorder means a data recording device recording an 
instantaneous data value at least once every 15 minutes.
    Flame zone means the portion of the combustion chamber in a boiler 
occupied by the flame envelope.
    Flow indicator means a device which indicates whether gas flow is 
present in a line.
    Halogenated vent stream means any vent stream determined to have a 
total concentration (by volume) of compounds containing halogens of 20 
ppmv (by compound) or greater.
    Incinerator means an enclosed combustion device that is used for 
destroying organic compounds. If there is energy recovery, the energy 
recovery section and the combustion chambers are not of integral design. 
That is, the energy recovery section and the combustion section are not 
physically formed into one manufactured or assembled unit but are joined 
by ducts or connections carrying flue gas.
    Primary fuel means the fuel fired through a burner or a number of 
similar burners. The primary fuel provides the principal heat input to 
the device, and the amount of fuel is sufficient to sustain operation 
without the addition of other fuels.
    Process heater means a device that transfers heat liberated by 
burning fuel directly to process streams or to heat transfer liquids 
other than water.
    Process unit means equipment assembled and connected by pipes or 
ducts to produce, as intermediates or final products, one or more of the 
chemicals in Sec. 60.707. A process unit can operate independently if 
supplied with sufficient feed or raw materials and sufficient product 
storage facilities.
    Product means any compound or chemical listed in Sec. 60.707 which 
is produced for sale as a final product as that chemical, or for use in 
the production of other chemicals or compounds. By-products, co-
products, and intermediates are considered to be products.
    Reactor processes are unit operations in which one or more 
chemicals, or reactants other than air, are combined or decomposed in 
such a way that their molecular structures are altered and one or more 
new organic compounds are formed.
    Recovery device means an individual unit of equipment, such as an 
absorber, carbon adsorber, or condenser, capable of and used for the 
purpose of recovering chemicals for use, reuse, or sale.
    Recovery system means an individual recovery device or series of 
such devices applied to the same vent stream.
    Relief valve means a valve used only to release an unplanned, 
nonroutine discharge. A relief valve discharge results from an operator 
error, a malfunction such as a power failure or equipment failure, or 
other unexpected cause that requires immediate venting of gas from 
process equipment in order to avoid safety hazards or equipment damage.
    Secondary fuel means a fuel fired through a burner other than a 
primary fuel burner. The secondary fuel may provide supplementary heat 
in addition to the heat provided by the primary fuel.
    Total organic compounds or TOC means those compounds measured 
according to the procedures in Sec. 60.704(b)(4). For the purposes of 
measuring molar composition as required in Sec. 60.704(d)(2)(i) and 
Sec. 60.704(d)(2)(ii), hourly emission rate as required in 
Sec. 60.704(d)(5) and Sec. 60.704(e), and TOC concentration as required 
in Sec. 60.705(b)(4) and Sec. 60.705(f)(4), those compounds which the 
Administrator has determined do not contribute appreciably to the 
formation of ozone are to be excluded.

[[Page 539]]

    Total resource effectiveness or TRE index value means a measure of 
the supplemental total resource requirement per unit reduction of TOC 
associated with a vent stream from an affected reactor process facility, 
based on vent stream flow rate, emission rate of TOC, net heating value, 
and corrosion properties (whether or not the vent stream contains 
halogenated compounds), as quantified by the equation given under 
Sec. 60.704(e).
    Vent stream means any gas stream discharged directly from a reactor 
process to the atmosphere or indirectly to the atmosphere after 
diversion through other process equipment. The vent stream excludes 
relief valve discharges and equipment leaks.

    (C) This efficiency of the final recovery device shall be applied to 
the TOC concentration measured prior to the final recovery device and 
prior to the introduction of any nonreactor stream or stream from a

    (f) Each owner or operator of an affected facility seeking to comply 
with Sec. 60.700(c)(2) or Sec. 60.702(c) shall recalculate the TRE index 
value for that affected facility whenever process changes are made. 
Examples of process changes include changes in production capacity, 
feedstock type, or catalyst type, or whenever there is replacement, 
removal, or addition of recovery equipment. The TRE index value shall be 
recalculated based on test data, or on best engineering estimates of the 
effects of the change on the recovery system.
    (1) Where the recalculated TRE index value is less than or equal to 
1.0, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator within 1 week 
of the recalculation and shall conduct a performance test according to 
the methods and procedures required by Sec. 60.704 in order to determine 
compliance with Sec. 60.702 (a) or (b). Performance tests must be 
conducted as soon as possible after the process change but no later than 
180 days from the time of the process change.
    (2) Where the recalculated TRE index value is less than or equal to 
8.0 but greater than 1.0, the owner or operator shall conduct a 
performance test in accordance with Sec. 60.8 and Sec. 60.704 and shall 
comply with Sec. 60.703, Sec. 60.704 and Sec. 60.705. Performance tests 
must be conducted as soon as possible after the process change but no 
later than 180 days from the time of the process change.
    (g) Any owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart 
seeking to demonstrate compliance with Sec. 60.700(c)(4) shall use 
Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, 
for determination of volumetric flow rate.
    (h) Each owner or operator seeking to demonstrate that a reactor 
process vent stream has a TOC concentration for compliance with the low 
concentration exemption in Sec. 60.700(c)(8) shall conduct an initial 
test to measure TOC concentration.

[[Page 546]]

    (1) The sampling site shall be selected as specified in paragraph 
(d)(1)(i) of this section.
    (2) Method 18 or Method 25A of part 60, appendix A shall be used to 
measure concentration.
    (3) Where Method 18 is used to qualify for the low concentration 
exclusion in Sec. 60.700(c)(8), the procedures in Sec. 60.704(b)(4) (i) 
and (iv) shall be used to measure TOC concentration, and the procedures 
of Sec. 60.704(b)(3) shall be used to correct the TOC concentration to 3 
percent oxygen. To qualify for the exclusion, the results must 
demonstrate that the concentration of TOC, corrected to 3 percent 
oxygen, is below 300 ppm by volume.
    (4) Where Method 25A is used, the following procedures shall be used 
to calculate ppm by volume TOC concentration, corrected to 3 percent 
oxygen:
    (i) Method 25A shall be used only if a single organic compound is 
greater than 50 percent of total TOC, by volume, in the reactor process 
vent stream. This compound shall be the principal organic compound.
    (ii) The principal organic compound may be determined by either 
process knowledge or test data collected using an appropriate EPA 
Reference Method. Examples of information that could constitute process 
knowledge include calculations based on material balances, process 
stoichiometry, or previous test results provided the results are still 
relevant to the current reactor process vent stream conditions.
    (iii) The principal organic compound shall be used as the 
calibration gas for Method 25A.
    (iv) The span value for Method 25A shall be 300 ppmv.
    (v) Use of Method 25A is acceptable if the response from the high-
level calibration gas is at least 20 times the standard deviation of the 
response from the zero calibration gas when the instrument is zeroed on 
the most sensitive scale.
    (vi) The owner or operator shall demonstrate that the concentration 
of TOC including methane and ethane measured by Method 25A, corrected to 
3 percent oxygen, is below 150 ppm by volume to qualify for the low 
concentration exclusion in Sec. 60.700(c)(8).
    (vii) The concentration of TOC shall be corrected to 3 percent 
oxygen using the procedures and equation in paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section.

Administrator of the specific provisions of Sec. 60.702 (Sec. 60.702 
(a), (b), or (c)) with which the owner or operator has elected to 
comply. Notification shall be submitted with the notification of initial 
start-up required by Sec. 60.7(a)(3). If an owner or operator elects at 
a later date to use an alternative provision of Sec. 60.702 with which 
he or she will comply, then the Administrator shall be notified by the 
owner or operator 90 days before implementing a change and, upon 
implementing the change, a performance test shall be performed as 
specified by Sec. 60.704 no later than 180 days from initial start-up.
    (b) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart 
shall keep an up-to-date, readily accessible record of the following

period of the performance testing while the vent stream is normally 
routed and constituted.
    (v) All measurements and calculations performed to determine the TRE 
index value of the vent stream.
    (c) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart 
shall keep up-to-date, readily accessible continuous records of the 
equipment operating parameters specified to be monitored under 
Sec. 60.703 (a) and (c) as well as up-to-date, readily accessible 
records of periods of operation during which the parameter boundaries 
established during the most recent performance test are exceeded. The 
Administrator may at any time require a report of these data. Where a 
combustion device is used to comply with Sec. 60.702(a), periods of 
operation during which the parameter boundaries established during the 
most recent performance tests are exceeded are defined as follows:
    (1) For thermal incinerators, all 3-hour periods of operation during

    (2) For catalytic incinerators, all 3-hour periods of operation 
during which the average temperature of the vent stream immediately 
before the catalyst bed is more than 28  deg.C (50  deg.F) below the 
average temperature of the vent stream during the most recent 
performance test at which compliance with Sec. 60.702(a) was determined. 
The owner or operator also shall record all 3-hour periods of operation 
during which the average temperature difference across the catalyst bed 
is less than 80 percent of the average temperature difference of the bed 
during the most recent performance test at which compliance with

    (3) All 3-hour periods of operation during which the average 
combustion temperature was more than 28  deg.C (50  deg.F) below the 
average combustion temperature during the most recent performance test 
at which compliance with Sec. 60.702(a) was determined for boilers or 
process heaters with a design heat input capacity of less than 44 MW 
(150 million Btu/hr) where the vent stream is introduced with the 
combustion air or as a secondary fuel.
    (4) For boilers or process heaters, whenever there is a change in 
the location at which the vent stream is introduced into the flame zone 
as required under Sec. 60.702(a).
    (d) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart 
shall keep records of the following:
    (1) Up-to-date, readily accessible continuous records of the flow 
indication specified under Sec. 60.703(a)(2)(i), Sec. 60.703(b)(2)(i)

Sec. 60.703(a)(2)(ii), Sec. 60.703(b)(2)(ii), and Sec. 60.703(c)(1)(ii), 
a record of continuous flow is not required. In such cases, the owner or 
operator shall keep up-to-date, readily accessible records of all 
monthly visual inspections of the seals as well as readily accessible 
records of all periods and the duration when the seal mechanism is 
broken, the bypass line valve position has changed, the serial number of

absorbing liquid specific gravity was more than 0.1 unit above, or more 
than 0.1 unit below, the average absorbing liquid specific gravity 
during the most recent performance test (unless monitoring of an 
alternative parameter, which is a measure of the degree of absorbing 
liquid saturation, is approved by the Administrator, in which case he 
will define appropriate parameter boundaries and periods of operation 
during which they are exceeded).
    (2) Where a condenser is the final recovery device in a system, and

of the carbon bed after regeneration (and after completion of any 
cooling cycle(s)) was more than 10 percent or 5  deg.C greater, 
whichever is less stringent, than the carbon bed temperature (in degrees 
Celsius) during the most recent performance test.
    (4) Where an absorber, condenser, or carbon adsorber is the final 
recovery device in the recovery system and where an organic compound 
monitoring device is used, all 3-hour periods of operation during which 
the average organic compound concentration level or reading of organic 
compounds in the exhaust gases is more than 20 percent greater than the 
exhaust gas organic compound concentration level or reading measured by 
the monitoring device during the most recent performance test.

rate cutoff in Sec. 60.700(c)(4) shall keep up-to-date, readily 
accessible records to indicate that the vent stream flow rate is less 
than 0.011 scm/min and of any change in equipment or process operation 
that increases the operating vent stream flow rate, including a 
measurement of the new vent stream flow rate.
    (i) Each owner or operator of an affected facility that seeks to 
comply with the requirements of this subpart by complying with the 
design production capacity provision in Sec. 60.700(c)(3) shall keep up-

comply with the requirements of this subpart by complying with the low 
concentration exemption in Sec. 60.700(c)(8) shall keep up-to-date, 
readily accessible records of any change in equipment or process 
operation that increases the concentration of the vent stream of the 
affected facility.
    (k) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart 
is exempt from the quarterly reporting requirements contained in 
Sec. 60.7(c) of the General Provisions.
    (l) Each owner or operator that seeks to comply with the 
requirements of this subpart by complying with the requirements of 
Sec. 60.700 (c)(2), (c)(3), or (c)(4) or Sec. 60.702 shall submit to the 
Administrator semiannual reports of the following recorded information. 
The initial report shall be submitted within 6 months after the initial 
start-up date.
    (1) Exceedances of monitored parameters recorded under Sec. 60.705 
(c), (f), and (g).
    (2) All periods and duration recorded under Sec. 60.705(d) when the

    (4) Any change in equipment or process operation that increases the 
operating vent stream flow rate above the

[[Page 550]]

low flow exemption level in Sec. 60.700(c)(4), including a measurement 
of the new vent stream flow rate, as recorded under Sec. 60.705(i). 
These must be reported as soon as possible after the change and no later 
than 180 days after the change. These reports may be submitted either in 
conjunction with semiannual reports or as a single separate report. A 
performance test must be completed within the same time period to verify 
the recalculated flow value and to obtain the vent stream 
characteristics of heating value and E<INF>TOC.</INF> The performance 
test is subject to the requirements of Sec. 60.8 of the General 
Provisions. Unless the facility qualifies for an exemption under any of 
the exemption provisions listed in Sec. 60.700(c), except for the total 
resource effectiveness index greater than 8.0 exemption in 
Sec. 60.700(c)(2), the facility must begin compliance with the

    (5) Any change in equipment or process operation, as recorded under 
paragraph (i) of this section, that increases the design production 
capacity above the low capacity exemption level in Sec. 60.700(c)(3) and 
the new capacity resulting from the change for the reactor process unit 
containing the affected facility. These must be reported as soon as 
possible after the change and no later than 180 days after the change. 
These reports may be submitted either in conjunction with semiannual 
reports or as a single separate report. A performance test must be 
completed within the same time period to obtain the vent stream flow 
rate, heating value, and E<INF>TOC.</INF> The performance test is 
subject to the requirements of Sec. 60.8. The facility must begin 
compliance with the requirements set forth in Sec. 60.702 or 
Sec. 60.700(d). If the facility chooses to comply with Sec. 60.702, the 
facility may qualify for an exemption under Sec. 60.700(c)(2), (4), or 
(8).
    (6) Any recalculation of the TRE index value, as recorded under 
Sec. 60.705(g).
    (7) All periods recorded under Sec. 60.705(d) in which the seal 
mechanism is broken or the by-pass line valve position has changed. A 
record of the serial number of the car-seal or a record to show that the 
key to unlock the bypass line valve was checked out must be maintained 
to demonstrate the period, the duration, and frequency in which the 
bypass line was operated.
    (8) Any change in equipment or process operation that increases the 
vent stream concentration above the low concentration exemption level in 
Sec. 60.700(c)(8), including a measurement of the new vent stream 
concentration, as recorded under Sec. 60.705(j). These must be reported 
as soon as possible after the change and no later than 180 days after 
the change. These reports may be submitted either in conjunction with 
semiannual reports or as a single separate report. If the vent stream 
concentration is above 300 ppmv as measured using Method 18 or above 150 
ppmv as measured using Method 25A, a performance test must be completed 
within the same time period to obtain the vent stream flow rate, heating 
value, and E<INF>TOC.</INF> The performance test is subject to the 
requirements of Sec. 60.8 of the General Provisions. Unless the facility 
qualifies for an exemption under any of the exemption provisions listed 
in Sec. 60.700(c), except for the TRE index greater than 8.0 exemption 
in Sec. 60.700(c)(2), the facility must begin compliance with the 
requirements set forth in Sec. 60.702.
    (m) The requirements of Sec. 60.705(l) remain in force until and 
unless EPA, in delegating enforcement authority to a State under section 
111(c) of the Act, approves reporting requirements or an alternative 
means of compliance surveillance adopted by such State. In that event, 
affected sources within the State will be relieved of the obligation to 
comply with Sec. 60.705(l), provided that they comply with the 
requirements established by the State.
    (n) Each owner or operator that seeks to demonstrate compliance with 
Sec. 60.700(c)(3) must submit to the Administrator an initial report 
detailing the design production capacity of the process unit.
    (o) Each owner or operator that seeks to demonstrate compliance with 
Sec. 60.700(c)(4) must submit to the Administrator an initial report 
including a flow rate measurement using the test methods specified in 
Sec. 60.704.
    (p) Each owner or operator that seeks to demonstrate compliance with

[[Page 551]]

Sec. 60.700(c)(8) must submit to the Administrator an initial report 
including a concentration measurement using the test method specified in 
Sec. 60.704.
    (q) The Administrator will specify appropriate reporting and 
recordkeeping requirements where the owner or operator of an affected 
facility complies with the standards specified under Sec. 60.702 other 
than as provided under Sec. 60.703 (a), (b), (c), and (d).
    (r) Each owner or operator whose reactor process vent stream is 
routed to a distillation unit subject to subpart NNN and who seeks to 
demonstrate compliance with Sec. 60.700(c)(5) shall submit to the 
Administrator a process design description as part of the initial 
report. This process design description must be retained for the life of 
the process. No other records or reports would be required unless 
process changes are made.
    (s) Each owner or operator who seeks to demonstrate compliance with 
Sec. 60.702 (a) or (b) using a control device must maintain on file a 
schematic diagram of the affected vent streams, collection system(s), 
fuel systems, control devices, and bypass systems as part of the initial 
report. This schematic diagram must be retained for the life of the 
system.
    (t) Each owner or operator that seeks to demonstrate compliance with 
Sec. 60.700(c)(2) must maintain a record of the initial test for 
determining the total resource effectiveness index and the results of 
the initial total resource effectiveness index calculation.

<R05>
Sec. 60.710  Applicability and designation of affected facility.

    (a) The affected facilities to which the provisions of this subpart 
apply are:
    (1) Each coating operation; and
    (2) Each piece of coating mix preparation equipment.
    (b) Any new coating operation that utilizes less than 38 m\3\ of 
solvent or any modified or reconstructed coating operation that utilizes 
less than 370 m\3\ of solvent for the manufacture of magnetic tape per 
calendar year is subject only to the requirements of Secs. 60.714(a), 
60.717(b), and 60.717(c). If the amount of solvent utilized for the 
manufacture of magnetic tape equals or exceeds these amounts in any 
calendar year, the facility is subject to Sec. 60.712 and all other 
sections of this subpart. Once a facility has become subject to 
Sec. 60.712 and all other sections of this subpart, it will remain 
subject to those requirements regardless of changes in annual solvent 
utilization.
    (c) This subpart applies to any affected facility for which 
construction, modification, or reconstruction begins after January 22, 
1986.


<R05>
Sec. 60.711  Definitions, symbols, and cross reference tables.

    (a) All terms used in this subpart that are not defined below have 
the meaning given to them in the Act and in subpart A of this part.
    (1) Base film means the substrate that is coated to produce magnetic 
tape.
    (2) Capture system means any device or combination of devices that 
contains or collects an airborne pollutant and directs it into a duct.
    (3) Coating applicator means any apparatus used to apply a coating 
to a continuous base film.
    (4) Coating mix preparation equipment means all mills, mixers, 
holding tanks, polishing tanks, and other equipment used in the 
preparation of the magnetic coating formulation but does not include 
those mills that do not emit VOC because they are closed, sealed, and 
operated under pressure.
    (5) Coating operation means any coating applicator, flashoff area, 
and drying oven located between a base film unwind station and a base 
film rewind station that coat a continuous base film to produce magnetic 
tape.
    (6) Common emission control device means a control device 
controlling emissions from the coating operation as well as from another 
emission source within the plant.
    (7) Concurrent means construction of a control device is commenced 
or completed within the period beginning 6 months prior to the date 
construction of affected coating mix preparation equipment commences and 
ending 2 years after the date construction of affected coating mix 
preparation equipment is completed.
    (8) Control device means any apparatus that reduces the quantity of 
a pollutant emitted to the air.
    (9) Cover means, with respect to coating mix preparation equipment, 
a device that lies over the equipment opening to prevent VOC from 
escaping and that meets the requirements found in Sec. 60.712(c)(1)-(5).
    (10) Drying oven means a chamber in which heat is used to bake, 
cure, polymerize, or dry a surface coating.
    (11) Equivalent diameter means four times the area of an opening 
divided by its perimeter.
    (12) Flashoff area means the portion of a coating operation between 
the coating applicator and the drying oven where solvent begins to 
evaporate from the coated base film.
    (13) Magnetic tape means any flexible substrate that is covered on 
one or both sides with a coating containing magnetic particles and that 
is used for audio or video recording or information storage.
    (14) Natural draft opening means any opening in a room, building, or 
total enclosure that remains open during operation of the facility and 
that is not connected to a duct in which a fan is installed. The rate 
and direction of the natural draft across such an opening is a 
consequence of the difference in pressures on either side of the wall 
containing the opening.
    (15) Nominal 1-month period means a calendar month or, if 
established prior to the performance test in a statement submitted with 
notification of anticipated startup pursuant to 40 CFR

[[Page 554]]

60.7(a)(2), a similar monthly time period (e.g., 30-day month or 
accounting month).
    (16) Temporary enclosure means a total enclosure that is constructed 
for the sole purpose of measuring the fugitive emissions from an 
affected facility. A temporary enclosure must be constructed and 
ventilated (through stacks suitable for testing) so that it has minimal 
impact on the performance of the permanent capture system. A temporary 
enclosure will be assumed to achieve total capture of fugitive VOC 
emissions if it conforms to the requirements found in 
Sec. 60.713(b)(5)(i) and if all natural draft openings are at least four 
duct or hood equivalent diameters away from each exhaust duct or hood. 
Alternatively, the owner or operator may apply to the Administrator for 
approval of a temporary enclosure on a case-by-case basis.
    (17) Total enclosure means a structure that is constructed around a 
source of emissions so that all VOC emissions are collected and 
exhausted through a stack or duct. With a total enclosure, there will be 
no fugitive emissions, only stack emissions. The only openings in a 
total enclosure are forced makeup air and exhaust ducts and any natural 
draft openings such as those that allow raw materials to enter and exit 
the enclosure for processing. All access doors or windows are closed 
during routine operation of the enclosed source. Brief, occasional 
openings of such doors or windows to accommodate process equipment 
adjustments are acceptable, but, if such openings are routine or if an 
access door remains open during the entire operation, the access door 
must be considered a natural draft opening. The average inward face 
velocity across the natural draft openings of the enclosure must be 
calculated including the area of such access doors. The drying oven 
itself may be part of the total enclosure. A permanent enclosure that 
meets the requirements found in Sec. 60.713(b)(5)(i) is assumed to be a 
total enclosure. The owner or operator of a permanent enclosure that 
does not meet the requirements may apply to the Administrator for 
approval of the enclosure as a total enclosure on a case-by-case basis. 
Such approval shall be granted upon a demonstration to the satisfaction 
of the Administrator that all VOC emissions are contained and vented to 
the control device.
    (18) Utilize refers to the use of solvent that is delivered to 
coating mix preparation equipment for the purpose of formulating 
coatings to be applied on an affected coating operation and any other 
solvent (e.g., dilution solvent) that is added at any point in the 
manufacturing process.
    (19) VOC content of the coating applied means the product of Method 
24 VOC analyses or formulation data (if the data are demonstrated to be 
equivalent to Method 24 results) and the total volume of coating fed to 
the coating applicator. This quantity is intended to include all VOC 
that actually are emitted from the coating operation in the gaseous 
phase. Thus, for purposes of the liquid-liquid VOC material balance in 
Sec. 60.713(b)(1), any VOC (including dilution solvent) added to the 
coatings must be accounted for, and any VOC contained in waste coatings 
or retained in the final product may be measured and subtracted from the 
total. (These adjustments are not necessary for the gaseous emission 
test compliance provisions of Sec. 60.713(b).)
    (20) Volatile Organic Compounds or VOC means any organic compounds 
that participate in atmospheric photochemical reactions or that are 
measured by Method 18, 24, 25, or 25A or an equivalent or alternative 
method as defined in 40 CFR 60.2.
    (b) The nomenclature used in this subpart has the following meaning:

    (4) To demonstrate compliance with Sec. 60.712(a), (b)(1), or (b)(3) 
(standards for coating operations) when the VOC emissions from more than 
one affected coating operation are collected by a common capture system 
and are vented through a common duct to a control device that is also 
controlling emissions from nonaffected sources and the emissions from 
the nonaffected sources are vented separately from the affected coating 
operations, the owner or operator may:
    (i) Consider the combined affected coating operations as a single 
emission source; and
    (ii) Conduct a compliance test on this single source by the methods 
described in Sec. 60.713(b)(2) or (3), as applicable.
    (5) An alternative method of demonstrating compliance with 
Sec. 60.712(a) or (b)(3) (standards for coating operations) and the sole 
method of demonstrating compliance with Sec. 60.712(b)(2) (standards for 
modified or reconstructed coating operations) is the installation of a 
total enclosure around the coating operation and the ventilation of all 
VOC emissions from the total enclosure to a control device with the

as applicable. If this method is selected, the compliance test methods 
described in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(4) of this 
section are not required. Instead, each owner or operator of an affected 
coating operation shall:
    (i) Demonstrate that a total enclosure is installed. An enclosure 
that meets the requirements in paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(A) through (D) of 
this section shall be assumed to be a total enclosure. The owner or

requirements may apply to the Administrator for approval of the 
enclosure as a total enclosure on a case-by-case basis. The enclosure 
shall be considered a total enclosure if it is demonstrated to the 
satisfaction of the Administrator that all VOC emissions from the 
affected coating operation are contained and vented to the control 
device. The requirements for automatic approval are as follows:
    (A) Total area of all natural draft openings shall not exceed 5 
percent of the total surface area of the total enclosure's walls, floor, 
and ceiling;
    (B) All sources of emissions within the enclosure shall be a minimum 
of four equivalent diameters away from each natural draft opening;

[[Page 563]]

    (C) Average inward face velocity across all natural draft openings 
(FV) shall be a minimum of 3,600 meters per hour as determined by the 
following procedures:
    (1) Construct all forced makeup air ducts and all exhaust ducts so 
that the volumetric flow rate in each can be accurately determined by 
the test methods and procedures specified in Sec. 60.715(c) and (d). 
Volumetric flow rates shall be calculated without the adjustment 
normally made for moisture content; and
    (2) Determine FV by the following equation:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.062
    
    (D) The air passing through all natural draft openings shall flow 
into the enclosure continuously. If FV is less than or equal to 9,000 
meters per hour, the continuous inward flow of air shall be verified by 
continuous observation using smoke tubes, streamers, tracer gases, or 
other means approved by the Administrator over the period that the 
volumetric flow rate tests required to determine FV are carried out. If 
FV is greater than 9,000 meters per hour, the direction of airflow 
through the natural draft openings shall be presumed to be inward at all 
times without verification.
    (ii) Determine the control device efficiency using Equation (2) or 
Equations (4) and (5), as applicable, and the test methods and 
procedures specified in Sec. 60.715(b) through (g).

enclosure is demonstrated and the value of E determined from Equation 
(2) (or the value of H<INF>sys</INF> determined from Equations (4) and 
(5), as applicable) is equal to or greater than the required efficiency 
as specified below:
    (A) For coating operations subject to the standards of 
Sec. 60.712(a), (b)(2)(ii), and (b)(3), 0.95 (95 percent); or

Sec. 60.712(b)(2)(i), the value of E determined from Equation (2) (or 
the value of H<INF>sys</INF> determined from Equations (4) and (5), as 
applicable) pursuant to Sec. 60.713(a)(2) prior to modification or 
reconstruction or 0.95 (95 percent), whichever is lower.
    (6) To demonstrate compliance with Sec. 60.712(c) (standard for new 
mix equipment with concurrent construction of a control device), each 
owner or operator of affected coating mix preparation equipment shall 
demonstrate upon inspection that:
    (i) Covers satisfying the requirements of Sec. 60.712(c)(1)-(5) have 
been installed and are being used properly;
    (ii) Procedures detailing the proper use of covers, as specified in 
Sec. 60.712(c)(1), have been posted in all areas where affected coating 
mix preparation equipment is used;
    (iii) The coating mix preparation equipment is vented to a control 
device; and
    (iv) The control device efficiency (E or H<INF>sys</INF>, as 
applicable) determined using Equation (2) or Equations (4) and (5),

    (i) Covers satisfying the requirements of Sec. 60.712(c)(1)-(5) have 
been installed and are being used properly; and

[[Page 564]]

    (ii) Procedures detailing the proper use of covers, as specified in 
Sec. 60.712(c)(1), have been posted in all areas where affected coating 
mix preparation equipment is used.
    (9) To determine compliance with Sec. 60.712(e) (high-solids 
coatings alternative standard), each owner or operator of an affected 
facility shall determine the weighted average mass of VOC contained in 
the coating per volume of coating solids applied for each and every 
nominal 1-month period according to the following procedures:
    (i) Determine the weight fraction of VOC in each coating applied

equal to 0.20 kilogram of VOC per liter of coating solids applied, the 
facility is in compliance.
    (c) Startups and shutdowns are normal operation for this source 
category. Emissions from these operations are to be included when 
determining if the standards for coating operations specified in 
Sec. 60.712(a) and (b) are being attained.
    (d) If a control device other than a carbon adsorber, condenser, or 
incinerator is used to control emissions from an affected facility, the 
necessary operating specifications for that device must be obtained from 
the Administrator. An example of such a device is a flare.

    (a) Each owner or operator of an affected coating operation that 
utilizes less solvent annually than the applicable cutoff provided in 
Sec. 60.710(b) and that is not subject to Sec. 60.712 (standards for 
coating operations) shall maintain records of actual solvent use.
    (b) Each owner or operator of an affected coating operation

Sec. 60.713(b)(1) (liquid material balance) shall maintain records of 
all the following for each and every nominal 1-month period:
    (1) Amount of coating applied at the applicator;
    (2) Results of the reference test method specified in Sec. 60.715(a) 
for determining the VOC content of all coatings applied;
    (3) Amount VOC recovered; and
    (4) Calculation of the percent VOC recovered.
    (c) Each owner or operator of an affected coating operation or 
affected coating mix preparation equipment controlled by a carbon 
adsorption system and demonstrating compliance by the procedures 
described in Sec. 60.713(b)(2), (3), (4), (5), or (6) (which include 
control device efficiency determinations) shall carry out the monitoring 
and recordkeeping provisions of paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section, 
as appropriate.
    (1) For carbon adsorption systems with a common exhaust stack for 
all the individual adsorber vessels, install, calibrate, maintain, and 
operate, according to the manufacturer's specifications, a monitoring 
device that continuously indicates and records the

[[Page 565]]

concentration level of organic compounds in either the control device 
outlet gas stream or in both the control device inlet and outlet gas 
streams. The outlet gas stream would be monitored if the percent 
increase in the concentration level of organic compounds is used as the 
basis for reporting, as described in Sec. 60.717(d)(3). The inlet and 
outlet gas streams would be monitored if the percent control device 
efficiency is used as the basis for reporting, as described in 
Sec. 60.717(d)(4).
    (2) For carbon adsorption systems with individual exhaust stacks for 
each adsorber vessel, install, calibrate, maintain, and operate, 
according to the manufacturer's specifications, a monitoring device that

Sec. 60.715  Test methods and procedures.

    Methods in appendix A of this part, except as provided under 
Sec. 60.8(b), shall be used to determine compliance as follows:
    (a) Method 24 is used to determine the VOC content in coatings. If 
it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that plant 
coating formulation data are equivalent to Method 24 results, 
formulation data may be used. In the event of any inconsistency between 
a Method 24 test and a facility's formulation data, the Method 24 test 
will govern. For Method 24, the coating sample must be a 1-liter sample 
taken into a 1-liter container at a location and time such that the 
sample will be representative of the coating applied to the base film 
(i.e., the sample shall include any dilution solvent or other VOC added 
during the manufacturing process). The container must be tightly sealed 
immediately after the sample is taken. Any solvent or other VOC added 
after the sample is taken must be measured and accounted for in the 
calculations that use Method 24 results.
    (b) Method 18, 25, or 25A, as appropriate to the conditions at the 
site, is used to determine VOC concentration. The owner or operator 
shall submit notice of the intended test method to the Administrator for 
approval along with the notification of the performance test required 
under Sec. 60.8(d) of the General Provisions. Method selection shall be 
based on consideration of the diversity of organic species present and 
their total concentration and on consideration of the potential presence 
of interfering gases. Except as indicated in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) 
of this section, the test shall consist of three separate runs, each 
lasting a minimum of 30 minutes.
    (1) When the method is to be used in the determination of the 
efficiency of a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with a common exhaust 
stack for all the individual adsorber vessels pursuant to 
Sec. 60.713(b)(2), (4), (5), or (6), the test shall consist of three 
separate runs, each coinciding with one or more complete sequences 
through the adsorption cycles of all the individual adsorber vessels.
    (2) When the method is to be used in the determination of the 
efficiency of a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with individual 
exhaust stacks for each adsorber vessel pursuant to Sec. 60.713(b)(3), 
(4), (5), or (6), each adsorber vessel shall be tested individually. The 
test for each adsorber vessel shall consist of three separate runs. Each 
run shall coincide with one or more complete adsorption cycles.
    (c) Method 1 or 1A is used for sample and velocity traverses.
    (d) Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D is used for velocity and volumetric flow 
rates.
    (e) Method 3 is used for gas analysis.
    (f) Method 4 is used for stack gas moisture.
    (g) Methods 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 3, and 4 shall be performed, as 
applicable, at least twice during each test period.

any emission point subject to Sec. 60.712(c) or (d) (standards for mix 
equipment) at least equivalent to that required by Sec. 60.712 (c) or 
(d), respectively, the Administrator will publish in the Federal 
Register a notice permitting the use of the alternative means. The 
notice may condition permission on requirements related to the operation 
and maintenance of the alternative means.
    (b) Any notice under paragraph (a) of this section shall be 
published only after public notice and an opportunity for a public 
hearing.
    (c) Any person seeking permission under this section shall submit 
either results from an emission test that documents the collection and

Sec. 60.723  Performance tests and compliance provisions.

    (a) Section 60.8 (d) and (f) do not apply to the performance test 
procedures required by this section.
    (b) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall conduct an 
initial performance test as required under Sec. 60.8(a) and thereafter a 
performance test each nominal 1-month period for each affected facility 
according to the procedures in this section.
    (1) The owner or operator shall determine the composition of 
coatings by analysis of each coating, as received, using Method 24, from 
data that have been determined by the coating manufacturer using Method 
24, or by other methods approved by the Administrator.
    (2) The owner or operator shall determine the volume of coating and 
the mass of VOC used for dilution of coatings from company records 
during each nominal 1-month period. If a common coating distribution

volume of coatings used at each facility by using procedures approved by 
the Administrator.
    (i) The owner or operator shall calculate the volume-weighted 
average mass of VOC's in coatings emitted per unit volume of coating 
solids applied (N) at each coating operation [i.e., for each type of 
coating (prime, color, texture, and touch-up) used] during each nominal 
1-month period for each affected facility. Each 1-month calculation is 
considered a performance test. Except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(2)(iii) of this section, N will be determined by the following 
procedures:
    (A) Calculate the mass of VOC's used (M<INF>o</INF>+M<INF>d</INF>) 
for each coating operation during each nominal 1-month period for each 
affected facility by the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.064


where n is the number of coatings of each type used during each nominal 
1-month period and m is the number of different diluent VOC's used 
during each nominal 1-month period. ([Sigma] L<INF>dj</INF> 
D<INF>dj</INF> will be 0 if no VOC's are added to the coatings, as 
received.)
    (B) Calculate the total volume of coating solids consumed 
(L<INF>s</INF>) in each nominal 1-month period for each coating 
operation for each affected facility by the following equation:

[[Page 572]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.065


where n is the number of coatings of each type used during each nominal 
1-month period.
    (C) Select the appropriate transfer efficiency (T) from Table 1 for 
each type of coating applications equipment used at each coating 
operation. If the owner or operator can demonstrate to the satisfaction 
of the Administrator that transfer efficiencies other than those shown 
are appropriate, the Administrator will approve their use on a case-by-
case basis. Transfer efficiency values for application methods not 
listed below shall be approved by the Administrator on a case-by-case 
basis. An owner or operator must submit sufficient data for the 
Administrator to judge the validity of the transfer efficiency claims.
    (D) Where more than one application method is used within a single 
coating operation, the owner or operator shall determine the volume of 
each coating applied by each method through a means acceptable to the 
Administrator and compute the volume-weighted average transfer 
efficiency by the following equation:

(T<INF>avg</INF>=T when only one type of coating operation occurs).

    (ii) Where the volume-weighted average mass of VOC's emitted to the 
atmosphere per unit volume of coating solids applied (N) is less than or 
equal to 1.5 kilograms per liter for prime coats, is less than or equal 
to 1.5 kilograms per liter for color coats, is less than or equal to 2.3 
kilograms per liter for texture coats, and is less than or equal to 2.3 
kilograms per liter for touch-up coats, the affected facility is in 
compliance.
    (iii) If each individual coating used by an affected facility has a 
VOC content (kg VOC/l of solids), as received, which when divided by the 
lowest transfer efficiency at which the coating is applied for each 
coating operation results in a value equal to or less than 1.5 kilograms 
per liter for prime and color coats and equal to or less than 2.3 
kilograms per liter for texture and touch-up coats, the affected 
facility is in compliance provided that no VOC's are added to the

    VOC used means the amount of VOC delivered to the coating mix 
preparation equipment of the affected facility (including any contained 
in premixed

[[Page 578]]

coatings or other coating ingredients prepared off the plant site) for 
the formulation of polymeric coatings to be applied to supporting 
substrates at the coating operation, plus any solvent added after 
initial formulation is complete (e.g., dilution solvent added at the 
coating operation). If premixed coatings that require no mixing at the 
plant site are used, ``VOC used'' means the amount of VOC delivered to 
the coating applicator(s) of the affected facility.
    Volatile organic compounds or VOC means any organic compounds that 
participate in atmospheric photochemical reactions; or that are measured 
by a reference method, an equivalent method, an alternative method, or

Sec. 60.742  Standards for volatile organic compounds.

    (a) Each owner or operator of an affected facility that is subject 
to the requirements of this subpart shall comply with the emissions 
limitations set forth in this section on and after the date on which the 
initial performance test required by Sec. 60.8 is completed, but not 
later than 60 days after achieving the maximum production rate at which 
the affected facility will be operated or 180 days after initial 
startup, whichever date comes first.
    (b) For the coating operation, each owner or operator of an affected 
facility shall either:
    (1) Reduce VOC emissions to the atmosphere from the coating 
operation by at least 90 percent (``emission reduction'' standard); or
    (2) Install, operate, and maintain a total enclosure around the 
coating operation and vent the captured VOC emissions from the total 
enclosure to a control device that is at least 95 percent effecient 
(alternative standard).
    (c) For the onsite coating mix preparation equipment of an affected 
facility, the owner or operator shall comply with the following 
requirements, as applicable:
    (1) For an affected facility that has concurrent construction of a 
control device and uses at least 130 Mg of VOC per 12-month period, the 
owner or operator shall install, operate, and maintain a cover on each 
piece of affected coating mix preparation equipment and vent VOC 
emissions from the covered mix equipment to a 95 percent efficient 
control device while preparation of the

[[Page 581]]

coating is taking place within the vessel.
    (2) For an affected facility that does not have concurrent 
construction of a control device but uses at least 130 Mg of VOC per 12-
month period, the owner or operator shall either:
    (i) Install, operate, and maintain a cover on each piece of affected 
coating mix preparation equipment; or
    (ii) Install, operate, and maintain a cover on each piece of 
affected coating mix preparation equipment and vent VOC emissions to a 
VOC control device.
    (3) For an affected facility that uses at least 95 Mg but less than 
130 Mg of VOC per 12-month period, the owner or operator shall either.
    (i) Install, operate, and maintain a cover on each piece of affected 
coating mix preparation equipment; or
    (ii) Install, operate, and maintain a cover on each piece of 
affected coating mix preparation equipment and vent VOC emissions to a 
VOC control device.

Sec. 60.743  Compliance provisions.

    (a) To demonstrate compliance with the emission reduction standard 
for coating operations specified in Sec. 60.742(b)(1), the owner or 
operator of the affected facility shall use one of the following 
methods.
    (1) Gaseous emission test for coating operations not using carbon 
adsorption beds with individual exhausts. This method is applicable when 
the emissions from any affected coating operation are controlled by a 
control device other than a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with 
individual exhaust stacks for each adsorber vessel. The owner or 
operator using this method shall comply with the following procedures:
    (i) Construct the vapor capture system and control device so that 
all gaseous volumetric flow rates and total VOC emissions can be 
accurately determined by the applicable test methods and procedures 
specified in Sec. 60.745(b) through (g);
    (ii) Determine capture efficiency from the coating operation by 
capturing, venting, and measuring all VOC emissions from the coating 
operation. During a performance test, the owner or operator of an 
affected coating operation located in an area with other sources of VOC 
shall isolate the coating operation emissions from all other sources of 
VOC by one of the following methods:
    (A) Build a temporary enclosure, as defined in Sec. 60.741(a) and 
conforming to the requirements of Sec. 60.743(b)(1), around the affected 
coating operation. The temporary enclosure must be constructed and 
ventilated (through stacks suitable for testing) so that it has minimal 
impact on performance of the capture system; or
    (B) Shut down all other sources of VOC and continue to exhaust 
fugitive emissions from the affected coating operation through any 
building ventilation system and other room exhausts such as those on 
drying ovens. All such ventilation air must be vented through stacks 
suitable for testing because the VOC content in each must be determined.
    (iii) Operate the emission control device with all emission sources 
connected and operating.
    (iv) Determine the efficiency (E) of the control device by Equation 
1:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.067


[[Page 582]]


    (v) Determine the efficiency (F) of the vapor capture system by 
Equation 2:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.068

    (vi) For each affected coating operation subject to 
Sec. 60.742(b)(1) (emission reduction standard for coating operations), 
compliance is demonstrated if the product of (E)x(F) is equal to or 
greater than 0.90.
    (2) Gaseous emission test for coating operations using carbon 
adsorption beds with individual exhausts. This method is applicable when 
emissions from any affected coating operation are controlled by a fixed-
bed carbon adsorption system with individual exhaust stacks for each 
adsorber vessel. The owner or operator using this method shall comply 
with the following procedures:
    (i) Construct the vapor capture system and control device so that 
each volumetric flow rate and the total VOC emissions can be accurately 
determined by the applicable test methods and procedures specified in 
Sec. 60.745 (b) through (g);
    (ii) Assure that all VOC emissions from the coating operation are 
segregated from other VOC sources and that the emissions can be captured 
for measurement, as described in Sec. 60.743(a)(1)(ii) (A) and (B);
    (iii) Operate the emission control device with all emission sources 
connected and operating;
    (iv) Determine the efficiency (H<INF>v</INF>) of each individual 
adsorber vessel (v) using Equation 3:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.069

    (v) Determine the efficiency of the carbon adsorption system 
(H<INF>sys</INF>) by computing the average efficiency of the adsorber 
vessels as weighted by the volumetric flow rate (Q<INF>hv</INF>) of each 
individual adsorber vessel (v) using Equation 4:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.070


[[Page 583]]


    (vi) Determine the efficiency (F) of the vapor capture system using 
Equation (2).
    (vii) For each affected coating operation subject to 
Sec. 60.742(b)(1) (emission reduction standard for coating operations), 
compliance is demonstrated if the product of (H<INF>sys</INF>)x(F) is 
equal to or greater than 0.90.
    (3) Monthly liquid material balance. This method can be used only 
when a VOC recovery device controls only those emissions from one 
affected coating operation. It may not be used if the VOC recovery 
device controls emissions from any other VOC emission sources. When 
demonstrating compliance by this method, Sec. 60.8(f) (Performance 
Tests) of this part does not apply. The owner or operator using this 
method shall comply with the following procedures to determine the VOC 
emission reduction for each nominal 1-month period:
    (i) Measure the amount of coating applied at the coating applicator. 
This quantity shall be determined at a time and location in the process 
after all ingredients (including any dilution solvent) have been added 
to the coating, or appropriate adjustments shall be made to account for 
any ingredients added after the amount of coating has been determined;
    (ii) Determine the VOC content of all coatings applied using the 
test method specified in Sec. 60.745(a). This value shall be determined 
at a time and location in the process after all ingredients (including 
any dilution solvent) have been added to the coating, or appropriate 
adjustments shall be made to account for any ingredients added after the 
VOC content in the coating has been determined;
    (iii) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate, according to the 
manufacturer's specifications, a device that indicates the cumulative 
amount of VOC recovered by the control device over each nominal 1-month 
period. The device shall be certified by the manufacturer to be accurate 
to within <plus-minus>2.0 percent;
    (iv) Measure the amount of VOC recovered; and
    (v) Calculate the overall VOC emission reduction (R) for each and 
every nominal 1-month period using Equation 5. Emissions during startups 
and shutdowns are to be included when determining R because startups and 
shutdowns are part of normal operation for this source category.

If the value of R is equal to or greater than 0.90, compliance with 
Sec. 60.742(b)(1) is demonstrated.
    (A) The value of RS<INF>i</INF> is zero unless the owner or operator 
submits the following information to the Administrator for approval of a 
measured value of RS<INF>i</INF> that is greater than zero but less than 
or equal to 6 percent by weight of the liquid VOC applied:
    (1) Measurement techniques; and
    (2) Documentation that the measured value of RS<INF>i</INF> exceeds 
zero but is less than or equal to 6 percent by weight of the liquid VOC 
applied.
    (B) For those facilities not subject to paragraph (a)(3)(v)(A) of 
this section, the value of RS<INF>i</INF> is zero unless the owner or 
operator submits the following information to the Administrator for 
approval of a measured value of RS<INF>i</INF> that is greater than 6 
percent by weight of the liquid VOC applied.
    (1) Measurement techniques;
    (2) Documentation that the measured value of RS<INF>i</INF> exceeds 
6 percent by weight of the liquid VOC applied; and
    (3) Either documentation of customer specifications requiring higher 
values or documentation that the desired

[[Page 584]]

properties of the product make it necessary for RS<INF>i</INF> to exceed 
6 percent by weight of the liquid VOC applied and that such properties 
cannot be achieved by other means.
    (C) The measurement techniques of paragraphs (a)(3)(v)(A)(1) and 
(a)(3)(v)(B)(1) of this section shall be submitted to the Administrator 
for approval with the notification of anticipated startup required under 
Sec. 60.7(a)(2).
    (vi) The point at which M<INF>r</INF> is to be measured shall be 
established when the compliance procedures are approved. The presumptive 
point of measurement shall be prior to separation/ purification; a point 
after separation/purification may be adopted for enhanced convenience or 
accuracy.
    (4) Short-term liquid material balance. This method may be used as 
an alternative to the monthly liquid material balance described in 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The owner or operator using this 
method shall comply with the following procedures to determine VOC 
emission reduction for a 3- to 7-day period and shall continuously 
monitor VOC emissions as specified in Sec. 60.744.
    (i) Use the procedures described in paragraphs (a)(3) (i) through 
(vi) of this section to determine the overall emission reduction, R. 
Compliance is demonstrated if the value of R is equal to or greater than 
0.90.
    (ii) The number of days for the performance test (3 to 7) is to be 
based on the affected facility's representative performance consistent 
with the requirements of Sec. 60.8(c). Data demonstrating that the 
chosen test period is representative shall be submitted to the 
Administrator for approval with the notification of anticipated startup 
required under Sec. 60.7(a)(2).
    (b) Each owner or operator of an affected coating operation subject 
to the standard specified in Sec. 60.742(b)(2) (alternative standard for 
coating operations) shall:
    (1) Demonstrate that a total enclosure is installed. The total 
enclosure shall either be approved by the Administrator in accordance 
with the provisions of Sec. 60.746, or meet the requirements in 
paragraphs (b)(1) (i) through (vi) of this section, as follows:

exhaust ducts and natural draft openings such as those through which raw 
materials enter and exist the coating operation;
    (ii) Total area of all natural draft openings does not exceed 5 
percent of the total surface area of the total enclosure's walls, floor, 
and ceiling;
    (iii) All access doors and windows are closed during normal 
operation of the enclosed coating operation, except for brief, 
occasional openings to accommodate process equipment adjustments. If 
such openings are frequent, or if the access door or window remains open 
for a significant amount of time during the process operation, it must 
be considered a natural draft opening. Access doors used routinely by 
workers to enter and exit the enclosed area shall be equipped with 
automatic closure devices;
    (iv) Average inward face velocity (FV) across all natural draft 
openings is a minimum of 3,600 meters per hour as determined by the 
following procedures:
    (A) Construct all forced makeup air ducts and all exhaust ducts so 
that the volumetric flow rate in each can be accurately determined by 
the test methods and procedures specified in Sec. 60.745 (c) and (d). 
Volumetric flow rates shall be calculated without the adjustment 
normally made for moisture content; and
    (B) Determine FV by Equation 6:

[[Page 585]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01JN92.072

    (v) The air passing through all natural draft openings flows into 
the enclosure continuously. If FV is less than or equal to 9,000 meters 
per hour, the continuous inward airflow shall be verified by continuous 
observation using smoke tubes, streamers, tracer gases, or other means 
approved by the Administrator over the period that the volumetric flow 
rate tests required to determine FV are carried out. If FV is greater 
than 9,000 meters per hour, the direction of airflow thourgh the natural 
draft openings shall be presumed to be inward at all times without 
verification.
    (vi) All sources of emissions within the enclosure shall be a 
minimum of four equivalent diameters away from each natural draft 
opening.
    (2) Determine the control device efficiency using Equation (1) or 
Equations (3) and (4), as applicable, and the test methods and 
procedures specified in Sec. 60.745 (b) through (g).
    (3) Compliance is demonstrated if the installation of a total 
enclosure is demonstrated and the value of E determined from Equation 
(1) or the value of H<INF>sys</INF> determined from Equations (3) and 
(4), as applicable, is equal to or greater than 0.95.
    (c) To demonstrate compliance with Sec. 60.742(c)(1) (standard for 
coating mix preparation equipment servicing a coating operation with 
concurrent construction of a control device that uses at least 130 Mg 
per year of VOC), each owner or operator of affected coating mix 
preparation equipment shall demonstrate that:
    (1) Covers meeting the following specifications have been installed

mixer shaft or port for addition of ingredients) shall be covered 
consistent with paragraphs (c)(1) (i), (ii), and (iii) of this section 
when not actively in use. An opening sufficient to allow safe clearance 
for a mixer shaft is acceptable during those periods when the shaft is 
in place; and
    (v) A polyehtylene or nonpermanent cover may be used provided it 
meets the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) (ii), (iii), and (iv) of 
this section. Such a cover shall not be reused after once being removed.

<R05>
Sec. 60.745  Test methods and procedures.

    Methods in appendix A of this part, except as provided under 
Sec. 60.8(b), shall be used to determine compliance as follows:
    (a) Method 24 is used to determine the VOC content in coatings. If 
it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that coating 
formulation data are equivalent to Method 24 results, formulation data 
may be used. In the event of any inconsistency between a Method 24 test 
and a facility's formulation data, the Method 24 test will govern. For 
Method 24, the coating sample must be a 1-liter sample collected in a 1-
liter container at a point in the process where the sample will be 
representative of the coating applied to the substrate (i.e., the sample 
shall include any dilution solvent or other

[[Page 588]]

VOC added during the manufacturing process). The container must be 
tightly sealed immediately after the sample is collected. Any solvent or 
other VOC added after the sample is taken must be measured and accounted 
for in the calculations that use Method 24 results.
    (b) Method 25 shall be used to determine VOC concentrations from 
incinerator gas streams. Alternative Methods (18 or 25A), may be used as 
explained in the applicability section of Method 25 in cases where use 
of Method 25 is demonstrated to be technically infeasible. The owner or 
operator shall submit notice of the intended test method to the 
Administrator for approval along with the notification of the 
performance test required under Sec. 60.8(d) of the General Provisions. 
Except as indicated in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, the 
test shall consist of three separate runs, each lasting a minimum of 30 
minutes.
    (1) When the method is to be used in the determination of the 
efficiency of a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with a common exhaust 
stack for all the individual adsorber vessels pursuant to Sec. 60.743 
(a)(1), (b), or (c), the test shall consist of three separate runs, each 
coinciding with one or more complete system rotations through the 
adsorption cycles of all the individual adsorber vessels.
    (2) When the method is to be used in the determination of the 
efficiency of a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with individual 
exhaust stacks for each adsorber vessel pursuant to Sec. 60.743 (a)(2), 
(b), or (c), each adsorber vessel shall be tested individually. Each 
test shall consist of three separate runs, each coinciding with one or 
more complete adsorption cycles.
    (c) Method 1 or 1A is used for sample and velocity traverses;
    (d) Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D is used for velocity and volumetric flow 
rates;
    (e) Method 3 is used for gas analysis;
    (f) Method 4 is used for stack gas moisture;
    (g) Methods 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D; 3; and 4 shall be performed, as 
applicable, at least twice during each test run.


<R05>
Sec. 60.746  Permission to use alternative means of emission limitation.

    (a) If, in the Administrator's judgment, an alternative means of 
emission limitation will achieve a reduction in emissions of VOC from 
any emission point subject to Sec. 60.742(c) at least equivalent to that 
required by Sec. 60.742(b)(2) or Sec. 60.742(c), respectively, the 
Administrator will publish in the Federal Register a notice permitting 
the use of the alternative means. The Administrator may condition 
permission on requirements that may be necessary to ensure operation and 
maintenance to achieve the same emission reduction as specified in 
Sec. 60.742(b)(2) or Sec. 60.742(c), respectively.
    (b) Any notice under paragraph (a) of this section shall be 
published only after public notice and an opportunity for a public 
hearing.
    (c) Any person seeking permission under this section shall submit to 
the Administrator either results from an emission test that accurately 
collects and measures all VOC emissions from a given control device or 
an engineering evaluation that accurately determines such emissions.


<R05>

Sec. 60.751  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, all terms not defined herein shall have the 
meaning given them in the Act or in subpart A of this part.
    Active collection system means a gas collection system that uses gas 
mover equipment.
    Active landfill means a landfill in which solid waste is being 
placed or a landfill that is planned to accept waste in the future.
    Closed landfill means a landfill in which solid waste is no longer 
being placed, and in which no additional solid wastes will be placed 
without first filing a notification of modification as prescribed under 
Sec. 60.7(a)(4). Once a notification of modification has been filed, and 
additional solid waste is placed in the landfill, the landfill is no 
longer closed.
    Closure means that point in time when a landfill becomes a closed 
landfill.
    Commercial solid waste means all types of solid waste generated by 
stores, offices, restaurants, warehouses, and other nonmanufacturing 
activities, excluding residential and industrial wastes.
    Controlled landfill means any landfill at which collection and 
control systems are required under this subpart as a result of the 
nonmethane organic compounds emission rate. The landfill is considered 
controlled at the time a collection and control system design plan is 
submitted in compliance with Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(i).
    Design capacity means the maximum amount of solid waste a landfill 
can accept, as indicated in terms of volume or mass in the most recent 
permit issued by the State, local, or Tribal agency responsible for 
regulating the landfill, plus any in-place waste not accounted for in 
the most recent permit. If the owner or operator chooses to convert the 
design capacity from volume to mass or from mass to volume to 
demonstrate its design capacity is less than 2.5 million megagrams or 
2.5 million cubic meters, the calculation must include a site specific 
density, which must be recalculated annually.
    Disposal facility means all contiguous land and structures, other 
appurtenances, and improvements on the land used for the disposal of 
solid waste.
    Emission rate cutoff means the threshold annual emission rate to 
which a landfill compares its estimated emission rate to determine if 
control under the regulation is required.
    Enclosed combustor means an enclosed firebox which maintains a 
relatively constant limited peak temperature generally using a limited 
supply of combustion air. An enclosed flare is considered an enclosed 
combustor.
    Flare means an open combustor without enclosure or shroud.
    Gas mover equipment means the equipment (i.e., fan, blower, 
compressor) used to transport landfill gas through the header system.
    Household waste means any solid waste (including garbage, trash, and 
sanitary waste in septic tanks) derived from households (including, but 
not limited to, single and multiple residences, hotels and motels, 
bunkhouses, ranger stations, crew quarters, campgrounds, picnic grounds, 
and day-use recreation areas).
    Industrial solid waste means solid waste generated by manufacturing 
or industrial processes that is not a hazardous waste regulated under 
Subtitle

[[Page 592]]

C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, parts 264 and 265 of 
this title. Such waste may include, but is not limited to, waste 
resulting from the following manufacturing processes: electric power 
generation; fertilizer/agricultural chemicals; food and related 
products/by-products; inorganic chemicals; iron and steel manufacturing; 
leather and leather products; nonferrous metals manufacturing/foundries; 
organic chemicals; plastics and resins manufacturing; pulp and paper 
industry; rubber and miscellaneous plastic products; stone, glass, clay, 
and concrete products; textile manufacturing; transportation equipment; 
and water treatment. This term does not include mining waste or oil and 
gas waste.
    Interior well means any well or similar collection component located 
inside the perimeter of the landfill waste. A perimeter well located 
outside the landfilled waste is not an interior well.
    Landfill means an area of land or an excavation in which wastes are 
placed for permanent disposal, and that is not a land application unit, 
surface impoundment, injection well, or waste pile as those terms are 
defined under Sec. 257.2 of this title.
    Lateral expansion means a horizontal expansion of the waste 
boundaries of an existing MSW landfill. A lateral expansion is not a 
modification unless it results in an increase in the design capacity of 
the landfill.
    Modification means an increase in the permitted volume design 
capacity of the landfill by either horizontal or vertical expansion 
based on its permitted design capacity as of May 30, 1991. Modification 
does not occur until the owner or operator commences construction on the 
horizontal or vertical expansion.
    Municipal solid waste landfill or MSW landfill means an entire 
disposal facility in a contiguous geographical space where household 
waste is placed in or on land. An MSW landfill may also receive other 
types of RCRA Subtitle D wastes (Sec. 257.2 of this title) such as 
commercial solid waste, nonhazardous sludge, conditionally exempt small 
quantity generator waste, and industrial solid waste. Portions of an MSW 
landfill may be separated by access roads. An MSW landfill may be 
publicly or privately owned. An MSW landfill may be a new MSW landfill, 
an existing MSW landfill, or a lateral expansion.
    Municipal solid waste landfill emissions or MSW landfill emissions 
means gas generated by the decomposition of organic waste deposited in 
an MSW landfill or derived from the evolution of organic compounds in 
the waste.
    NMOC means nonmethane organic compounds, as measured according to 
the provisions of Sec. 60.754.
    Nondegradable waste means any waste that does not decompose through 
chemical breakdown or microbiological activity. Examples are, but are 
not limited to, concrete, municipal waste combustor ash, and metals.
    Passive collection system means a gas collection system that solely 
uses positive pressure within the landfill to move the gas rather than 
using gas mover equipment.
    Sludge means any solid, semisolid, or liquid waste generated from a 
municipal, commercial, or industrial wastewater treatment plant, water 
supply treatment plant, or air pollution control facility, exclusive of 
the treated effluent from a wastewater treatment plant.
    Solid waste means any garbage, sludge from a wastewater treatment 
plant, water supply treatment plant, or air pollution control facility 
and other discarded material, including solid, liquid, semisolid, or 
contained gaseous material resulting from industrial, commercial, 
mining, and agricultural operations, and from community activities, but 
does not include solid or dissolved material in domestic sewage, or 
solid or dissolved materials in irrigation return flows or industrial 
discharges that are point sources subject to permits under 33 U.S.C. 
1342, or source, special nuclear, or by-product material as defined by 
the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C 2011 et seq.).
    Sufficient density means any number, spacing, and combination of 
collection system components, including vertical wells, horizontal 
collectors, and surface collectors, necessary to maintain

[[Page 593]]

emission and migration control as determined by measures of performance 
set forth in this part.
    Sufficient extraction rate means a rate sufficient to maintain a 
negative pressure at all wellheads in the collection system without 
causing air infiltration, including any wellheads connected to the 
system as a result of expansion or excess surface emissions, for the 
life of the blower.

Administrator as provided in Sec. 60.757(a). The landfill may calculate 
design capacity in either megagrams or cubic meters for comparison with 
the exemption values. Any density conversions shall be documented and 
submitted with the report. Submittal of the initial design capacity 
report shall fulfill the requirements of this subpart except as provided 
for in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.
    (1) The owner or operator shall submit to the Administrator an 
amended design capacity report, as provided for in Sec. 60.757(a)(3).
    (2) When an increase in the maximum design capacity of a landfill 
exempted from the provisions of Sec. 60.752(b) through Sec. 60.759 of 
this subpart on the basis of the design capacity exemption in paragraph 
(a) of this section results in a revised maximum design capacity equal 
to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters, 
the owner or operator shall comply with the provision of paragraph (b) 
of this section.
    (b) Each owner or operator of an MSW landfill having a design 
capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million 
cubic meters, shall either comply with paragraph (b)(2) of this section 
or calculate an NMOC emission rate for the landfill using the procedures 
specified in Sec. 60.754. The NMOC emission rate shall be recalculated 
annually, except as provided in Sec. 60.757(b)(1)(ii) of this subpart. 
The owner or operator of an MSW landfill subject to this subpart with a 
design capacity greater than or equal to 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 
million cubic meters is subject to part 70 or 71 permitting 
requirements.
    (1) If the calculated NMOC emission rate is less than 50 megagrams 
per year, the owner or operator shall:
    (i) Submit an annual emission report to the Administrator, except as 
provided for in Sec. 60.757(b)(1)(ii); and
    (ii) Recalculate the NMOC emission rate annually using the 
procedures specified in Sec. 60.754(a)(1) until such time as the 
calculated NMOC emission rate is equal to or greater than 50 megagrams 
per year, or the landfill is closed.
    (A) If the NMOC emission rate, upon recalculation required in 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, is equal to or greater than 50 
megagrams per year, the owner or operator shall install a collection and 
control system in compliance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (B) If the landfill is permanently closed, a closure notification 
shall be submitted to the Administrator as provided for in 
Sec. 60.757(d).
    (2) If the calculated NMOC emission rate is equal to or greater than 
50 megagrams per year, the owner or operator shall:
    (i) Submit a collection and control system design plan prepared by a 
professional engineer to the Administrator within 1 year:
    (A) The collection and control system as described in the plan shall 
meet the design requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (B) The collection and control system design plan shall include any

    (D) The Administrator shall review the information submitted under 
paragraphs (b)(2)(i) (A),(B) and (C) of this section and either approve 
it, disapprove it, or request that additional information be submitted. 
Because of the many site-specific factors involved with landfill gas 
system design, alternative systems may be necessary. A wide variety of 
system designs are possible, such as vertical wells, combination 
horizontal and vertical collection systems, or horizontal trenches only, 
leachate collection components, and passive systems.
    (ii) Install a collection and control system that captures the gas 
generated within the landfill as required by paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A) or 
(B) and (b)(2)(iii) of this section within 30 months after the first 
annual report in which the emission rate equals or exceeds 50 megagrams 
per year, unless Tier 2 or Tier 3 sampling demonstrates that the 
emission rate is less than 50 megagrams per year, as specified in 
Sec. 60.757(c)(1) or (2).
    (A) An active collection system shall:
    (1) Be designed to handle the maximum expected gas flow rate from 
the entire area of the landfill that warrants control over the intended

shall be less than 50 megagrams per year on three successive test dates. 
The test dates shall be no less than 90 days apart, and no more than 180 
days apart.
    (c) For purposes of obtaining an operating permit under title V of 
the Act, the owner or operator of a MSW landfill subject to this subpart 
with a design capacity less than 2.5 million megagrams or 2.5 million 
cubic meters is not subject to the requirement to obtain an operating 
permit for the landfill under part 70 or 71 of this chapter, unless the 
landfill is otherwise subject to either part 70 or 71. For purposes of 
submitting a timely application for an operating permit under part 70 or 
71, the owner or operator of a MSW landfill subject to this subpart with 
a design capacity greater than or equal to 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 
million cubic meters, and not otherwise subject to either part 70 or 71, 
becomes subject to the requirements of Secs. 70.5(a)(1)(i) or

Sec. 60.753  Operational standards for collection and control systems.

    Each owner or operator of an MSW landfill with a gas collection and 
control system used to comply with the provisions of 
Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(ii) of this subpart shall:
    (a) Operate the collection system such that gas is collected from 
each area, cell, or group of cells in the MSW landfill in which solid 
waste has been in place for:
    (1) 5 years or more if active; or
    (2) 2 years or more if closed or at final grade;
    (b) Operate the collection system with negative pressure at each 
wellhead except under the following conditions:
    (1) A fire or increased well temperature. The owner or operator 
shall record instances when positive pressure occurs in efforts to avoid 
a fire. These records shall be submitted with the annual reports as 
provided in Sec. 60.757(f)(1);
    (2) Use of a geomembrane or synthetic cover. The owner or operator 
shall develop acceptable pressure limits in the design plan;
    (3) A decommissioned well. A well may experience a static positive 
pressure after shut down to accommodate for declining flows. All design 
changes shall be approved by the Administrator;
    (c) Operate each interior wellhead in the collection system with a 
landfill gas temperature less than 55  deg.C and with either a nitrogen 
level less than 20 percent or an oxygen level less than 5 percent. The 
owner or operator may establish a higher operating temperature, 
nitrogen, or oxygen value at a particular well. A higher operating value 
demonstration shall show supporting data that the elevated parameter 
does not cause fires or significantly inhibit anaerobic decomposition by 
killing methanogens.
    (1) The nitrogen level shall be determined using Method 3C, unless 
an alternative test method is established as allowed by 
Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(i) of this subpart.
    (2) Unless an alternative test method is established as allowed by 
Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(i) of this subpart, the oxygen shall be determined by 
an oxygen

[[Page 596]]

meter using Method 3A or 3C except that:
    (i) The span shall be set so that the regulatory limit is between 20 
and 50 percent of the span;
    (ii) A data recorder is not required;
    (iii) Only two calibration gases are required, a zero and span, and 
ambient air may be used as the span;
    (iv) A calibration error check is not required;
    (v) The allowable sample bias, zero drift, and calibration drift are 
<plus-minus>10 percent.
    (d) Operate the collection system so that the methane concentration 
is less than 500 parts per million above background at the surface of 
the landfill. To determine if this level is exceeded, the owner or 
operator shall conduct surface testing around the perimeter of the 
collection area and along a pattern that traverses the landfill at 30 
meter intervals and where visual observations indicate elevated 
concentrations of landfill gas, such as distressed vegetation and cracks 
or seeps in the cover. The owner or operator may establish an 
alternative traversing pattern that ensures equivalent coverage. A 
surface monitoring design plan shall be developed that includes a 
topographical map with the monitoring route and the rationale for any 
site-specific deviations from the 30 meter intervals. Areas with steep 
slopes or other dangerous areas may be excluded from the surface 
testing.
    (e) Operate the system such that all collected gases are vented to a 
control system designed and operated in compliance with 
Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(iii). In the event the collection or control system is 
inoperable, the gas mover system shall be shut down and all valves in 
the collection and control system contributing to venting of the gas to 
the atmosphere shall be closed within 1 hour; and
    (f) Operate the control or treatment system at all times when the 
collected gas is routed to the system.
    (g) If monitoring demonstrates that the operational requirements in 
paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section are not met, corrective 
action shall be taken as specified in Sec. 60.755(a)(3) through (5) or 
Sec. 60.755(c) of this subpart. If corrective actions are taken as 
specified in Sec. 60.755, the monitored exceedance is not a violation of 
the operational requirements in this section.

Sec. 60.754  Test methods and procedures.

    (a)(1) The landfill owner or operator shall calculate the NMOC 
emission rate using either the equation provided in paragraph (a)(1)(i) 
of this section or the equation provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this 
section. Both equations may be used if the actual year-to-year solid 
waste acceptance rate is known, as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i), for 
part of the life of the landfill and the actual year-to-year solid waste 
acceptance rate is unknown, as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii), for 
part of the life of the landfill. The values to be used in both 
equations are 0.05 per year for k, 170 cubic meters per megagram for 
L<INF>O</INF>, and 4,000 parts per million by volume as hexane for the 
C<INF>NMOC.</INF> For landfills located in geographical areas with a 
thirty year annual average precipitation of less than 25 inches, as 
measured at the nearest representative official meteorologic site, the k 
value to be used is 0.02 per year.
    (i) The following equation shall be used if the actual year-to-year 
solid waste acceptance rate is known.

calculating the value of R, if documentation of the nature and amount of 
such wastes is maintained.
    (2) Tier 1. The owner or operator shall compare the calculated NMOC 
mass emission rate to the standard of 50 megagrams per year.
    (i) If the NMOC emission rate calculated in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section is less than 50 megagrams per year, then the landfill owner 
shall submit an emission rate report as provided in Sec. 60.757(b)(1), 
and shall recalculate the NMOC mass emission rate annually as required 
under Sec. 60.752(b)(1).
    (ii) If the calculated NMOC emission rate is equal to or greater 
than 50 megagrams per year, then the landfill owner shall either comply 
with Sec. 60.752(b)(2), or determine a site-specific NMOC concentration 
and recalculate the NMOC emission rate using the procedures provided in 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
    (3) Tier 2. The landfill owner or operator shall determine the NMOC 
concentration using the following sampling procedure. The landfill owner 
or operator shall install at least two sample probes per hectare of 
landfill surface that has retained waste for at least 2 years. If the 
landfill is larger than 25 hectares in area, only 50 samples are 
required. The sample probes should be located to avoid known areas of 
nondegradable solid waste. The owner or operator shall collect and 
analyze one sample of landfill gas from each probe to determine the NMOC 
concentration using Method 25 or 25C of Appendix A of this part. Method 
18 of Appendix A of this part may be used to analyze the samples 
collected by the Method 25 or 25C sampling procedure. Taking composite 
samples from different probes into a single cylinder is allowed; 
however, equal sample volumes must be taken from each probe. For each 
composite, the sampling rate, collection times, beginning and ending 
cylinder vacuums, or alternative volume measurements must be recorded to 
verify that composite volumes are equal. Composite sample volumes should 
not be less than one liter unless evidence can be provided to 
substantiate the accuracy of smaller volumes. Terminate compositing 
before the cylinder approaches ambient pressure where measurement 
accuracy diminishes. If using Method 18, the owner or operator must 
identify all compounds in the sample and, as a minimum, test for those 
compounds published in the most recent Compilation of Air Pollutant 
Emission Factors (AP-42), minus carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, and 
mercury. As a minimum, the instrument must be calibrated for each of the 
compounds on the list. Convert the concentration of each Method 18 
compound to C<INF>NMOC</INF> as hexane by multiplying by the ratio of 
its carbon atoms divided by six. If more than the required number of 
samples are taken, all samples must be used in the analysis. The 
landfill owner or operator must divide the NMOC concentration from 
Method 25 or 25C of Appendix A of this part by six to convert from 
C<INF>NMOC</INF> as carbon to C<INF>NMOC</INF> as hexane. If the 
landfill has an active or passive gas removal system in place, Method 25 
or 25C samples may be collected from these systems instead of surface 
probes provided the removal system can be

[[Page 598]]

shown to provide sampling as representative as the two sampling probe 
per hectare requirement. For active collection systems, samples may be 
collected from the common header pipe before the gas moving or 
condensate removal equipment. For these systems, a minimum of three 
samples must be collected from the header pipe.
    (i) The landfill owner or operator shall recalculate the NMOC mass 
emission rate using the equations provided in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or 
(a)(1)(ii) of this section and using the average NMOC concentration from 
the collected samples instead of the default value in the equation 
provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (ii) If the resulting mass emission rate calculated using the site-
specific NMOC concentration is equal to or greater than 50 megagrams per 
year, then the landfill owner or operator shall either comply with 
Sec. 60.752(b)(2), or determine the site-specific methane generation 
rate constant and recalculate the NMOC emission rate using the site-
specific methane generation rate using the procedure specified in 
paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
    (iii) If the resulting NMOC mass emission rate is less than 50 
megagrams per year, the owner or operator shall submit a periodic 
estimate of the emission rate report as provided in Sec. 60.757(b)(1) 
and retest the site-specific NMOC concentration every 5 years using the 
methods specified in this section.
    (4) Tier 3. The site-specific methane generation rate constant shall 
be determined using the procedures provided in Method 2E of appendix A 
of this part. The landfill owner or operator shall estimate the NMOC 
mass emission rate using equations in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (a)(1)(ii) 
of this section and using a site-specific methane generation rate 
constant k, and the site-specific NMOC concentration as determined in 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section instead of the default values provided 
in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The landfill owner or operator 
shall compare the resulting NMOC mass emission rate to the standard of 
50 megagrams per year.
    (i) If the NMOC mass emission rate as calculated using the site-
specific methane generation rate and concentration of NMOC is equal to 
or greater than 50 megagrams per year, the owner or operator shall 
comply with Sec. 60.752(b)(2).
    (ii) If the NMOC mass emission rate is less than 50 megagrams per 
year, then the owner or operator shall submit a periodic emission rate 
report as provided in Sec. 60.757(b)(1) and shall recalculate the NMOC 
mass emission rate annually, as provided in Sec. 60.757(b)(1) using the 
equations in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and using the site-
specific methane generation rate constant and NMOC concentration 
obtained in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The calculation of the 
methane generation rate constant is performed only once, and the value 
obtained from this test shall be used in all subsequent annual NMOC 
emission rate calculations.
    (5) The owner or operator may use other methods to determine the 
NMOC concentration or a site-specific k as an alternative to the methods 
required in paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section if the method 
has been approved by the Administrator.
    (b) After the installation of a collection and control system in 
compliance with Sec. 60.755, the owner or operator shall calculate the 
NMOC emission rate for purposes of determining when the system can be 
removed as provided in Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(v), using the following 
equation:

M<INF>NMOC</INF> = 1.89 x 10<SUP>-3</SUP> Q<INF>LFG</INF> 
    C<INF>NMOC</INF>

where,

M<INF>NMOC</INF> = mass emission rate of NMOC, megagrams per year
Q<INF>LFG</INF> = flow rate of landfill gas, cubic meters per minute
C<INF>NMOC</INF> = NMOC concentration, parts per million by volume as 
hexane

    (1) The flow rate of landfill gas, Q<INF>LFG</INF>, shall be 
determined by measuring the total landfill gas flow rate at the common 
header pipe that leads to the control device using a gas flow measuring 
device calibrated according to the provisions of section 4 of Method 2E 
of appendix A of this part.
    (2) The average NMOC concentration, C<INF>NMOC</INF>, shall be 
determined by collecting and analyzing landfill gas sampled from the 
common header pipe before the gas moving or condensate removal equipment 
using the procedures

[[Page 599]]

in Method 25C or Method 18 of appendix A of this part. If using Method 
18 of appendix A of this part, the minimum list of compounds to be 
tested shall be those published in the most recent Compilation of Air 
Pollutant Emission Factors (AP-42). The sample location on the common 
header pipe shall be before any condensate removal or other gas refining 
units. The landfill owner or operator shall divide the NMOC 
concentration from Method 25C of appendix A of this part by six to 
convert from C<INF>NMOC</INF> as carbon to C<INF>NMOC</INF> as hexane.
    (3) The owner or operator may use another method to determine 
landfill gas flow rate and NMOC concentration if the method has been 
approved by the Administrator.
    (c) When calculating emissions for PSD purposes, the owner or 
operator of each MSW landfill subject to the provisions of this subpart 
shall estimate the NMOC emission rate for comparison to the PSD major 
source and significance levels in Secs. 51.166 or 52.21 of this chapter 
using AP-42 or other approved measurement procedures.
    (d) For the performance test required in Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(iii)(B), 
Method 25, 25C, or Method 18 of Appendix A of this part must be used to 
determine compliance with the 98 weight-percent efficiency or the 20 
ppmv outlet concentration level, unless another method to demonstrate 
compliance has been approved by the Administrator as provided by 
Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(i)(B). Method 3 or 3A shall be used to determine 
oxygen for correcting the NMOC concentration as hexane to 3 percent. In 
cases where the outlet concentration is less than 50 ppm NMOC as carbon 
(8 ppm NMOC as hexane), Method 25A should be used in place of Method 25. 
If using Method 18 of appendix A of this part, the minimum list of 
compounds to be tested shall be those published in the most recent 
Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors (AP-42). The following 
equation shall be used to calculate efficiency:

Control Efficiency = (NMOC<INF>in</INF> - NMOC<INF>out</INF>)/
    (NMOC<INF>in</INF>)

where,

NMOC<INF>in</INF> = mass of NMOC entering control device
NMOC<INF>out</INF> = mass of NMOC exiting control device

Sec. 60.755  Compliance provisions.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(i)(B), the specified 
methods in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section shall be 
used to determine whether the gas collection system is in compliance 
with Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(ii).
    (1) For the purposes of calculating the maximum expected gas 
generation flow rate from the landfill to determine compliance with 
Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(ii)(A)(1), one of the following equations shall be 
used. The k and L<INF>o</INF> kinetic factors should be those published 
in the most recent Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors (AP-42) 
or other site specific values demonstrated to be appropriate and 
approved by the Administrator. If k has been determined as specified in 
Sec. 60.754(a)(4), the value of k determined from the test shall be 
used. A value of no more than 15 years shall be used for the intended 
use period of the gas mover equipment. The active life of the landfill 
is the age of the landfill plus the estimated number of years until 
closure.
    (i) For sites with unknown year-to-year solid waste acceptance rate:

Q<INF>m</INF> = 2L<INF>o</INF> R (e<SUP>-kc</SUP> - e<SUP>-kt</SUP>)

where,

Q<INF>m</INF> = maximum expected gas generation flow rate, cubic meters 
per year
L<INF>o</INF> = methane generation potential, cubic meters per megagram 
solid waste
R = average annual acceptance rate, megagrams per year
k = methane generation rate constant, year<SUP>-1</SUP>
t = age of the landfill at equipment installation plus the time the 
owner or operator intends to use the gas mover equipment or active life 
of the landfill, whichever is less. If the equipment is installed after 
closure, t is the age of the landfill at installation, years
c = time since closure, years (for an active landfill c = O and 
e<SUP>-kc</SUP> = 1)

    (ii) For sites with known year-to-year solid waste acceptance rate:

[[Page 600]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR12MR96.026

where,

Q<INF>M</INF>=maximum expected gas generation flow rate, cubic meters 
per year
k=methane generation rate constant, year<SUP>-1</SUP>
L<INF>o</INF>=methane generation potential, cubic meters per megagram 
solid waste
M<INF>i</INF>=mass of solid waste in the i<SUP>th</SUP> section, 
megagrams
t<INF>i</INF>=age of the i<SUP>th</SUP> section, years

    (iii) If a collection and control system has been installed, actual 
flow data may be used to project the maximum expected gas generation 
flow rate instead of, or in conjunction with, the equations in 
paragraphs (a)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section. If the landfill is still 
accepting waste, the actual measured flow data will not equal the 
maximum expected gas generation rate, so calculations using the 
equations in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) or (ii) or other methods shall be 
used to predict the maximum expected gas generation rate over the 
intended period of use of the gas control system equipment.
    (2) For the purposes of determining sufficient density of gas 
collectors for compliance with Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(ii)(A)(2), the owner or 
operator shall design a system of vertical wells, horizontal collectors, 
or other collection devices, satisfactory to the Administrator, capable 
of controlling and extracting gas from all portions of the landfill 
sufficient to meet all operational and performance standards.
    (3) For the purpose of demonstrating whether the gas collection 
system flow rate is sufficient to determine compliance with 
Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(ii)(A)(3), the owner or operator shall measure gauge 
pressure in the gas collection header at each individual well, monthly. 
If a positive pressure exists, action shall be initiated to correct the 
exceedance within 5 calendar days, except for the three conditions 
allowed under Sec. 60.753(b). If negative pressure cannot be achieved 
without excess air infiltration within 15 calendar days of the first 
measurement, the gas collection system shall be expanded to correct the 
exceedance within 120 days of the initial measurement of positive 
pressure. Any attempted corrective measure shall not cause exceedances 
of other operational or performance standards. An alternative timeline 
for correcting the exceedance may be submitted to the Administrator for 
approval.
    (4) Owners or operators are not required to expand the system as 
required in paragraph (a)(3) of this section during the first 180 days 
after gas collection system startup.
    (5) For the purpose of identifying whether excess air infiltration 
into the landfill is occurring, the owner or operator shall monitor each 
well monthly for temperature and nitrogen or oxygen as provided in 
Sec. 60.753(c). If a well exceeds one of these operating parameters, 
action shall be initiated to correct the exceedance within 5 calendar 
days. If correction of the exceedance cannot be achieved within 15 
calendar days of the first measurement, the gas collection system shall 
be expanded to correct the exceedance within 120 days of the initial 
exceedance. Any attempted corrective measure shall not cause exceedances 
of other operational or performance standards. An alternative timeline 
for correcting the exceedance may be submitted to the Administrator for 
approval.
    (6) An owner or operator seeking to demonstrate compliance with 
Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(ii)(A)(4) through the use of a collection system not 
conforming to the specifications provided in Sec. 60.759 shall provide 
information satisfactory to the Administrator as specified in 
Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(i)(C) demonstrating that off-site migration is being 
controlled.
    (b) For purposes of compliance with Sec. 60.753(a), each owner or 
operator of a controlled landfill shall place each well or design 
component as specified in the approved design plan as provided in 
Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(i). Each well shall be installed no later than 60 days 
after the date on which the initial solid waste has been in place for a 
period of:
    (1) 5 years or more if active; or
    (2) 2 years or more if closed or at final grade.
    (c) The following procedures shall be used for compliance with the 
surface methane operational standard as provided in Sec. 60.753(d).
    (1) After installation of the collection system, the owner or 
operator shall monitor surface concentrations of methane along the 
entire perimeter of

[[Page 601]]

the collection area and along a pattern that traverses the landfill at 
30 meter intervals (or a site-specific established spacing) for each 
collection area on a quarterly basis using an organic vapor analyzer, 
flame ionization detector, or other portable monitor meeting the 
specifications provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) The background concentration shall be determined by moving the 
probe inlet upwind and downwind outside the boundary of the landfill at 
a distance of at least 30 meters from the perimeter wells.
    (3) Surface emission monitoring shall be performed in accordance 
with section 4.3.1 of Method 21 of appendix A of this part, except that 
the probe inlet shall be placed within 5 to 10 centimeters of the 
ground. Monitoring shall be performed during typical meteorological 
conditions.
    (4) Any reading of 500 parts per million or more above background at 
any location shall be recorded as a monitored exceedance and the actions 
specified in paragraphs (c)(4) (i) through (v) of this section shall be 
taken. As long as the specified actions are taken, the exceedance is not 
a violation of the operational requirements of Sec. 60.753(d).
    (i) The location of each monitored exceedance shall be marked and 
the location recorded.
    (ii) Cover maintenance or adjustments to the vacuum of the adjacent 
wells to increase the gas collection in the vicinity of each exceedance 
shall be made and the location shall be re-monitored within 10 calendar 
days of detecting the exceedance.
    (iii) If the re-monitoring of the location shows a second 
exceedance, additional corrective action shall be taken and the location 
shall be monitored again within 10 days of the second exceedance. If the 
re-monitoring shows a third exceedance for the same location, the action 
specified in paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section shall be taken, and no 
further monitoring of that location is required until the action 
specified in paragraph (c)(4)(v) has been taken.
    (iv) Any location that initially showed an exceedance but has a 
methane concentration less than 500 ppm methane above background at the 
10-day re-monitoring specified in paragraph (c)(4) (ii) or (iii) of this 
section shall be re-monitored 1 month from the initial exceedance. If 
the 1-month remonitoring shows a concentration less than 500 parts per 
million above background, no further monitoring of that location is 
required until the next quarterly monitoring period. If the 1-month 
remonitoring shows an exceedance, the actions specified in paragraph 
(c)(4) (iii) or (v) shall be taken.
    (v) For any location where monitored methane concentration equals or 
exceeds 500 parts per million above background three times within a 
quarterly period, a new well or other collection device shall be 
installed within 120 calendar days of the initial exceedance. An 
alternative remedy to the exceedance, such as upgrading the blower, 
header pipes or control device, and a corresponding timeline for 
installation may be submitted to the Administrator for approval.
    (5) The owner or operator shall implement a program to monitor for 
cover integrity and implement cover repairs as necessary on a monthly 
basis.
    (d) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with the provisions in 
paragraph (c) of this section shall comply with the following 
instrumentation specifications and procedures for surface emission 
monitoring devices:
    (1) The portable analyzer shall meet the instrument specifications 
provided in section 3 of Method 21 of appendix A of this part, except 
that ``methane'' shall replace all references to VOC.
    (2) The calibration gas shall be methane, diluted to a nominal 
concentration of 500 parts per million in air.
    (3) To meet the performance evaluation requirements in section 3.1.3 
of Method 21 of appendix A of this part, the instrument evaluation 
procedures of section 4.4 of Method 21 of appendix A of this part shall 
be used.
    (4) The calibration procedures provided in section 4.2 of Method 21 
of appendix A of this part shall be followed immediately before 
commencing a surface monitoring survey.
    (e) The provisions of this subpart apply at all times, except during 
periods of start-up, shutdown, or malfunction, provided that the 
duration of

[[Page 602]]

start-up, shutdown, or malfunction shall not exceed 5 days for 
collection systems and shall not exceed 1 hour for treatment or control 
devices.

Sec. 60.757  Reporting requirements.

    Except as provided in Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(i)(B),
    (a) Each owner or operator subject to the requirements of this 
subpart shall submit an initial design capacity report to the 
Administrator.
    (1) The initial design capacity report shall fulfill the 
requirements of the notification of the date construction is commenced 
as required by Sec. 60.7(a)(1) and shall be submitted no later than:
    (i) June 10, 1996, for landfills that commenced construction, 
modification, or reconstruction on or after May 30, 1991 but before 
March 12, 1996 or
    (ii) Ninety days after the date of commenced construction, 
modification, or reconstruction for landfills that commence 
construction, modification, or reconstruction on or after March 12, 
1996.
    (2) The initial design capacity report shall contain the following 
information:
    (i) A map or plot of the landfill, providing the size and location 
of the landfill, and identifying all areas where solid waste may be 
landfilled according to the permit issued by the State, local, or tribal 
agency responsible for regulating the landfill.
    (ii) The maximum design capacity of the landfill. Where the maximum 
design capacity is specified in the permit issued by the State, local, 
or tribal agency responsible for regulating the landfill, a copy of the 
permit specifying the maximum design capacity may be submitted as part 
of the report. If the maximum design capacity of the landfill is not 
specified in the permit, the maximum design capacity shall be calculated 
using good engineering practices. The calculations shall be provided, 
along with the relevant parameters as part of the report. The State, 
Tribal, local agency or Administrator may request other reasonable 
information as may be necessary to verify the maximum design capacity of 
the landfill.
    (3) An amended design capacity report shall be submitted to the 
Administrator providing notification of an increase in the design 
capacity of the landfill, within 90 days of an increase in the maximum 
design capacity of the landfill to or above 2.5 million megagrams and 
2.5 million cubic meters. This increase in design capacity may result 
from an increase in the permitted volume of the landfill or an increase 
in the density as documented in the annual recalculation required in 
Sec. 60.758(f).
    (b) Each owner or operator subject to the requirements of this 
subpart shall submit an NMOC emission rate report to the Administrator 
initially and annually thereafter, except as provided for in paragraphs 
(b)(1)(ii) or (b)(3) of this section. The Administrator may request such 
additional information as may be necessary to verify the reported NMOC 
emission rate.
    (1) The NMOC emission rate report shall contain an annual or 5-year 
estimate of the NMOC emission rate calculated using the formula and 
procedures provided in Sec. 60.754(a) or (b), as applicable.
    (i) The initial NMOC emission rate report may be combined with the 
initial design capacity report required in paragraph (a) of this section 
and shall be submitted no later than indicated in paragraphs 
(b)(1)(i)(A) and (B) of this section. Subsequent NMOC emission rate 
reports shall be submitted annually thereafter, except as provided for 
in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(3) of this section.
    (A) June 10, 1996, for landfills that commenced construction, 
modification, or reconstruction on or after May 30, 1991, but before 
March 12, 1996, or

[[Page 604]]

    (B) Ninety days after the date of commenced construction, 
modification, or reconstruction for landfills that commence 
construction, modification, or reconstruction on or after March 12, 
1996.
    (ii) If the estimated NMOC emission rate as reported in the annual 
report to the Administrator is less than 50 megagrams per year in each 
of the next 5 consecutive years, the owner or operator may elect to 
submit an estimate of the NMOC emission rate for the next 5-year period 
in lieu of the annual report. This estimate shall include the current 
amount of solid waste-in-place and the estimated waste acceptance rate 
for each year of the 5 years for which an NMOC emission rate is 
estimated. All data and calculations upon which this estimate is based 
shall be provided to the Administrator. This estimate shall be revised 
at least once every 5 years. If the actual waste acceptance rate exceeds 
the estimated waste acceptance rate in any year reported in the 5-year 
estimate, a revised 5-year estimate shall be submitted to the 
Administrator. The revised estimate shall cover the 5-year period

    (1) The collection devices within the interior and along the 
perimeter areas shall be certified to achieve comprehensive control of 
surface gas emissions by a professional engineer. The following issues 
shall be addressed in the design: depths of refuse, refuse gas 
generation rates and flow characteristics, cover properties, gas system 
expandibility, leachate and condensate management, accessibility, 
compatibility with filling operations, integration with closure end use, 
air intrusion control, corrosion resistance, fill settlement, and 
resistance to the refuse decomposition heat.
    (2) The sufficient density of gas collection devices determined in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall address landfill gas migration 
issues and augmentation of the collection system through the use of 
active or passive systems at the landfill perimeter or exterior.
    (3) The placement of gas collection devices determined in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section shall control all gas producing areas, except as 
provided by paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (a)(3)(ii) of this section.

[[Page 608]]

    (i) Any segregated area of asbestos or nondegradable material may be 
excluded from collection if documented as provided under Sec. 60.758(d). 
The documentation shall provide the nature, date of deposition, location 
and amount of asbestos or nondegradable material deposited in the area, 
and shall be provided to the Administrator upon request.
    (ii) Any nonproductive area of the landfill may be excluded from 
control, provided that the total of all excluded areas can be shown to 
contribute less than 1 percent of the total amount of NMOC emissions 
from the landfill. The amount, location, and age of the material shall 
be documented and provided to the Administrator upon request. A separate 
NMOC emissions estimate shall be made for each section proposed for 
exclusion, and the sum of all such sections shall be compared to the 
NMOC emissions estimate for the entire landfill. Emissions from each 
section shall be computed using the following equation:

Q<INF>i</INF> = 2 k L<INF>o</INF> M<INF>i</INF> (e-<SUP>kt</SUP> i) 
    (C<INF>NMOC</INF>) (3.6 x 10<SUP>-9</SUP>)

where,

Q<INF>i</INF> = NMOC emission rate from the i<SUP>th</SUP> section, 
megagrams per year
k = methane generation rate constant, year<SUP>-1</SUP>
L<INF>o</INF> = methane generation potential, cubic meters per megagram 
solid waste
M<INF>i</INF> = mass of the degradable solid waste in the i<SUP>th</SUP> 
section, megagram
t<INF>i</INF> = age of the solid waste in the i<SUP>th</SUP> section, 
years
C<INF>NMOC</INF> = concentration of nonmethane organic compounds, parts 
per million by volume
3.6x10<SUP>-9</SUP> = conversion factor

    (iii) The values for k and C<INF>NMOC</INF> determined in field 
testing shall be used if field testing has been performed in determining 
the NMOC emission rate or the radii of influence (this distance from the 
well center to a point in the landfill where the pressure gradient 
applied by the blower or compressor approaches zero). If field testing 
has not been performed, the default values for k, L<INF>O</INF> and 
C<INF>NMOC</INF> provided in Sec. 60.754(a)(1) or the alternative values 
from Sec. 60.754(a)(5) shall be used. The mass of nondegradable solid 
waste contained within the given section may be subtracted from the 
total mass of the section when estimating emissions provided the nature, 
location, age, and amount of the nondegradable material is documented as 
provided in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.
    (b) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with 
Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(i)(A) shall construct the gas collection devices using 
the following equipment or procedures:
    (1) The landfill gas extraction components shall be constructed of 
polyvinyl chloride (PVC), high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe, 
fiberglass, stainless steel, or other nonporous corrosion resistant 
material of suitable dimensions to: convey projected amounts of gases; 
withstand installation, static, and settlement forces; and withstand 
planned overburden or traffic loads. The collection system shall extend 
as necessary to comply with emission and migration standards. Collection 
devices such as wells and horizontal collectors shall be perforated to 
allow gas entry without head loss sufficient to impair performance 
across the intended extent of control. Perforations shall be situated 
with regard to the need to prevent excessive air infiltration.
    (2) Vertical wells shall be placed so as not to endanger underlying 
liners and shall address the occurrence of water within the landfill. 
Holes and trenches constructed for piped wells and horizontal collectors 
shall be of sufficient cross-section so as to allow for their proper 
construction and completion including, for example, centering of pipes 
and placement of gravel backfill. Collection devices shall be designed 
so as not to allow indirect short circuiting of air into the cover or 
refuse into the collection system or gas into the air. Any gravel used 
around pipe perforations should be of a dimension so as not to penetrate 
or block perforations.
    (3) Collection devices may be connected to the collection header 
pipes below or above the landfill surface. The connector assembly shall 
include a positive closing throttle valve, any necessary seals and 
couplings, access couplings and at least one sampling port. The 
collection devices shall be constructed of PVC, HDPE, fiberglass, 
stainless steel, or other nonporous material of suitable thickness.

[[Page 609]]

    (c) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with 
Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(i)(A) shall convey the landfill gas to a control 
system in compliance with Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(iii) through the collection 
header pipe(s). The gas mover equipment shall be sized to handle the 
maximum gas generation flow rate expected over the intended use period 
of the gas moving equipment using the following procedures:
    (1) For existing collection systems, the flow data shall be used to 
project the maximum flow rate. If no flow data exists, the procedures in 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall be used.
    (2) For new collection systems, the maximum flow rate shall be in 
accordance with Sec. 60.755(a)(1).

    Yes, the Administrator can delegate all authorities in all sections 
of this subpart to the State for direct State enforcement.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1035  How are these new source performance standards structured?

    These new source performance standards contain five major 
components:
    (a) Preconstruction requirements.
    (1) Materials separation plan.
    (2) Siting analysis.
    (b) Good combustion practices.
    (1) Operator training.
    (2) Operator certification.
    (3) Operating requirements.
    (c) Emission limits.
    (d) Monitoring and stack testing.
    (e) Recordkeeping and reporting.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1040  Do all five components of these new source performance 
standards apply at the same time?

    No, you must meet the preconstruction requirements before you 
commence construction of the municipal waste combustion unit. After the 
municipal waste combustion unit begins operation, you must meet all of 
the good combustion practices, emission limits, monitoring, stack 
testing, and most recordkeeping and reporting requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1045  Are there different subcategories of small municipal waste 
combustion units within this subpart?

    (a) Yes, this subpart subcategorizes small municipal waste 
combustion units into two groups based on the aggregate capacity of the 
municipal waste combustion plant as follows:
    (1) Class I Units. Class I units are small municipal waste 
combustion units that are located at municipal waste combustion plants 
with an aggregate plant combustion capacity greater than 250 tons per 
day of municipal solid waste. (See the definition of ``municipal waste 
combustion plant capacity'' in Sec. 60.1465 for specification of which 
units at a plant are included in the aggregate capacity calculation.)
    (2) Class II Units. Class II units are small municipal waste 
combustion units that are located at municipal waste combustion plants 
with an aggregate plant combustion capacity less than or equal to 250 
tons per day of municipal solid waste. (See the definition of 
``municipal waste combustion plant capacity'' in Sec. 60.1465 for 
specification of which units at a plant are included in the aggregate 
capacity calculation.)
    (b) The requirements for Class I and Class II units are identical 
except for two items:
    (1) Class I units have a nitrogen oxides emission limit. Class II 
units do not have a nitrogen oxides emission limit (see Table 1 of this 
subpart). Additionally, Class I units have continuous emission 
monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements for nitrogen 
oxides.
    (2) Class II units are eligible for the reduced testing option 
provided in Sec. 60.1305.

operator is onsite, the provisionally certified control room operator 
may perform those duties without notice to, or approval by, the 
Administrator.
    (b) When the certified chief facility operator and certified shift 
supervisor are offsite for more than 12 hours, but for 2 weeks or less, 
and no other certified operator is onsite, the provisionally certified 
control room operator may perform those duties without notice to, or 
approval by, the Administrator. However, you must record the period when 
the certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor are 
offsite and include that information in the annual report as specified 
under Sec. 60.1410(l).
    (c) When the certified chief facility operator and certified shift 
supervisor are offsite for more than 2 weeks, and no other certified 
operator is onsite, the provisionally certified control room operator 
may perform those duties without notice to, or approval by, the 
Administrator. However, you must take two actions:
    (1) Notify the Administrator in writing. In the notice, state what 
caused the absence and what you are doing to ensure that a certified 
chief facility operator or certified shift supervisor is onsite.
    (2) Submit a status report and corrective action summary to the 
Administrator every 4 weeks following the initial notification. If the 
Administrator notifies you that your status report or corrective action 
summary is disapproved, the municipal waste combustion unit may continue 
operation for 90 days, but then must cease operation. If corrective 
actions are taken in the 90-day period such that the Administrator 
withdraws the disapproval, municipal waste combustion unit operation may 
continue.

                     Continuous Emission Monitoring


<R05>
Sec. 60.1225  What types of continuous emission monitoring must I perform?

    To continuously monitor emissions, you must perform four tasks:
    (a) Install continuous emission monitoring systems for certain 
gaseous pollutants.
    (b) Make sure your continuous emission monitoring systems are 
operating correctly.
    (c) Make sure you obtain the minimum amount of monitoring data.
    (d) Install a continuous opacity monitoring system.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1230  What continuous emission monitoring systems must I install 
for gaseous pollutants?

    (a) You must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate continuous 
emission monitoring systems for oxygen (or carbon dioxide), sulfur 
dioxide, and carbon monoxide. If you operate a Class I municipal waste 
combustion unit, you must also install, calibrate, maintain, and operate 
a continuous emission monitoring system for nitrogen oxides. Install the 
continuous emission monitoring systems for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen 
oxides, and oxygen (or carbon dioxide) at the outlet of the air 
pollution control device.
    (b) You must install, evaluate, and operate each continuous emission 
monitoring system according to the ``Monitoring Requirements'' in 
Sec. 60.13.
    (c) You must monitor the oxygen (or carbon dioxide) concentration at 
each location where you monitor sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide. 
Additionally, if you operate a Class I municipal waste combustion unit, 
you must also monitor the oxygen (or carbon dioxide) concentration at 
the location where you monitor nitrogen oxides.
    (d) You may choose to monitor carbon dioxide instead of oxygen as a 
diluent gas. If you choose to monitor carbon dioxide, then an oxygen 
monitor is not required, and you must follow the requirements in 
Sec. 60.1255.
    (e) If you choose to demonstrate compliance by monitoring the 
percent reduction of sulfur dioxide, you must also install continuous 
emission monitoring systems for sulfur dioxide and oxygen (or carbon 
dioxide) at the inlet of the air pollution control device.
    (f) If you prefer to use an alternative sulfur dioxide monitoring 
method, such as parametric monitoring, or cannot monitor emissions at 
the inlet of the air pollution control device to determine percent 
reduction, you can apply to the Administrator for approval to use an 
alternative monitoring method under Sec. 60.13(i).


<R05>
Sec. 60.1235  How are the data from the continuous emission monitoring 
systems used?

    You must use data from the continuous emission monitoring systems 
for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide to demonstrate 
continuous compliance with the emission limits specified in Tables 1 and 
2 of this subpart. To demonstrate compliance for dioxins/furans, 
cadmium, lead, mercury, particulate matter, opacity, hydrogen chloride, 
and fugitive ash, see Sec. 60.1290.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1240  How do I make sure my continuous emission monitoring systems 
are operating correctly?

    (a) Conduct initial, daily, quarterly, and annual evaluations of 
your continuous emission monitoring systems that measure oxygen (or 
carbon dioxide), sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides (Class I municipal 
waste combustion units only), and carbon monoxide.
    (b) Complete your initial evaluation of the continuous emission 
monitoring systems within 60 days after your municipal waste combustion 
unit reaches the maximum load level at which it will operate, but no 
later than 180 days after its initial startup.
    (c) For initial and annual evaluations, collect data concurrently 
(or within 30 to 60 minutes) using your oxygen (or carbon dioxide) 
continuous emission monitoring system, your sulfur dioxide, nitrogen 
oxides, or carbon monoxide continuous emission monitoring systems, as 
appropriate, and the appropriate test methods specified in Table 3 of 
this subpart. Collect the data during each initial and annual evaluation 
of your continuous emission monitoring systems following the applicable 
performance specifications in appendix B of this part. Table 4 of this

[[Page 620]]

subpart shows the performance specifications that apply to each 
continuous emission monitoring system.
    (d) Follow the quality assurance procedures in Procedure 1 of 
appendix F of this part for each continuous emission monitoring system. 
The procedures include daily calibration drift and quarterly accuracy 
determinations.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1245  Am I exempt from any appendix B or appendix F requirements to 
evaluate continuous emission monitoring systems?

    Yes, the accuracy tests for your sulfur dioxide continuous emission 
monitoring system require you to also evaluate your oxygen (or carbon 
dioxide) continuous emission monitoring system. Therefore, your oxygen 
(or carbon dioxide) continuous emission monitoring system is exempt from 
two requirements:
    (a) Section 2.3 of Performance Specification 3 in appendix B of this 
part (relative accuracy requirement).
    (b) Section 5.1.1 of appendix F of this part (relative accuracy test 
audit).


<R05>
Sec. 60.1250  What is my schedule for evaluating continuous emission 
monitoring systems?

    (a) Conduct annual evaluations of your continuous emission 
monitoring systems no more than 13 months after the previous evaluation 
was conducted.
    (b) Evaluate your continuous emission monitoring systems daily and 
quarterly as specified in appendix F of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1255  What must I do if I choose to monitor carbon dioxide instead 
of oxygen as a diluent gas?

    You must establish the relationship between oxygen and carbon 
dioxide during the initial evaluation of your continuous emission 
monitoring systems. You may reestablish the relationship during annual 
evaluations. To establish the relationship use three procedures:
    (a) Use EPA Reference Method 3A or 3B in appendix A of this part to 
determine oxygen concentration at the location of your carbon dioxide 
monitor.
    (b) Conduct at least three test runs for oxygen. Make sure each test 
run represents a 1-hour average and that sampling continues for at least 
30 minutes in each hour.
    (c) Use the fuel-factor equation in EPA Reference Method 3B in 
appendix A of this part to determine the relationship between oxygen and 
carbon dioxide.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1260  What is the minimum amount of monitoring data I must collect 
with my continuous emission monitoring systems and is the data collection requirement 
          enforceable?

    (a) Where continuous emission monitoring systems are required, 
obtain 1-hour arithmetic averages. Make sure the averages for sulfur 
dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide are in parts per million 
by dry volume at 7 percent oxygen (or the equivalent carbon dioxide 
level). Use the 1-hour averages of oxygen (or carbon dioxide) data from 
your continuous emission monitoring system to determine the actual 
oxygen (or carbon dioxide) level and to calculate emissions at 7 percent 
oxygen (or the equivalent carbon dioxide level).
    (b) Obtain at least two data points per hour in order to calculate a 
valid 1-hour arithmetic average. Section 60.13(e)(2) requires your 
continuous emission monitoring systems to complete at least one cycle of 
operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each 15-minute 
period.
    (c) Obtain valid 1-hour averages for 75 percent of the operating 
hours per day for 90 percent of the operating days per calendar quarter. 
An operating day is any day the unit combusts any municipal solid waste 
or refuse-derived fuel.
    (d) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) 
through (c) of this section, you are in violation of the data collection 
requirement regardless of the emission level monitored, and you must 
notify the Administrator according to Sec. 60.1410(e).
    (e) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) 
through (c) of this section, you must still use all valid data from the 
continuous emission monitoring systems in calculating emission 
concentrations and percent reductions in accordance with Sec. 60.1265.

[[Page 621]]


<R05>
Sec. 60.1265  How do I convert my 1-hour arithmetic averages into the 
appropriate averaging times and units?

    (a) Use the equation in Sec. 60.1460(a) to calculate emissions at 7 
percent oxygen.
    (b) Use EPA Reference Method 19 in appendix A of this part, section 
4.3, to calculate the daily geometric average concentrations of sulfur 
dioxide emissions. If you are monitoring the percent reduction of sulfur 
dioxide, use EPA Reference Method 19 in appendix A of this part, section 
5.4, to determine the daily geometric average percent reduction of 
potential sulfur dioxide emissions.
    (c) If you operate a Class I municipal waste combustion unit, use 
EPA Reference Method 19 in appendix A of this part, section 4.1, to 
calculate the daily arithmetic average for concentrations of nitrogen 
oxides.
    (d) Use EPA Reference Method 19 in appendix A of this part, section 
4.1, to calculate the 4-hour or 24-hour daily block averages (as 
applicable) for concentrations of carbon monoxide.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1270  What is required for my continuous opacity monitoring system 
and how are the data used?

    (a) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous opacity 
monitoring system.
    (b) Install, evaluate, and operate each continuous opacity 
monitoring system according to Sec. 60.13.
    (c) Complete an initial evaluation of your continuous opacity 
monitoring system according to Performance Specification 1 in appendix B 
of this part. Complete the evaluation within 60 days after your 
municipal waste combustion unit reaches the maximum load level at which 
it will operate, but no more than 180 days after its initial startup.
    (d) Complete each annual evaluation of your continuous opacity 
monitoring system no more than 13 months after the previous evaluation.
    (e) Use tests conducted according to EPA Reference Method 9 in 
appendix A of this part, as specified in Sec. 60.1300, to determine 
compliance with the opacity limit in Table 1 of this subpart. The data 
obtained from your continuous opacity monitoring system are not used to 
determine compliance with the opacity limit.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1275  What additional requirements must I meet for the operation of 
my continuous emission monitoring systems and continuous opacity monitoring system?

    Use the required span values and applicable performance 
specifications in Table 4 of this subpart.


<R05>

Sec. 60.1280  What must I do if any of my continuous emission monitoring 
systems are temporarily unavailable to meet the data collection 
requirements?

    Refer to Table 4 of this subpart. It shows alternate methods for 
collecting data when systems malfunction or when repairs, calibration 
checks, or zero and span checks keep you from collecting the minimum 
amount of data.

                              Stack Testing


<R05>
Sec. 60.1285  What types of stack tests must I conduct?

    Conduct initial and annual stack tests to measure the emission 
levels of dioxins/furans, cadmium, lead, mercury, particulate matter, 
opacity, hydrogen chloride, and fugitive ash.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1290  How are the stack test data used?

    You must use results of stack tests for dioxins/furans, cadmium, 
lead, mercury, particulate matter, opacity, hydrogen chloride, and 
fugitive ash to demonstrate compliance with the emission limits in Table 
1 of this subpart. To demonstrate compliance for carbon monoxide, 
nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide, see Sec. 60.1235.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1295  What schedule must I follow for the stack testing?

    (a) Conduct initial stack tests for the pollutants listed in 
Sec. 60.1285 within 60 days after your municipal waste combustion unit 
reaches the maximum load level at which it will operate, but no later 
than 180 days after its initial startup.
    (b) Conduct annual stack tests for the same pollutants after the 
initial stack test. Conduct each annual stack

[[Page 622]]

test no later than 13 months after the previous stack test.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1300  What test methods must I use to stack test?

    (a) Follow Table 5 of this subpart to establish the sampling 
location and to determine pollutant concentrations, number of traverse 
points, individual test methods, and other specific testing requirements 
for the different pollutants.
    (b) Make sure that stack tests for all the pollutants consist of at 
least three test runs, as specified in Sec. 60.8. Use the average of the 
pollutant emission concentrations from the three test runs to determine 
compliance with the emission limits in Table 1 of this subpart.
    (c) Obtain an oxygen (or carbon dioxide) measurement at the same 
time as your pollutant measurements to determine diluent gas levels, as 
specified in Sec. 60.1230.
    (d) Use the equations in Sec. 60.1460(a) to calculate emission 
levels at 7 percent oxygen (or an equivalent carbon dioxide basis), the 
percent reduction in potential hydrogen chloride emissions, and the 
reduction efficiency for mercury emissions. See the individual test 
methods in Table 5 of this subpart for other required equations.
    (e) You can apply to the Administrator for approval under 
Sec. 60.8(b) to use a reference method with minor changes in 
methodology, use an equivalent method, use an alternative method the 
results of which the Administrator has determined are adequate for 
demonstrating compliance, waive the requirement for a performance test 
because you have demonstrated by other means that you are in compliance, 
or use a shorter sampling time or smaller sampling volume.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1305  May I conduct stack testing less often?

    (a) You may test less often if you own or operate a Class II 
municipal waste combustion unit and if all stack tests for a given 
pollutant over 3 consecutive years show you comply with the emission 
limit. In that case, you are not required to conduct a stack test for 
that pollutant for the next 2 years. However, you must conduct another 
stack test within 36 months of the anniversary date of the third 
consecutive stack test that shows you comply with the emission limit. 
Thereafter, you must perform stack tests every 3rd year but no later 
than 36 months following the previous stack tests. If a stack test shows 
noncompliance with an emission limit, you must conduct annual stack 
tests for that pollutant until all stack tests over 3 consecutive years 
show compliance with the emission limit for that pollutant. The 
provision applies to all pollutants subject to stack testing 
requirements: dioxins/furans, cadmium, lead, mercury, particulate 
matter, opacity, hydrogen chloride, and fugitive ash.
    (b) You can test less often for dioxins/furans emissions if you own 
or operate a municipal waste combustion plant that meets two conditions. 
First, you have multiple municipal waste combustion units onsite that 
are subject to this subpart. Second, all those municipal waste 
combustion units have demonstrated levels of dioxins/furans emissions 
less than or equal to 7 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total 
mass) for 2 consecutive years. In that case, you may choose to conduct 
annual stack tests on only one municipal waste combustion unit per year 
at your plant. The provision only applies to stack testing for dioxins/
furans emissions.
    (1) Conduct the stack test no more than 13 months following a stack 
test on any municipal waste combustion unit subject to this subpart at 
your plant. Each year, test a different municipal waste combustion unit 
subject to this subpart and test all municipal waste combustion units 
subject to this subpart in a sequence that you determine. Once you 
determine a testing sequence, it must not be changed without approval by 
the Administrator.
    (2) If each annual stack test shows levels of dioxins/furans 
emissions less than or equal to 7 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter 
(total mass), you may continue stack tests on only one municipal waste 
combustion unit subject to this subpart per year.
    (3) If any annual stack test indicates levels of dioxins/furans 
emissions greater than 7 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total 
mass), conduct subsequent annual stack tests on

[[Page 623]]

all municipal waste combustion units subject to this subpart at your 
plant. You may return to testing one municipal waste combustion unit 
subject to this subpart per year if you can demonstrate dioxins/furans 
emission levels less than or equal to 7 nanograms per dry standard cubic 
meter (total mass) for all municipal waste combustion units at your 
plant subject to this subpart for 2 consecutive years.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1310  May I deviate from the 13-month testing schedule if unforeseen 
circumstances arise?

    You may not deviate from the 13-month testing schedules specified in 
Secs. 60.1295(b) and 60.1305(b)(1) unless you apply to the Administrator 
for an alternative schedule, and the Administrator approves your request 
for alternate scheduling prior to the date on which you would otherwise 
have been required to conduct the next stack test.

                      Other Monitoring Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 60.1315  Must I meet other requirements for continuous monitoring?

    You must also monitor three operating parameters:
    (a) Load level of each municipal waste combustion unit.
    (b) Temperature of flue gases at the inlet of your particulate 
matter air pollution control device.
    (c) Carbon feed rate if activated carbon is used to control dioxins/
furans or mercury emissions.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1320  How do I monitor the load of my municipal waste combustion 
unit?

    (a) If your municipal waste combustion unit generates steam, you 
must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a steam flowmeter or a 
feed water flowmeter and meet five requirements:
    (1) Continuously measure and record the measurements of steam (or 
feed water) in kilograms (or pounds) per hour.
    (2) Calculate your steam (or feed water) flow in 4-hour block 
averages.
    (3) Calculate the steam (or feed water) flow rate using the method 
in ``American Society of Mechanical Engineers Power Test Codes: Test 
Code for Steam Generating Units, Power Test Code 4.1--1964 (R1991),'' 
section 4 (incorporated by reference in Sec. 60.17(h)(2)).
    (4) Design, construct, install, calibrate, and use nozzles or 
orifices for flow rate measurements, using the recommendations in 
``American Society of Mechanical Engineers Interim Supplement 19.5 on 
Instruments and Apparatus: Application, Part II of Fluid Meters,'' 6th 
Edition (1971), chapter 4 (incorporated by reference in 
Sec. 60.17(h)(3)).
    (5) Before each dioxins/furans stack test, or at least once a year, 
calibrate all signal conversion elements associated with steam (or feed 
water) flow measurements according to the manufacturer instructions.
    (b) If your municipal waste combustion unit does not generate steam, 
or, if your municipal waste combustion units have shared steam systems 
and steam load cannot be estimated per unit, you must determine, to the 
satisfaction of the Administrator, one or more operating parameters that 
can be used to continuously estimate load level (for example, the feed 
rate of municipal solid waste or refuse-derived fuel). You must 
continuously monitor the selected parameters.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1325  How do I monitor the temperature of flue gases at the inlet of 
my particulate matter control device?

    You must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a device to 
continuously measure the temperature of the flue gas stream at the inlet 
of each particulate matter control device.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1330  How do I monitor the injection rate of activated carbon?

    If your municipal waste combustion unit uses activated carbon to 
control dioxins/furans or mercury emissions, you must meet three 
requirements:
    (a) Select a carbon injection system operating parameter that can be 
used to calculate carbon feed rate (for example, screw feeder speed).
    (b) During each dioxins/furans and mercury stack test, determine the 
average carbon feed rate in kilograms (or pounds) per hour. Also, 
determine the average operating parameter level that

[[Page 624]]

correlates to the carbon feed rate. Establish a relationship between the 
operating parameter and the carbon feed rate in order to calculate the 
carbon feed rate based on the operating parameter level.
    (c) Continuously monitor the selected operating parameter during all 
periods when the municipal waste combustion unit is operating and 
combusting waste, and calculate the 8-hour block average carbon feed 
rate in kilograms (or pounds) per hour, based on the selected operating 
parameter. When calculating the 8-hour block average, do two things:
    (1) Exclude hours when the municipal waste combustion unit is not 
operating.
    (2) Include hours when the municipal waste combustion unit is 
operating but the carbon feed system is not working correctly.


<R05>

Sec. 60.1335  What is the minimum amount of monitoring data I must collect 
with my continuous parameter monitoring systems and is the data collection 
          requirement enforceable?

    (a) Where continuous parameter monitoring systems are used, obtain 
1-hour arithmetic averages for three parameters:
    (1) Load level of the municipal waste combustion unit.
    (2) Temperature of the flue gases at the inlet of your particulate 
matter control device.
    (3) Carbon feed rate if activated carbon is used to control dioxins/
furans or mercury emissions.
    (b) Obtain at least two data points per hour in order to calculate a 
valid 1-hour arithmetic average.
    (c) Obtain valid 1-hour averages for at least 75 percent of the 
operating hours per day for 90 percent of the operating days per 
calendar quarter. An operating day is any day the unit combusts any 
municipal solid waste or refuse-derived fuel.
    (d) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) 
through (c) of this section, you are in violation of the data collection 
requirement and you must notify the Administrator according to 
Sec. 60.1410(e).

                              Recordkeeping

        Air Curtain Incinerators that Burn 100 Percent Yard Waste


<R05>
Sec. 60.1435  What is an air curtain incinerator?

    An air curtain incinerator operates by forcefully projecting a 
curtain of air across an open chamber or open pit in which combustion 
occurs. Incinerators of that type can be constructed above or below 
ground and with or without refractory walls and floor.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1440  What is yard waste?

    Yard waste is grass, grass clippings, bushes, shrubs, and clippings

solid waste.
    (2) The opacity limit is 35 percent (6-minute average) during the 
startup period that is within the first 30 minutes of operation.
    (b) Except during malfunctions, the requirements of this subpart 
apply at all times. Each malfunction must not exceed 3 hours.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1450  How must I monitor opacity for air curtain incinerators that

                                Equations


<R05>
Sec. 60.1460  What equations must I use?

    (a) Concentration correction to 7 percent oxygen. Correct any 
pollutant concentration to 7 percent oxygen using equation 1 of this 
section:

C<INF>7</INF><not-eq> = C<INF>unc</INF> * (13.9) * (1/(20.9-
    CO<INF>2</INF>)) (Eq.1)

Where:

C<INF>7</INF><not-eq> = concentration corrected to 7 percent oxygen.
C<INF>unc</INF> = uncorrected pollutant concentration.
CO<INF>2</INF> = concentration of oxygen (percent).

    (b) Percent reduction in potential mercury emissions. Calculate the 
percent reduction in potential mercury emissions (%P<INF>Hg</INF>) using 
equation 2 of this section:

%P<INF>Hg</INF> = (E<INF>i</INF>-<INF>o</INF>) * (100/E<INF>i</INF>) 
    (Eq. 2)

Where:

%P<INF>Hg</INF> = percent reduction of potential mercury emissions
E<INF>i</INF> = mercury emission concentration as measured at the air 
pollution control device inlet, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, dry basis
E<INF>o</INF> = mercury emission concentration as measured at the air 
pollution control device outlet, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, dry 
basis

    (c) Percent reduction in potential hydrogen chloride emissions. 
Calculate the percent reduction in potential hydrogen chloride emissions 
(%P<INF>HC1</INF>) using equation 3 of this section:

%P<INF>HC1</INF> = (E<INF>i</INF> - E<INF>o</INF>) * (100/E<INF>i</INF>) 
    (Eq. 3)

Where:

%P<INF>HC1</INF> = percent reduction of the potential hydrogen chloride 
emissions
E<INF>I</INF> = hydrogen chloride emission concentration as measured at 
the air pollution control device inlet, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, 
dry basis
E<INF>O</INF> = hydrogen chloride emission concentration as measured at 
the air pollution control device outlet, corrected to 7 percent oxygen, 
dry basis

    (d) Capacity of a municipal waste combustion unit. For a municipal 
waste combustion unit that can operate continuously for 24-hour periods, 
calculate the municipal waste combustion unit capacity based on 24 hours 
of operation at the maximum charge rate. To determine the maximum charge 
rate, use one of two methods:
    (1) For municipal waste combustion units with a design based on heat 
input capacity, calculate the maximum charging rate based on the maximum 
heat input capacity and one of two heating values:
    (i) If your municipal waste combustion unit combusts refuse-derived 
fuel, use a heating value of 12,800 kilojoules per kilogram (5,500 
British thermal units per pound).
    (ii) If your municipal waste combustion unit combusts municipal 
solid waste, use a heating value of 10,500 kilojoules per kilogram 
(4,500 British thermal units per pound).
    (2) For municipal waste combustion units with a design not based on 
heat input capacity, use the maximum designed charging rate.
    (e) Capacity of a batch municipal waste combustion unit. Calculate 
the capacity of a batch municipal waste combustion unit as the maximum 
design amount of municipal solid waste they can charge per batch 
multiplied by the maximum number of batches they can process in 24 
hours. Calculate the maximum number of batches by dividing 24 by the 
number of hours needed to process one batch. Retain fractional batches 
in the calculation. For example, if one batch requires 16 hours, the 
municipal waste combustion unit can combust 24/16, or 1.5 batches, in 24 
hours.
    (f) Quarterly carbon usage. If you use activated carbon to comply 
with the dioxins/furans or mercury limits, calculate the required 
quarterly usage of carbon using equation 4 of this section for plant 
basis or equation 5 of this section for unit basis:
    (1) Plant basis.
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06DE00.001
    
Where:

C = required quarterly carbon usage for the plant in kilograms (or 
pounds).

    Source: 65 FR 76384, Dec. 6, 2000, unless otherwise noted.

                              Introduction


<R05>
Sec. 60.1500  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    This subpart establishes emission guidelines and compliance 
schedules for the control of emissions from existing small municipal 
waste combustion units. The pollutants addressed by the emission 
guidelines are listed in Tables 2, 3, 4, and 5 of this subpart. The 
emission guidelines are developed in accordance with sections 111(d) and 
129 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and subpart B of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1505  Am I affected by this subpart?

    (a) If you are the Administrator of an air quality program in a 
State or United States protectorate with one or more existing small 
municipal waste combustion units that commenced construction on or 
before August 30, 1999, you must submit a State plan to the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that implements the emission 
guidelines contained in this subpart.
    (b) You must submit the State plan to EPA by December 6, 2001.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1510  Is a State plan required for all States?

    No, you are not required to submit a State plan if there are no 
existing small municipal waste combustion units in your State and you 
submit a negative declaration letter in place of the State plan.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1515  What must I include in my State plan?

    (a) Include nine items:
    (1) Inventory of affected municipal waste combustion units, 
including those that have ceased operation but have not been dismantled.
    (2) Inventory of emissions from affected municipal waste combustion 
units in your State.
    (3) Compliance schedules for each affected municipal waste 
combustion unit.
    (4) Good combustion practices and emission limits for affected 
municipal waste ombustion units that are at least as protective as the 
emission guidelines contained in this subpart.
    (5) Stack testing, continuous emission monitoring, recordkeeping, 
and reporting requirements.

    (6) Certification that the hearing on the State plan was held, a 
list of witnesses and their organizational affiliations, if any, 
appearing at the hearing, and a brief written summary of each 
presentation or written submission.
    (7) Provision for State progress reports to EPA.
    (8) Identification of enforceable State mechanisms that you selected 
for implementing the emission guidelines of this subpart.
    (9) Demonstration of your State's legal authority to carry out the 
CAA sections 111(d) and 129 State plan.
    (b) Your State plan can deviate from the format and content of the 
emission guidelines contained in this subpart. However, if your State 
plan does deviate, you must demonstrate that your State plan is as 
protective as the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. Your 
State plan must address regulatory applicability, increments of progress 
for retrofit, operator training and certification, operating practice, 
emission limits, continuous emission monitoring, stack testing, 
recordkeeping, reporting, and air curtain incinerator requirements.
    (c) Follow the requirements of subpart B of this part in your State 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1520  Is there an approval process for my State plan?

    The EPA will review your State plan according to Sec. 60.27.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1525  What if my State plan is not approvable?

    If you do not submit an approvable State plan (or a negative 
declaration letter), EPA will develop a Federal plan, according to 
Sec. 60.27 to implement the emission guidelines contained in this 
subpart. Owners and operators of municipal waste combustion units not 
covered by an approved and currently effective State plan must comply 
with the Federal plan. The Federal plan is an interim action and, by its 
own terms, will cease to apply when your State plan is approved and 
becomes effective.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1530  Is there an approval process for a negative declaration letter?

    No, the EPA has no formal review process for negative declaration 
letters. Once your negative declaration letter has been received, EPA 
will place a copy in the public docket and publish a notice in the 
Federal Register. If, at a later date, an existing small municipal waste 
combustion unit is identified in your State, the Federal plan 
implementing the emission guidelines contained in this subpart will 
automatically apply to that municipal waste combustion unit until your 
State plan is approved.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1535  What compliance schedule must I include in my State plan?

    (a) Your State plan must include compliance schedules that require 
small municipal waste combustion units to achieve final compliance or 
cease operation as expeditiously as practicable but not later than the 
earlier of two dates:
    (1) December 6, 2005.
    (2) Three years after the effective date of State plan approval.
    (b) For compliance schedules longer than 1 year after the effective 
date of State plan approval, State plans must include two items:
    (1) Dates for enforceable increments of progress as specified in 
Sec. 60.1590.
    (2) For Class I units (see definition in Sec. 60.1940), dioxins/
furans stack test results for at least one test conducted during or 
after 1990. The stack tests must have been conducted according to the 
procedures specified under Sec. 60.1790.
    (c) Class I units that commenced construction after June 26, 1987 
must comply with the dioxins/furans and mercury limits specified in 
Tables 2 and 3 of this subpart by the later of two dates:
    (1) One year after the effective date of State plan approval.
    (2) One year following the issuance of a revised construction or 
operation permit, if a permit modification is required.

[[Page 642]]


<R05>
Sec. 60.1540  Are there any State plan requirements for this subpart that 
supersede the requirements specified in subpart B?

    Subpart B of this part establishes general requirements for 
developing and processing CAA section 111(d) plans. This subpart applies 
instead of the requirements in subpart B of this part, for two items:
    (a) Option for case-by-case less stringent emission standards and 
longer compliance schedules. State plans developed to implement this 
subpart must be as protective as the emission guidelines contained in 
this subpart. State plans must require all municipal waste combustion 
units to comply no later than December 6, 2005. That requirement applies 
instead of the option for case-by-case less stringent emission standards 
and longer compliance schedules in Sec. 60.24(f).
    (b) Increments of progress requirements. For Class II units (see 
definition in Sec. 60.1940), a State plan must include at least two 
increments of progress for the affected municipal waste combustion 
units. The two minimum increments are the final control plan submittal 
date and final compliance date in Sec. 60.21(h)(1) and (5). That 
requirement applies instead of the requirement of Sec. 60.24(e)(1) that 
would require a State plan to include all five increments of progress 
for all municipal waste combustion units. For Class I units under this 
subpart, the final control plan must contain the five increments of 
progress in Sec. 60.24(e)(1).


<R05>
Sec. 60.1545  Does this subpart directly affect municipal waste combustion 
unit owners and operators in my State?

    (a) No, this subpart does not directly affect municipal waste 
combustion unit owners and operators in your State. However, municipal 
waste combustion unit owners and operators must comply with the State 
plan you developed to implement the emission guidelines contained in 
this subpart. Some States may incorporate the emission guidelines 
contained in this subpart into their State plans by direct incorporation 
by reference. Others may include the model rule text directly in their 
State plan.
    (b) All municipal waste combustion units must be in compliance with 
the requirements established in this subpart by December 6, 2005, 
whether the municipal waste combustion unit is regulated under a State 
or Federal plan.

                      Applicability of State Plans


<R05>
Sec. 60.1550  What municipal waste combustion units must I address in my 
State plan?

    (a) Your State plan must address all existing small municipal waste 
combustion units in your State that meet two criteria:
    (1) The municipal waste combustion unit has the capacity to combust 
at least 35 tons per day of municipal solid waste but no more than 250 
tons per day of municipal solid waste or refuse-derived fuel.
    (2) The municipal waste combustion unit commenced construction on or 
before August 30, 1999.
    (b) If an owner or operator of a municipal waste combustion unit 
makes changes that meet the definition of modification or reconstruction 
after June 6, 2001 for subpart AAAA of this part, the municipal waste 
combustion unit becomes subject to subpart AAAA of this part and the 
State plan no longer applies to that unit.
    (c) If an owner or operator of a municipal waste combustion unit 
makes physical or operational changes to an existing municipal waste 
combustion unit primarily to comply with your State plan, subpart AAAA 
of this part (New Source Performance Standards for New Small Municipal 
Waste Combustion Units) does not apply to that unit. Such changes do not 
constitute modifications or reconstructions under subpart AAAA of this 
part.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1555  Are any small municipal waste combustion units exempt from my 
State plan?

    (a) Small municipal waste combustion units that combust less than 11 
tons per day. Units are exempt from your State plan if four requirements 
are met:

[[Page 644]]

refineries that use feed stocks produced by plastics/rubber recycling 
units.
    (2) The unit does not combust any other municipal solid waste.
    (j) Cement kilns. Cement kilns that combust municipal solid waste 
are exempt from your State plan.
    (k) Air curtain incinerators. If an air curtain incinerator (see 
Sec. 60.1940 for definition) combusts 100 percent yard waste, then those 
units must only meet the requirements under ``Model Rule--Air Curtain 
Incinerators That Burn 100 Percent Yard Waste'' (Secs. 60.1910 through 
60.1930).


<R05>

Sec. 60.1560  Can an affected municipal waste combustion unit reduce its 
capacity to less than 35 tons per day rather than comply with my State 
plan?

    (a) Yes, an owner or operator of an affected municipal waste 
combustion unit may choose to reduce, by your final compliance date, the 
maximum combustion capacity of the unit to less than 35 tons per day of 
municipal solid waste rather than comply with your State plan. They must 
submit a final control plan and the notifications of achievement of 
increments of progress as specified in Sec. 60.1610.
    (b) The final control plan must, at a minimum, include two items:
    (1) A description of the physical changes that will be made to 
accomplish the reduction.
    (2) Calculations of the current maximum combustion capacity and the 
planned maximum combustion capacity after the reduction. Use the 
equations specified under Sec. 60.1935(d) and (e) to calculate the 
combustion capacity of a municipal waste combustion unit.
    (c) A permit restriction or a change in the method of operation does 
not qualify as a reduction in capacity. Use the equations specified 
under Sec. 60.1935(d) and (e) to calculate the combustion capacity of a 
municipal waste combustion unit.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1565  What subcategories of small municipal waste combustion units 
must I include in my State plan?

    This subpart specifies different requirements for different 
subcategories of municipal waste combustion units. You must use those 
same two subcategories in your State plan. Those two subcategories are 
based on the aggregate capacity of the municipal waste combustion plant 
as follows:
    (a) Class I units. Class I units are small municipal waste 
combustion units that are located at municipal waste combustion plants 
with an aggregate plant combustion capacity greater than 250 tons per 
day of municipal solid waste. (See the definition of ``municipal waste 
combustion plant capacity'' in Sec. 60.1940 for specification of which 
units at a plant are included in the aggregate capacity calculation.)
    (b) Class II units. Class II units are small municipal waste 
combustion units that are located at municipal waste combustion plants 
with an aggregate plant combustion capacity less than or equal to 250 
tons per day of municipal solid waste. (See the definition of 
``municipal waste combustion plant capacity'' in Sec. 60.1940 for 
specification of which units at a plant are included in the aggregate 
capacity calculation.)

                            Use of Model Rule


<R05>
Sec. 60.1570  What is the ``model rule'' in this subpart?

    (a) The model rule is the portion of the emission guidelines 
(Secs. 60.1585 through 60.1905) that addresses the regulatory 
requirements applicable to small municipal waste combustion units. The 
model rule provides the requirements in a regulation format.
    (b) In the model rule, ``you'' means the owner or operator of a 
small municipal waste combustion unit.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1575  How does the model rule relate to the required elements of my 
State plan?

    The model rule may be used to satisfy the State plan requirements 
specified in Sec. 60.1515(a)(4) and (5). Alternative language may be 
used in your State plan, but only if you can demonstrate that the 
alternative language is as protective as the model rule.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1580  What are the principal components of the model rule?

    The model rule contains five major components:

    (a) Increments of progress toward compliance.
    (b) Good combustion practices:

    (d) A provisionally certified shift supervisor who is scheduled to 
take the full certification exam.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1685  What if all the certified operators must be temporarily 
offsite?

    If the certified chief facility operator and certified shift 
supervisor both are unavailable, a provisionally certified control room 
operator at the municipal waste combustion unit may fulfill the 
certified operator requirement. Depending on the length of time that a 
certified chief facility operator and certified shift supervisor are 
away, you must meet one of three criteria:
    (a) When the certified chief facility operator and certified shift 
supervisor are both offsite for 12 hours or less and no other certified 
operator is onsite, the provisionally certified control room operator 
may perform those duties without notice to, or approval by, the 
Administrator.
    (b) When the certified chief facility operator and certified shift 
supervisor are offsite for more than 12 hours, but for 2 weeks or less, 
and no other certified operator is onsite, the provisionally certified 
control room operator may perform those duties without notice to, or 
approval by, the Administrator. However, you must record the periods 
when the certified chief facility operator and certified shift 
supervisor are offsite and include the information in the annual report 
as specified under Sec. 60.1885(l).
    (c) When the certified chief facility operator and certified shift 
supervisor are offsite for more than 2 weeks, and no other certified 
operator is onsite, the provisionally certified control room operator 
may perform those duties without notice to, or approval by, the 
Administrator. However, you must take two actions:
    (1) Notify the Administrator in writing. In the notice, state what 
caused the absence and what you are doing to ensure that a certified 
chief facility operator or certified shift supervisor is onsite.

[[Page 649]]

    (2) Submit a status report and corrective action summary to the 
Administrator every 4 weeks following the initial notification. If the 
Administrator notifies you that your status report or corrective action 
summary is disapproved, the municipal waste combustion unit may continue 
operation for 90 days, but then must cease operation. If corrective 
actions are taken in the 90-day period such that the Administrator 
withdraws the disapproval, municipal waste combustion unit operation may 
continue.

      Model Rule--Good Combustion Practices: Operating Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 60.1690  What are the operating practice requirements for my municipal 
waste combustion unit?

    (a) You must not operate your municipal waste combustion unit at 
loads greater than 110 percent of the maximum demonstrated load of the 
municipal waste combustion unit (4-hour block average), as specified 
under ``Definitions'' (Sec. 60.1940).
    (b) You must not operate your municipal waste combustion unit so 
that the temperature at the inlet of the particulate matter control 
device exceeds 17 deg.C above the maximum demonstrated temperature of 
the particulate matter control device (4-hour block average), as 
specified under ``Definitions'' (Sec. 60.1940).
    (c) If your municipal waste combustion unit uses activated carbon to

block average carbon feed rate at or above the highest average level 
established during the most recent dioxins/furans or mercury test.
    (d) If your municipal waste combustion unit uses activated carbon to 
control dioxins/furans or mercury emissions, you must evaluate total 
carbon usage for each calendar quarter. The total amount of carbon 
purchased and delivered to your municipal waste combustion plant must be 
at or above the required quarterly usage of carbon. At your option, you 
may choose to evaluate required quarterly carbon usage on a municipal 
waste combustion unit basis for each individual municipal waste 
combustion unit at your plant. Calculate the required quarterly usage of 
carbon using equation 4 or 5 in Sec. 60.1935(f).
    (e) Your municipal waste combustion unit is exempt from limits on 
load level, temperature at the inlet of the particulate matter control 
device, and carbon feed rate during any of five situations:
    (1) During your annual tests for dioxins/furans.
    (2) During your annual mercury tests (for carbon feed rate 
requirements only).
    (3) During the 2 weeks preceding your annual tests for dioxins/
furans.
    (4) During the 2 weeks preceding your annual mercury tests (for 
carbon feed rate requirements only).
    (5) Whenever the Administrator or delegated State authority permits 
you to do any of five activities:
    (i) Evaluate system performance.
    (ii) Test new technology or control technologies.
    (iii) Perform diagnostic testing.
    (iv) Perform other activities to improve the performance of your 
municipal waste combustion unit.
    (v) Perform other activities to advance the state of the art for 
emission controls for your municipal waste combustion unit.

you must comply with the dioxins/furans and mercury emission limits 
specified in Table 2 of this subpart as applicable by the later of the 
following two dates:
    (1) One year after the effective date of State plan approval.
    (2) One year after the issuance of a revised construction or 
operating permit, if a permit modification is required. Final compliance 
with the dioxins/furans limits must be achieved no later than December 
6, 2005, even if the date 1 year after the issuance of a revised 
construction or operation permit is later than December 6, 2005.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1710  What happens to the emission limits during periods of startup, 
shutdown, and malfunction?

    (a) The emission limits of this subpart apply at all times except 
during periods of municipal waste combustion unit startup, shutdown, or

               Model Rule--Continuous Emission Monitoring


<R05>
Sec. 60.1715  What types of continuous emission monitoring must I perform?

    To continuously monitor emissions, you must perform four tasks:
    (a) Install continuous emission monitoring systems for certain 
gaseous pollutants.
    (b) Make sure your continuous emission monitoring systems are 
operating correctly.
    (c) Make sure you obtain the minimum amount of monitoring data.
    (d) Install a continuous opacity monitoring system.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1720  What continuous emission monitoring systems must I install for 
gaseous pollutants?

    (a) You must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate continuous 
emission monitoring systems for oxygen (or carbon dioxide), sulfur 
dioxide, and carbon monoxide. If you operate a Class I municipal waste 
combustion unit, also install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a 
continuous emission monitoring system for nitrogen oxides. Install the 
continuous emission monitoring systems for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen 
oxides, and oxygen (or carbon dioxide) at the outlet of the air 
pollution control device.
    (b) You must install, evaluate, and operate each continuous emission 
monitoring system according to the ``Monitoring Requirements'' in 
Sec. 60.13.
    (c) You must monitor the oxygen (or carbon dioxide) concentration at 
each location where you monitor sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide. 
Additionally, if you operate a Class I municipal waste combustion unit, 
you must also monitor the oxygen (or carbon dioxide) concentration at 
the location where you monitor nitrogen oxides.
    (d) You may choose to monitor carbon dioxide instead of oxygen as a 
diluent gas. If you choose to monitor carbon dioxide, then an oxygen 
monitor is

[[Page 651]]

not required and you must follow the requirements in Sec. 60.1745.
    (e) If you choose to demonstrate compliance by monitoring the 
percent reduction of sulfur dioxide, you must also install continuous 
emission monitoring systems for sulfur dioxide and oxygen (or carbon 
dioxide) at the inlet of the air pollution control device.
    (f) If you prefer to use an alternative sulfur dioxide monitoring 
method, such as parametric monitoring, or cannot monitor emissions at 
the inlet of the air pollution control device to determine percent 
reduction, you can apply to the Administrator for approval to use an 
alternative monitoring method under Sec. 60.13(i).


<R05>
Sec. 60.1725  How are the data from the continuous emission monitoring 
systems used?

    You must use data from the continuous emission monitoring systems 
for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide to demonstrate 
continuous compliance with the applicable emission limits specified in 
Tables 2, 3, 4, and 5 of this subpart. To demonstrate compliance for 
dioxins/furans, cadmium, lead, mercury, particulate matter, opacity, 
hydrogen chloride, and fugitive ash, see Sec. 60.1780.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1730  How do I make sure my continuous emission monitoring systems 
are operating correctly?

    (a) Conduct initial, daily, quarterly, and annual evaluations of 
your continuous emission monitoring systems that measure oxygen (or 
carbon dioxide), sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides (Class I municipal 
waste combustion units only), and carbon monoxide.
    (b) Complete your initial evaluation of the continuous emission 
monitoring systems within 180 days after your final compliance date.
    (c) For initial and annual evaluations, collect data concurrently 
(or within 30 to 60 minutes) using your oxygen (or carbon dioxide) 
continuous emission monitoring system, your sulfur dioxide, nitrogen 
oxides, or carbon monoxide continuous emission monitoring systems, as 
appropriate, and the appropriate test methods specified in Table 6 of 
this subpart. Collect the data during each initial and annual evaluation 
of your continuous emission monitoring systems following the applicable 
performance specifications in appendix B of this part. Table 7 of this 
subpart shows the performance specifications that apply to each 
continuous emission monitoring system.
    (d) Follow the quality assurance procedures in Procedure 1 of 
appendix F of this part for each continuous emission monitoring system. 
The procedures include daily calibration drift and quarterly accuracy 
determinations.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1735  Am I exempt from any appendix B or appendix F requirements 
to evaluate continuous emission monitoring systems?

    Yes, the accuracy tests for your sulfur dioxide continuous emission 
monitoring system require you to also evaluate your oxygen (or carbon 
dioxide) continuous emission monitoring system. Therefore, your oxygen 
(or carbon dioxide) continuous emission monitoring system is exempt from 
two requirements:
    (a) Section 2.3 of Performance Specification 3 in appendix B of this 
part (relative accuracy requirement).
    (b) Section 5.1.1 of appendix F of this part (relative accuracy test 
audit).


<R05>
Sec. 60.1740  What is my schedule for evaluating continuous emission 
monitoring systems?

    (a) Conduct annual evaluations of your continuous emission 
monitoring systems no more than 13 months after the previous evaluation 
was conducted.
    (b) Evaluate your continuous emission monitoring systems daily and 
quarterly as specified in appendix F of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1745  What must I do if I choose to monitor carbon dioxide instead 
of oxygen as a diluent gas?

    You must establish the relationship between oxygen and carbon 
dioxide during the initial evaluation of your continuous emission 
monitoring systems. You may reestablish the relationship during annual 
evaluations. To establish the relationship use three procedures:
    (a) Use EPA Reference Method 3A or 3B in appendix A of this part to 
determine oxygen concentration at the location of your carbon dioxide 
monitor.

[[Page 652]]

    (b) Conduct at least three test runs for oxygen. Make sure each test 
run represents a 1-hour average and that sampling continues for at least 
30 minutes in each hour.
    (c) Use the fuel-factor equation in EPA Reference Method 3B in 
appendix A of this part to determine the relationship between oxygen and 
carbon dioxide.


<R05>

Sec. 60.1750  What is the minimum amount of monitoring data I must collect 
with my continuous emission monitoring systems and is the data collection requirement 
          enforceable?

    (a) Where continuous emission monitoring systems are required, 
obtain 1-hour arithmetic averages. Make sure the averages for sulfur 
dioxide, nitrogen oxides (Class I municipal waste combustion units 
only), and carbon monoxide are in parts per million by dry volume at 7 
percent oxygen (or the equivalent carbon dioxide level). Use the 1-hour 
averages of oxygen (or carbon dioxide) data from your continuous 
emission monitoring system to determine the actual oxygen (or carbon 
dioxide) level and to calculate emissions at 7 percent oxygen (or the 
equivalent carbon dioxide level).
    (b) Obtain at least two data points per hour in order to calculate a 
valid 1-hour arithmetic average. Section 60.13(e)(2) requires your 
continuous emission monitoring systems to complete at least one cycle of 
operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each 15-minute 
period.
    (c) Obtain valid 1-hour averages for 75 percent of the operating 
hours per day for 90 percent of the operating days per calendar quarter. 
An operating day is any day the unit combusts any municipal solid waste 
or refuse-derived fuel.
    (d) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) 
through (c) of this section, you are in violation of the data collection 
requirement regardless of the emission level monitored, and you must 
notify the Administrator according to Sec. 60.1885(e).
    (e) If you do not obtain the minimum data required in paragraphs (a) 
through (c) of this section, you must still use all valid data from the 
continuous emission monitoring systems in calculating emission 
concentrations and percent reductions in accordance with Sec. 60.1755.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1755  How do I convert my 1-hour arithmetic averages into appropriate 
averaging times and units?

    (a) Use the equation in Sec. 60.1935(a) to calculate emissions at 7 
percent oxygen.
    (b) Use EPA Reference Method 19 in appendix A of this part, section 
4.3, to calculate the daily geometric average concentrations of sulfur 
dioxide emissions. If you are monitoring the percent reduction of sulfur 
dioxide, use EPA Reference Method 19 in appendix A of this part, section 
5.4, to determine the daily geometric average percent reduction of 
potential sulfur dioxide emissions.
    (c) If you operate a Class I municipal waste combustion unit, use 
EPA Reference Method 19 in appendix A of this part, section 4.1, to 
calculate the daily arithmetic average for concentrations of nitrogen 
oxides.
    (d) Use EPA Reference Method 19 in appendix A of this part, section 
4.1, to calculate the 4-hour or 24-hour daily block averages (as 
applicable) for concentrations of carbon monoxide.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1760  What is required for my continuous opacity monitoring system 
and how are the data used?

    (a) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous opacity 
monitoring system.
    (b) Install, evaluate, and operate each continuous opacity 
monitoring system according to Sec. 60.13.
    (c) Complete an initial evaluation of your continuous opacity 
monitoring system according to Performance Specification 1 in appendix B 
of this part. Complete the evaluation by 180 days after your final 
compliance date.
    (d) Complete each annual evaluation of your continuous opacity 
monitoring system no more than 13 months after the previous evaluation.
    (e) Use tests conducted according to EPA Reference Method 9 in 
appendix A of this part, as specified in Sec. 60.1790, to determine 
compliance with the opacity limit in Table 2 or 4 of this subpart. The 
data obtained from your continuous opacity monitoring system are

[[Page 653]]

not used to determine compliance with the opacity limit.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1765  What additional requirements must I meet for the operation of 
my continuous emission monitoring systems and continuous opacity monitoring system?

    Use the required span values and applicable performance 
specifications in Table 8 of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1770  What must I do if any of my continuous emission monitoring 
systems are temporarily unavailable to meet the data collection requirements?

    Refer to Table 8 of this subpart. It shows alternate methods for 
collecting data when systems malfunction or when repairs, calibration 
checks, or zero and span checks keep you from collecting the minimum 
amount of data.

                        Model Rule--Stack Testing


<R05>
Sec. 60.1775  What types of stack tests must I conduct?

    Conduct initial and annual stack tests to measure the emission 
levels of dioxins/furans, cadmium, lead, mercury, particulate matter, 
opacity, hydrogen chloride, and fugitive ash.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1780  How are the stack test data used?

    You must use results of stack tests for dioxins/furans, cadmium, 
lead, mercury, particulate matter, opacity, hydrogen chloride, and 
fugitive ash to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission 
limits in Tables 2 and 4 of this subpart. To demonstrate compliance for 
carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide, see Sec. 60.1725.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1785  What schedule must I follow for the stack testing?

    (a) Conduct initial stack tests for the pollutants listed in 
Sec. 60.1775 by 180 days after your final compliance date.
    (b) Conduct annual stack tests for the same pollutants after the 
initial stack test. Conduct each annual stack test no later than 13 
months after the previous stack test.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1790  What test methods must I use to stack test?

    (a) Follow Table 8 of this subpart to establish the sampling 
location and to determine pollutant concentrations, number of traverse 
points, individual test methods, and other specific testing requirements 
for the different pollutants.
    (b) Make sure that stack tests for all the pollutants consist of at 
least three test runs, as specified in Sec. 60.8. Use the average of the 
pollutant emission concentrations from the three test runs to determine 
compliance with the applicable emission limits in Tables 2 and 4 of this 
subpart.
    (c) Obtain an oxygen (or carbon dioxide) measurement at the same 
time as your pollutant measurements to determine diluent gas levels, as 
specified in Sec. 60.1720.
    (d) Use the equations in Sec. 60.1935(a) to calculate emission 
levels at 7 percent oxygen (or an equivalent carbon dioxide basis), the 
percent reduction in potential hydrogen chloride emissions, and the 
reduction efficiency for mercury emissions. See the individual test 
methods in Table 6 of this subpart for other required equations.
    (e) You can apply to the Administrator for approval under 
Sec. 60.8(b) to use a reference method with minor changes in 
methodology, use an equivalent method, use an alternative method the 
results of which the Administrator has determined are adequate for 
demonstrating compliance, waive the requirement for a performance test 
because you have demonstrated by other means that you are in compliance, 
or use a shorter sampling time or smaller sampling volume.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1795  May I conduct stack testing less often?

    (a) You may test less often if you own or operate a Class II 
municipal waste combustion unit and if all stack tests for a given 
pollutant over 3 consecutive years show you comply with the emission 
limit. In that case, you are not required to conduct a stack test for 
that pollutant for the next 2 years. However, you must conduct another 
stack test within 36 months of the anniversary date of the third 
consecutive stack test that shows you

[[Page 654]]

comply with the emission limit. Thereafter, you must perform stack tests 
every 3rd year but no later than 36 months following the previous stack 
tests. If a stack test shows noncompliance with an emission limit, you 
must conduct annual stack tests for that pollutant until all stack tests 
over 3 consecutive years show compliance with the emission limit for 
that pollutant. The provision applies to all pollutants subject to stack 
testing requirements: dioxins/furans, cadmium, lead, mercury, 
particulate matter, opacity, hydrogen chloride, and fugitive ash.
    (b) You can test less often for dioxins/furans emissions if you own 
or operate a municipal waste combustion plant that meets two conditions. 
First, you have multiple municipal waste combustion units onsite that 
are subject to this subpart. Second, all those municipal waste 
combustion units have demonstrated levels of dioxins/furans emissions 
less than or equal to 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total 
mass) for Class I units, or 30 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter 
(total mass) for Class II units, for 2 consecutive years. In that case, 
you may choose to conduct annual stack tests on only one municipal waste 
combustion unit per year at your plant. The provision only applies to 
stack testing for dioxins/furans emissions.
    (1) Conduct the stack test no more than 13 months following a stack 
test on any municipal waste combustion unit subject to this subpart at 
your plant. Each year, test a different municipal waste combustion unit 
subject to this subpart and test all municipal waste combustion units 
subject to this subpart in a sequence that you determine. Once you 
determine a testing sequence, it must not be changed without approval by 
the Administrator.
    (2) If each annual stack test shows levels of dioxins/furans 
emissions less than or equal to 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic 
meter (total mass) for Class I units, or 30 nanograms per dry standard 
cubic meter (total mass) for Class II units, you may continue stack 
tests on only one municipal waste combustion unit subject to this 
subpart per year.
    (3) If any annual stack test indicates levels of dioxins/furans 
emissions greater than 15 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total 
mass) for Class I units, or 30 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter 
(total mass) for Class II units, conduct subsequent annual stack tests 
on all municipal waste combustion units subject to this subpart at your 
plant. You may return to testing one municipal waste combustion unit 
subject to this subpart per year if you can demonstrate dioxins/furans 
emissions levels less than or equal to 15 nanograms per dry standard 
cubic meter (total mass) for Class I units, or 30 nanograms per dry 
standard cubic meter (total mass) for Class II units, for all municipal 
waste combustion units at your plant subject to this subpart for 2 
consecutive years.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1800  May I deviate from the 13-month testing schedule if unforeseen 
circumstances arise?

    You may not deviate from the 13-month testing schedules specified in 
Secs. 60.1785(b) and 60.1795(b)(1) unless you apply to the Administrator 
for an alternative schedule, and the Administrator approves your request 
for alternate scheduling prior to the date on which you would otherwise 
have been required to conduct the next stack test.

                Model Rule--Other Monitoring Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 60.1805  Must I meet other requirements for continuous monitoring?

    You must also monitor three operating parameters:
    (a) Load level of each municipal waste combustion unit.
    (b) Temperature of flue gases at the inlet of your particulate 
matter air pollution control device.
    (c) Carbon feed rate if activated carbon is used to control dioxins/
furans or mercury emissions.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1810  How do I monitor the load of my municipal waste combustion unit?

    (a) If your municipal waste combustion unit generates steam, you 
must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a steam flowmeter or a 
feed water flowmeter and meet five requirements:

[[Page 655]]

    (1) Continuously measure and record the measurements of steam (or 
feed water) in kilograms (or pounds) per hour.
    (2) Calculate your steam (or feed water) flow in 4-hour block 
averages.
    (3) Calculate the steam (or feed water) flow rate using the method 
in ``American Society of Mechanical Engineers Power Test Codes: Test 
Code for Steam Generating Units, Power Test Code 4.1--1964 (R1991),'' 
section 4 (incorporated by reference in Sec. 60.17(h)(2)).
    (4) Design, construct, install, calibrate, and use nozzles or 
orifices for flow rate measurements, using the recommendations in 
``American Society of Mechanical Engineers Interim Supplement 19.5 on 
Instruments and Apparatus: Application, Part II of Fluid Meters,'' 6th 
Edition (1971), chapter 4 (incorporated by reference in 
Sec. 60.17(h)(3)).
    (5) Before each dioxins/furans stack test, or at least once a year, 
calibrate all signal conversion elements associated with steam (or feed 
water) flow measurements according to the manufacturer instructions.
    (b) If your municipal waste combustion units do not generate steam, 
or, if your municipal waste combustion units have shared steam systems 
and steam load cannot be estimated per unit, you must determine, to the 
satisfaction of the Administrator, one or more operating parameters that 
can be used to continuously estimate load level (for example, the feed 
rate of municipal solid waste or refuse-derived fuel). You must 
continuously monitor the selected parameters.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1815  How do I monitor the temperature of flue gases at the inlet of 
my particulate matter control device?

    You must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a device to 
continuously measure the temperature of the flue gas stream at the inlet 
of each particulate matter control device.


<R05>
Sec. 60.1820  How do I monitor the injection rate of activated carbon?

    If your municipal waste combustion unit uses activated carbon to 
control dioxins/furans or mercury emissions, you must meet three 
requirements:
    (a) Select a carbon injection system operating parameter that can be 
used to calculate carbon feed rate (for example, screw feeder speed).
    (b) During each dioxins/furans and mercury stack test, determine the 
average carbon feed rate in kilograms (or pounds) per hour. Also, 
determine the average operating parameter level that correlates to the 
carbon feed rate. Establish a relationship between the operating 
parameter and the carbon feed rate in order to calculate the carbon feed 
rate based on the operating parameter level.
    (c) Continuously monitor the selected operating parameter during all 
periods when the municipal waste combustion unit is operating and 
combusting waste and calculate the 8-hour block average carbon feed rate 
in kilograms (or pounds) per hour, based on the selected operating 
parameter. When calculating the 8-hour block average, do two things:
    (1) Exclude hours when the municipal waste combustion unit is not 
operating.
    (2) Include hours when the municipal waste combustion unit is 
operating but the carbon feed system is not working correctly.


<R05>

Sec. 60.1825  What is the minimum amount of monitoring data I must collect 
with my continuous parameter monitoring systems and is the data collection 
          requirement enforceable?

    (a) Where continuous parameter monitoring systems are used, obtain 
1-hour arithmetic averages for three parameters:
    (1) Load level of the municipal waste combustion unit.
    (2) Temperature of the flue gases at the inlet of your particulate 
matter control device.
    (3) Carbon feed rate if activated carbon is used to control dioxins/
furans or mercury emissions.
    (b) Obtain at least two data points per hour in order to calculate a 
valid 1-hour arithmetic average.
    (c) Obtain valid 1-hour averages for at least 75 percent of the 
operating hours per day for 90 percent of the operating days per

    (d) Capacity of a municipal waste combustion unit. For a municipal 
waste combustion unit that can operate continuously for 24-hour periods, 
calculate the municipal waste combustion unit capacity based on 24 hours 
of operation at the maximum charge rate. To determine the maximum charge 
rate, use one of two methods:
    (1) For municipal waste combustion units with a design based on heat 
input capacity, calculate the maximum charging rate based on the maximum 
heat input capacity and one of two heating values:
    (i) If your municipal waste combustion unit combusts refuse-derived 
fuel, use a heating value of 12,800 kilojoules per kilogram (5,500 
British thermal units per pound).
    (ii) If your municipal waste combustion unit combusts municipal 
solid waste, use a heating value of 10,500 kilojoules per kilogram 
(4,500 British thermal units per pound).
    (2) For municipal waste combustion units with a design not based on 
heat input capacity, use the maximum designed charging rate.
    (e) Capacity of a batch municipal waste combustion unit. Calculate 
the capacity of a batch municipal waste combustion unit as the maximum 
design amount of municipal solid waste they can charge per batch 
multiplied by the maximum number of batches they can process in 24 
hours. Calculate the maximum number of batches by dividing 24 by the 
number of hours needed to process one batch. Retain fractional batches 
in the calculation. For example, if one batch requires 16 hours, the 
municipal waste combustion unit can combust 24/16, or 1.5 batches, in 24 
hours.
    (f) Quarterly carbon usage. If you use activated carbon to comply 
with the

[[Page 664]]

dioxins/furans or mercury limits, calculate the required quarterly usage 
of carbon using equation 4 of this section for plant basis or equation 5 
of this section for unit basis:
    (1) Plant basis.
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06DE00.006
    
Where:

C = required quarterly carbon usage for the plant in kilograms (or 
pounds).
f<INF>i</INF> = required carbon feed rate for the municipal waste 
combustion unit in kilograms (or pounds) per hour. That is the average 
carbon feed rate during the most recent mercury or dioxins/furans stack 
tests (whichever has a higher feed rate).
h<INF>i</INF> = number of hours the municipal waste combustion unit was 
in operation during the calendar quarter (hours).
n = number of municipal waste combustion units, i, located at your 
plant.

    (2) Unit basis.
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06DE00.007
    
Where:

C = required quarterly carbon usage for the unit in kilograms (or 
pounds).
f = required carbon feed rate for the municipal waste combustion unit in 
kilograms (or pounds) per hour. That is the average carbon feed rate 
during the most recent mercury or dioxins/furans stack tests (whichever 
has a higher feed rate).
h = number of hours the municipal waste combustion unit was in operation 
during the calendar quarter (hours).

    (i) A qualified operator is accessible as required under 
Sec. 60.2070(a).
    (ii) You notify the Administrator that a qualified operator is 
accessible and that you are resuming operation.

                Emission Limitations and Operating Limits


<R05>
Sec. 60.2105  What emission limitations must I meet and by when?

    You must meet the emission limitations specified in Table 1 of this 
subpart 60 days after your CISWI unit reaches the charge rate at which 
it will operate, but no later than 180 days after its initial startup.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2110  What operating limits must I meet and by when?

    (a) If you use a wet scrubber to comply with the emission 
limitations, you must establish operating limits for four operating 
parameters (as specified in Table 2 of this subpart) as described in 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section during the initial 
performance test.
    (1) Maximum charge rate, calculated using one of the two different 
procedures in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii), as appropriate.
    (i) For continuous and intermittent units, maximum charge rate is 
110 percent of the average charge rate measured during the most recent 
performance test demonstrating compliance with all applicable emission 
limitations.
    (ii) For batch units, maximum charge rate is 110 percent of the 
daily charge rate measured during the most recent performance test 
demonstrating compliance with all applicable emission limitations.
    (2) Minimum pressure drop across the wet scrubber, which is 
calculated as 90 percent of the average pressure drop across the wet 
scrubber measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating 
compliance with the particulate matter emission limitations; or minimum 
amperage to the wet scrubber, which is calculated as 90 percent of the 
average amperage to the wet scrubber measured during the most recent 
performance test demonstrating compliance with the particulate matter 
emission limitations.
    (3) Minimum scrubber liquor flow rate, which is calculated as 90 
percent of the average liquor flow rate at the inlet to the wet scrubber 
measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating 
compliance with all applicable emission limitations.
    (4) Minimum scrubber liquor pH, which is calculated as 90 percent of 
the average liquor pH at the inlet to the wet scrubber measured during 
the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the HCl 
emission limitation.
    (b) You must meet the operating limits established during the 
initial performance test 60 days after your CISWI unit reaches the 
charge rate at which it will operate, but no later than 180 days after 
its initial startup.
    (c) If you use a fabric filter to comply with the emission 
limitations, you must operate each fabric filter system such that the 
bag leak detection system alarm does not sound more than 5 percent of 
the operating time during a 6-month period. In calculating this 
operating time percentage, if inspection of the fabric filter 
demonstrates that no corrective action is required, no alarm time is 
counted. If corrective action is required, each alarm shall be counted 
as a minimum of 1 hour. If you take longer than 1 hour to initiate 
corrective action, the alarm time shall be counted as the actual amount 
of time taken by you to initiate corrective action.

[[Page 680]]


<R05>
Sec. 60.2115  What if I do not use a wet scrubber to comply with the 
emission limitations?

    If you use an air pollution control device other than a wet 
scrubber, or limit emissions in some other manner, to comply with the 
emission limitations under Sec. 60.2105, you must petition the 
Administrator for specific operating limits to be established during the 
initial performance test and continuously monitored thereafter. You must 
not conduct the initial performance test until after the petition has 
been approved by the Administrator. Your petition must include the five 
items listed in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
    (a) Identification of the specific parameters you propose to use as 
additional operating limits.
    (b) A discussion of the relationship between these parameters and 
emissions of regulated pollutants, identifying how emissions of 
regulated pollutants change with changes in these parameters, and how 
limits on these parameters will serve to limit emissions of regulated 
pollutants.
    (c) A discussion of how you will establish the upper and/or lower 
values for these parameters which will establish the operating limits on 
these parameters.
    (d) A discussion identifying the methods you will use to measure and 
the instruments you will use to monitor these parameters, as well as the 
relative accuracy and precision of these methods and instruments.
    (e) A discussion identifying the frequency and methods for 
recalibrating the instruments you will use for monitoring these 
parameters.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2120  What happens during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction?

    (a) All performance tests must consist of a minimum of three test 
runs conducted under conditions representative of normal operations.
    (b) You must document that the waste burned during the performance 
test is representative of the waste burned under normal operating 
conditions by maintaining a log of the quantity of waste burned (as 
required in Sec. 60.2175(b)(1)) and the types of waste burned during the 
performance test.
    (c) All performance tests must be conducted using the minimum run 
duration specified in Table 1 of this subpart.
    (d) Method 1 of appendix A of this part must be used to select the 
sampling location and number of traverse points.
    (e) Method 3A or 3B of appendix A of this part must be used for gas 
composition analysis, including measurement of oxygen concentration. 
Method 3A or 3B of appendix A of this part must be used simultaneously 
with each method.
    (f) All pollutant concentrations, except for opacity, must be 
adjusted to 7 percent oxygen using Equation 1 of this section:

C<INF>adj</INF> = C<INF>meas</INF> (20.9-7)/(20.9-%O<INF>2</INF>)       
    (Eq. 1)

Where:

C<INF>adj</INF> = pollutant concentration adjusted to 7 percent oxygen;
C<INF>meas</INF> = pollutant concentration measured on a dry basis;
(20.9-7) = 20.9 percent oxygen-7 percent oxygen (defined oxygen 
correction basis);
20.9 = oxygen concentration in air, percent; and
%O<INF>2</INF> = oxygen concentration measured on a dry basis, percent.

    (g) You must determine dioxins/furans toxic equivalency by following 
the procedures in paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of this section.
    (1) Measure the concentration of each dioxin/furan tetra-through 
octachlorinated-congener emitted using EPA Method 23.
    (2) For each dioxin/furan (tetra-through octachlorinated) congener

[[Page 681]]

measured in accordance with paragraph (g)(1) of this section, multiply 
the congener concentration by its corresponding toxic equivalency factor 
specified in Table 3 of this subpart.
    (3) Sum the products calculated in accordance with paragraph (g)(2) 
of this section to obtain the total concentration of dioxins/furans 
emitted in terms of toxic equivalency.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2130  How are the performance test data used?

    You use results of performance tests to demonstrate compliance with 
the emission limitations in Table 1 of this subpart.

                     Initial Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 60.2135  How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission 
limitations and establish the operating limits?

    You must conduct an initial performance test, as required under 
Sec. 60.8, to determine compliance with the emission limitations in 
Table 1 of this subpart and to establish operating limits using the 
procedure in Sec. 60.2110 or Sec. 60.2115. The initial performance test 
must be conducted using the test methods listed in Table 1 of this 
subpart and the procedures in Sec. 60.2125.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2140  By what date must I conduct the initial performance test?

    The initial performance test must be conducted within 60 days after 
your CISWI unit reaches the charge rate at which it will operate, but no 
later than 180 days after its initial startup.

                   Continuous Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 60.2145  How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission 
limitations and the operating limits?

    (a) You must conduct an annual performance test for particulate 
matter, hydrogen chloride, and opacity for each CISWI unit as required 
under Sec. 60.8 to determine compliance with the emission limitations. 
The annual performance test must be conducted using the test methods 
listed in Table 1 of this subpart and the procedures in Sec. 60.2125.
    (b) You must continuously monitor the operating parameters specified 
in Sec. 60.2110 or established under Sec. 60.2115. Operation above the 
established maximum or below the established minimum operating limits 
constitutes a deviation from the established operating limits. Three-
hour rolling average values are used to determine compliance (except for 
baghouse leak detection system alarms) unless a different averaging 
period is established under Sec. 60.2115. Operating limits do not apply 
during performance tests.
    (c) You must only burn the same types of waste used to establish 
operating limits during the performance test.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2150  By what date must I conduct the annual performance test?

    You must conduct annual performance tests for particulate matter, 
hydrogen chloride, and opacity within 12 months following the initial 
performance test. Conduct subsequent annual performance tests within 12 
months following the previous one.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2155  May I conduct performance testing less often?

    (a) You can test less often for a given pollutant if you have test 
data for at least 3 years, and all performance tests for the pollutant 
(particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, or opacity) over 3 consecutive 
years show that you comply with the emission limitation. In this case, 
you do not have to conduct a performance test for that pollutant for the 
next 2 years. You must conduct a performance test during the 3rd year 
and no more than 36 months following the previous performance test.
    (b) If your CISWI unit continues to meet the emission limitation for 
particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, or opacity, you may choose to 
conduct performance tests for these pollutants every 3rd year, but each 
test must be within 36 months of the previous performance test.
    (c) If a performance test shows a deviation from an emission 
limitation for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, or opacity, you 
must conduct annual performance tests for that pollutant until all 
performance tests over a 3-year period show compliance.

[[Page 682]]


<R05>
Sec. 60.2160  May I conduct a repeat performance test to establish new 
operating limits?

    (a) Yes. You may conduct a repeat performance test at any time to 
establish new values for the operating limits. The Administrator may 
request a repeat performance test at any time.
    (b) You must repeat the performance test if your feed stream is 
different than the feed streams used during any performance test used to 
demonstrate compliance.

 Subpart DDDD--Emissions Guidelines and Compliance Times for Commercial 
      and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units that Commenced 
               Construction On or Before November 30, 1999

    Source: 65 FR 75362, Dec. 1, 2000, unless otherwise noted.

                              Introduction


<R05>
Sec. 60.2500  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    This subpart establishes emission guidelines and compliance 
schedules for the control of emissions from commercial and industrial 
solid waste incineration (CISWI) units. The pollutants addressed by 
these emission guidelines are listed in Table 2 of this subpart. These 
emission guidelines are developed in accordance with sections 111(d) and 
129 of the Clean Air Act and subpart B of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2505  Am I affected by this subpart?

    (a) If you are the Administrator of an air quality program in a 
State or United States protectorate with one or more existing CISWI 
units that commenced construction on or before November 30, 1999, you 
must submit a State plan to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
that implements the emission guidelines contained in this subpart.
    (b) You must submit the State plan to EPA by December 3, 2001.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2510  Is a State plan required for all States?

    No. You are not required to submit a State plan if there are no 
existing CISWI units in your State, and you submit a negative 
declaration letter in place of the State plan.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2515  What must I include in my State plan?

    (a) You must include the nine items described in paragraphs (a)(1) 
through (9) of this section in your State plan.
    (1) Inventory of affected CISWI units, including those that have 
ceased operation but have not been dismantled.
    (2) Inventory of emissions from affected CISWI units in your State.
    (3) Compliance schedules for each affected CISWI unit.
    (4) Emission limitations, operator training and qualification 
requirements, a waste management plan, and operating limits for affected 
CISWI units that are at least as protective as the emission guidelines 
contained in this subpart.
    (5) Performance testing, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.
    (6) Certification that the hearing on the State plan was held, a 
list of witnesses and their organizational affiliations, if any, 
appearing at the hearing, and a brief written summary of each 
presentation or written submission.
    (7) Provision for State progress reports to EPA.
    (8) Identification of enforceable State mechanisms that you selected 
for implementing the emission guidelines of this subpart.
    (9) Demonstration of your State's legal authority to carry out the 
sections 111(d) and 129 State plan.
    (b) Your State plan may deviate from the format and content of the 
emission guidelines contained in this subpart. However, if your State 
plan does deviate in content, you must demonstrate that your State plan 
is at least as protective as the emission guidelines contained in this 
subpart. Your State plan must address regulatory applicability, 
increments of progress for retrofit, operator training and 
qualification, a waste management plan, emission limitations, 
performance testing, operating limits, monitoring, recordkeeping and 
reporting, and air curtain incinerator requirements.
    (c) You must follow the requirements of subpart B of this part 
(Adoption and Submittal of State Plans for Designated Facilities) in 
your State plan.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2520  Is there an approval process for my State plan?

    Yes. The EPA will review your State plan according to Sec. 60.27.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2525  What if my State plan is not approvable?

    If you do not submit an approvable State plan (or a negative 
declaration

[[Page 693]]

letter) by December 2, 2002, EPA will develop a Federal plan according 
to Sec. 60.27 to implement the emission guidelines contained in this 
subpart. Owners and operators of CISWI units not covered by an approved 
State plan must comply with the Federal plan. The Federal plan is an 
interim action and will be automatically withdrawn when your State plan 
is approved.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2530  Is there an approval process for a negative declaration letter?

    No. The EPA has no formal review process for negative declaration 
letters. Once your negative declaration letter has been received, EPA 
will place a copy in the public docket and publish a notice in the 
Federal Register. If, at a later date, an existing CISWI unit is found 
in your State, the Federal plan implementing the emission guidelines 
contained in this subpart would automatically apply to that CISWI unit 
until your State plan is approved.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2535  What compliance schedule must I include in my State plan?

    (a) Your State plan must include compliance schedules that require 
CISWI units to achieve final compliance as expeditiously as practicable 
after approval of the State plan but not later than the earlier of the 
two dates specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
    (1) December 1, 2005.
    (2) Three years after the effective date of State plan approval.
    (b) For compliance schedules more than 1 year following the 
effective date of State plan approval, State plans must include dates 
for enforceable increments of progress as specified in Sec. 60.2580.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2540  Are there any State plan requirements for this subpart that 
apply instead of the requirements specified in subpart B?

    Yes. Subpart B establishes general requirements for developing and 
processing section 111(d) plans. This subpart applies instead of the 
requirements in subpart B of this part for paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section:
    (a) State plans developed to implement this subpart must be as 
protective as the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. State 
plans must require all CISWI units to comply by December 1, 2005 or 3 
years after the effective date of State plan approval, whichever is 
sooner. This applies instead of the option for case-by-case less 
stringent emission standards and longer compliance schedules in 
Sec. 60.24(f).
    (b) State plans developed to implement this subpart are required to 
include two increments of progress for the affected CISWI units. These 
two minimum increments are the final control plan submittal date and 
final compliance date in Sec. 60.21(h)(1) and (5). This applies instead 
of the requirement of Sec. 60.24(e)(1) that would require a State plan 
to include all five increments of progress for all CISWI units.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2545  Does this subpart directly affect CISWI unit owners and 
operators in my State?

    (a) No. This subpart does not directly affect CISWI unit owners and 
operators in your State. However, CISWI unit owners and operators must 
comply with the State plan you develop to implement the emission 
guidelines contained in this subpart. States may choose to incorporate 
the model rule text directly in their State plan.
    (b) If you do not submit an approvable plan to implement and enforce 
the guidelines contained in this subpart by December 2, 2002, the EPA 
will implement and enforce a Federal plan, as provided in Sec. 60.2525, 
to ensure that each unit within your State reaches compliance with all 
the provisions of this subpart by December 1, 2005.

                      Applicability of State Plans


<R05>
Sec. 60.2550  What CISWI units must I address in my State plan?

    (a) Your State plan must address incineration units that meet all 
three criteria described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this 
section.
    (1) Incineration units in your State that commenced construction on 
or before November 30, 1999.
    (2) Incineration units that meet the definition of a CISWI unit as 
defined in Sec. 60.2875.
    (3) Incineration units not exempt under Sec. 60.2555.

[[Page 694]]

    (b) If the owner or operator of a CISWI unit makes changes that meet 
the definition of modification or reconstruction on or after June 1, 
2001, the CISWI unit becomes subject to subpart CCCC of this part and 
the State plan no longer applies to that unit.
    (c) If the owner or operator of a CISWI unit makes physical or 
operational changes to an existing CISWI unit primarily to comply with 
your State plan, subpart CCCC of this part does not apply to that unit. 
Such changes do not qualify as modifications or reconstructions under 
subpart CCCC of this part.

    (a) If you use a wet scrubber to comply with the emission 
limitations, you must establish operating limits for four operating 
parameters (as specified in Table 3 of this subpart) as described in 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section during the initial 
performance test.
    (1) Maximum charge rate, calculated using one of the two different 
procedures in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii), as appropriate.
    (i) For continuous and intermittent units, maximum charge rate is 
110 percent of the average charge rate measured during the most recent 
performance test demonstrating compliance with all applicable emission 
limitations.
    (ii) For batch units, maximum charge rate is 110 percent of the 
daily charge rate measured during the most recent performance test 
demonstrating compliance with all applicable emission limitations.
    (2) Minimum pressure drop across the wet scrubber, which is 
calculated as 90 percent of the average pressure drop across the wet 
scrubber measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating 
compliance with the particulate matter emission limitations; or minimum 
amperage to the wet scrubber, which is calculated as 90 percent of the 
average amperage to the wet scrubber measured during the most recent 
performance test demonstrating compliance with the particulate matter 
emission limitations.
    (3) Minimum scrubber liquor flow rate, which is calculated as 90 
percent of the average liquor flow rate at the inlet to the wet scrubber 
measured during the most recent performance test demonstrating 
compliance with all applicable emission limitations.
    (4) Minimum scrubber liquor pH, which is calculated as 90 percent of 
the average liquor pH at the inlet to the wet scrubber measured during 
the most recent performance test demonstrating compliance with the HCl 
emission limitation.
    (b) You must meet the operating limits established during the 
initial performance test on the date the initial performance test is 
required or completed (whichever is earlier).
    (c) If you use a fabric filter to comply with the emission 
limitations, you must operate each fabric filter system such that the 
bag leak detection system alarm does not sound more than 5 percent of 
the operating time during a 6-month period. In calculating this 
operating time percentage, if inspection of the fabric filter 
demonstrates that

[[Page 701]]

no corrective action is required, no alarm time is counted. If 
corrective action is required, each alarm shall be counted as a minimum 
of 1 hour. If you take longer than 1 hour to initiate corrective action, 
the alarm time shall be counted as the actual amount of time taken by 
you to initiate corrective action.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2680  What if I do not use a wet scrubber to comply with the emission 
limitations?

    If you use an air pollution control device other than a wet 
scrubber, or limit emissions in some other manner, to comply with the 
emission limitations under Sec. 60.2670, you must petition the 
Administrator for specific operating limits to be established during the 
initial performance test and continuously monitored thereafter. You must 
not conduct the initial performance test until after the petition has 
been approved by the Administrator. Your petition must include the five 
items listed in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
    (a) Identification of the specific parameters you propose to use as 
additional operating limits.
    (b) A discussion of the relationship between these parameters and 
emissions of regulated pollutants, identifying how emissions of 
regulated pollutants change with changes in these parameters, and how 
limits on these parameters will serve to limit emissions of regulated 
pollutants.
    (c) A discussion of how you will establish the upper and/or lower 
values for these parameters which will establish the operating limits on 
these parameters.
    (d) A discussion identifying the methods you will use to measure and 
the instruments you will use to monitor these parameters, as well as the 
relative accuracy and precision of these methods and instruments.
    (e) A discussion identifying the frequency and methods for 
recalibrating the instruments you will use for monitoring these 
parameters.

runs conducted under conditions representative of normal operations.
    (b) You must document that the waste burned during the performance 
test is representative of the waste burned under normal operating 
conditions by maintaining a log of the quantity of waste burned (as 
required in Sec. 60.2740(b)(1)) and the types of waste burned during the 
performance test.
    (c) All performance tests must be conducted using the minimum run 
duration specified in Table 2 of this subpart.
    (d) Method 1 of appendix A of this part must be used to select the 
sampling location and number of traverse points.

composition analysis, including measurement of oxygen concentration. 
Method 3A or 3B of appendix A of this part must be used simultaneously 
with each method.
    (f) All pollutant concentrations, except for opacity, must be 
adjusted to 7 percent oxygen using Equation 1 of this section:

C<INF>adj</INF> = C<INF>meas</INF> (20.9-7)/(20.9-%O<INF>2</INF>)      
    (Eq. 1)

Where:

C<INF>adj</INF> = pollutant concentration adjusted to 7 percent oxygen;
C<INF>meas</INF> = pollutant concentration measured on a dry basis;
(20.9-7) = 20.9 percent oxygen-7 percent oxygen (defined oxygen 
correction basis);
20.9 = oxygen concentration in air, percent; and
%O<INF>2</INF> = oxygen concentration measured on a dry basis, percent.

<R05>
Sec. 60.2700  How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission 
limitations and establish the operating limits?

    You must conduct an initial performance test, as required under 
Sec. 60.8, to determine compliance with the emission limitations in 
Table 2 of this subpart and to establish operating limits using the 
procedure in Sec. 60.2675 or Sec. 60.2680. The initial performance test 
must be conducted using the test methods listed in Table 2 of this 
subpart and the procedures in Sec. 60.2690.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2705  By what date must I conduct the initial performance test?

    The initial performance test must be conducted no later than 180 
days after your final compliance date. Your final compliance date is 
specified in Table 1 of this subpart.

             Model Rule--Continuous Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 60.2710  How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission 
limitations and the operating limits?

    (a) You must conduct an annual performance test for particulate 
matter, hydrogen chloride, and opacity for each CISWI unit as required 
under Sec. 60.8 to determine compliance with the emission limitations. 
The annual performance test must be conducted using the test methods 
listed in Table 2 of this subpart and the procedures in Sec. 60.2690.
    (b) You must continuously monitor the operating parameters specified 
in Sec. 60.2675 or established under Sec. 60.2680. Operation above the 
established maximum or below the established minimum operating limits 
constitutes a deviation from the established operating limits. Three-
hour rolling average values are used to determine compliance (except for 
baghouse leak detection system alarms) unless a different averaging 
period is established under Sec. 60.2680. Operating limits do not apply 
during performance tests.
    (c) You must only burn the same types of waste used to establish 
operating limits during the performance test.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2715  By what date must I conduct the annual performance test?

    You must conduct annual performance tests for particulate matter, 
hydrogen chloride, and opacity within 12 months following the initial 
performance test. Conduct subsequent annual performance tests within 12 
months following the previous one.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2720  May I conduct performance testing less often?

    (a) You can test less often for a given pollutant if you have test 
data for at least 3 years, and all performance tests for the pollutant 
(particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, or opacity) over 3 consecutive 
years show that you comply with the emission limitation. In this case, 
you do not have to conduct a performance test for that pollutant for the 
next 2 years. You must conduct a performance test during the third year

[[Page 703]]

and no more than 36 months following the previous performance test.
    (b) If your CISWI unit continues to meet the emission limitation for 
particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, or opacity, you may choose to 
conduct performance tests for these pollutants every third year, but 
each test must be within 36 months of the previous performance test.
    (c) If a performance test shows a deviation from an emission 
limitation for particulate matter, hydrogen chloride, or opacity, you 
must conduct annual performance tests for that pollutant until all 
performance tests over a 3-year period show compliance.


<R05>
Sec. 60.2725  May I conduct a repeat performance test to establish new 
operating limits?

    (a) Yes. You may conduct a repeat performance test at any time to 
establish new values for the operating limits. The Administrator may 
request a repeat performance test at any time.
    (b) You must repeat the performance test if your feed stream is 
different than the feed streams used during any performance test used to 
demonstrate compliance.
