                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 2000), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

\1\ Where length is used in this table it means the length measured from end to end over the deck, excluding sheer. This expression means a straight line measurement of the overall length from
  the foremost part of the vessel to the aftermost part of the vessel, measured parallel to the centerline.
\2\ Subchapters E (Load Lines), F (Marine Engineering), J (Electrical Engineering), and N (Dangerous Cargoes) of this chapter may also be applicable under certain conditions. The provisions of
  49 CFR parts 171-179 apply whenever hazardous materials are on board vessels (including motorboats), except when specifically exempted by law.
\3\ Public nautical schoolships, other than vessels of the Navy and Coast Guard, shall meet the requirements of part 167 of subchapter R (Nautical Schools) of this chapter. Civilian nautical
  schoolships, as defined by 46 U.S.C. 1331, shall meet the requirements of subchapter H (Passenger Vessels) and part 168 of subchapter R (Nautical Schools) of this chapter.
\4\ Subchapter H (Passenger Vessels) of this chapter covers only those vessels of 100 gross tons or more. Subchapter T (Small Passenger Vessels) of this chapter covers only those vessels of
  less than 100 gross tons.
\5\ Vessels covered by subchapter H (Passenger Vessels) or I (Cargo and Miscellaneous Vessels) of this chapter, where the principal purpose or use of the vessel is not for the carriage of
  liquid cargo, may be granted a permit to carry a limited amount of flammable or combustible liquid cargo in bulk. The portion of the vessel used for the carriage of the flammable or
  combustible liquid cargo shall meet the requirements of subchapter D (Tank Vessels) in addition to the requirements of subchapter H (Passenger Vessels) or I (Cargo and Miscellaneous Vessels)
  of this chapter.
\6\ Any vessel on an international voyage is subject to the requirements of the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea, 1974.
\7\ The meaning of the term ``passenger'' is as defined in the Act of May 10, 1956 (Sec. 1, 70 Stat. 151; 46 U.S.C. 390). On oceanographic vessels scientific personnel on board shall not be
  deemed to be passengers nor seamen, but for calculations of lifesaving equipment, etc., shall be counted as persons.
\8\ Boilers and machinery are subject to examination on vessels over 40 feet in length.
\9\ Under 46 U.S.C. 441 an ``oceanographic research vessel'' is a vessel ``* * * being employed exclusively in instruction in oceanography or limnology, or both, or exclusively in
  oceanographic research, * * *,'' Under 46 U.S.C. 443, ``an oceanographic research vessel shall not be deemed to be engaged in trade or commerce.'' If or when an oceanographic vessel engages
  in trade or commerce, such vessel cannot operate under its certificate of inspection as an oceanographic vessel, but shall be inspected and certificated for the service in which engaged, and
  the scientific personnel aboard then become persons employed in the business of the vessel.
\10\ Bulk dangerous cargoes are cargoes specified in table 151.01-10(b), in table I of part 153, and in table 4 of part 154 of this chapter.

Sec. 90.05-5  Specific application noted in text.

    (a) At the beginning of the various parts, subparts, and sections, a 
more specific application is generally given for the particular portion 
of the text involved. This application sets forth the types, sizes, or 
services or vessels to which the text pertains, and in many cases limits 
the application of the text to vessels contracted for before or after a 
specific date. As used in this subchapter, the term ``vessels contracted 
for'' includes not only the contracting for the construction of a 
vessel, but also the contracting for a material alteration to a vessel, 
the contracting for the conversion of a vessel to a cargo or 
miscellaneous vessel, and the changing of service or route of a vessel 
if such change increases or modifies the general requirements for the 
vessel or increases the hazards to which it might be subjected.


<R05>
Sec. 90.05-7  Ocean or unlimited coastwise vessels on inland and Great Lakes routes.

    (a) Vessels inspected and certificated for ocean or unlimited 
coastwise routes shall be considered suitable for navigation insofar as 
the provisions of this subchapter are concerned on any inland routes, 
including the Great Lakes.


<R05>
Sec. 90.05-10  Application to vessels on an international voyage.

    (a) Except for yachts and fishing vessels and as provided in 
paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, the regulations in this 
subchapter that apply to a vessel on an ``international voyage'' apply 
to a vessel that--
    (1) Is mechanically propelled and of at least 500 gross tons; and
    (2) Is engaged on a voyage--
    (i) From a country to which the International Convention for Safety 
of Life at Sea, 1974, (SOLAS 74) applies, to a port outside that country 
or the reverse;
    (ii) From any territory, including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 
all possessions of the United States and all lands held by the United 
States under a protectorate or mandate, whose international relations 
are the responsibility of a contracting SOLAS 74 government, or which is 
administered by the United Nations, to a port outside the territory or 
the reverse; or
    (iii) Between the contiguous states of the United States and the 
states of Hawaii or Alaska or between the states of Hawaii and Alaska.
    (b) The regulations that apply to a vessel on an ``international 
voyage'' in this subchapter do not apply to ships engaged on a voyage 
solely on the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River as far east as a 
straight line drawn from Cap de Rosiers to West Point, Anticosti Island, 
the 63d Meridian;
    (c) The Commandant or his authorized representative may exempt any 
vessel on an international voyage from the requirements of this 
subchapter if the vessel--
    (1) Makes a single international voyage in exceptional 
circumstances; and
    (2) Meets safety requirements prescribed for the voyage by the 
Commandant.
    (d) The Commandant or his authorized representative may exempt any 
vessel from the construction requirements of this subchapter if the 
vessel does not proceed more than 20 nautical miles from the nearest 
land in the course of its voyage.

Sec. 90.05-20  Applicability to offshore supply vessels.

    (a) Existing offshore supply vessels as defined by Sec. 90.10-40(b), 
if they are of 100 or more but of less than 500 gross tons, are subject 
to inspection under this subchapter. New offshore supply vessels as 
defined by Sec. 90.10-40(c), are subject to inspection under subchapter 
L of this chapter.
    (b) Each offshore supply vessel permitted grandfathering under 
paragraph (a) of this section must complete construction and have a 
Certificate of Inspection by March 16, 1998.

Sec. 90.05-25  Seagoing barge.

    (a) All nonself-propelled vessels of 100 gross tons and over that 
proceed on voyages on the high seas or ocean are

[[Page 12]]

subject to inspection and certification as seagoing barges.
    (b) In applying the laws and regulations to manned seagoing barges, 
one criterion for invocation of safety standards is the description of 
seagoing barges by relative size in gross tons. When it is determined by 
the Commandant that the gross register tonnage for a particular manned 
seagoing barge, which is attained by exemptions, reductions, or other 
devices in the basic gross tonnage formulation, will circumvent or be 
incompatible with the application of specific safety requirements in the 
regulations in this subchapter for a manned seagoing barge of such 
physical size, the Commandant shall prescribe the regulations to be made 
applicable to such seagoing barge. When the Commandant determines that 
the gross register tonnage is not a valid criterion for the invocation 
of safety requirements based on relative size, the parties involved will 
be informed of the determination and of the regulations applicable to 
such manner seagoing barges, and before being permitted to operate such 
seagoing barges, compliance therewith shall be required. Endorsements or 
notations on the seagoing barge's certificate of inspection may be made 
as appropriate.

157.10d.
    Vessels inspected and certificated under this subchapter may carry 
limited quantities of flammable and combustible liquid cargo in bulk in 
the grades indicated, provided the Certificate of Inspection is endorsed 
to permit such carriage:
    (a) Cargo vessels:
    (1) Grades D and E in an integral tank; and
    (2) Grades D and E and certain specifically named Grade C in a 
portable tank, including a marine portable tank (MPT), in accordance 
with subpart 98.30 or 98.33 of this subchapter.
    (b) Miscellaneous Vessels, such as cable, salvage, pile-driving, and 
oil-drilling-rig vessels:
    (1) Grades B, C, D, and E in a fixed independent or integral tank 
authorized by the commandant;
    (2) Grades D and E and certain specifically named Grade C in a 
portable tank, including an MPT, in accordance with subpart 98.30 or 
98.33 of this subchapter.

<R05>
Sec. 91.27-1  Annual and periodic inspections.

    (a) Annual inspection. Your vessel must undergo an annual inspection 
within the 3 months before or after each anniversary date, except as 
required in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (1) You must contact the cognizant Officer in Charge, Marine 
Inspection to schedule an inspection at a time and place which he or she 
approves. No written application is required.
    (2) The scope of the annual inspection is the same as the inspection 
for certification as specified in Sec. 91.25-10 but in less detail 
unless the cognizant marine inspector finds deficiencies or determines 
that a major change has occurred since the last inspection. If 
deficiencies are found or a major change to the vessel has occurred, the 
marine inspector will conduct an inspection more detailed in scope to 
ensure that the vessel is in satisfactory condition and fit for the 
service for which it is intended. If your vessel passes the annual 
inspection, the marine inspector will endorse your current Certificate 
of Inspection.
    (3) If the annual inspection reveals deficiencies in your vessel's 
maintenance, you must make any or all repairs or improvements within the 
time period specified by the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection.
    (4) Nothing in this subpart limits the marine inspector from 
conducting such tests or inspections he or she deems necessary to be 
assured of the vessel's seaworthiness.
    (b) Periodic inspection. Your vessel must undergo a periodic 
inspection within 3 months before or after the second or third 
anniversary of the date of your vessel's Certificate of Inspection. This 
periodic inspection will take the place of an annual inspection.
    (1) You must contact the cognizant Officer in Charge, Marine 
Inspection to schedule an inspection at a time and place which he or she 
approves. No written application is required.
    (2) The scope of the periodic inspection is the same as that for the 
inspection for certification, as specified in Sec. 91.25-10. The Officer 
in Charge, Marine Inspection will insure that the vessel is in 
satisfactory condition and fit for the service for which it is intended. 
If your vessel passes the periodic inspection, the marine inspector will 
endorse your current Certificate of Inspection.
    (3) If the periodic inspection reveals deficiencies in your vessel's 
maintenance, you must make any or all repairs or improvements within the 
time period specified by the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection.

available, the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, upon the 
recommendation of the vessel owner and his contractor or their 
representative, shall select a person who, in the case of an individual 
vessel, shall be authorized to make such inspection. If the inspection 
indicates that such operations can be undertaken with safety, a 
certificate setting forth the fact in writing and qualified as may be 
required, shall be issued by the certified marine chemist or the 
authorized person before the work is started. Such qualifications shall 
include any requirements as may be deemed necessary to maintain, insofar 
as can reasonably be done, the safe conditions in the spaces certified 
throughout the operation and shall include such additional tests and 
certifications as considered required. Such qualifications and 
requirements shall include precautions necessary to eliminate or 
minimize hazards that may be present from protective coatings or 
residues from cargoes.
    (2) When not in such a port or place, and a marine chemist or such 
person authorized by the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, is not 
reasonably available, the inspection shall be made by the senior officer 
present and a proper entry shall be made in the vessel's logbook.
    (d) It shall be the responsibility of the senior officer present to 
secure copies of certificates issued by the certified marine chemist or 
such person authorized by the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection. It 
shall be the responsibility of the senior officer present, insofar as 
the persons under his control are concerned, to maintain a safe 
condition on the vessel by full observance of all qualifications and 
requirements listed by the marine chemist in the certificate.

  commercial grade together with a commercial garden hose nozzle may be
  used. The pump may be hand operated and the length of hose shall be
  sufficient to assure coverage of all parts of the vessel.
\2\ 75 feet of 1\1/2\-inch hose and \5/8\-inch nozzle may be used where
  specified by Sec.  95.10-10(b) for interior locations and 50 feet of
  1\1/2\-inch hose may be used in exterior locations on vessels in other
  than ocean or coastwise service.

    (b) On vessels of 1,000 gross tons and over on an international 
voyage, each required fire pump, while delivering water thru the fire 
main system at a pressure corresponding to that required by paragraph 
(c) of this section, shall have a minimum capacity of at least two-
thirds of that required for an independent bilge pump. However, in no 
case shall the capacity of each fire pump be less than that otherwise 
required by this section.
    (c) Each pump shall be capable of delivering water simultaneously 
from the two highest outlets at a Pitot tube pressure of approximately 
50 p.s.i. Where 1\1/2\-inch hose is permitted in lieu of 2\1/2\-inch 
hose by footnote 2 of Table 95.10-5(a), the pump capacity shall be 
determined on the same basis as if 2\1/2\-inch hose had been permitted. 
Where \3/4\-inch hose is permitted by Table

[[Page 49]]

95.10-5(a), the Pitot tube pressure need be only 35 p.s.i.
    (d) Fire pumps shall be fitted on the discharge side with relief 
valves set to relieve at 25 p.s.i. in excess of the pressure necessary 
to maintain the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section or 125 
p.s.i., whichever is greater. Relief valves may be omitted if the pumps, 
operating under shut-off conditions, are not capable of developing a 
pressure exceeding this amount.
    (e) Fire pumps shall be fitted with a pressure gage on the discharge 
side of the pumps.
    (f) Fire pumps may be used for other purposes provided at least one 
of the required pumps is kept available for use on the fire system at 
all times. In no case shall a pump having connection to an oil line be 
used as a fire pump. Branch lines connected to the fire main for 
purposes other than fire and deck wash shall be so arranged that 
adequate water can be made continuously available for firefighting 
purposes.
    (g) The total area of the pipes leading from a pump shall not be 
less than the discharge area of the pump.
    (h) On vessels with oil fired boilers, either main or auxiliary, or 
with internal combustion propulsion machinery, where 2 fire pumps are 
required, they shall be located in separate spaces, and the arrangement 
of pumps, sea connections, and sources of power shall be such as to 
insure that a fire in any one space will not put all of the fire pumps 
out of operation. However, where it is shown to the satisfaction of the 
Commandant that it is unreasonable or impracticable to meet this 
requirement due to the size or arrangement of the vessel, or for other 
reasons, the installation of a total flooding carbon dioxide system may 
be accepted as an alternate method of extinguishing any fire which would 
affect the powering and operation of at least one of the required fire 
pumps.

    (a) The size of fire hydrants, hose, and nozzles and the length of 
hose required shall be as noted in Table 95.10-5(a).
    (b) In lieu of the 2\1/2\-inch hose and hydrants specified in Table 
95.10-5(a), on vessels over 1,500 gross tons, the hydrants in interior 
locations may have siamese connections for 1\1/2\-inch hose. In these 
cases the hose shall be 75 feet in length, and only one hose will be 
required at each fire station; however, if all such stations can be 
satisfactorily served with 50-foot lengths, 50-foot hose may be used.
    (c) On vessels of 500 gross tons and over there must be at least one 
shore connection to the fire main available to each side of the vessel 
in an accessible location. Suitable cut-out valves and check valves must 
be provided. Suitable adapters also must be provided for furnishing the 
vessel's shore connections with couplings mating those on the shore fire 
lines. Vessels of 500 gross tons and over on an international voyage, 
must be provided with at least one international shore connection 
complying with ASTM F 1121 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 95.01-
2). Facilities must be available enabling an international connection to 
be used on either side of the vessel.
    (d) Fire hydrants shall be of sufficient number and so located that 
any part of the vessel, other than main machinery spaces, accessible to 
persons on board while the vessel is being navigated and all cargo holds 
may be reached with at least 2 streams of water from separate outlets, 
at least one of which shall be from a single length of hose. In main 
machinery spaces, all portions of such spaces shall be capable of being 
reached by at least 2 streams of water, each of which shall be from a 
single length of hose from separate outlets; however, this requirement 
need not apply to shaft alleys containing no assigned space for the 
stowage of combustibles. Fire hydrants shall be numbered as required by 
Sec. 97.37-15 of this subchapter.
    (e) All parts of the fire main located on exposed decks shall either 
be protected against freezing or be fitted with cut-out valves and drain 
valves so that the entire exposed parts of such piping may be shut off 
and drained in freezing weather. Except when closed to prevent freezing, 
such valves shall be sealed open.

[[Page 50]]

    (f) The outlet at the fire hydrant shall be limited to any position 
from the horizontal to the vertical pointing downward, so that the hose 
will lead horizontally or downward to minimize the possibility of 
kinking.
    (g) Each fire hydrant must have at least one length of firehose, a 
spanner, and a hose rack or other device for stowing the hose.
    (h) Fire hose shall be connected to the outlets at all times. 
However, on open decks where no protection is afforded to the hose in 
heavy weather, or where the hose may be liable to damage from the 
handling of cargo, the hose may be temporarily removed from the hydrant 
and stowed in an accessible nearby location.
    (i) Each firehose on each hydrant must have a combination solid 
stream and water spray firehose nozzle approved under subpart 162.027 of 
this chapter. Firehose nozzles previously approved under subpart 162.027 
of this chapter may be retained so long as they are maintained in good 
condition to the satisfaction of the Officer in Charge, Marine 
Inspection.
    (j) In each propulsion machinery space containing an oil fired 
boiler, internal combustion machinery, or oil fuel unit on a vessel on 
an international voyage or of 1000 gross tons or more, each firehose 
having a combination nozzle previously approved under subpart 162.027 of 
this chapter must have a low-velocity water spray applicator that is 
also previously approved under subpart 162.027 of this chapter. The 
length of the applicator must be less than 1.8 meters (6 feet).
    (k) Fixed brackets, hooks, or other means for stowing an applicator 
must be next to each fire hydrant that has an applicator under paragraph 
(j) of this section.
    (l) Firehose shall not be used for any other purpose than fire 
extinguishing, drills, and testing.
    (m) Fire hydrants, nozzles, and other fittings shall have threads to 
accommodate the hose connections noted in paragraph (l) of this section.
    (n) Firehose and couplings must be as follows:
    (1) Fire station hydrant connections shall be brass, bronze, or 
other equivalent metal. Couplings shall either:
    (i) Use National Standard fire hose coupling threads for the 1\1/2\ 
inch (38 millimeter) and 2\1/2\ inch (64 millimeter) hose sizes, i.e., 9 
threads per inch for 1\1/2\ inch hose, and 7\1/2\ threads per inch for 
2\1/2\ inch hose; or
    (ii) Be a uniform design for each hose diameter throughout the 
vessel.
    (2) Where 19 millimeters (\3/4\ inch) hose is permitted by table 
95.10-5(a), the hose and couplings shall be of good commercial grade.
    (3) Each section of firehose must be lined commercial firehose that 
conforms to Underwriters' Laboratories, Inc. Standard 19 or Federal 
Specification ZZ-H-451E. Hose that bears the label of Underwriters' 
Laboratories, Inc. as lined firehose is accepted as conforming to this 
requirement.

      Subpart 95.15--Carbon Dioxide Extinguishing Systems, Details


<R05>
Sec. 95.15-1  Application.

    (a) Where a carbon dioxide extinguishing system is installed, the 
provisions of this subpart, with the exception of Sec. 95.15-90, shall 
apply to all installations contracted for on or after November 19, 1952. 
Installations contracted for prior to November 19, 1952, shall meet the 
requirements of Sec. 95.15-90.
    (b) The requirements of this subpart are based on a ``high pressure 
system,'' i.e., one in which the carbon dioxide is stored in liquid form 
at atmospheric temperature. Details for ``low pressure systems,'' i. e., 
those in which the carbon dioxide is stored in liquid form at a 
continuously controlled low temperature, may be specifically approved by 
the Commandant where it is demonstrated that a comparable degree of 
safety and fire extinguishing ability is achieved.


<R05>
Sec. 95.15-5  Quantity, pipe sizes, and discharge rates.

    (a) General. The amount of carbon dioxide required for each space 
shall be as determined by paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.
    (b) Total available supply. A separate supply of carbon dioxide need 
not be provided for each space protected. The total available supply 
shall be at least sufficient for the space requiring the greatest 
amount.

[[Page 52]]

    (c) Cargo spaces. (1) The number of pounds of carbon dioxide 
required for each space shall be equal to the gross volume of the space 
in cubic feet divided by 30.
    (2) Although separate piping shall be led to each cargo hold and 
'tween deck, for the purpose of determining the amount of carbon dioxide 
required, a cargo compartment will be considered as the space between 
watertight or firescreen bulkheads and from the tank top or lowest deck 
to the deck head of the uppermost space on which cargo may be carried. 
If a trunk extends beyond such deck, the trunk volume shall be included. 
Tonnage openings shall be considered as sealed for this purpose.
    (3) Branch lines to the various cargo holds and 'tween decks shall 
not be less than \3/4\-inch standard pipe size.
    (4) No specific discharge rate need be applied to such systems.
    (d) Machinery spaces, paint lockers, tanks, and similar spaces. (1) 
Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the number of 
pounds of carbon dioxide required for each space shall be equal to the 
gross volume of the space divided by the appropriate factor noted in 
Table 95.15-5(d)(1). If fuel can drain from the compartment being 
protected to an adjacent compartment, or if the compartments are not 
entirely separate, the requirements for both compartments shall be used 
to determine the amount of carbon dioxide to be provided. The carbon 
dioxide shall be arranged to discharge into both such compartments 
simultaneously.

    (2) For the purpose of the requirements of this paragraph, the 
volume of the machinery space shall be taken as exclusive of the normal 
machinery casing unless the boiler, internal combustion machinery, or 
fuel oil installation extend into such space, in which case the volume 
shall be taken to the top of the casing or the next material reduction 
in casing area, whichever is lower. For installations contracted for on 
or after October 1, 1959, ``normal machinery casing'' and ``material 
reduction in casing area'' shall be defined as follows:
    (i) By ``normal machinery casing'' shall be meant a casing the area 
of which is not more than 40 percent of the maximum area of the 
machinery space.
    (ii) By ``material reduction in casing area'' shall be meant a 
reduction to at least 40 percent of the casing area.
    (3) For vessels on an international voyage contracted for on or 
after May 26, 1965, the amount of carbon dioxide required for a space 
containing propulsion boilers or internal combustion propulsion 
machinery shall be as given by paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this 
section or by dividing the entire volume, including the casing, by a 
factor of 25, whichever is the larger.
    (4) Branch lines to the various spaces shall be as noted in Table 
95.15-5(d)(4).

    (5) Distribution piping within the space shall be proportioned from 
the supply line to give proper distribution to the outlets without 
throttling.
    (6) The number, type, and location of discharge outlets shall be 
such as to give a uniform distribution throughout the space.
    (7) The total area of all discharge outlets shall not exceed 85 
percent nor be less than 35 percent of the nominal cylinder outlet area 
or the area of the supply pipe, whichever is smaller. The nominal 
cylinder outlet area in square inches shall be determined by multiplying 
the factor 0.0022 by the number of pounds of carbon dioxide required, 
except that in no case shall this outlet area be less than 0.110 square 
inches.

[[Page 53]]

    (8) The discharge of at least 85 percent of the required amount of 
carbon dioxide shall be complete within 2 minutes.
    (e) Spaces specially suitable for vehicles. (1) The number of pounds 
of carbon dioxide required shall be equal to the gross volume of the 
largest ``tight'' space divided by 22. In no case, however, shall the 
quantity be less than that required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (2) The arrangement of valves and piping shall be such that the 
required quantity of carbon dioxide may be discharged into any ``tight'' 
space. The discharge of the required quantity of carbon dioxide shall be 
completed within 2 minutes.
    (3) Except as noted in paragraphs (e) (1) and (2) of this section, 
the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section shall apply.

Sec. 95.15-10  Controls.

    (a) Except as noted in Sec. 95.15-20(b) all controls and valves for 
the operation of the system shall be outside the space protected, and 
shall not be located in any space that might be cut off or made 
inaccessible in the event of fire in any of the spaces protected.
    (b) If the same cylinders are used to protect more than one hazard, 
a manifold with normally closed stop valves shall be used to direct the 
carbon dioxide into the proper space. If cylinders are used to protect 
only one hazard, a normally closed stop valve shall be installed between 
the cylinders and the hazard except for systems of the type indicated in 
Sec. 95.15-5(d) which contain not more than 300 pounds of carbon 
dioxide.
    (c) Distribution piping to the various cargo spaces shall be 
controlled from not more than two stations. One of the stations 
controlling the system for the main machinery space shall be located as 
convenient as practicable to one of the main escapes from the space. All 
control stations and the individual valves and controls shall be marked 
as required by Secs. 97.37-10 and 97.37-13 of this subchapter.
    (d) Systems of the type indicated in Sec. 95.15-5(d) shall be 
actuated by one control operating the valve to the space and a separate 
control releasing at least the required amount of carbon dioxide. These 
two controls shall be located in a box or other enclosure clearly 
identified for the particular space. Those systems installed without a 
stop valve shall be operated by one control releasing at least the 
required amount of carbon dioxide.
    (e) Where provisions are made for the simultaneous release of a 
given amount of carbon dioxide by operation of a remote control, 
provisions shall also be made for manual control at the cylinders. Where 
gas pressure from pilot cylinders is used as a means for releasing the 
remaining cylinders, not less than two pilot cylinders shall be used for 
systems consisting of more than two cylinders. Each of the pilot 
cylinders shall be capable of manual control at the cylinder, but the 
remaining cylinders need not be capable of individual manual control.
    (f) Systems of the type indicated in Sec. 95.15-5(d), other than 
systems for tanks, which are of more than 300 pounds of carbon dioxide, 
shall be fitted with an approved delayed discharge so arranged that the 
alarm will be sounded for at least 20 seconds before the carbon dioxide 
is released into the space. Such systems of not more than 300 pounds of 
carbon dioxide shall also have a similar delayed discharge, except for 
those systems for tanks and for spaces which have a suitable horizontal 
escape. This paragraph shall be applicable only to systems installed on 
or after July 1, 1957.
    (g) All distribution valves and controls shall be of an approved 
type. All controls shall be suitably protected.
    (h) Complete but simple instructions for the operation of the 
systems must be located in a conspicuous place at or near all pull 
boxes, stop valve controls and in the CO<INF>2</INF> cylinder storage 
room. On systems in which the CO<INF>2</INF> cylinders are not within 
the protected space, these instructions must also include a schematic 
diagram of the system and instructions detailing alternate methods of 
discharging the system should the manual release or stop valve controls 
fail to operate. Each control valve

[[Page 54]]

to branch lines must be marked to indicate the related space served.
    (i) If the space or enclosure containing the carbon dioxide supply 
or controls is to be locked, a key to the space or enclosure shall be in 
a break-glass-type box conspicuously located adjacent to the opening.

    (c) All piping, valves, and fittings of ferrous materials shall be 
protected inside and outside against corrosion unless specifically 
approved otherwise by the Commandant.
    (d) A pressure relief valve or equivalent set to relieve between 
2,400 and 2,800 pounds per square inch shall be installed in the 
distributing manifold or such other location as to protect the piping in 
the event that all branch line shut-off valves are closed.
    (e) All dead-end lines shall extend at least 2 inches beyond the 
last orifice and shall be closed with cap or plug.
    (f) All piping, valves, and fittings shall be securely supported, 
and where necessary, protected against injury.
    (g) Drains and dirt traps shall be fitted where necessary to prevent 
the accumulation of dirt or moisture. Drains and dirt traps shall be 
located in accessible locations where possible.
    (h) Piping shall be used for no other purpose except that it may be 
incorporated with the fire-detecting system.
    (i) Piping passing through living quarters shall not be fitted with 
drains or other openings within such spaces.
    (j) Installation test requirements are:
    (1) Upon completion of the piping installation, and before the 
cylinders are connected, a pressure test shall be applied as set forth 
in this paragraph. Only carbon dioxide or other inert gas shall be used 
for this test.
    (2) The piping from the cylinders to the stop valves in the manifold 
shall be subjected to a pressure of 1,000 pounds per square inch. With 
no additional gas being introduced to the system, it shall be 
demonstrated that the leakage of the system is such as not to permit a 
pressure drop of more than 150 pounds per square inch per minute for a 
2-minute period.
    (3) The individual branch lines to the various spaces protected 
shall be subjected to a test similar to that described in the preceding 
paragraph with the exception that the pressure used shall be 600 pounds 
per square inch in lieu of 1,000 pounds per square inch. For the purpose 
of this test, the distribution piping shall be capped within the space 
protected at the first joint ahead of the nozzles.
    (4) In lieu of the tests prescribed in paragraphs (j) (1) through 
(3) of this section, small independent systems protecting spaces such as 
emergency generator rooms, lamp lockers, etc., may be tested by blowing 
out the piping with air at a pressure of at least 100 pounds per square 
inch.

    (b) Systems of the type indicated in Sec. 95.15-5(d), consisting of 
not more than 300 pounds of carbon dioxide, may have the cylinders 
located within the space protected. If the cylinder stowage is within 
the space protected, the system shall be arranged in an approved manner 
to be automatically operated by a heat actuator within the space in 
addition to the regular remote and local controls.
    (c) The space containing the cylinders shall be properly ventilated 
and designed to preclude an anticipated ambient temperature in excess of 
130 degrees F.
    (d) Cylinders shall be securely fastened and supported, and where 
necessary, protected against injury.
    (e) Cylinders shall be so mounted as to be readily accessible and 
capable of

[[Page 55]]

easy removal for recharging and inspection. Provisions shall be 
available for weighing the cylinders.
    (f) Where subject to moisture, cylinders shall be so installed as to 
provide a space of at least 2 inches between the flooring and the bottom 
of the cylinders.
    (g) Cylinders shall be mounted in an upright position or inclined 
not more than 30 degrees from the vertical. However, cylinders which are 
fitted with flexible or bent siphon tubes may be inclined not more than 
80 degrees from the vertical.
    (h) Where check valves are not fitted on each independent cylinder 
discharge, plugs or caps shall be provided for closing outlets when 
cylinders are removed for inspection or refilling.
    (i) All cylinders used for storing carbon dioxide must be

Sec. 97.15-20  Hatches and other openings.

    (a)(1) With the exception stated in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, it shall be the responsibility of the master to assure himself 
that all exposed cargo hatches and other openings in the hull of his 
vessel are closed, made properly watertight by the use of tarpaulins, 
gaskets or similar devices, and in all respects properly secured for sea 
before leaving protected waters.
    (2) A vessel engaged in a voyage exclusively on Great Lakes waters 
and having 6 feet or more of freeboard, measured vertically from the 
water's edge at the lowest point of sheer to the top of deck at the 
ship's side, may, at the master's discretion, omit tarpaulins on the 
ship's hatches from 16 May through 15 September (both dates inclusive). 
This exemption does not relieve the master of any responsibility for the 
securing and protection of his hatches during the interval of exemption 
and, in case of indications of bad

[[Page 71]]

weather or other threatening conditions, he shall not leave protected 
waters until the exposed cargo hatches and other openings in the hull of 
his vessel are properly covered, secured and protected.

closing devices and to which Sec. 45.01-20 of subchapter E (Load Lines) 
of this chapter applies need not comply with the requirements of this 
section as to exposed cargo hatches.
    (d) The master at his discretion may permit hatches or other 
openings to remain uncovered or open, or to be uncovered or opened for 
reasonable purposes such as ship's maintenance while the vessel is being 
navigated: Provided, That in his opinion existing conditions warrant 
such action.
    (e) In the event the master employs the discretionary provisions of 
this section after leaving port he shall cause appropriate entries to be 
made in the official log or equivalent thereof setting forth the time of 
uncovering, opening, closing or covering of the hatches or other 
openings to which this section applies and the circumstances warranting 
the action taken.
    (f) The discretionary provisions of this section shall not relieve 
the master of his responsibility for the safety of his vessel, her crew 
or cargo.


<R05>
Sec. 97.15-30  Emergency lighting and power systems.

<R05>
Sec. 107.401  Purpose and definition.

    (a) The International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, 
requires one or more of the certificates described in this subpart to be 
carried on self-propelled vessels of 500 gross tons or over engaged in 
international voyages. This subpart prescribes rules for the issuance of 
these certificates to mobile offshore drilling units.
    (b) ``International voyage'' has the same meaning as stated in 
Regulation

[[Page 117]]

2(d) of part A, chapter I in the International Convention for Safety of 
Life at Sea, 1974. (SOLAS 74), which is: ``a voyage from a country to 
which the present Convention applies to a port outside such country, or 
conversely. The Coast Guard has interpreted this definition to include 
the following:
    (1) A voyage from a country to which SOLAS 1974 applies, to a port 
outside that country or the reverse;
    (2) A voyage from any territory, including the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, all possesssions of the United States, and all lands held 
by the United States under a protectorate or mandate, whose 
international relations are the responsibility of a contracting SOLAS 74 
government, or which is administered by the United Nations, to a port 
outside that territory or the reverse;

The Coast Guard has interpreted this definition to not include a ``Great 
Lakes voyage'' which means a voyage solely on the Great Lakes of North 
America and the St. Lawrence River west of a straight line drawn from 
Capedes Rosiers to West Point, Anticosti Island and, on the north side 
of Anticosti Island, the 63rd Meridian.

least 500 gross tons on an international voyage from any of the 
requirements in the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea, 
1974 (SOLAS 74) if the unit meets the conditions of Regulation 4 of Part 
A, Chapter I, of SOLAS 74 which states the following:

    a. A ship which is not normally engaged on international voyages but 
which, in exceptional circumstances, is required to undertake a single 
international voyage may be exempted by the Administration from any of 
the requirements of the present Regulations provided that it complies 
with safety requirements which are adequate in the opinion of the 
Administration for the voyage which is to be undertaken by the ship.
    b. The Administration may exempt any ship which embodies features of 
a novel kind from any of the provisions of Chapters II-1, II-2, III and 
IV of these Regulations the application of which might seriously impede 
research into the development of such features and their incorporation 
in ships engaged on international voyages. Any such

[[Page 118]]

ship shall, however, comply with safety requirements which, in the 
opinion of that Administration, are adequate for the service for which 
it is intended and are such as to ensure the overall safety of the ship 
and which are acceptable to the Governments of the States to be visited 
by the ship. The Administration which allows any such exemption shall 
communicate to the Organization particulars of same and the reasons 
therefor which the Organization shall circulate to the Contracting 
Governments for their information.

    (c) The Commandant (G-MOC) may exempt a self-propelled unit of at 
least 500 gross tons on an international voyage from the requirements of 
Chapter III (Lifesaving Appliances, &C.) of SOLAS 74 if the unit meets 
the conditions of Regulation 2 of chapter III which states in part:

    The Administration may, if it considers that the sheltered nature 
and conditions of the voyage are such as to render the application of 
any specific requirements of this chapter unreasonable or unnecessary, 
exempt from those requirements individual ships or classes of ships 
which, in the course of their voyage, do not proceed more than 20 miles 
from the nearest land.

    (d) The Commandant (G-MOC) may exempt a unit from the requirements 
of Chapters II-1 (Construction--Subdivision and stability, machinery and 
electrical installations) or II-2 (Construction--Fire protection, fire 
detection and fire extinction) of SOLAS 74 if the unit meets the 
conditions of Regulation 1-4 of Part A Chapter II-1 or Regulation 1-4.1 
of Part A Chapter II-2, respectively, of SOLAS 74 which state the 
following: The Administration of a State may, if it considers that the 
sheltered nature and conditions of the voyage are such as to render the 
application of any specific requirements of this chapter unreasonable or 
unnecessary, exempt from those requirements individual ships or classes 
of ships entitled to fly the flag of the State which, in the course of 
their voyage, do not proceed more than 20 miles from the nearest land.
    (e) An Exemption Certificate is in force for the period of validity 
of the certificate to which it refers.

Appendix A to Part 109--Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular No. 4-
 78--Inspection and Certification of Existing Mobile Offshore Drilling 
                                  Units

    1. Purpose. To promulgate instructions for the inspection and 
certification of existing mobile offshore drilling units. This NVIC is 
also being published as appendix A of 46 CFR Subchapter IA.
    2. Background. Mobile Offshore Drilling Units are recognized 
internationally through the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative 
Organization as being a ``special purpose ship'' designed and operated 
to carry out an industrial function at sea. Contemporary U.S. Vessel 
regulations in Title 46 CFR do not adequately cover the safety 
considerations which are unique to the hull and structural designs, 
industrial equipment and operating procedures incorporated in drilling 
vessels. To provide appropriate and adequate standards, the Coast Guard 
with the assistance of the National Offshore Operations Advisory 
Committee, and following the provisions of the Administrative Procedures 
Act, developed Subchapter IA, Regulations for Mobile Offshore Drilling 
Units, 46 CFR Parts 107-109 and amendments to 46 CFR Subchapters ``F'', 
Marine Engineering Regulations, and ``J'', Electrical Engineering 
Regulations. These regulations, published in Federal Register (43 FR 
56788 December 4, 1978) will apply to all units contracted for on or 
after the effective date of the regulations.
    3. Discussion. a. This NVIC elaborates the ``grandfather 
provisions'' of 46 CFR 107.211 and 107.215 in applying Subchapter IA to 
the approximately 150 existing ocean-going U.S. flag mobile offshore 
drilling units. ``Existing'' Mobile Offshore Drilling Units are those 
vessels which have been contracted for before the effective date of the 
regulations including:
    (1) Units in Service.
    (2) Units under construction.
    (3) Units contracted for which are to be constructed and delivered 
prior to January 1, 1981.
    b. Existing uncertificated mobile drilling units of which there are 
approximately 92 of the bottom bearing configuration, i.e., jack-up and 
submersible types, have not previously been required to comply with 
vessel inspection regulations. Some units have met the load line 
requirements of Subchapter ``E'' for International Voyages. Many of the 
older units are not classed by a classification society. Bottom bearing 
units operating on the Outer Continental Shelf of United States have 
been required to meet the safety requirements of 33 CFR Subchapter ``N'' 
as artificial islands. On January 3, 1979, existing bottom bearing units 
are subject to the ``grandfather provisions'' in Sec. 107.211(c) of 
Subchapter IA.
    c. Existing certificated mobile offshore drilling units, for the 
purposes of this NVIC, are column-stabilized and ship-shape types of 
which approximately 58 are currently certificated, or have made 
application for an original Certificate of Inspection or intend to make 
application for an original inspection for certification under 46 CFR 
Subchapter ``I'' on the basis of the unit being contracted for prior to 
the effective date of the new regulations. These units may continue to 
meet the structural, equipment, material and arrangement standards which 
were applicable to the hull, engineering, electrical and industrial 
systems when the units were contracted for. In addition they must meet 
the provisions of d.(1), d.(4)(d), d.(7)(b), d.(8), d.(9), d.(10)(b), 
d.(11) and d.(12) of paragraph 3 of this NVC in accordance with 
Sec. 107.215(c)(2) of Subchapter IA.
    d. Inspection Provisions for Existing Uncertificated Units. The 
intent of the ``grandfather'' provisions of this NVIC for existing 
uncertificated units is to ascertain through inspection that the 
material condition of the unit and its equipment meet reasonable levels 
of safety. To this end, the following determinations will be made:
    <bullet> The design, construction and arrangements of the hull, 
machinery electrical and industrial systems do not reveal manifestly 
unsafe aspects.
    <bullet> There is no excessive deterioration of the hull structure 
or equipment foundations.
    <bullet> There are no intrinsic fire or explosion hazards.
    <bullet> There are no personnel hazards such as unguarded moving 
machinery, potential electrical shock conditions or lack of handrails.
    <bullet> The unit is seaworthy and exhibits satisfactory stability.
    (1) General. (a) Repairs and minor alterations to hull structure or 
equipment may be made to the same standards as the original 
installation. However, new installations or major alterations which 
affect vessel or personnel safety shall meet the applicable standards of 
Subchapter IA.
    (b) Existing items of safety equipment not meeting the applicable 
specifications or requirements set forth in Subchapter IA may be 
continued in service as long as they are maintained in good working 
order to the satisfaction of the OCMI. Such safety equipment and 
installations requiring extensive repairs shall be replaced and shall 
meet the

[[Page 177]]

applicable specifications and requirements of Subchapter IA.
    (c) The OCMI has discretion to accept alternatives or equivalents 
which meet the established standards, and to give special consideration 
to departures from the regulations when it can be shown that special 
circumstances warrant such departures.
    (2) Plan Submittal. (a) For units not classed by the American Bureau 
of Shipping or other recognized classification society, (see 46 CFR 
108.109) the OCMI must have sufficient plans and information submitted 
to him which will describe such things as the unit's size, construction, 
configuration, arrangement of tanks, decks and spaces; and the machinery 
and electrical installation. In addition, the OCMI may require submittal 
of any additional data he considers necessary in order to proceed with 
the original inspections.
    (b) For units classed by the American Bureau of Shipping or other 
recognized classification society, the plans and information described 
in Subchapter IA Sec. 107.305 (a), (b), (v), and (ii) and a general 
description of the machinery and electrical installation shall be 
submitted to the OCMI for information. The OCMI may accept continued 
classification as proof of structural, mechanical, and electrical 
sufficiency. However, the OCMI may require additional plans and 
information if necessary.
    (3) Hull Structure. (a) No structural changes will be required 
unless manifestly unsafe conditions exist.
    (b) Existing uncertificated units must be drydocked or have a 
special examination in lieu of drydocking as required by 46 CFR, 107-
261.
    (c) Achievement of one compartment subdivision is not required where 
extensive modification of the original design would be necessary; 
however, watertight integrity of the hull and structural boundaries must 
be maintained. Bulkheads and decks designed to be watertight must be 
maintained as such where they are penetrated by pipes, electrical cable, 
reach rods, ventilation systems, etc.
    (4) Stability. (a) The stability of each existing unit will be 
reviewed by the Coast Guard. The plans indicated in 46 CFR Subchapter IA 
Sec. 107.305(q) through (u-l) must be submitted to the cognizant OCMI or 
Merchant Marine Technical Office.
    (b) Lightship data from a Coast Guard witnessed and approved 
stability test is required for each existing, uncertificated unit. 
Alternatively other evidence of lightship values will be considered on a 
case by case basis.
    (c) In general, compliance with the intact stability standards of 46 
CFR Subchapter IA, Secs. 108.303 through 108.309 is required. Where 
existing units were designed to a lesser standard of stability than that 
specified in Secs. 108.303 through 108.309, some relaxation based on 
proven past performance may be granted at the discretion of the OCMI and 
limiting conditions, if any, set forth in the operating manual. In no 
case will the minimum wind speed for adequate stability be reduced below 
50 knots.
    (d) An operating manual shall be prepared for each unit. Each 
operating manual must contain the information indicated in 46 CFR 
Subchapter IA, Sec. 109.121(d) and be submitted to the cognizant OCMI or 
Merchant Marine Technical Office for review.
    (5) Load Line. (a) All units are required to obtain and maintain a 
valid Load Line Certificate. The structure and stability of the unit 
must be proven adequate for the voyages and areas of operation intended.
    (b) The American Bureau of Shipping or other recognized 
classification society will issue Load Line Certificates and conduct 
initial and annual load line surveys. Coast Guard and the American 
Bureau of Shipping inspections may be conducted simultaneously, but it 
is the owner's responsibility to arrange coordinated inspection 
schedules.
    (c) The structural review conducted by the American Bureau of 
Shipping or other recognized classification society for load line 
assignment may be accepted by the Coast Guard as proof of structural 
adequacy of the hull.
    (d) The stability review must be completed prior to issuance of a 
Load Line Certificate. The Coast Guard will inform the American Bureau 
of Shipping or other recognized classification society of the results of 
the stability review, and will indicate any stability limitations to be 
placed on the Load Line Certificate.
    (e) Freeboard calculations for self-elevating units with barge type 
hulls will be made in accordance with 46 CFR, Part 42. The bow height 
requirements of 46 CFR 42.20-70 may be relaxed to approximately 33% of 
the normal requirement for barge shapes moving at speeds less than 6 
knots. No relaxation of the addition to freeboard for deficiency in 
sheer is allowed. The freeboard for units other than self-elevating 
units with barge type hulls will be based upon compliance with the 
intact and damage stability standards applicable at the time the unit 
was contracted for.
    (f) All units delivered after the date of this NVIC regardless of 
contract date, must obtain a Load Line Certificate as soon as 
operationally feasible.
    (6) Route and Operating Area Limitations. (a) Units classed by the 
American Bureau of Shipping or other recognized classification society 
for ocean service generally will be certificated by the Coast Guard for 
ocean routes.
    (b) Unclassed units which have proven structural and stability 
adequacy by continued safe operation in a specific geographic area, such 
as the Gulf of Mexico, will be limited by the Certificate of Inspection 
and

[[Page 178]]

Load Line Certificate to that area. To qualify for an unlimited oceans 
route, such a unit must be reviewed for adequacy of the structure and 
stability by the Coast Guard and meet the Load Line requirements of d. 
(5) above.
    (c) Any unit which intends to move or operate outside the 
geographical area indicated on the Certificate of Inspection must 
receive prior approval from the OCMI.
    (7) Fire Protection. (a) Structural fire protection. All units must 
meet the provisions of Sec. 108.123, Insulation of Combustible Materials 
and Sec. 108.127, Storage Lockers for Combustibles. All existing 
interior stairways which are open at each end must be enclosed at one 
level. On units where wood was utilized in the construction of 
accommodation spaces, each space must be equipped with a smoke or heat 
detector either battery powered or operating on the AC power supply. All 
detectors must have the Underwriters Laboratories, Inc., label (UL) or 
the Factory Mutual Laboratories (FM) label.
    (b) Fire Extinguishing Systems. Systems and equipment must be 
provided which will meet or be equivalent to the applicable 
specifications and provisions required by Subchapter IA. Installed fire 
extinguishing systems, which provide equivalent or greater protection 
than systems required by Subpart E, Subchapter IA may be continued in 
use as long as they are in good material condition and will function as 
designed. Where practicable, existing washdown systems may be utilized 
as the firemain. Where wood was utilized in the construction of 
accommodation spaces, the applicable requirements of 46 CFR Subchapter 
IA, Table 108.495(a) should be doubled.
    (8) Lifesaving Equipment. (a) Each unit must have lifesaving 
equipment (lifeboats and davit launched liferafts) for 200 percent of 
the total persons allowed on board. Except for submersible type units, 
the installation of lifeboats for 100 percent of the persons (on board) 
is required in accordance with 46 CFR 108.503 of Subchapter IA. 
Consideration will be given to those units where existing arrangement 
and structure do not provide sufficient room for installation of the 
lifeboats or where the added weight of the lifeboats, davits and winches 
will materially reduce the variable load capacity of the unit. In such 
cases, davit launched inflatable liferafts with a combined personnel 
capacity of the required lifeboats, and a rescue boat approved by the 
OCMI may be acceptable equivalents. Submersible type units may 
substitute Coast Guard approved throw over type inflatable liferafts and 
an approved rescue boat for the required lifeboats.
    (b) For the second part of the total 200 percent primary lifesaving 
requirement, lifeboats installed in accordance with 33 CFR, Subchapter 
``N'' Part 144 or Coast Guard approved life floats may be retained as 
provided for in 3.d(1)(b) of this Circular. They will be considered 
collectively with the Coast Guard approved liferafts for calculating the 
amount of equipment to provide for 100 percent of personnel on board.
    (c) Adequate access to all lifesaving equipment must be provided.
    (9) Cranes. (a) Plan approval will not normally be required of any 
crane which conforms to the specifications of the manufacturer as 
originally installed. A rated load test as described in Sec. 107.260 of 
Subchapter IA will be required unless the crane has been load tested 
while under certification by an approved certifying authority as 
provided for in 46 CFR 107.258. Prior to the rated load test, the crane 
should be identified by manufacturer and model number to determine that 
the correct load rating chart is being used. The owner must submit to 
the OCMI details and calculations of any alterations to a crane which 
were accomplished without manufacturer's documentation in order to 
verify the rated load of the crane.
    (10) Electrical. (a) Multiple power sources do not require an 
emergency generator; however, storage batteries or approved relay-
controlled battery operated lanterns are required to be installed for 
the emergency lighting system and provide 12 hours of lighting.
    (b) Electrical equipment installed in Class I, division 1 and 2 
locations, as defined in Subchapter IA, Sec. 108.170 must be of a 
suitable type and in good material condition.
    (11) Unfired Pressure Vessels. (a) Unfired pressure vessels built 
and stamped in accordance with Section VIII of the ASME Code may be 
continued in service as long as they remain in satisfactory condition. 
At the original and subsequent inspections for certification, ASME Code 
pressure vessels must be tested and examined in accordance with the 
requirements in 46 CFR 61.10-5.
    (b) Unfired pressure vessels which cannot be identified as being 
constructed to any recognized standard may be continued in service 
provided that no obvious defects are noted. These pressure vessels shall 
be hydrostatically tested to one and one half times the working 
pressure. For pressure vessels that can not be reasonably 
hydrostatically tested, nondestructive testing may be used to verify the 
pressure vessels condition for continued serviceability. These pressure 
vessels will then be stamped with a Coast Guard identification number 
and periodically tested and examined in accordance with the requirements 
in 46 CFR 61.10-5.
    (12) Marine Sanitation Devices. (a) All units must meet the 
provisions of 33 CFR Part 159, Coast Guard Marine Sanitation Devices 
Regulations. The discharge requirements are compatible with the OCS 
Orders of the U.S. Geological Survey.

[[Page 179]]

    4. Action. a. The owner of each existing certificated unit must 
provide the cognizant OCMI a proposed plan to accomplish the 
requirements in paragraph 3. c. of this NVIC within 60 days from the 
effective date of the regulations. Most items should be approved at the 
unit's next inspection for certification; however, where major equipment 
installations are concerned, the owner may be allowed up to two years to 
comply with the requirements from the time the OCMI completes his 
assessment of the proposals.
    b. Application for Original Inspection for Certification. Not later 
than sixty days from January 3, 1979, application for original 
inspection for certification of all existing uncertificated units, shall 
be submitted to the appropriate OCMI. The plans or descriptive data 
specified in paragraph 3.d(2) of this NVIC along with a proposed plan to 
bring the unit into compliance should, if possible, be submitted with 
the application for inspection. If not feasible to assemble all required 
information in this time frame, an estimated date of submittal shall be 
indicated on the application. Arrangements should be made to commence 
the original inspection for certification with due consideration for the 
unit's operating situation.
    c. To the extent possible the same inspection team will conduct the 
inspection of all existing uncertificated units in a geographical area. 
It may be advantageous to conduct the original inspection in conjunction 
with an impending special or periodic survey, drydocking or availability 
period. Units under construction will receive primary consideration by 
the OCMI for the allocation of time and personnel so that any problems 
can be identified while the unit is in the most advantageous situation 
to apply corrections.
    d. The variety of designs and arrangements presented by existing 
uninspected MODU's makes it impractical to prescribe detailed standards 
for all existing units. The procedures followed to implement this NVC 
must provide the necessary flexibility. Items which must be taken into 
consideration in applying this NVIC are listed below. Categorizing units 
into groups to which the same items apply will be of value during the 
inspection process. These items are:
<bullet> Type
<bullet> Builder
<bullet> Model
<bullet> Date build
<bullet> Classed by ABS or other classification society
<bullet> Load Line assignment
<bullet> Operating history (including geographical areas)
<bullet> Present location

    e. Issuance of the Original Certificate of Inspection. The intent of 
the original inspection of existing uncertificated units is to identify 
and commence correction of any unsafe conditions and/or equipment 
deficiencies and to issue the unit an original Certificate of 
Inspection. A reasonable period of time will be permitted to correct 
minor deficiencies. Those items directly affecting personnel safety and 
health will require immediate attention to correct the unsafe condition. 
Extensive deficiencies, such as those involving structural aspects or 
equipment may require up to two years to remedy. Additional times may be 
allowed if repair facilities are not available to coastal areas adjacent 
to the unit's area of operation. Where manifestly unsafe conditions are 
found, the OCMI may require that the unit discontinue operations until 
such conditions are corrected. If the owner or operator feels aggrieved 
by the decision of the OCMI, the appeals procedures of 46 CFR 2.01-70 
are applicable.
    f. Questions concerning this NVIC should be referred to the 
Commandant (G-MOC).

    As used in this Subpart:
    (a) Ships's service loads mean electrical equipment for all 
auxiliary services necessary for maintaining the vessel in a normal, 
operational and habitable condition. Ship's service loads include, but 
are not limited to, all safety, lighting, ventilation, navigational, 
communications, habitability, and propulsion auxiliary loads. Electrical 
propulsion motor, bow thruster motor, cargo transfer, drilling, cargo 
refrigeration for other than Class 5.2 organic peroxides and Class 4.1 
self-reactive substances, and other industrial type loads are not 
included.
    (b) Drilling loads means all loads associated exclusively with the 
drilling operation including power to the drill table, mud system, and 
positioning equipment.

<R05>
Sec. 111.10-3  Two generating sources.

    In addition to the emergency power sources required under part 112 
of this chapter, each self-propelled vessel and each mobile offshore 
drilling unit must have at least two electric generating sources.

[CGD 94-108, 61 FR 28276, June 4, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 111.10-4  Power requirements, generating sources.

    (a) The aggregate capacity of the electric ship's service generating 
sources required in Sec. 111.10-3 must be sufficient for the ship's 
service loads.
    (b) With the ship's service generating source of the largest 
capacity stopped, the combined capacity of the remaining electric ship's 
service generating source or sources must be sufficient to supply those 
services necessary to provide normal operational conditions of 
propulsion and safety, and minimum comfortable conditions of 
habitability. Habitability services include cooking, heating, air 
conditioning (where installed), domestic refrigeration, mechanical 
ventilation, sanitation, and fresh water.

[[Page 217]]

    (c) The capacity of the ship's service generating sources must be 
sufficient for supplying the ship's service loads without the use of a 
generating source which is dependent upon the speed or direction of the 
main propelling engines or shafting.
    (d) Operating generators must provide a continuous and uninterrupted 
source of power for the ship's service load under normal operational 
conditions. Any vessel speed change or throttle movement must not cause 
a ship's service load power interruption.
    (e) Vessels with electric propulsion that have two or more constant-
voltage generators which supply both ship's service and propulsion power 
do not need additional ship's service generators provided that with any 
one propulsion/ship's service generator out of service the capacity of 
the remaining generator(s) is sufficient for the electrical loads 
necessary to provide normal operational conditions of propulsion and 
safety, and minimum comfortable conditions of habitability.
    (f) A generator driven by a main propulsion unit (such as a shaft 
generator) which is capable of providing electrical power continuously, 
regardless of the speed and direction of the propulsion shaft, may be 
considered one of the ship's service generating sets required by 
Sec. 111.10-3. A main-engine-dependent generator which is not capable of 
providing continuous electrical power may be utilized as a supplemental 
generator provided that a required ship's service generator or 
generators having sufficient capacity to supply the ship's service loads 
can be automatically brought on line prior to the main-engine-dependent 
generator tripping off-line due to a change in the speed or direction of 
the main propulsion unit.

the electrical services necessary to start the main propulsion plant 
from a dead ship condition.
    (b) If the emergency generator is used for part or all of the 
electric power necessary to start the main propulsion plant from a dead 
ship condition, the emergency generator must be capable of providing 
power to all emergency lighting, emergency internal communications 
systems, and fire detection and alarm systems in addition to the power 
utilized for starting the main propulsion plant. Additional requirements 
are in Sec. 112.05-3(c) of this chapter.

    If transformers are used to supply the ship's service distribution 
system required by this subpart for ships and mobile offshore drilling 
units, there must be at least two installed, independent power 
transformers. With the largest transformer out of service, the capacity 
of the remaining units must be sufficient to supply the ship service 
loads.

    Note to Sec. 111.10-9: A ship's service supply system would consist 
of transformers, overcurrent protection devices, and cables, and would 
normally be located in the system between a medium voltage bus and a low 
voltage ship's service switchboard.

Sec. 111.70-7  Remote control, interlock, and indicator circuits.

    (a) Overcurrent protection. A conductor of a control, interlock, or 
indicator circuit of a motor controller must be protected against 
overcurrent unless:
    (1) The conductor is wholly within the controller enclosure;
    (2) The rating or setting of the branch circuit overcurrent device 
is not more than 300 percent of the current-carrying capacity of the 
control, interlock, or indicator circuit conductor;
    (3) There is an overcurrent device in each side of the line that has 
a rating or setting of not more than 300 percent of the current-carrying 
capacity of the control, electrical interlock, or indicator circuit 
conductor, except if under operating conditions there is no appreciable 
difference in potential between the external conductors, overcurrent 
protection need only be at the supply of that side of the line; or
    (4) The opening of the control, interlock, or indicator circuit 
creates a hazard.
    Note: For overcurrent protection of steering gear control and 
indicator circuits, see Subpart 111.93 of this chapter.
    (b) Accidental ground. The controller must be designed to prevent an 
accidental ground in a remote control circuit from causing the stop 
switches to fail to operate or causing the motor to start.
    (c) Source of potential. The potential for a control, interlock, or 
indicator circuit must be derived from the load side of the motor and 
controller disconnect device, except if the control functions require 
circuits that must be common to two or more controllers, the switching 
arrangement in paragraph (d) of this section must be met.
    (d) Switching. In the design of a control, interlock, or indicator 
circuit, all practicable steps must be taken to eliminate all but one 
source of power in an enclosure. If the control functions make it 
impracticable to energize

[[Page 236]]

a control interlock or indicator circuit from the load side of a motor 
and controller disconnect device and the voltage of the control, 
interlock, or indicator circuit is more than 24 volts, there must be one 
of the following alternative methods of switching:
    (1) Each conductor of a control, interlock, or indicator circuit 
must be disconnected from all sources of potential by a disconnect 
device independent of the motor and controller disconnect device. The 
two independent devices must be adjacent to each other, and a fixed 
sign, warning the operator to open both devices to disconnect completely 
the motor and controller, must be on the exterior of the door of the 
main disconnect device.
    (2) Each conductor of a control, interlock, or indicator circuit 
must be disconnected from all sources of power by a disconnect device 
actuated by the opening of the controller door, or the power must first 
be disconnected to allow opening of the door. The disconnect device and 
its connections, including each terminal block for terminating the 
vessel's wiring, must have no electrically uninsulated or unshielded 
surface. When this type of disconnect device is used for vital auxiliary 
circuits, a nameplate must be affixed to the vital auxiliary motor 
controller door that warns that opening the door will trip a vital 
auxiliary off-line.

<R05>
Sec. 112.05-1  Purpose.

    (a) The purpose of this part is to ensure a dependable, independent, 
and dedicated emergency power source with sufficient capacity to supply 
those services that are necessary for the safety of the passengers, 
crew, and other persons in an emergency and those additional loads that 
may be authorized under paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) No load may be powered from an emergency power source, except:
    (1) A load required by this part to be powered from the emergency 
power source;
    (2) A bus-tie to the main switchboard that meets Sec. 112.05-3; and
    (3) Emergency loads that may be necessary to maintain or restore the 
propulsion plant, such as control systems, controllable pitch 
propellers, hydraulic pumps, control air compressors, and machinery 
necessary for dead-ship start-up.
    (c) Other loads may be authorized by the Commanding Officer, Marine 
Safety Center (MSC), to be connected to the emergency source of power to 
provide an increased level of safety in recognition of a unique vessel 
mission or configuration. When these loads are authorized, the emergency 
power source must--
    (1) Be sized to supply these loads using a unity (1.0) service 
factor; or
    (2) Be provided with automatic load shedding that removes these 
loads and operates before the emergency generator trips due to overload. 
The automatic load shedding circuit breakers must be manually reset.

<R05>
Sec. 112.05-3  Main-emergency bus-tie.

    Each bus-tie between a main switchboard and an emergency switchboard 
must:
    (a) Disconnect automatically upon loss of potential at the emergency 
switchboard;
    (b) Be arranged to prevent parallel operation of an emergency power 
source with any other source of electric power, except for interlock 
systems for momentary transfer of loads; and
    (c) If arranged for feedback operation, open automatically upon 
overload of the emergency power source before the emergency power source 
is tripped off the line from the overload.


<R05>
Sec. 112.05-5  Emergency power source.

    (a) The emergency power source must meet table 112.05-5(a) and have 
the capacity to supply all loads that are simultaneously connected to 
it, except a load on a bus-tie to the main switchboard or non-required 
loads that are connected in accordance with Sec. 112.05-1(c).

<R05>
Sec. 115.100  When required.

    (a) A vessel to which this subchapter applies may not be operated 
without having on board a valid U.S. Coast Guard Certificate of 
Inspection.
    (b) Except as noted in Sec. 115.114 of this part, each vessel 
inspected and certificated under the provisions of this subchapter must, 
when any passengers are aboard during the tenure of the certificate, be 
in full compliance with the terms of the certificate.
    (c) If necessary to prevent delay of the vessel, a temporary 
Certificate of Inspection may be issued pending the issuance and 
delivery of the regular Certificate of Inspection. The temporary 
certificate must be carried in the same manner as the regular 
certificate and is considered the same as the regular Certificate of 
Inspection which it represents.
    (d) A vessel on a foreign voyage between a port in the United States 
and a port in a foreign country, whose Certificate of Inspection expires 
during the voyage, may lawfully complete the voyage without a valid 
Certificate of Inspection provided the voyage is completed within 30 
days of expiration and the certificate did not expire within 15 days of 
sailing on the foreign voyage from a U.S. port.


<R05>
Sec. 115.103  Description.

    The Certificate of Inspection issued to a vessel describes the 
vessel, the route(s) that it may travel, the minimum manning 
requirements, the survival and rescue craft carried, the minimum fire 
extinguishing equipment and life jackets required to be carried, the 
maximum number of passengers and total persons that may be carried, the 
number of passengers the vessel may carry in overnight accommodation 
spaces, the name of the owner and managing operator, any equivalences 
accepted or authorized by the Commandant or any Officer in Charge,

<R05>
Sec. 115.110  Routes permitted.

    (a) The area of operation for each vessel and any necessary 
operational limits are determined by the cognizant OCMI, and recorded on 
the vessel's Certificate of Inspection. Each area of operation, referred 
to as a route, is described on the Certificate of Inspection under the 
major headings ``Oceans,'' ``Coastwise,'' ``Limited Coastwise,'' ``Great 
Lakes,'' ``Lakes, Bays, and Sounds,'' or ``Rivers,'' as applicable. 
Further limitations imposed or extensions granted are described by 
reference to bodies of waters, geographical points, distance from 
geographical points, distances from land, depths of channel, seasonal 
limitations, and similar factors.
    (b) Operation of a vessel on a route of lesser severity than those 
specifically described or designated on the Certificate of Inspection is 
permitted unless expressly prohibited on the certificate of Inspection. 
The general order of severity of routes is: oceans, coastwise, limited 
coastwise, Great Lakes, lakes, bays and sounds, and rivers. The 
cognizant OCMI may prohibit a vessel from operating on a route of lesser 
severity than the primary route a vessel is authorized to operate on if 
local conditions necessitate such a restriction.
    (c) Non-self-propelled vessels are prohibited from operating on an 
oceans, coastwise, limited coastwise, or Great Lakes route unless the 
Commandant approves such a route.
    (d) When designating a permitted route or imposing any operational 
limits on a vessel, the OCMI may consider:
    (1) Requirements of this subchapter for which compliance is based on 
the route of the vessel;
    (2) The performance capabilities of the vessel based on design, 
scantlings, stability, subdivision, propulsion, speed, operating modes, 
maneuverability, other characteristics; and
    (3) The suitability of the vessel for night-time operations and use 
in all weather conditions.


<R05>
Sec. 115.112  Total persons permitted.

    The cognizant OCMI determines the total number of persons permitted 
to be carried on a vessel. In determining the total number of persons 
permitted to be carried, the OCMI may consider stability restrictions 
and subdivision requirements of the vessel, the vessel's route, general 
arrangement, means of escape, lifesaving equipment, the minimum manning 
requirements, and the maximum number of passengers permitted in 
accordance with Sec. 115.113 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 115.113  Passengers permitted.

    (a) The maximum number of passengers permitted must be not more than 
that allowed by the requirements of this section, except as authorized 
by the OCMI under paragraph (d) of this section.
    (b) The maximum number of passengers permitted on any vessel may be 
the greatest number permitted by the length of rail criterion, deck area 
criterion, or fixed seating criterion described in this paragraph or a 
combination of these criteria as allowed by paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (1) Length of rail criterion. One passenger may be permitted for 
each 760

[[Page 304]]

millimeters (30 inches) of rail space available to the passengers at the 
periphery of each deck. The following rail space may not be used in 
determining the maximum number of passengers permitted:
    (i) Rail space in congested areas unsafe for passengers, such as 
near anchor handling equipment or line handling gear, in the way of sail 
booms, running rigging, or paddle wheels, or along pulpits;
    (ii) Rail space on stairways; and
    (iii) Rail space where persons standing in the space would block the 
line of vision of the licensed individual operating the vessel.
    (2) Deck area criterion. One passenger may be permitted for each 0.9 
square meters (10 square feet) of deck area available for the 
passengers' use. In computing such deck area, the areas occupied by the 
following must be excluded:
    (i) Areas for which the number of persons permitted is determined 
using the fixed seating criteria;
    (ii) Obstructions, including stairway and elevator enclosures, 
elevated stages, bars, and cashier stands, but not including slot 
machines, tables, or other room furnishings;
    (iii) Toilets and washrooms;
    (iv) Spaces occupied by and necessary for handling lifesaving 
equipment, anchor handling equipment or line handling gear, or in the 
way of sail booms or running rigging;
    (v) Spaces below deck that are unsuitable for passengers or that 
would not normally be used by passengers;
    (vi) Interior passageways less than 840 millimeters (34 inches) wide 
and passageways on open deck, less than 710 millimeters (28 inches) 
wide;
    (vii) Bow pulpits, swimming platforms and areas that do not have a 
solid deck, such as netting on multi-hull vessels;
    (viii) Deck areas in way of paddle wheels; and
    (ix) Aisle area provided in accordance with Sec. 116.820(d) of this 
chapter.
    (3) Fixed seating criterion. One passenger may be permitted for each 
455 millimeter (18 inches) of width of fixed seating provided by 
Sec. 116.820 of this chapter. Each sleeping berth in overnight 
accommodation spaces shall be counted as only one seat.
    (c) Different passenger capacity criteria may be used on each deck 
of a vessel and added together to determine the total passenger capacity 
of that vessel. Where seats are provided on part of a deck and not on 
another, the number of passengers permitted on a vessel may be the sum 
of the number permitted by the seating criterion for the space having 
seats and the number permitted by the deck area criterion for the space 
having no seats. The length of rail criterion may not be combined with 
either the deck area criterion or the fixed seating criterion when 
determining the maximum number of passengers permitted on an individual 
deck.
    (d) For a vessel operating on short runs on protected waters such as 
a ferry, the cognizant OCMI may give special consideration to increases 
in passenger allowances.


<R05>
Sec. 115.114  Alternative requirements for a vessel operating as other than a small passenger vessel.

    (a) When authorized by the cognizant OCMI by an endorsement of the 
vessel's Certificate of Inspection, a small passenger vessel carrying 
six or less passengers, or operating as a commercial fishing vessel or 
other uninspected vessel, or carrying less than twelve passengers and 
operating as a recreational vessel, need not meet requirements of:
    (1) Subparts C, D, and E, of part 117 of this chapter if the vessel 
is in satisfactory compliance with the lifesaving equipment regulations 
for an uninspected vessel or recreational vessel in similar service;
    (2) Subpart C of part 116 of this chapter and subchapter S of this 
chapter if the vessel is in satisfactory compliance with applicable

the satisfaction of the cognizant OCMI that the vessel is seaworthy for 
the intended service; and
    (3) Sections 121.404, 121.408, and 121.410 of this subchapter 
providing the vessel is in satisfactory compliance

[[Page 305]]

with any navigational equipment requirements for an uninspected or 
recreational vessel in a similar service.
    (b) A vessel operating under the alternative regulations of 
paragraph (a) of this section must:
    (1) Not alter the arrangement of the vessel nor remove any equipment 
required by the certificate for the intended operation, without the 
consent of the congnizant OCMI;
    (2) Comply with minimum manning specified on the Certificate of 
Inspection, which may include reduced manning depending on the number of 
passengers and operation of the vessel;
    (3) When carrying from one to six passengers except for a vessel 
being operated as a recreational vessel, make the announcement required 
by Sec. 122.506(a) of this subchapter before getting underway; and
    (4) If a vessel of more than 15 gross tons, not carry freight for 
hire.
    (c) The endorsement issued under paragraph (a) of this section must 
indicate the route, maximum number of passengers, and the manning 
required to operate under the provisions of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 115.120  Certificate of Inspection amendment.

    (a) An amended Certificate of Inspection may be issued at any time 
by any OCMI. The amended Certificate of Inspection replaces the 
original, but the expiration date remains the same as that of the 
original. An amended Certificate of Inspection may be issued to 
authorize and record a change in the dimensions, gross tonnage, owner, 
managing operator, manning, persons permitted, route permitted, 
conditions of operations, or equipment of a vessel, from that specified 
in the current Certificate of Inspection.
    (b) A request for an amended Certificate of Inspection must be made

<R05>
Sec. 115.202  Permit to proceed.

    (a) When a vessel is not in compliance with its Certificate of 
Inspection or fails to comply with a regulation of this subchapter, the 
cognizant OCMI may permit the vessel to proceed to another port for 
repair if, in the judgment of the OCMI, the trip can be completed 
safely, even if the Certificate of Inspection of the vessel has expired 
or is about to expire.
    (b) Form CG-948, ``Permit to Proceed to another Port for Repairs,'' 
may be issued by the cognizant OCMI to the owner, managing operator, or 
the master of the vessel stating the conditions under which the vessel 
may proceed to another port. The permit may be issued only upon the 
written application of the owner, managing operator, or master, and 
after the vessel's Certificate of Inspection is turned over to the OCMI.
    (c) A vessel may not carry passengers when operating in accordance 
with a permit to proceed, unless the cognizant OCMI determines that it 
is safe to do so.


<R05>
Sec. 115.204  Permit to carry excursion party.

    (a) The cognizant OCMI may permit a vessel to engage in a temporary 
excursion operation with a greater number of persons or on a more 
extended route, or both, than permitted by its Certificate of Inspection 
when, in the opinion of the OCMI, the operation can be undertaken 
safely.
    (b) Upon the written application of the owner or managing operator 
of the vessel, the cognizant OCMI may issue a Form CG-949, ``Permit to 
Carry Excursion Party.'' to indicate his or her permission to carry an 
excursion party. The OCMI will indicate on the permit the conditions 
under which it is issued, the number of persons the vessel may carry, 
the crew required, any additional lifesaving or safety equipment 
required, the route for which the permit is granted, and the dates on 
which the permit is valid.
    (c) The number of passengers normally permitted on an excursion 
vessel is governed by Sec. 115.113 of this part.

[[Page 306]]

    (d) The OCMI will not normally waive applicable minimum safety 
standards when issuing an excursion permit. In particular, a vessel that 
is being issued an excursion permit will normally be required to meet 
the minimum stability, survival craft, life jacket, fire safety, and 
manning standards applicable to a vessel in the service for which the 
excursion permit is requested
    (e) The permit acts as a temporary, limited duration supplement to 
the vessel's Certificate of Inspection and must be carried with the 
Certificate of Inspection. A vessel operating under a permit to carry an 
excursion party must be in full compliance with the terms of its 
Certificate of Inspection as supplemented by the permit.

for 1 hour. In addition, they must be so insulated with approved 
structural insulation, bulkhead panels, or deck covering so that, if 
subjected to the standard fire test for the applicable time period 
listed below, the average temperature on the unexposed side does not 
rise more than 139 deg. C (250 deg. F) above the original temperature, 
nor does the temperature at any one point, including any joint, rise 
more than 181 deg. C (325 deg. F) above the original temperature:

A-60 Class...............................  60 minutes
A-30 Class...............................  30 minutes
A-15 Class...............................  15 minutes
A-0 Class................................  0 minutes
 

    (ii) Penetrations in A-Class fire control boundaries for electrical 
cables, pipes, trunks, ducts, etc. must be constructed to prevent the 
passage of flame and smoke for one hour. In addition, the penetration 
must be designed or insulated so that it will withstand the same 
temperature rise limits as the boundary penetrated.

fire test, they are capable of preventing the passage of flame for 30 
minutes. In addition, their insulation

[[Page 321]]

value must be such that, if subjected to the standard fire test for the 
applicable time period listed below, the average temperature of the 
unexposed side does not rise more than 139 deg. C (250 deg. F) above the 
original temperature, nor does the temperature at any one point, 
including any joint, rise more than 225 deg. C (405 deg. F) above the 
original temperature:

B-15 Class...............................  15 minutes
B-0 Class................................  0 minutes
 

    (iv) Penetrations in B-Class fire control boundaries for electrical 
cables, pipes, trunks, ducts, etc. must be constructed to prevent the 
passage of flame for 30 minutes. In addition, the penetration must be 
designed or insulated so that it will withstand the same temperature 
rise limits as the boundary penetrated.
    (v) C-Class bulkheads and decks must be composed of noncombustible 
materials.
    (vi) C'-Class bulkheads and decks must be constructed of 
noncombustible materials and made intact with the main structure of the

    (2) Any interruption or change of direction in a stairway must be 
accomplished by means of an intermediate landing of a width and length 
at least equal to the tread width of the stairway.
    (j) A stairway or stairtower must not have an angle of inclination 
from the horizontal of more than 40 degrees. However, stairways 
accessing spaces visited solely by crew members must not have an angle 
of inclination from the horizontal of more than 50 degrees. The 
Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center may approve higher angles of 
inclination for spaces with severe space constraints.
    (k) Where a continuous vertical deck penetration for a stairway or 
elevator exceeds one deck, the integrity of all decks must be assured by 
enclosure bulkheads and decks meeting the requirements of 
Secs. 116.415(b) and 116.415(c) of this part. Doors meeting the 
requirements of Secs. 116.435(b) and 116.435(c) of this part must be 
fitted in the enclosure at each deck serviced.

[[Page 328]]

    (l) Where a vertical deck penetration for a stairway or elevator 
involves only one deck, the integrity of the deck must be assured as 
required by paragraph (j) of this section. Alternatively the integrity 
of the deck may be maintained at one level only by means of bulkheads of 
the same fire control boundary rating as the deck penetrated. A door 
meeting the requirements of Secs. 116.435(b) and 116.435(c) of this part 
must be fitted in the enclosure. In spaces containing a balcony, the 
integrity of the balcony deck in the way of stairways or elevators need 
not be assured. However, such stairways must not be considered to be a 
means of escape.
    (m) Arrangements. (1) Each main vertical zone with more than two 
deck levels, each having enclosed or partially enclosed accommodation 
spaces, other than washroom or toilet spaces and open decks, must be 
served by at least one stairtower, so that a person may escape from any 
accommodation space or any other space where persons may be normally 
quartered or employed, to all other decks having any such spaces within 
the same main vertical zone, without coming out of the stairtower 
enclosure. Where a stairtower is accessible from two main vertical 
zones, it may be considered as the required stairtower for both main 
vertical zones provided all boundaries of the stairtower meet main 
vertical zone boundary requirements contained in Sec. 116.415 of this 
part.
    (2) Each stairtower must give access to an embarkation station or an 
area of refuge identified in the emergency escape plan required by 
Sec. 116.520.
    (3) Stairtowers must not give direct access to overnight 
accommodations or spaces of type 9, 10, 11, or 12.
    (4) A stairtower is not required to extend below deck to serve 
spaces in which a fire is likely to originate if one of the means of 
escape is:
    (i) A stairway that leads directly to a weather deck; or
    (ii) A stairway leading to a stairtower enclosure that includes self 
closing fire doors at both the top and bottom; or
    (iii) An alternative stairtower arrangement providing an equivalent 
level of safety is acceptable to the Commanding Officer, Marine Safety 
Center.
    (5) The Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center may accept other 
means of escape in combination with a stairtower provided the exits open 
directly to weather or through a main vertical zone bulkhead.
    (6) For vessels in which a stairtower is not required, a stairway 
must provide a means of escape for each deck of the main vertical zone.
    (n) The minimum tread width of a stairway or stairtower must be 8.4 
millimeters (0.333 inches) for each person served, but must not be less 
than 910 millimeters (36 inches). However, in stairways accessing spaces 
utilized solely by crew members, the minimum tread width must be 8.4 
millimeters (0.333 inches) for each person served, but not less than 710 
millimeters (28 inches).
    (1) The minimum tread width of a stairway or stairtower must be 
determined for each deck considering only those persons on that deck, 
except as provided in paragraph (n)(3) of this section. Once a minimum 
tread width has been established at any deck, it must not be decreased 
in the direction of escape.
    (2) In determining the number of persons served, a space must be 
considered to contain at least the number of persons as follows:
    (i) Passenger overnight accommodation spaces: Designed capacity;
    (ii) Accommodation spaces having fixed seating for passengers: 
Maximum seating capacity;
    (iii) Public spaces, including spaces such as casinos, restaurants, 
club rooms, and cinemas, and public accommodation spaces as defined in 
Sec. 114.400 of this subchapter, except overnight accommodation spaces: 
One person for each 0.9 square meters (10 square feet) of deck area. In 
computing such deck area, the following areas must be excluded:
    (A) Areas for which the number of persons permitted is determined 
using the fixed seating criterion;
    (B) Obstructions, including stairway and elevator enclosures, 
elevated stages, bars, and cashier stands, but not including slot 
machines, tables, or other room furnishings;

[[Page 329]]

    (C) Toilets and washrooms;
    (D) Interior passageways less than 850 millimeters (34 inches) wide 
and passageways on open deck less than 710 millimeters (28 inches) wide;
    (E) Spaces necessary for handling lifesaving equipment, anchor 
handling equipment, or line handling gear, or in way of sail booms or 
running rigging; and
    (F) Bow pulpits, swimming platforms, and areas that do not have a 
solid deck, such as netting on multi hull vessels;
    (iv) Crew overnight accommodation spaces: Two-thirds designed 
capacity; and
    (v) Work spaces: Occupancy under normal operating conditions.
    (3) If a stairway forms part of a normal embarkation or debarkation 
route, or egress route to an area of refuge, the number of persons using 
the stairway for that purpose must be used in determining the minimum 
tread width. The Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center, may approve a 
narrower stairway width if a narrower stairway will not unreasonably 
impede the flow of persons out of the space requiring egress or from an 
area of refuge to an embarkation station. Specific consideration can be 
given by the Marine Safety Center to the arrangement of landing area in 
excess of that required by paragraph (i) of this section when 
considering the approval of a narrower stairway width. However, the 
stairway width must be at least 910 millimeters (36 inches) unless the 
stairway is utilized solely by crew members, in which case the minimum 
tread width must be at least 710 millimeters (28 inches).
    (4) If more than one stairtower serves a main vertical zone, the 
number of persons in that main vertical zone may be distributed among 
the stairtowers.

requirements of this section.
    (b) Each level of a space containing a balcony must have two 
independent means of escape that meet the requirements of Sec. 116.500 
of this part.
    (c) For the purpose of main vertical zone bulkhead spacing 
requirements, the length of the space to which the balcony opens is 
considered to be increased by an amount equal to the gross area of the 
balcony divided by the average width of the space. If this equivalent 
main vertical zone length exceeds 40 meters (131 feet), the space must 
meet the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section. The actual 
length of the space may not exceed 40 meters (131 feet).
    (d) If the equivalent main vertical zone length under paragraph (c) 
of this section exceeds 40 meters (131 feet), both decks connected by 
the balcony must be protected with an automatic sprinkler system meeting 
NFPA 13.
    (e) If the unobstructed balcony opening area is less than 93 square 
meters (1,000 square feet), the opening must be protected in accordance 
with NFPA 13 or other standard specified by the Commandant. The 
horizontal projection area of stairs, escalators, statues, or other 
obstructions must be subtracted from the total balcony opening area for 
purposes of computation of unobstructed balcony opening area.

of atrium opening area.

[[Page 330]]

    (b) The entire main vertical zone containing an atrium must be 
protected throughout with a smoke detection system of an approved type 
which is installed in accordance with Sec. 76.33 in subchapter H of this 
chapter. However, on vessels with no overnight passenger accommodations, 
smoke detectors may be omitted from the accommodation space containing 
the atrium.
    (c) The entire main vertical zone containing an atrium must be 
protected with an automatic sprinkler system meeting NFPA 13.
    (d) The atrium must be provided with a smoke extraction system that 
complies with either:
    (1) The smoke extraction system must be capable of exhausting the 
entire volume of the space within 10 minutes. The smoke extraction 
system must be capable of being activated by both the smoke detection 
system and by manual control, and designed with sufficient plenum air 
openings to prevent excessive negative air pressure in the atrium; or,
    (2) The smoke extraction system may be designed in accordance with 
the principles of NFPA 92B ``Smoke Management Systems in Malls, Atria,

an open position.
    (n) Footholds, handholds, ladders, and similar means provided to aid 
escape, must be suitable for use in emergency conditions, of rigid 
construction, and permanently fixed in position, unless they can be 
folded, yet brought into immediate service in an emergency.
    (o) On a vessel of not more than 19.8 meters (65 feet) in length, a 
window or windshield of sufficient size and proper accessibility may be 
used as one of the required means of escape from an enclosed space, 
provided it:
    (1) Does not lead directly overboard;
    (2) Can be opened or is designed to be kicked or pushed out; and
    (3) Is suitably marked.
    (p) Only one means of escape is required from a space where:
    (1) The space has a deck area less than 30 square meters (322 square 
feet);
    (2) There is no stove, heater, or other source of fire in the space;
    (3) The means of escape is located as far as possible from a

paragraph.
    (1) Piping, valves, and fittings must have a bursting pressure of 
not less than 41,360 kPa (6,000 psi). Piping, in nominal sizes of not 
more than 19 millimeters (0.75 inches), must be at least Schedule 40 
(standard weight), and in nominal sizes of over 19 millimeter (0.75 
inches), must be at least Schedule 80 (extra heavy).
    (2) A pressure relief valve or equivalent set to relieve at between 
16,550 and 19,300 kPa (2,400 and 2,800 psi) must be installed in the 
distribution manifold to protect the piping from overpressurization.
    (3) Nozzles must be approved by the Commandant.
    (4) When installed in a machinery space, paint locker, a space 
containing flammable liquid stores, or a space with a fuel tank, a fixed

system must be capable of providing to a space must not be less than the 
gross volume of the space divided by the appropriate factor given in 
Table 118.410(f)(4)(i). If fuel can drain from a space being protected 
to an adjacent space or if the spaces are not entirely separate, the 
volume of both spaces must be used to determine the quantity of carbon 
dioxide required. The carbon dioxide must be arranged to discharge into 
both such spaces simultaneously.

    (iii) Distribution piping within a space must be proportioned from 
the distribution line to give proper supply to the outlets without 
throttling.
    (iv) The number, type, and location of discharge outlets must 
provide uniform distribution of carbon dioxide throughout a space.
    (v) The total area of all discharge outlets must not exceed 85 
percent nor be less than 35 percent of the nominal cylinder outlet area 
or the area of the supply pipe, whichever is smaller. The

[[Page 353]]

nominal cylinder outlet area in square millimeters (inches) is 
determined by multiplying the factor 0.015 (0.0022 if using square 
inches) by the total capacity in kilograms (pounds) of all carbon 
dioxide cylinders in the system, except in no case must the outlet area 
be of less than 71 square millimeters (0.110 square inches).
    (vi) The discharge of at least 85 percent of the required amount of 
carbon dioxide must be completed within two minutes.
    (5) When installed in an enclosed ventilation system for rotating 
electrical propulsion equipment a fixed carbon dioxide system must meet 
the following requirements.
    (i) The quantity of carbon dioxide in kilograms (pounds) must be 
sufficient for initial and delayed discharges as required by this 
paragraph. The initial discharge must be equal to the gross volume of 
the system divided by 160 (10 if using pounds) for ventilation systems 
having a volume of less than 57 cubic meters (2,000 cubic feet), or 
divided by 192 (12 if using pounds) for ventilation systems having a 
volume of at least 57 cubic meters (2,000 cubic feet). In addition, 
there must be sufficient carbon dioxide available to permit delayed 
discharges to maintain at least a 25 percent concentration until the 
equipment can be stopped. If the initial discharge achieves this 
concentration, a delayed discharge is not required.
    (ii) The piping sizes for the initial discharge must be in 
accordance with Table 118.410(f)(4)(ii) and the discharge of the 
required amount must be completed within two minutes.
    (iii) Piping for the delayed discharge must not be less than 12.7 
millimeters (0.5 inches) nominal pipe size, and need not meet specific 
requirement for discharge rate.
    (iv) Piping for the delayed discharge may be incorporated with the 
initial discharge piping.
    (6) When installed in a cargo space a fixed carbon dioxide system 
must meet the following requirements.
    (i) The number of kilograms (pounds) of carbon dioxide required for 
each space in cubic meters (feet) must be equal to the gross volume of 
the space in cubic meters (feet) divided by 480 (30 if using pounds).
    (ii) System piping must be of at least 19 millimeters (0.75 inches).
    (iii) No specific discharge rate is required.
    (g) Specific requirements for Halon 1301 systems. (1) A custom 
engineered fixed gas fire extinguishing system that uses Halon 1301, 
must comply with the applicable sections of UL 1058 ``Halogenated Agent 
Extinguishing System Units,'' and the requirements of this paragraph.
    (2) The Halon 1301 quantity and discharge requirements of UL 1058 
apply, with the exception that the Halon 1301 design concentration must 
be 6 percent at the lowest ambient temperature expected in the space. If 
the lowest temperature is not known, a temperature of -18 deg. C (0 deg. 
F) must be assumed.
    (3) Each storage cylinder in a system must have the same pressure 
and volume.
    (4) Computer programs used in designing systems must be approved by 
an independent laboratory recognized by the Commandant.

    Note to Sec. 118.410(g):
    As of Jan. 1, 1994, the United States banned the production of 
Halon. The Environmental Protection Agency placed significant 
restrictions on the servicing and maintenance of systems containing 
Halon. Vessels operating on an international voyage, subject to SOLAS 
requirements, are prohibited from installing fixed gas fire 
extinguishing systems containing Halon.

high as the opening of the fill pipe and they must be kept closed at all 
times except during sounding.
    (d) Fill pipes and sounding pipes must be so arranged that overflow 
of liquid or vapor cannot escape to the inside of the vessel.
    (e) Fill pipes and sounding pipes must run as directly as possible, 
preferably in a straight line, from the deck connection to the top of 
the tank. Such pipes must terminate on the weather deck and must be 
fitted with shutoff valves, watertight deck plates, or screw caps, 
suitably marked for identification. Diesel fill pipes and sounding pipes 
may terminate at the top of the tank.
    (f) Where a flexible fill pipe section is necessary, suitable 
flexible tubing or hose having high resistance to salt water, petroleum 
oils, heat and vibration, may be used. Such hose must overlap metallic 
pipe ends at least 1.5 times the pipe diameter and must be secured at 
each end by clamps. The flexible section must be accessible and as near 
the upper end of the fill pipe as practicable. When the flexible section 
is a nonconductor of electricity, the metallic sections of the fill pipe 
separated thereby must be joined by a conductor for protection against 
generation of a static charge when filling with fuel.

Sec. 125.100  Applicability.

    (a) Except as provided by paragraph (c) of this section, this 
subchapter applies to each offshore supply vessel (OSV) of United States 
flag contracted for, or the keel of which was laid, on or after March 
15, 1996.
    (b) Each OSV contracted for, or the keel of which was laid, before 
March 15, 1996, must be constructed and inspected to comply with--
    (1) The regulations in effect until March 15, 1996 (46
    CFR subchapter I or subchapter T, as appropriate), as they existed 
at the time of construction; or
    (2) The regulations in this subchapter.
    (c) Each OSV permitted grandfathering under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section must complete construction and have a Certificate of Inspection 
by March 16, 1998.

noted.


<R05>
Sec. 126.510  Annual and periodic inspections.

    (a) Annual inspection. Your vessel must undergo an annual inspection 
within 3 months before or after each anniversary date, except as 
required in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (1) You must contact the cognizant OCMI to schedule an inspection at 
a time and place which he or she approves. No written application is 
required.
    (2) The scope of the annual inspection is the same as the inspection 
for certification as specified in Sec. 126.430, but in less detail 
unless the cognizant marine inspector finds deficiencies or determines 
that a major change has occurred since the last inspection. If 
deficiencies are found or a major change to the vessel has occurred, the 
marine inspector will conduct an inspection more detailed in scope to 
ensure that the vessel is in satisfactory condition and fit for the 
service for which it is intended. If your vessel passes the annual 
inspection, the marine inspector will endorse your current Certificate 
of Inspection.
    (3) If the annual inspection reveals deficiencies in your vessel's 
maintenance, you must make any or all repairs or improvements within the 
time period specified by the OCMI.
    (4) Nothing in this subpart limits the marine inspector from making 
such tests or inspections he or she deems necessary to be assured of the 
vessel's seaworthiness.
    (b) Periodic inspection. Your vessel must undergo a periodic 
inspection within 3 months before or after the second or third 
anniversary of the date of your vessel's Certificate of Inspection. This 
periodic inspection will take the place of an annual inspection.
    (1) You must contact the cognizant OCMI to schedule an inspection at 
a time and place which he or she approves. No written application is 
required.
    (2) The scope of the periodic inspection is the same as that for the 
inspection for certification, as specified in Sec. 126.430. The OCMI 
will insure that the

[[Page 422]]

vessel is in satisfactory condition and fit for the service for which it 
is intended. If your vessel passes the periodic inspection, the marine 
inspector will endorse your current Certificate of Inspection.
    (3) If the periodic inspection reveals deficiencies in your vessel's 
maintenance, you must make any or all repairs or improvements within the 
time period specified by the OCMI.
    (4) Nothing in this subpart limits the marine inspector from 
conducting such tests or inspections he or she deems necessary to be 
assured of the vessel's seaworthiness.

tons may request authorization to conduct an alternative annual 
inspection in place of the annual inspection described in 
Sec. 126.510(a) of this subpart. The request must go to the cognizant 
OCMI assigned responsibility for inspections in the country in which the 
vessel is operating and will be examined. To qualify for the alternative 
annual examination, the vessel must meet the following requirements:
    (1) The request must be in writing and be received by the OCMI not 
later than the anniversary date.
    (2) The vessel is likely to be continuously employed outside of the 
United States during the 3 months before and after each anniversary 
date.
    (b) In determining whether to authorize the alternative annual 
inspection, the OCMI considers the following:
    (1) Information contained in previous examination reports on 
inspection and drydock, including the recommendation of the then 
cognizant OCMI for participation in the alternative midperiod program 
and alternative annual examination.

alternative annual inspection, is as follows:

    I certify that to the best of my knowledge and belief the 
information contained in the report is complete and accurate.

    (f) Deficiencies and hazards discovered during the alternative 
annual inspection conducted pursuant to this section must be corrected 
or eliminated, if practical, before the examination report is submitted 
to the OCMI in accordance with paragraph (d)(5) of this section. 
Deficiencies and hazards that are not corrected or eliminated by the 
time the examination report is submitted must be listed in the report as 
``outstanding.'' Upon receipt of an examination report indicating 
outstanding deficiencies or hazards, the OCMI must inform the owner or 
operator in writing of the time period within which to correct or 
eliminate the deficiencies or hazards and the method for establishing 
that the corrections have been accomplished. Where a deficiency or 
hazard remains uncorrected or uneliminated after the expiration of the 
time specified for correction or elimination, the Officer in Charge, 
Marine Inspection must initiate appropriate enforcement measures.
    (g) Upon receipt of the report, the OCMI will evaluate it and 
determine the following:
    (1) Whether the cognizant OCMI accepts the alternative annual 
inspection instead of the annual inspection required by Sec. 126.510(a) 
of this subpart.
    (2) Whether the vessel is in satisfactory condition.

         Subpart B--Portable and Semiportable Fire Extinguishers


<R05>
Sec. 132.210  Classification.

    (a) Each portable fire extinguisher and semiportable fire 
extinguisher is classified by a symbol combining letter and number. The 
letter indicates the type of fire that the unit should extinguish; the 
number indicates the relative size of the unit.
    (b) The types of fire are the following:
    (1) ``A''--fires in ordinary combustible materials, where the 
quenching and cooling effect of quantities of either water or solutions 
containing large percentages of water is essential.
    (2) ``B''--fires in flammable liquids, greases, and the like, where 
the blanketing effect of a smothering-agent is essential.
    (3) ``C''--fires in electrical equipment, where the use of 
nonconducting extinguishing-agent is essential.
    (c) The sizes of units run from ``I'' for the smallest to ``V'' for 
the largest. Sizes I and II are portable fire extinguishers; sizes III, 
IV, and V, which exceed 25 kilograms (55 pounds) in gross weight, are 
semiportable fire extinguishers and must be fitted with suitable hose 
and nozzle or other practicable means to cover any part of the space 
involved. Typical portable and semiportable fire extinguishers are set 
forth by Table 132.210 of this section.

                                                                      Table 132.210

Sec. 134.130  New construction.

    Each applicant for an original Certificate of Inspection and for 
approval of plans must submit, as well as three copies of those required 
by Sec. 127.110 of this subchapter, three copies of the following plans:
    (a) Operating Manual for Liftboats.
    (b) Legs, details of supporting structure, and structural 
calculations.


<R05>
Sec. 134.140  Structural standards.

    (a) Except as provided by paragraph (b) of this section, each 
liftboat must comply with the ABS's ``Rules for Building and Classing 
Mobile Offshore Drilling Units'', assuming a steady wind speed of 100 
knots for liftboats in unrestricted service, and 70 knots for liftboats 
in restricted service under normal operating conditions and 100 knots 
under severe storm conditions, as follows:
    (1) The main hull structure, legs, and supporting structure must 
comply with Section 3/4.3 of the Rules.
    (2) The calculations required by Section 3/4.3 of the Rules must 
assume the vessel to be in the most adverse loading conditions described 
by Sections 3/2.1 and 3/4.1 of the Rules.
    (3) Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Commandant (G-MSE), the 
calculations on column-buckling required by Section 3/4.3 of the Rules, 
must employ an effective-length factor, ``K'', of not less than 2.0.
    (4) The calculations on single-rack jacking systems required by 
Sections 3/2.1 and 3/4.1 of the Rules must include an extra bending 
moment caused by the most adverse eccentric loading of the legs.
    (b) Standards of classification societies other than the ABS, and 
other established standards acceptable to the Commandant (G-MSE), may be 
used.
    (c) Upon submittal of the plans required by Secs. 127.110 and 
133.130 of this subchapter, the standard used in the design must be 
specified.
    (d) If no established standard is used in the design, etailed design 
calculations must be submitted with the plans required by Secs. 127.110 
and 133.130 of this subchapter.


<R05>
Sec. 134.150  Liftboat-jacking systems.

    (a) For this subchapter, liftboat jacking systems are vital systems 
and must comply with Sections 4/1.13.1 through 4/1.13.3 of the ABS's 
``Rules for Building and Classing Mobile Offshore Drilling Units'' as 
well as meet the applicable requirements of part 128 of this subchapter.
    (b) Each control system for a liftboat jacking system must be 
designed so that loss of power, loss of pressure in the hydraulic 
system, or low hydraulic-fluid level will activate a visible and audible 
alarm at the operating station and will not result in the liftboat's 
uncontrolled descent.


<R05>
Sec. 134.160  Freeboard markings.

    Freeboard markings required by Sec. 174.260 of this subchapter must 
be both permanently scribed or embossed and painted white or yellow on a 
dark background.

to do when heavy weather is forecast, including when critical decisions 
or acts--such as leaving the area and heading for a harbor of safe 
refuge, or evacuating the vessel--should be accomplished.
    (7) Guidance on operating the vessel while changing mode and while 
preparing the vessel to make a move, and information on how to avoid 
structural damage from shifting loads during heavy weather.
    (8) Information on inherent operational limitations for each mode 
and on changing modes, including preloading instructions.
