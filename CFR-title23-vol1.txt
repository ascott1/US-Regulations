                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, April 1, 2011), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
April 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in eleven separate 
volumes. For the period beginning April 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY

    The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of 
Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a 
``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used 
editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and 
not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as 
an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that 
issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after 
contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please 
notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, 
or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities 
and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an 
alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in 
this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.

[[Page vii]]

    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

use or reservation is in the public interest and will not impair the 
highway or interfere with the free and safe flow of traffic thereon.


<R05>
Sec. 1.27  Maintenance.

    The responsibility imposed upon the State highway department, 
pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 116, for the maintenance of projects shall be 
carried out in accordance with policies and procedures issued by the 
Administrator. The State highway department may provide for such 
maintenance by formal agreement with any adequately equipped county, 
municipality or other governmental instrumentality, but such an 
agreement shall not relieve the State highway department of its 
responsibility for such maintenance.


<R05>
Sec. 1.28  Diversion of highway revenues.

    (a) Reduction in apportionment. If the Secretary shall find that any 
State has diverted funds contrary to 23 U.S.C. 126, he shall take such 
action as he may deem necessary to comply with said provision of law by 
reducing the first Federal-aid apportionment of primary, secondary and 
urban funds made to the State after the date of such finding. In any 
such reduction, each of these funds shall be reduced in the same 
proportion.
    (b) Furnishing of information. The Administrator may require any 
State to submit to him such information as he may deem necessary to 
assist the Secretary in carrying out the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 126 and

<R05>
Sec. 140.602  Requirements and conditions.

    (a) An SHA that uses the proceeds of bonds issued by the State, a 
county, city or other political subdivision of the State, for the 
construction of projects on the Federal-aid primary or Interstate 
system, or extensions of any of the Federal-aid highway systems in urban 
areas, or for substitute highway projects approved under 23 U.S.C. 
103(e)(4), may claim payment of any portion of such sums apportioned to 
it for expenditures on such system to aid in the retirement of the 
principal of bonds at their maturities, to the extent that the proceeds 
of bonds have actually been expended in the construction of projects.
    (b) Any interest earned and payable on bonds, the proceeds of which 
were expended on Interstate projects after November 6, 1978, is an 
eligible cost of construction. The amount of interest eligible for 
participation will be based on (1) the date the proceeds were expended 
on the project, (2) amount expended, and (3) the date of conversion to a 
regularly funded project. As provided for in section 115(c), Pub. L. 95-
599, November 6, 1978, interest on bonds issued in any fiscal year by a 
State after November 6, 1978, may be paid under the authority of 23 
U.S.C. 122 only if such SHA was eligible to obligate Interstate 
Discretionary funds under the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 118(b) during such 
fiscal year, and the Administrator certifies that such eligible SHA has 
utilized, or will utilize to the fullest extent possible during such 
fiscal year, its authority to obligate funds under 23 U.S.C. 118(b).

for in Sec. 140.610 shall be the legal pro rata in effect at the time 
of execution of the project agreement for the bond issue project.
    (d) The authorization of a bond issue project does not constitute a 
commitment of Federal funds until the project is converted to a regular 
Federal-aid project as provided for in Sec. 140.610.
    (e) Reimbursements for the redemption of bonds may not precede, by 
more than 60 days, the scheduled date of the retirement of the bonds.
    (f) Federal funds are not eligible for payment into sinking funds 
created and maintained for the subsequent retirement of bonds.


<R05>
Sec. 140.603  Programs.

    Programs covering projects to be financed from the proceeds of bonds 
shall be prepared and submitted to FHWA. Project designations shall be

    (a) At such time as the SHA elects to apply available apportioned 
Federal-aid funds to the retirement of bonds, including eligible 
interest earned and payable on Interstate Bond Projects, subject to 
available obligational authority, its claim shall be supported by 
appropriate certifications as follows:

    I hereby certify that the following bonds, (list), the proceeds of 
which have been actually expended in the construction of bond issue 
projects authorized by title 23 U.S.C., section 122, (1) have been 
retired on ------, or (2) mature and are scheduled for retirement on --
----, which is ---- days in advance of the maturity date of ------.

    Eligible interest claimed on Interstate Bond Projects shall be shown 
for each bond and the certification shall include the statement:

    I also certify that interest earned and paid or payable for each 
bond listed has been determined from the date on and after which the 
respective bond proceeds were actually expended on the project.

    (b) The SHA's request for full conversion of a completed projects), 
or partial conversion of an active or completed project(s), may be made 
by letter, inclusive of the appropriate certification as described in 
Sec. 140.610(a) making reference to any progress payments received or 
the final voucher(s) previously submitted and approved in accordance 
with Sec. 140.609.
    (c) Approval of the conversion action shall be by the Division 
Administrator.
    (d) The SHA's request for partial conversion of an active or 
completed bond issue project shall provide for: (1) Conversion to funded

Subpart G [Reserved]


<R04>
              Subpart H_State Highway Agency Audit Expense

    Source: 49 FR 45578, Nov. 19, 1984, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 140.801  Purpose.

    To establish the reimbursement criteria for Federal participation in 
project related audit expenses.


<R05>
Sec. 140.803  Policy.

    Project related audits performed in accordance with generally 
accepted auditing standards (as modified by the Comptroller General of 
the United States) and applicable Federal laws and regulations are 
eligible for Federal participation. The State highway agency (SHA) may 
use other State, local public agency, and Federal audit organizations as 
well as licensed or certified public accounting firms to augment its 
audit force.


<R05>
Sec. 140.805  Definitions.

    (a) Project related audits. Audits which directly benefit Federal-
aid highway projects. Audits performed in accordance with the 
requirements of 23 CFR part 12, audits of third party contract costs, 
and other audits providing assurance that a recipient has complied with 
FHWA regulations are all considered project related audits. Audits 
benefiting only nonfederal projects, those performed for SHA management 
use only, or those serving similar nonfederal purposes are not 
considered project related.
    (b) Third party contract costs. Project related costs incurred by 
railroads, utilities, consultants, governmental instrumentalities, 
universities, nonprofit

[[Page 16]]

organizations, construction contractors (force account work), and 
organizations engaged in right-of-way studies, planning, research, or 
related activities where the terms of a proposal or contract (including 
lump sum) necessitate an audit. Construction contracts (except force 
account work) are not included in this group.


<R05>
Sec. 140.807  Reimbursable costs.

    (a) Federal funds may be used to reimburse an SHA for the following 
types of project related audit costs:
    (1) Salaries, wages, and related costs paid to public employees in 
accordance with subpart G of this part,
    (2) Payments by the SHA to any Federal, State, or local public 
agency audit organization, and
    (3) Payments by the SHA to licensed or certified public accounting 
firms.
    (b) Audit costs incurred by an SHA shall be equitably distributed to 
all benefiting parties. The portion of these costs allocated to the 
Federal-Aid Highway Program which are not directly related to a specific 
project or projects shall be equitably distributed, as a minimum, to the 
major FHWA funding categories in that State.


<R04>
                Subpart I_Reimbursement for Railroad Work

    Source: 40 FR 16057, Apr. 9, 1975, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 140.900  Purpose.

    The purpose of this subpart is to prescribe policies and procedures 
on reimbursement to the States for railroad work done on projects 
undertaken pursuant to the provisions of 23 CFR part 646, subpart B.


<R05>
Sec. 140.902  Applicability.

    This subpart, and all references hereinafter made to ``projects,'' 
applies to Federal-aid projects involving railroad facilities, including 
projects for the elimination of hazards of railroad-highway crossings, 
and other projects which use railroad properties or which involve 
adjustments required by highway construction to either railroad 
facilities or facilities that are jointly owned or used by railroad and 
utility companies.


<R05>
Sec. 140.904  Reimbursement basis.

    (a) General. On projects involving the elimination of hazards of 
railroad-highway crossings, and on other projects where a railroad 
company is not obligated to move or to change its facilities at its own 
expense, reimbursement will be made for the costs incurred by the State 
in making changes to railroad facilities as required in connection with 
a Federal-aid highway project, in accordance with the provisions of this 
subpart.
    (b) Eligibility. To be eligible, the costs must be:
    (1) For work which is included in an approved statewide 
transportation improvement program.
    (2) Incurred subsequent to the date of authorization by the Federal 
Highway Administration (FHWA),
    (3) Incurred in accordance with the provisions of 23 CFR, part 646, 
subpart B, and
    (4) Properly attributable to the project.

[40 FR 16057, Apr. 9, 1975, as amended at 53 FR 18276, May 23, 1988; 62 
FR 45328, Aug. 27, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 140.906  Labor costs.

    (a) General. (1) Salaries and wages, at actual or average rates, and 
related expenses paid by a company to individuals, for the time they are 
working on the project, are reimbursable when supported by adequate 
records. This shall include labor costs associated with preliminary 
engineering, construction engineering, right-of-way, and force account 
construction.
    (2) Salaries and expenses paid to individuals who are normally part 
of the overhead organization of the company may be reimbursed for the 
time they are working directly on the project, such as for accounting 
and bill preparation, when supported by adequate records and when the 
work performed by such individuals is essential to the project and could 
not have been accomplished as economically by employees outside the 
overhead organization.
    (3) Amounts paid to engineers, architects and others for services 
directly related to projects may be reimbursed.

[[Page 17]]

    (b) Labor surcharges. (1) Labor surcharges include worker 
compensation insurance, public liability and property damage insurance, 
and such fringe benefits as the company has established for the benefit 
of its employees. The cost of labor surcharges will be reimbursed at 
actual cost to the company or a company may, at its option, use an 
additive rate or other similar technique in lieu of actual costs 
provided that (i) the rate is based on historical cost data of the 
company, (ii) such rate is representative of actual costs incurred, 
(iii) the rate is adjusted at least annually taking into consideration 
known anticipated changes and correcting for any over or under applied 
costs for the preceding period, and (iv) the rate is approved by the SHA 
and FHWA.
    (2) Where the company is a self-insurer there may be reimbursement:
    (i) At experience rates properly developed from actual costs, not to 
exceed the rates of a regular insurance company for the class of 
employment covered, or
    (ii) At the option of the company, a fixed rate of 8 percent of 
direct labor costs for worker compensation and public liability and 
property damage insurance together.

[40 FR 16057, Apr. 9, 1975, as amended at 47 FR 33955, Aug. 5, 1982; 56 
FR 56578, Nov. 6, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 140.907  Overhead and indirect construction costs.

    (a) A State may elect to reimburse the railroad company for its 
overhead and indirect construction costs.
    (b) The FHWA will participate in these costs provided that:
    (1) The costs are distributed to all applicable work orders and 
other functions on an equitable and uniform basis in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles;
    (2) The costs included in the distribution are limited to costs 
actually incurred by the railroad;
    (3) The costs are eligible in accordance with the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR), part 31, Contract Cost Principles and 
Procedures, relating to contracts with commercial organizations;
    (4) The costs are considered reasonable;
    (5) Records are readily available at a single location which 
adequately support the costs included in the distribution, the method 
used for distributing the costs, and the basis for determining additive 
rates;
    (6) The rates are adjusted at least annually taking into 
consideration any overrecovery or underrecovery of costs; and
    (7) The railroad maintains written procedures which assure proper 
control and distribution of the overhead and indirect construction 
costs.

[53 FR 18276, May 23, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 140.908  Materials and supplies.

    (a) Procurement. Materials and supplies, if available, are to be 
furnished from company stock, except they may be obtained from other 
sources near the project site when available at less cost. Where not 
available from company stock, they may be purchased either under 
competitive bids or existing continuing contracts, under which the 
lowest available prices are developed. Minor quantities and proprietary 
products are excluded from these requirements. The company shall not be 
required to change its existing standards for materials used in 
permanent changes to its facilities.
    (b) Costs. (1) Materials and supplies furnished from company stock 
shall be billed at current stock price of such new or used material at 
time of issue.
    (2) Materials and supplies not furnished from company stock shall be 
billed at actual costs to the company delivered to the point of entry on 
the railroad company's line nearest the source of procurement.
    (3) A reasonable cost of plant inspection and testing may be 
included in the costs of materials and supplies where such expense has 
been incurred. The computation of actual costs of materials and supplies 
shall include the deduction of all offered discounts, rebates and 
allowances.
    (c) Materials recovered. (1) Materials recovered from temporary use 
and accepted for reuse by the company shall be credited to the project 
at prices charged to the job, less a consideration for loss in service 
life at 10 percent for

[[Page 18]]

rails, angle bars, tie plates and metal turnout materials and 15 percent 
for all other materials. Materials recovered from the permanent facility 
of the company that are accepted by the company for return to stock 
shall be credited to the project at current stock prices of such used 
material.
    (2) Materials recovered and not accepted for reuse by the company, 
if determined to have a net sale value, shall be sold by the State or 
railroad following an opportunity for State inspection and appropriate 
solicitation for bids, to the highest bidder; or if the company 
practices a system of periodic disposal by sale, credit to the project 
shall be at the going prices supported by the records of the company. 
Where applicable, credit for materials recovered from the permanent 
facility in length or quantities in excess of that being placed should 
be reduced to reflect any increased cost of railroad operation resulting 
from the adjustment.
    (d) Removal costs. Federal participation in the costs of removing, 
salvaging, transporting, and handling recovered materials will be 
limited to the value of materials recovered, except where FHWA approves 
additional measures for restoration of affected areas as required by the 
physical construction or by reason of safety or aesthetics.
    (e) Handling costs. The actual and direct costs of handling and 
loading out of materials and supplies at and from company stores or 
material yards and of unloading and handling of recovered materials 
accepted by the company at its stores or material yards, are 
reimbursable. At the option of the company, 5 percent of the amounts 
billed for the materials and supplies which are issued from company 
stores and material yards will be reimbursable in lieu of actual costs.
    (f) Credit losses. On projects where a company actually suffers loss 
by application of credits, the company shall have the opportunity of 
submitting a detailed statement of such loss as a basis for further 
adjustment.


<R05>
Sec. 140.910  Equipment.

    (a) Company owned equipment. Cost of company-owned equipment may be 
reimbursed for the average or actual cost of operation, light and 
running repairs, and depreciation, or at industry rates representative 
of actual costs as agreed to by the railroad, SHA, and FHWA. 
Reimbursement for company-owned vehicles may be made at average or 
actual costs or at rates of recorded use per mile which are 
representative of actual costs and agreed to by the company, SHA, and 
FHWA.
    (b) Other equipment. Where company owned equipment is not available, 
reimbursement will be limited to the amount of rental paid (1) to the 
lowest qualified bidder, (2) under existing continuing contracts at 
reasonable cost, or (3) as an exception, by negotiation where (b) (1) 
and (2) are impractical due to project location or schedule.

[40 FR 16057, Apr. 9, 1975, as amended at 47 FR 33955, Aug. 5, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 140.912  Transportation.

    (a) Employees. The company's cost of necessary employee 
transportation and subsistence directly attributable to the project, 
which is consistent with overall policy of the company, is reimbursable.
    (b) Materials, supplies, and equipment. The most economical movement 
of materials, supplies and equipment to the project and necessary return 
to storage, including the associated costs of loading and unloading 
equipment, is reimbursable. Transportation by a railroad company over 
its own lines in a revenue train is reimbursable at average or actual 
costs, at rates which are representative of actual costs, or at rates 
which the company charges its customers for similar shipments provided 
the rate structure is documented and available to the public. These 
rates are to be agreed to by the company, SHA, and FHWA. No charge will 
be made for transportation by work train other than the operating 
expenses of the work train. When it is more practicable or more 
economical to move equipment on its own wheels, reimbursement may be 
made at average or actual costs or at rates which are representative of 
actual costs and are agreed to by the railroad, SHA, and FHWA.

[40 FR 16057, Apr. 9, 1975, as amended at 47 FR 33955, Aug. 5, 1982]

[[Page 19]]


<R05>
Sec. 140.914  Credits for improvements.

    (a) Credit shall be made to the project for additions or 
improvements which provide for higher quality or increased service 
capability of the operating facility and which are provided solely for 
the benefit of the company.
    (b) Where buildings and other depreciable structures of a company 
which are integral to operation of rail traffic must be replaced, credit 
shall be made to the project as set forth in 23 CFR 646.216(c)(2).
    (c) No credit is required for additions or improvements which are:
    (1) Necessitated by the requirements of the highway project.
    (2) Replacements which, although not identical, are of equivalent 
standard.
    (3) Replacements of devices or materials no longer regularly 
manufactured and the next highest grade or size is used.
    (4) Required by governmental and appropriate regulatory commission 
requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 140.916  Protection.

    The cost of essential protective services which, in the opinion of a 
railroad company, are required to ensure safety to railroad operations 
during certain periods of the construction of a project, is reimbursable 
provided an item for such services is incorporated in the State-railroad 
agreement or in a work order issued by the State and approved by FHWA.


<R05>
Sec. 140.918  Maintenance and extended construction.

    The cost of maintenance and extended construction is reimbursable to 
the extent provided for in 23 CFR 646.216(f)(4), and where included in 
the State-Railroad Agreement or otherwise approved by the State and 
FHWA.


<R05>
Sec. 140.920  Lump sum payments.

    Where approved by FHWA, pursuant to 23 CFR 646.216(d)(3), 
reimbursement may be made as a lump sum payment, in lieu of actual 
costs.


<R05>
Sec. 140.922  Billings.

    (a) After the executed State-Railroad Agreement has been approved by 
FHWA, the company may be reimbursed on progress billings of incurred 
costs. Costs for materials stockpiled at the project site or 
specifically purchased and delivered to the company for use on the 
project may be reimbursed on progress billings following approval of the 
executed State-Railroad Agreement or the written agreement under 23 CFR 
646.218(c).
    (b) The company shall provide one final and complete billing of all 
incurred costs, or of the agreed-to lump sum, within one year following 
completion of the reimbursable railroad work. Otherwise, previous 
payments to the company may be considered final, except as agreed to 
between the SHA and the railroad.
    (c) All company cost records and accounts relating to the project 
are subject to audit by representatives of the State and/or the Federal 
Government for a period of three years from the date final payment has 
been received by the company.
    (d) A railroad company must advise the State promptly of any 
outstanding obligation of the State's contractor for services furnished 
by the company such as protective services.

Sec. 172.1  Purpose and applicability.

    This part prescribes policies and procedures for the administration 
of engineering and design related service contracts under 23 U.S.C. 112 
as supplemented by the common grant rule, 49

[[Page 20]]

CFR part 18. It is not the intent of this part to release the grantee 
from the requirements of the common grant rule. The policies and 
procedures involve federally funded contracts for engineering and design 
related services for projects subject to the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 
112(a) and are issued to ensure that a qualified consultant is obtained 
through an equitable selection process, that prescribed work is properly 
accomplished in a timely manner, and at fair and reasonable cost. 
Recipients of Federal funds shall ensure that their subrecipients comply 
with this part.


<R05>
Sec. 172.3  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    Audit means a review to test the contractor's compliance with the 
requirements of the cost principles contained in 48 CFR part 31.
    Cognizant agency means any Federal or State agency that has 
conducted and issued an audit report of the consultant's indirect cost 
rate that has been developed in accordance with the requirements of the 
cost principles contained in 48 CFR part 31.
    Competitive negotiation means any form of negotiation that utilizes 
the following:
    (1) Qualifications-based procedures complying with title IX of the 
Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (Public Law 92-
582, 86 Stat. 1278 (1972));
    (2) Equivalent State qualifications-based procedures; or
    (3) A formal procedure permitted by State statute that was enacted 
into State law prior to the enactment of Public Law 105-178 (TEA-21) on 
June 9, 1998.
    Consultant means the individual or firm providing engineering and 
design related services as a party to the contract.
    Contracting agencies means State Departments of Transportation 
(State DOTs) or local governmental agencies that are responsible for the 
procurement of engineering and design related services.
    Engineering and design related services means program management, 
construction management, feasibility studies, preliminary engineering, 
design, engineering, surveying, mapping, or architectural related 
services with respect to a construction project subject to 23 U.S.C. 
112(a).
    One-year applicable accounting period means the annual accounting 
period for which financial statements are regularly prepared for the 
consultant.


<R05>
Sec. 172.5  Methods of procurement.

    (a) Procurement. The procurement of Federal-aid highway contracts 
for engineering and design related services shall be evaluated and 
ranked by the contracting agency using one of the following procedures:
    (1) Competitive negotiation. Contracting agencies shall use 
competitive negotiation for the procurement of engineering and design 
related services when Federal-aid highway funds are involved in the 
contract. These contracts shall use qualifications-based selection 
procedures in the same manner as a contract for architectural and 
engineering services is negotiated under title IX of the Federal 
Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 541-544) or 
equivalent State qualifications-based requirements. The proposal 
solicitation (project, task, or service) process shall be by public 
announcement, advertisement, or any other method that assures qualified 
in-State and out-of-State consultants are given a fair opportunity to be 
considered for award of the contract. Price shall not be used as a 
factor in the analysis and selection phase. Alternatively, a formal 
procedure adopted by State Statute enacted into law prior to June 9, 
1998 is also permitted under paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
    (2) Small purchases. Small purchase procedures are those relatively 
simple and informal procurement methods where an adequate number of 
qualified sources are reviewed and the total contract costs do not 
exceed the simplified acquisition threshold fixed in 41 U.S.C. 403(11). 
Contract requirements should not be broken down into smaller components 
merely to permit the use of small purchase requirements. States and 
subrecipients of States may use the State's small purchase procedures 
for the procurement of engineering and design related services provided 
the total contract costs do not exceed the

[[Page 21]]

simplified acquisition threshold fixed in 41 U.S.C. 403(11).
    (3) Noncompetitive negotiation. Noncompetitive negotiation may be 
used to procure engineering and design related services on Federal-aid 
participating contracts when it is not feasible to award the contract 
using competitive negotiation, equivalent State qualifications-based 
procedures, or small purchase procedures. Contracting agencies shall 
submit justification and receive approval from the FHWA before using 
this form of contracting. Circumstances under which a contract may be 
awarded by noncompetitive negotiation are limited to the following:
    (i) The service is available only from a single source;
    (ii) There is an emergency which will not permit the time necessary 
to conduct competitive negotiations; or
    (iii) After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is 
determined to be inadequate.
    (4) State statutory procedures. Contracting agencies may procure 
engineering and design related services using an alternate selection 
procedure established in State statute enacted into law before June 9, 
1998.
    (b) Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program. The contracting 
agency shall give consideration to DBE consultants in the procurement of 
engineering and design related service contracts subject to 23 U.S.C. 
112(b)(2) in accordance with 49 CFR part 26.
    (c) Compensation. The cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage 
of construction cost methods of compensation shall not be used.


<R05>
Sec. 172.7  Audits.

    (a) Performance of audits. When State procedures call for audits of 
contracts or subcontracts for engineering design services, the audit 
shall be performed to test compliance with the requirements of the cost 
principles contained in 48 CFR part 31. Other procedures may be used if 
permitted by State statutes that were enacted into law prior to June 9, 
1998.
    (b) Audits for indirect cost rate. Contracting agencies shall use 
the indirect cost rate established by a cognizant agency audit for the 
cost principles contained in 48 CFR part 31 for the consultant, if such 
rates are not under dispute. A lower indirect cost rate may be used if 
submitted by the consultant firm, however the consultant's offer of a 
lower indirect cost rate shall not be a condition of contract award. The 
contracting agencies shall apply these indirect cost rates for the 
purposes of contract estimation, negotiation, administration, reporting, 
and contract payment and the indirect cost rates shall not be limited by 
any administrative or de facto ceilings. The consultant's indirect cost 
rates for its one-year applicable accounting period shall be applied to 
the contract, however once an indirect cost rate is established for a 
contract it may be extended beyond the one year applicable accounting 
period provided all concerned parties agree. Agreement to the extension 
of the one-year applicable period shall not be a condition of contract 
award. Other procedures may be used if permitted by State statutes that 
were enacted into law prior to June 9, 1998.
    (c) Disputed audits. If the indirect cost rate(s) as established by 
the cognizant audit in paragraph (b) of this section are in dispute, the 
parties of any proposed new contract must negotiate a provisional 
indirect cost rate or perform an independent audit to establish a rate 
for the specific contract. Only the consultant and the parties involved 
in performing the indirect cost audit may dispute the established 
indirect cost rate. If an error is discovered in the established 
indirect cost rate, the rate may be disputed by any prospective user.
    (d) Prenotification; confidentiality of data. The FHWA and 
recipients and subrecipients of Federal-aid highway funds may share the 
audit information in complying with the State or subrecpient's 
acceptance of a consultant's overhead rates pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 112 
and this part provided that the consultant is given notice of each use 
and transfer. Audit information shall not be provided to other 
consultants or any other government agency not sharing the cost data, or 
to any firm or government agency for purposes other than complying with 
the State or subrecpient's acceptance of a consultant's overhead rates 
pursuant

[[Page 22]]

to 23 U.S.C. 112 and this part without the written permission of the 
affected consultants. If prohibited by law, such cost and rate data 
shall not be disclosed under any circumstance, however should a release 
be required by law or court order, such release shall make note of the 
confidential nature of the data.


<R05>
Sec. 172.9  Approvals.

    (a) Written procedures. The contracting agency shall prepare written 
procedures for each method of procurement it proposes to utilize. These

Administration.
    (2) Section 162a of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1973 (section 
324, title 23 U.S.C.) requires that there be no discrimination on the 
ground of sex. The FHWA considers all assurances heretofore received to 
have been amended to include a prohibition against discrimination on the 
ground of sex. These assurances were signed by the 50 States, the 
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and 
American Samoa. The State highway agency shall submit a certification to 
the FHWA indicating that the requirements of section 162a of the 
Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1973 have been added to its assurances.
    (3) The State highway agency shall take affirmative action to 
correct any deficiencies found by the FHWA within a reasonable time

determination of concurrence or noncurrence with a recommendation to the 
Federal Highway Administrator. Should the Federal Highway Administrator 
concur with the recommendation, the file is referred to the Department 
of Transportation, Office of the Secretary, for appropriate action in 
accordance with 49 CFR.

Sec. 230.105  Applicability.

    (a) Federal-aid highway construction projects. This subpart applies 
to all Federal-aid highway construction projects and to Appalachian 
highway construction projects and other State supervised cooperative 
highway construction projects except:
    (1) Federal-aided highway construction projects being constructed 
pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 117; and
    (2) Those projects located in areas where the Office of Federal 
Contract Compliance has implemented an ``Imposed'' or a ``Hometown'' 
Plan, except for those requirements pertaining to specific provisions 
involving on-the-job training and those provisions pertaining to 
supportive services and reporting requirements.
    (b) Direct Federal highway construction projects. This subpart 
applies to all direct Federal highway construction projects except:
    (1) For those provisions relating to the special requirements for 
the provision of supportive services; and

Federal Contract Compliance has implemented an ``Imposed'' or 
``Hometown'' plan.


<R05>
Sec. 230.107  Policy.

    (a) Direct Federal and Federal-aid highway construction projects. It 
is the policy of the FHWA to require that all direct Federal and 
Federal-aid highway construction contracts include the same specific 
equal employment opportunity requirements. It is also the policy to 
require that all direct Federal and Federal-aid highway construction 
subcontracts of $10,000 or more (not including contracts for supplying 
materials) include these same requirements.
    (b) Federal-aid highway construction projects. It is the policy of 
the FHWA to require full utilization of all available training and 
skill-improvement opportunities to assure the increased participation of 
minority groups and disadvantaged persons and women in all phases of the 
highway construction industry. Moreover, it is the policy of the Federal 
Highway Administration to encourage the provision of supportive services 
which will increase the effectiveness of approved on-the-job training 
programs conducted in connection with Federal-aid highway construction 
projects.


<R05>
Sec. 230.109  Implementation of specific Equal Employment Opportunity requirements.

    (a) Federal-aid highway construction projects. The special

[[Page 33]]


<R05>
Sec. 230.111  Implementation of special requirements for the provision of on-the-job training.

    (a) The State highway agency shall determine which Federal-aid 
highway construction contracts shall include the ``Training Special 
Provisions'' (appendix B) and the minimum number of trainees to be 
specified therein after giving appropriate consideration to the 
guidelines set forth in Sec. 230.111(c). The ``Training Special 
Provisions'' shall supersede section 7(b) of the Special Provisions 
(appendix A) entitled ``Specific Equal Employment Opportunity 
Responsibilities.'' Minor wording revisions will be required to the 
``Training Special Provisions'' in areas having ``Hometown'' or 
``Imposed Plan'' requirements.
    (b) The Washington Headquarters shall establish and publish annually 
suggested minimum training goals. These goals will be based on the 
Federal-aid apportioned amounts and the minority population. A State 
will have achieved its goal if the total number of training slots on 
selected federally aided highway construction contracts which have been 
awarded during each 12-month period equals or exceeds the State's 
suggested minimum annual goal. In the event a State highway agency does 
not attain its goal during a calendar year, the State highway agency at 
the end of the calendar year shall inform the Administrator of the 
reasons for its inability to meet the suggested minimum number of 
training slots and the steps to be taken to achieve the goal during the 
next calendar year. The information is to be submitted not later than 30 
days from the end of the calendar year and should be factual, and should 
not only indicate the situations occurring during the year but show the 
project conditions at least through the coming year. The final 
determination will be made on what training goals are considered to be 
realistic based on the information submitted by a State.
    (c) The following guidelines shall be utilized by the State highway 
agency in selecting projects and determining the number of trainees to 
be provided training therein:
    (1) Availability of minorities, women, and disadvantaged for 
training.
    (2) The potential for effective training.
    (3) Duration of the contract.
    (4) Dollar value of the contract.
    (5) Total normal work force that the average bidder could be 
expected to use.
    (6) Geographic location.
    (7) Type of work.
    (8) The need for additional journeymen in the area.
    (9) Recognition of the suggested minimum goal for the State.
    (10) A satisfactory ratio of trainees to journeymen expected to be 
on the contractor's work force during normal operations (considered to 
fall between 1:10 and 1:4).
    (d) Training programs which are established shall be approved only 
if they meet the standards set forth in appendix B with regard to:
    (1) The primary objectives of training and upgrading minority group 
workers, women and disadvantaged persons.
    (2) The development of full journeymen.
    (3) The minimum length and type of training.
    (4) The minimum wages of trainees.
    (5) Trainees certifications.
    (6) Keeping records and furnishing reports.
    (e)(1) Training programs considered by a State highway agency to 
meet the standards under this directive shall be submitted to the FHWA 
division Administrator with a recommendation for approval.
    (2) Employment pursuant to training programs approved by the FHWA 
division Administrator will be exempt from the minimum wage rate 
provisions of section 113 of title 23 U.S.C. Approval, however, shall 
not be given to training programs which provide for employment of 
trainees at wages less than those required by the Special Training 
Provisions. (Appendix B.)
    (f)(1) Apprenticeship programs approved by the U.S. Department of 
Labor as of the date of proposed use by a Federal-aid highway contractor 
or subcontractor need not be formally approved by the State highway 
agency or the FHWA division Administrator. Such programs, including 
their minimum wage provisions, are acceptable for use, provided they are 
administered

[[Page 34]]

in a manner reasonably calculated to meet the equal employment 
opportunity obligations of the contractor.
    (2) Other training programs approved by the U.S. Department of Labor 
as of the date of proposed use by a Federal-aid highway contractor or 
subcontractor are also acceptable for use without the formal approval of 
the State highway agency or the division Administrator provided:
    (i) The U.S. Department of Labor has clearly approved the program 
aspects relating to equal employment opportunity and the payment of 
trainee wage rates in lieu of prevailing wage rates.
    (ii) They are reasonably calculated to qualify the average trainees 
for journeyman status in the classification concerned by the end of the 
training period.
    (iii) They are administered in a manner calculated to meet the equal 
employment obligations of the contractors.
    (g) The State highway agencies have the option of permitting 
Federal-aid highway construction contractors to bid on training to be 
given under this directive. The following procedures are to be utilized 
by those State highway agencies that elect to provide a bid item for 
training:
    (1) The number of training positions shall continue to be specified 
in the Special Training Provisions. Furthermore, this number should be 
converted into an estimated number of hours of training which is to be 
used in arriving at the total bid price for the training item. Increases 
and decreases from the estimated amounts would be handled as overruns or 
underruns;
    (2) A section concerning the method of payment should be included in 
the Special Training Provisions. Some offsite training is permissible as 
long as the training is an integral part of an approved training program 
and does not comprise a substantial part of the overall training. 
Furthermore, the trainee must be concurrently employed on a federally 
aided highway construction project subject to the Special Training 
Provisions attached to this directive. Reimbursement for offsite 
training may only be made to the contractor where he does one or more of 
the following: Contributes to the cost of the training, provides the 
instruction to the trainee, or pays the trainee's wages during the 
offsite training period;
    (3) A State highway agency may modify the special provisions to 
specify the numbers to be trained in specific job classifications;
    (4) A State highway agency can specify training standards provided 
any prospective bidder can use them, the training standards are made 
known in the advertised specifications, and such standards are found 
acceptable by FHWA.

FR 3080, Jan. 21, 1976]


<R05>
Sec. 230.113  Implementation of supportive services.

    (a) The State highway agency shall establish procedures, subject to 
the availability of funds under 23 U.S.C. 140(b), for the provision of 
supportive services in support of training programs approved under this 
directive. Funds made available to implement this paragraph shall not be 
used to finance the training of State highway agency employees or to 
provide services in support of such training. State highway agencies are 
not required to match funds allocated to them under this section.
    (b) In determining the types of supportive services to be provided 
which will increase the effectiveness of approved training programs. 
State highway agencies shall give preference to the following types of

supportive services other than those listed above shall submit their 
proposals to the Federal Highway Administration for approval. The 
proposal, together with recommendations of the division and regional 
offices shall be submitted to the Administrator for appropriate action.
    (d) When the State highway agency provides supportive services by 
contract, formal advertising is not required by the FHWA, however, the 
State highway agency shall solicit proposals from such qualified sources 
as will assure the competitive nature of the procurement. The evaluation 
of proposals by the State highway agency must include consideration of 
the proposer's ability to effect a productive relationship with 
contractors, unions (if appropriate), minority and women groups, 
minority and women trainees, and other persons or organizations whose 
cooperation and assistance will contribute to the successful performance 
of the contract work.
    (e) In the selection of contractors to provide supportive services, 
State highway agencies shall make conscientious efforts to search out 
and utilize the services of qualified minority or women organizations, 
or minority or women business enterprises.
    (f) As a minimum, State highway agency contracts to obtain 
supportive services shall include the following provisions:
    (1) A statement that a primary purpose of the supportive services is

Sec. 230.115  Special contract requirements for ``Hometown'' or ``Imposed'' Plan areas.

    Direct Federal and Federal-aid contracts to be performed in 
``Hometown''

[[Page 36]]

or ``Imposed'' Plan areas will incorporate the special provision set 
forth in appendix G.


<R05>
Sec. 230.117  Reimbursement procedures (Federal-aid highway construction projects only).

    (a) On-the-job special training provisions. State highway agencies 
will be reimbursed on the same pro-rata basis as the construction costs 
of the Federal-aid project.
    (b) Supportive services. (1) The State highway agency must keep a 
separate account of supportive services funds since they cannot be 
interchanged with regular Federal-aid funds. In addition, these funds 
may not be expended in a manner that would provide for duplicate payment 
of Federal or Federal-aid funds for the same service.
    (2) Where a State highway agency does not obligate all its funds 
within the time specified in the particular year's allocation directive, 
the funds shall revert to the FHWA Headquarters Office to be made 
available for use by other State highway agencies, taking into 
consideration each State's need for and ability to use such funds.


<R05>
Sec. 230.119  Monitoring of supportive services.

    Supportive services procured by a State highway agency shall be 
monitored by both the State highway agency and the division office.


<R05>
Sec. 230.121  Reports.

    (a) Employment reports on Federal-aid highway construction contracts 
not subject to ``Hometown'' or ``Imposed'' plan requirements.
    (1) Paragraph 10c of the special provisions (appendix A) sets forth 
specific reporting requirements. FHWA Form PR-1391, Federal-Aid Highway 
Construction Contractors Annual EEO Report, (appendix C) and FHWA Form 
PR 1392, Federal-Aid Highway Construction Summary of Employment Data 
(including minority breakdown) for all Federal-Aid Highway Projects for 
month ending July 31st, 19--, (appendix D) are to be used to fulfill 
these reporting requirements.
    (2) Form PR 1391 is to be completed by each contractor and each 
subcontractor subject to this part for every month of July during which 
work is performed, and submitted to the State highway agency. A separate 
report is to be completed for each covered contract or subcontract. The 
employment data entered should reflect the work force on board during 
all or any part of the last payroll period preceding the end of the 
month. The State highway agency is to forward a single copy of each 
report to the FHWA division office.

<R05>
      Sec. Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 230--Special Provisions

         specific equal employment opportunity responsibilities

    1. General. a. Equal employment opportunity requirements not to 
discriminate and to take affirmative action to assure equal employment 
opportunity as required by Executive Order 11246 and Executive Order 
11375 are set forth in Required Contract, Provisions (Form PR-1273 or 
1316, as appropriate) and these Special Provisions which are imposed 
pursuant to section 140 of title 23 U.S.C., as established by section 22 
of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968. The requirements set forth in 
these Special Provisions shall constitute the specific affirmative 
action requirements for project activities under this contract and 
supplement the equal employment opportunity requirements set forth in 
the Required Contract Provisions.
    b. The contractor will work with the State highway agencies and the 
Federal Government in carrying out equal employment opportunity 
obligations and in their review of his/her activities under the 
contract.
    c. The contractor and all his/her subcontractors holding 
subcontracts not including material suppliers, of $10,000 or more, will 
comply with the following minimum specific requirement activities of 
equal employment opportunity: (The equal employment opportunity 
requirements of Executive Order 11246, as set forth in volume 6, chapter 
4, section 1, subsection 1 of the Federal-Aid Highway Program Manual, 
are applicable to material suppliers as well as contractors and 
subcontractors.) The contractor will include these requirements in every 
subcontract of $10,000 or more with such modification of language as is 
necessary to make them binding on the subcontractor.
    2. Equal Employment Opportunity Policy. The contractor will accept 
as his operating policy the following statement which is designed to 
further the provision of equal employment opportunity to all persons 
without regard to their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, 
and to promote the full realization of equal employment opportunity 
through a positive continuing program:
    It is the policy of this Company to assure that applicants are 
employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without 
regard to their race, religion, sex, color, or national origin. Such 
action shall include: employment, upgrading, demotion, or transfer; 
recruitment or recruitment advertising; layoff or termination; rates of 
pay or other forms of compensation; and selection for training, 
including apprenticeship, preapprenticeship, and/or on-the-job training.
    3. Equal Employment Opportunity Officer. The contractor will 
designate and make known to the State highway agency contracting 
officers and equal employment opportunity officer (hereinafter referred 
to as the EEO Officer) who will have the responsibility for and must be 
capable of effectively administering and promoting an active contractor 
program of equal employment opportunity and who must be assigned 
adequate authority and responsibility to do so.
    4. Dissemination of Policy. a. All members of the contractor's staff 
who are authorized to hire, supervise, promote, and discharge employees, 
or who recommend such action, or who are substantially involved in such 
action, will be made fully cognizant of, and will implement, the 
contractor's equal employment opportunity policy and contractual 
responsibilities to provide equal employment opportunity in each grade 
and classification of employment. To ensure that the above agreement 
will be met, the following actions will be taken as a minimum:
    (1) Periodic meetings of supervisory and personnel office employees 
will be conducted before the start of work and then not less often than 
once every six months, at which time the contractor's equal employment 
opportunity policy and its implementation will be reviewed and 
explained. The meetings will be conducted by the EEO Officer or other 
knowledgeable company official.
    (2) All new supervisory or personnel office employees will be given 
a thorough indoctrination by the EEO Officer or other knowledgeable 
company official, covering all major aspects of the contractor's equal 
employment opportunity obligations within thirty days following their 
reporting for duty with the contractor.
    (3) All personnel who are engaged in direct recruitment for the 
project will be instructed by the EEO Officer or appropriate company 
official in the contractor's procedures for locating and hiring minority 
group employees.
    b. In order to make the contractor's equal employment opportunity 
policy known to all employees, prospective employees and potential 
sources of employees, i.e., schools, employment agencies, labor unions 
(where appropriate), college placement officers, etc., the contractor 
will take the following actions:
    (1) Notices and posters setting forth the contractor's equal 
employment opportunity

[[Page 38]]

policy will be placed in areas readily accessible to employees, 
applicants for employment and potential employees.
    (2) The contractor's equal employment opportunity policy and the 
procedures to implement such policy will be brought to the attention of 
employees by means of meetings, employee handbooks, or other appropriate 
means.
    5. Recruitment. a. When advertising for employees, the contractor 
will include in all advertisements for employees the notation: ``An 
Equal Opportunity Employer.'' All such advertisements will be published 
in newspapers or other publications having a large circulation among 
minority groups in the area from which the project work force would 
normally be derived.
    b. The contractor will, unless precluded by a valid bargaining 
agreement, conduct systematic and direct recruitment through public and 
private employee referral sources likely to yield qualified minority 
group applicants, including, but not limited to, State employment 
agencies, schools, colleges and minority group organizations. To meet 
this requirement, the contractor will, through his EEO Officer, identify 
sources of potential minority group employees, and establish with such 
identified sources procedures whereby minority group applicants may be 
referred to the contractor for employment consideration.
    In the event the contractor has a valid bargaining agreement 
providing for exclusive hiring hall referrals, he is expected to observe 
the provisions of that agreement to the extent that the system permits 
the contractor's compliance with equal employment opportunity contract 
provisions. (The U.S. Department of Labor has held that where 
implementation of such agreements have the effect of discriminating 
against minorities or women, or obligates the contractor to do the same, 
such implementation violates Executive Order 11246, as amended.)
    c. The contractor will encourage his present employees to refer 
minority group applicants for employment by posting appropriate notices 
or bulletins in areas accessible to all such employees. In addition, 
information and procedures with regard to referring minority group 
applicants will be discussed with employees.
    6. Personnel Actions. Wages, working conditions, and employee 
benefits shall be established and administered, and personnel actions of 
every type, including hiring, upgrading, promotion, transfer, demotion, 
layoff, and termination, shall be taken without regard to race, color, 
religion, sex, or national origin. The following procedures shall be 
followed:
    a. The contractor will conduct periodic inspections of project sites 
to insure that working conditions and employee facilities do not 
indicate discriminatory treatment of project site personnel.
    b. The contractor will periodically evaluate the spread of wages 
paid within each classification to determine any evidence of 
discriminatory wage practices.
    c. The contractor will periodically review selected personnel 
actions in depth to determine whether there is evidence of 
discrimination. Where evidence is found, the contractor will promptly 
take corrective action. If the review indicates that the discrimination 
may extend beyond the actions reviewed, such corrective action shall 
include all affected persons.
    d. The contractor will promptly investigate all complaints of 
alleged discrimination made to the contractor in connection with his 
obligations under this contract, will attempt to resolve such 
complaints, and will take appropriate corrective action within a 
reasonable time. If the investigation indicates that the discrimination 
may affect persons other than the complainant, such corrective action 
shall include such other persons. Upon completion of each investigation, 
the contractor will inform every complainant of all of his avenues of 
appeal.
    7. Training and Promotion. a. The contractor will assist in 
locating, qualifying, and increasing the skills of minority group and 
women employees, and applicants for employment.
    b. Consistent with the contractor's work force requirements and as 
permissible under Federal and State regulations, the contractor shall 
make full use of training programs, i.e., apprenticeship, and on-the-job 
training programs for the geographical area of contract performance. 
Where feasible, 25 percent of apprentices or trainees in each occupation 
shall be in their first year of apprenticeship or training. In the event 
the Training Special Provision is provided under this contract, this 
subparagraph will be superseded as indicated in Attachment 2.
    c. The contractor will advise employees and applicants for 
employment of available training programs and entrance requirements for 
each.
    d. The contractor will periodically review the training and 
promotion potential of minority group and women employees and will 
encourage eligible employees to apply for such training and promotion.
    8. Unions. If the contractor relies in whole or in part upon unions 
as a source of employees, the contractor will use his/her best efforts 
to obtain the cooperation of such unions to increase opportunities for 
minority groups and women within the unions, and to effect referrals by 
such unions of minority and female employees. Actions by the contractor 
either directly or through a contractor's association acting as agent 
will include the procedures set forth below:

[[Page 39]]

    a. The contractor will use best efforts to develop, in cooperation 
with the unions, joint training programs aimed toward qualifying more 
minority group members and women for membership in the unions and 
increasing the skills of minority group employees and women so that they 
may qualify for higher paying employment.
    b. The contractor will use best efforts to incorporate an equal 
employment opportunity clause into each union agreement to the end that 
such union will be contractually bound to refer applicants without 
regard to their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.
    c. The contractor is to obtain information as to the referral 
practices and policies of the labor union except that to the extent such 
information is within the exclusive possession of the labor union and 
such labor union refuses to furnish such information to the contractor, 
the contractor shall so certify to the State highway department and 
shall set forth what efforts have been made to obtain such information.
    d. In the event the union is unable to provide the contractor with a 
reasonable flow of minority and women referrals within the time limit 
set forth in the collective bargaining agreement, the contractor will, 
through independent recruitment efforts, fill the employment vacancies 
without regard to race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; making 
full efforts to obtain qualified and/or qualifiable minority group 
persons and women. (The U.S. Department of Labor has held that it shall 
be no excuse that the union with which the contractor has a collective 
bargaining agreement providing for exclusive referral failed to refer 
minority employees.) In the event the union referral practice prevents 
the contractor from meeting the obligations pursuant to Executive Order 
11246, as amended, and these special provisions, such contractor shall 
immediately notify the State highway agency.
    9. Subcontracting. a. The contractor will use his best efforts to 
solicit bids from and to utilize minority group subcontractors or 
subcontractors with meaningful minority group and female representation 
among their employees. Contractors shall obtain lists of minority-owned 
construction firms from State highway agency personnel.
    b. The contractor will use his best efforts to ensure subcontractor 
compliance with their equal employment opportunity obligations.
    10. Records and Reports. a. The contractor will keep such records as 
are necessary to determine compliance with the contractor's equal 
employment opportunity obligations. The records kept by the contractor 
will be designed to indicate:
    (1) The number of minority and nonminority group members and women 
employed in each work classification on the project.
    (2) The progress and efforts being made in cooperation with unions 
to increase employment opportunities for minorities and women 
(applicable only to contractors who rely in whole or in part on unions 
as a source of their work force),
    (3) The progress and efforts being made in locating, hiring, 
training, qualifying, and upgrading minority and female employees, and
    (4) The progress and efforts being made in securing the services of 
minority group subcontractors or subcontractors with meaningful minority 
and female representation among their employees.
    b. All such records must be retained for a period of three years 
following completion of the contract work and shall be available at 
reasonable times and places for inspection by authorized representatives 
of the State highway agency and the Federal Highway Administration.
    c. The contractors will submit an annual report to the State highway 
agency each July for the duration of the project, indicating the number 
of minority, women, and non-minority group employees currently engaged 
in each work classification required by the contract work. This 
information is to be reported on Form PR 1391. If on-the-job training is 
being required by ``Training Special Provision'', the contractor will be 
required to furnish Form FHWA 1409.

<R05>
  Sec. Appendix B to Subpart A of Part 230--Training Special Provisions

    This Training Special Provision supersedes subparagraph 7b of the 
Special Provision entitled ``Specific Equal Employment Opportunity 
Responsibilities,'' (Attachment 1), and is in implementation of 23 
U.S.C. 140(a).
    As part of the contractor's equal employment opportunity affirmative 
action program training shall be provided as follows:
    The contractor shall provide on-the-job training aimed at developing 
full journeymen in the type of trade or job classification involved.
    The number of trainees to be trained under the special provisions 
will be -------- (amount to be filled in by State highway department).
    In the event that a contractor subcontracts a portion of the 
contract work, he shall determine how many, if any, of the trainees are 
to be trained by the subcontractor, provided, however, that the 
contractor shall retain the primary responsibility for meeting the 
training requirements imposed by this special provision. The contractor 
shall also insure that this training

[[Page 40]]

special provision is made applicable to such subcontract. Where 
feasible, 25 percent of apprentices or trainees in each occupation shall 
be in their first year of apprenticeship or training.
    The number of trainees shall be distributed among the work 
classifications on the basis of the contractor's needs and the 
availability of journeymen in the various classifications within a 
reasonable area of recruitment. Prior to commencing construction, the 
contractor shall submit to the State highway agency for approval the 
number of trainees to be trained in each selected classification and 
training program to be used. Furthermore, the contractor shall specify 
the starting time for training in each of the classifications. The 
contractor will be credited for each trainee employed by him on the 
contract work who is currently enrolled or becomes enrolled in an 
approved program and will be reimbursed for such trainees as provided 
hereinafter.
    Training and upgrading of minorities and women toward journeymen 
status is a primary objective of this Training Special Provision. 
Accordingly, the contractor shall make every effort to enroll minority 
trainees and women (e.g., by conducting systematic and direct 
recruitment through public and private sources likely to yield minority 
and women trainees) to the extent that such persons are available within 
a reasonable area of recruitment. The contractor will be responsible for 
demonstrating the steps that he has taken in pursuance thereof, prior to 
a determination as to whether the contractor is in compliance with this 
Training Special Provision. This training commitment is not intended, 
and shall not be used, to discriminate against any applicant for 
training, whether a member of a minority group or not.
    No employee shall be employed as a trainee in any classification in 
which he has successfully completed a training course leading to 
journeyman status or in which he has been employed as a journeyman. The 
contractor should satisfy this requirement by including appropriate 
questions in the employee application or by other suitable means. 
Regardless of the method used the contractor's records should document 
the findings in each case.
    The minimum length and type of training for each classification will 
be as established in the training program selected by the contractor and 
approved by the State highway agency and the Federal Highway 
Administration. The State highway agency and the Federal Highway 
Administration shall approve a program if it is reasonably calculated to 
meet the equal employment opportunity obligations of the contractor and 
to qualify the average trainee for journeyman status in the 
classification concerned by the end of the training period. Furthermore, 
apprenticeship programs registered with the U.S. Department of Labor, 
Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, or with a State apprenticeship 
agency recognized by the Bureau and training programs approved but not 
necessarily sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor, Manpower 
Administration, Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training shall also be 
considered acceptable provided it is being administered in a manner 
consistent with the equal employment obligations of Federal-aid highway 
construction contracts. Approval or acceptance of a training program 
shall be obtained from the State prior to commencing work on the 
classification covered by the program. It is the intention of these 
provisions that training is to be provided in the construction crafts 
rather than clerk-typists or secretarial-type positions. Training is 
permissible in lower level management positions such as office 
engineers, estimators, timekeepers, etc., where the training is oriented 
toward construction applications. Training in the laborer classification 
may be permitted provided that significant and meaningful training is 
provided and approved by the division office. Some offsite training is 
permissible as long as the training is an integral part of an approved 
training program and does not comprise a significant part of the overall 
training.
    Except as otherwise noted below, the contractor will be reimbursed 
80 cents per hour of training given an employee on this contract in 
accordance with an approved training program. As approved by the 
engineer, reimbursement will be made for training persons in excess of 
the number specified herein. This reimbursement will be made even though 
the contractor receives additional training program funds from other 
sources, provided such other does not specifically prohibit the 
contractor from receiving other reimbursement. Reimbursement for offsite 
training indicated above may only be made to the contractor where he 
does one or more of the following and the trainees are concurrently 
employed on a Federal-aid project; contributes to the cost of the 
training, provides the instruction to the trainee or pays the trainee's 
wages during the offsite training period.
    No payment shall be made to the contractor if either the failure to 
provide the required training, or the failure to hire the trainee as a 
journeyman, is caused by the contractor and evidences a lack of good 
faith on the part of the contractor in meeting the requirements of this 
Training Special Provision. It is normally expected that a trainee will 
begin his training on the project as soon as feasible after start of 
work utilizing the skill involved and remain on the project as long as 
training opportunities exist in his work classification or until he has 
completed his training program. It is not required that all trainees be 
on board for the entire length

[[Page 41]]

of the contract. A contractor will have fulfilled his responsibilities 
under this Training Special Provision if he has provided acceptable 
training to the number of trainees specified. The number trained shall 
be determined on the basis of the total number enrolled on the contract 
for a significant period.
    Trainees will be paid at least 60 percent of the appropriate minimum 
journeyman's rate specified in the contract for the first half of the 
training period, 75 percent for the third quarter of the training 
period, and 90 percent for the last quarter of the training period, 
unless apprentices or trainees in an approved existing program are 
enrolled as trainees on this project. In that case, the appropriate 
rates approved by the Departments of Labor or Transportation in 
connection with the existing program shall apply to all trainees being 
trained for the same classification who are covered by this Training 
Special Provision.
    The contractor shall furnish the trainee a copy of the program he 
will follow in providing the training. The contractor shall provide each 
trainee with a certification showing the type and length of training 
satisfactorily completed.
    The contractor will provide for the maintenance of records and 
furnish periodic reports documenting his performance under this Training 
Special Provision.

  Subpart B_Supportive Services for Minority, Disadvantaged, and Women 
                          Business Enterprises

    Source: 50 FR 51243, Dec. 16, 1985, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 230.201  Purpose.

    To prescribe the policies, procedures, and guidance to develop, 
conduct, and administer supportive services assistance programs for 
minority, disadvantaged, and women business enterprises.


<R05>
Sec. 230.202  Definitions.

    (a) Minority Business Enterprise, as used in this subpart, refers to 
all small

[[Page 45]]

businesses which participate in the Federal-aid highway program as a 
minority business enterprise (MBE), women business enterprise (WBE), or 
disadvantaged business enterprise (DBE), all defined under 49 CFR part 
23. This expanded definition is used only in this subpart as a 
simplified way of defining the firms eligible to benefit from this 
supportive services program.
    (b) Supportive Services means those services and activities provided 
in connection with minority business enterprise programs which are 
designed to increase the total number of minority businesses active in 
the highway program and contribute to the growth and eventual self-
sufficiency of individual minority businesses so that such businesses 
may achieve proficiency to compete, on an equal basis, for contracts and 
subcontracts.
    (c) State highway agency means that department, commission, board, 
or official of any State charged by its laws with the responsibility for 
highway construction. The term State is considered equivalent to State 
highway agency if the context so implies.


<R05>
Sec. 230.203  Policy.

    Based on the provisions of Pub. L. 97-424, dated January 6, 1983, it 
is the policy of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to promote 
increased participation of minority business enterprises in Federal-aid 
highway contracts in part through the development and implementation of 
cost effective supportive services programs through the State highway 
agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 230.204  Implementation of supportive services.

    (a) Subject to the availability of funds under 23 U.S.C. 140(c), the 
State highway agency shall establish procedures to develop, conduct, and 
administer minority business enterprise training and assistance programs 
specifically for the benefit of women and minority businesses. 
Supportive services funds allocated to the States shall not be used to 
finance the training of State highway agency employees or to provide 
services in support of such training. State highway agencies are not 
required to match funds allocated to them under this section. Individual

    (e) When the State highway agency provides supportive services by 
contract, formal advertising is not required by FHWA; however, the State 
highway agency shall solicit proposals from such qualified sources as 
will assure the competitive nature of the procurement. The evaluation of 
proposals by the State highway agency must include consideration of the 
proposer's ability to effect a productive relationship with majority and 
minority contractors, contractors' associations, minority groups, and 
other persons or organizations whose cooperation and assistance will 
increase the opportunities for minority business enterprises to compete 
for and perform contracts and subcontracts.
    (f) In the selection of contractors to perform supportive services, 
State highway agencies shall make conscientious efforts to search out, 
and utilize the services of qualified minority or women organizations,

    The provisions of this subpart are applicable to all States that 
receive Federal financial assistance in connection with the Federal-aid 
highway program.


<R05>
Sec. 230.305  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, the following definitions apply:
    (a) Affirmative Action Plan means:
    (1) With regard to State highway agency work forces, a written 
document detailing the positive action steps the State highway agency 
will take to assure internal equal employment opportunity (internal 
plan).
    (2) With regard to Federal-aid construction contract work forces, 
the Federal equal employment opportunity bid conditions, to be enforced 
by a State highway agency in the plan areas established by the Secretary 
of Labor and FHWA special provisions in nonplan areas (external plan).
    (b) Equal employment opportunity program means the total State 
highway agency program, including the affirmative action plans, for 
ensuring compliance with Federal requirements both in State highway 
agency internal employment and in employment on Federal-aid construction 
projects.
    (c) Minority groups. An employee may be included in the minority 
group to which he or she appears to belong, or is regarded in the 
community as belonging. As defined by U.S. Federal agencies for 
employment purposes, minority group persons in the U.S. are identified 
as Blacks (not of Hispanic origin), Hispanics, Asian or Pacific 
Islanders, and American Indians or Alaskan Natives.
    (d) Racial/ethnic identification. For the purpose of this regulation 
and any accompanying report requirements, an employee may be included in 
the group to which he or she appears to belong, identifies with, or is 
regarded in the community as belonging. However, no person should be 
counted in more than one racial/ethnic category. The following group 
categories will be used:

                part ii--state highway agency employment

    I. General. The State highway agency's (SHA) internal program is an 
integral part of the agency's total activities. It should include the 
involvement, commitment and support of executives, managers, supervisors 
and all other employees. For effective administration and implementation 
of the EEO Program, an affirmative action plan (AAP) is required. The 
scope of an EEO program and an AAP must be comprehensive, covering all 
elements of the agency's personnel management policies and practices. 
The major part of an AAP must be recognition and removal of any barriers 
to equal employment opportunity, identification of problem areas and of 
persons unfairly excluded or held back and action enabling them to 
compete for jobs on an equal basis. An effective AAP not only benefits 
those who have been denied equal employment opportunity but will also 
greatly benefit the organization which often has overlooked, screened 
out or underutilized the great reservoir of untapped human resources and 
skills, especially among women and minority groups.
    Set forth are general guidelines designed to assist the State 
highway agencies in implementing internal programs, including the 
development and implementation of AAP's to ensure fair and equal 
treatment for all persons, regardless of race, color, religion, sex or 
national origin in all employment practices.
    II. Administration and implementation. The head of each State 
highway agency is responsible for the overall administration of the 
internal EEO program, including the total integration of equal 
opportunity into all facets of personnel management. However, specific 
program responsibilities should be assigned for carrying out the program 
at all management levels.
    To ensure effectiveness in the implementation of the internal EEO 
program, a specific and realistic AAP should be developed. It should 
include both short and long-range objectives, with priorities and target 
dates for achieving goals and measuring progress, according to the 
agency's individual need to overcome existing problems.
    A. State Highway Agency Affirmative Action Officer (internal). 1. 
Appointment of Affirmative Action Officer. The head of the SHA should 
appoint a qualified Affirmative Action (AA) Officer (Internal EEO 
Officer) with responsibility and authority to implement the internal EEO 
program. In making the selection, the following factors should be 
considered:

[[Page 51]]

    a. The person appointed should have proven ability to accomplish 
major program goals.
    b. Managing the internal EEO program requires a major time 
commitment; it cannot be added on to an existing full-time job.
    c. Appointing qualified minority and/or female employees to head or 
staff the program may offer good role models for present and potential 
employees and add credibility to the programs involved. However, the 
most essential requirements for such position(s) are sensitivity to 
varied ways in which discrimination limits job opportunities, commitment 
to program goals and sufficient status and ability to work with others 
in the agency to achieve them.
    2. Responsibilities of the Affirmative Action Officer. The 
responsibilities of the AA Officer should include, but not necessarily 
be limited to:
    a. Developing the written AAP.
    b. Publicizing its content internally and externally.
    c. Assisting managers and supervisors in collecting and analyzing 
employment data, identifying problem areas, setting goals and timetables 
and developing programs to achieve goals. Programs should include 
specific remedies to eliminate any discriminatory practices discovered 
in the employment system.
    d. Handling and processing formal discrimination complaints.
    e. Designing, implementing and monitoring internal audit and 
reporting systems to measure program effectiveness and to determine 
where progress has been made and where further action is needed.
    f. Reporting, at least quarterly, to the head of the SHA on progress 
and deficiencies of each unit in relation to agency goals.
    g. In addition, consider the creation of:
    (1) An EEO Advisory Committee, whose membership would include top 
management officials,
    (2) An EEO Employee Committee, whose membership would include rank 
and file employees, with minority and female representatives from 
various job levels and departments to meet regularly with the AA 
officer, and
    (3) An EEO Counseling Program to attempt informal resolution of 
discrimination complaints.
    B. Contents of an affirmative action plan. The Affirmative Action 
Plan (AAP) is an integral part of the SHA's EEO program. Although the 
style and format of AAP's may vary from one SHA to another, the basic 
substance will generally be the same. The essence of the AAP should 
include, but not necessarily be limited to:
    1. Inclusion of a strong agency policy statement of commitment to 
EEO.
    2. Assignment of responsibility and authority for program to a 
qualified individual.
    3. A survey of the labor market area in terms of population makeup, 
skills, and availability for employment.
    4. Analyzing the present work force to identify jobs, departments 
and units where minorities and females are underutilized.
    5. Setting specific, measurable, attainable hiring and promotion 
goals, with target dates, in each area of underutilization.
    6. Making every manager and supervisor responsible and accountable 
for meeting these goals.
    7. Reevaluating job descriptions and hiring criteria to assure that 
they reflect actual job needs.
    8. Finding minorities and females who are qualified or qualifiable 
to fill jobs.
    9. Getting minorities and females into upward mobility and relevant 
training programs where they have not had previous access.
    10. Developing systems to monitor and measure progress regularly. If 
results are not satisfactory to meet goals, determine the reasons and 
make necessary changes.
    11. Developing a procedure whereby employees and applicants may 
process allegations of discrimination to an impartial body without fear 
of reprisal.
    C. Implementation of an affirmative action plan. The written AAP is 
the framework and management tool to be used at all organizational 
levels to actively implement, measure and evaluate program progress on 
the specific action items which represent EEO program problems or 
deficiencies. The presence of a written plan alone does not constitute 
an EEO program, nor is it, in itself, evidence of an ongoing program. As 
a minimum, the following specific actions should be taken.
    1. Issue written equal employment opportunity policy statement and 
affirmative action commitment. To be effective, EEO policy provisions 
must be enforced by top management, and all employees must be made aware 
that EEO is basic agency policy. The head of the SHA (1) should issue a 
firm statement of personal commitment, legal obligation and the 
importance of EEO as an agency goal, and (2) assign specific 
responsibility and accountability to each executive, manager and 
supervisor.
    The statement should include, but not necessarily be limited to, the 
following elements:
    a. EEO for all persons, regardless of race, color, religion, sex or 
national origin as a fundamental agency policy.
    b. Personal commitment to and support of EEO by the head of the SHA.
    c. The requirement that special affirmative action be taken 
throughout the agency to overcome the effects of past discrimination.
    d. The requirement that the EEO program be a goal setting program 
with measurement

[[Page 52]]

and evaluation factors similar to other major agency programs.
    e. Equal opportunity in all employment practices, including (but not 
limited to) recruiting, hiring, transfers, promotions, training, 
compensation, benefits, recognition (awards), layoffs, and other 
terminations.
    f. Responsibility for positive affirmative action in the discharge 
of EEO programs, including performance evaluations of managers and 
supervisors in such functions, will be expected of and shared by all 
management personnel.
    g. Accountability for action or inaction in the area of EEO by 
management personnel.
    2. Publicize the affirmative action plan. a. Internally: (1) 
Distribute written communications from the head of the SHA.
    (2) Include the AAP and the EEO policy statement in agency 
operations manual.
    (3) Hold individual meetings with managers and supervisors to 
discuss the program, their individual responsibilities and to review 
progress.
    (4) Place Federal and State EEO posters on bulletin boards, near 
time clocks and in personnel offices.
    (5) Publicize the AAP in the agency newsletters and other 
publications.
    (6) Present and discuss the AAP as a part of employee orientation 
and all training programs.
    (7) Invite employee organization representatives to cooperate and 
assist in developing and implementing the AAP.
    b. Externally: Distribute the AAP to minority groups and women's 
organizations, community action groups, appropriate State agencies, 
professional organizations, etc.
    3. Develop and implement specific programs to eliminate 
discriminatory barriers and achieve goals. a. Job structuring and upward 
mobility: The AAP should include specific provisions for:
    (1) Periodic classification plan reviews to correct inaccurate 
position descriptions and to ensure that positions are allocated to the 
appropriate classification.
    (2) Plans to ensure that all qualification requirements are closely 
job related.
    (3) Efforts to restructure jobs and establish entry level and 
trainee positions to facilitate progression within occupational areas.
    (4) Career counseling and guidance to employees.
    (5) Creating career development plans for lower grade employees who 
are underutilized or who demonstrate potential for advancement.
    (6) Widely publicizing upward mobility programs and opportunities 
within each work unit and within the total organizational structure.
    b. Recruitment and placement. The AAP should include specific 
provisions for, but not necessarily limited to:
    (1) Active recruitment efforts to support and supplement those of 
the central personnel agency or department, reaching all appropriate 
sources to obtain qualified employees on a nondiscriminatory basis.
    (2) Maintaining contracts with organizations representing minority 
groups, women, professional societies, and other sources of candidates 
for technical, professional and management level positions.
    (3) Ensuring that recruitment literature is relevant to all 
employees, including minority groups and women.
    (4) Reviewing and monitoring recruitment and placement procedures so 
as to assure that no discriminatory practices exist.
    (5) Cooperating with management and the central personnel agency on 
the review and validation of written tests and other selection devices.
    (6) Analyzing the flow of applicants through the selection and 
appointment process, including an analytical review of reasons for 
rejections.
    (7) Monitoring the placement of employees to ensure the assignment 
of work and workplace on a nondiscriminatory basis.
    c. Promotions. The AAP should include specific provisions for, but 
not necessarily limited to:
    1. Establishing an agency-wide merit promotion program, including a 
merit promotion plan, to provide equal opportunity for all persons based 
on merit and without regard to race, color, religion, sex or national 
origin.
    2. Monitoring the operation of the merit promotion program, 
including a review of promotion actions, to assure that requirements 
procedures and practices support EEO program objectives and do not have 
a discriminatory impact in actual operation.
    3. Establishing skills banks to match employee skills with available 
job advancement opportunities.
    4. Evaluating promotion criteria (supervisory evaluations, oral 
interviews, written tests, qualification standards, etc.) and their use 
by selecting officials to identify and eliminate factors which may lead 
to improper ``selection out'' of employees or applicants, particularly 
minorities and women, who traditionally have not had access to better 
jobs. It may be appropriate to require selecting officials to submit a 
written justification when well qualified persons are passed over for 
upgrading or promotion.
    5. Assuring that all job vacancies are posted conspicuously and that 
all employees are encouraged to bid on all jobs for which they feel they 
are qualified.
    6. Publicizing the agency merit promotion program by highlighting 
breakthrough promotions, i.e., advancement of minorities and women to 
key jobs, new career heights, etc.

[[Page 53]]

    d. Training. The AAP should include specific provisions for, but not 
necessarily limited to:
    (1) Requiring managers and supervisors to participate in EEO 
seminars covering the AAP, the overall EEO program and the 
administration of the policies and procedures incorporated therein, and 
on Federal, State and local laws relating to EEO.
    (2) Training in proper interviewing techniques of employees who 
conduct employment selection interviews.
    (3) Training and education programs designed to provide 
opportunities for employees to advance in relation to the present and 
projected manpower needs of the agency and the employees' career goals.
    (4) The review of profiles of training course participants to ensure 
that training opportunities are being offered to all eligible employees 
on an equal basis and to correct any inequities discovered.
    e. Layoffs, recalls, discharges, demotions, and disciplinary 
actions. The standards for deciding when a person shall be terminated, 
demoted, disciplined, laid off or recalled should be the same for all 
employees, including minorities and females. Seemingly neutral practices 
should be reexamined to see if they have a disparate effect on such 
groups. For example, if more minorities and females are being laid off 
because they were the last hired, then, adjustments should be made to 
assure that the minority and female ratios do not decrease because of 
these actions.
    (1) When employees, particularly minorities and females, are 
disciplined, laid off, discharged or downgraded, it is advisable that 
the actions be reviewed by the AA Officer before they become final.
    (2) Any punitive action (i.e., harassment, terminations, demotions), 
taken as a result of employees filing discrimination complaints, is 
illegal.
    (3) The following records should be kept to monitor this area of the 
internal EEO program:
    On all terminations, including layoffs and discharges: indicate 
total number, name, (home address and phone number), employment date, 
termination date, recall rights, sex, racial/ethnic identification (by 
job category), type of termination and reason for termination.
    On all demotions: indicate total number, name, (home address and 
phone number), demotion date, sex, racial/ethnic identification (by job 
category), and reason for demotion.
    On all recalls: indicate total number, name, (home address and phone 
number) recall date, sex, and racial/ethnic identification (by job 
category).
    Exit interviews should be conducted with employees who leave the 
employment of the SHA.
    f. Other personnel actions. The AAP should include specific 
provisions for, but not necessarily limited to:
    (1) Assuring that information on EEO counseling and grievance 
procedures is easily available to all employees.
    (2) A system for processing complaints alleging discrimination 
because of race, color, religion, sex or national origin to an impartial 
body.
    (3) A system for processing grievances and appeals (i.e., 
disciplinary actions, adverse actions, adverse action appeals, etc).
    (4) Including in the performance appraisal system a factor to rate 
manager's and supervisors' performance in discharging the EEO program 
responsibilities assigned to them.
    (5) Reviewing and monitoring the performance appraisal program 
periodically to determine its objectivity and effectiveness.
    (6) Ensuring the equal availability of employee benefits to all 
employees.
    4. Program evaluation. An internal reporting system to continually 
audit, monitor and evaluate programs is essential for a successful AAP. 
Therefore, a system providing for EEO goals, timetables, and periodic 
evaluations needs to be established and implemented. Consideration 
should be given to the following actions:
    a. Defining the major objectives of EEO program evaluation.
    b. The evaluation should be directed toward results accomplished, 
not only at efforts made.
    c. The evaluation should focus attention on assessing the adequacy 
of problem identification in the AAP and the extent to which the 
specific action steps in the plan provide solutions.
    d. The AAP should be reviewed and evaluated at least annually. The 
review and evaluation procedures should include, but not be limited to, 
the following:
    (1) Each bureau, division or other major component of the agency 
should make annual and such other periodic reports as are needed to 
provide an accurate review of the operations of the AAP in that 
component.
    (2) The AA Officer should make an annual report to the head of the 
SHA, containing the overall status of the program, results achieved 
toward established objectives, identity of any particular problems 
encountered and recommendations for corrective actions needed.
    e. Specific, numerical goals and objectives should be established 
for the ensuing year. Goals should be developed for the SHA as a whole, 
as well as for each unit and each job category.
    III. Employment statistical data. A. As a minimum, furnish the most 
recent data on the following:
    1. The total population in the State,

[[Page 54]]

    2. The total labor market in State, with a breakdown by racial/
ethnic identification and sex, and
    3. An analysis of (1) and (2) above, in connection with the 
availability of personnel and jobs within SHA's.
    B. State highway agencies shall use the EEO-4 Form in providing 
current work force data. This data shall reflect only State department 
of transportation/State highway department employment.

    Source: 41 FR 34239, Aug. 13, 1976, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 230.401  Purpose.

    The purpose of the regulations in this subpart is to prescribe 
policies and procedures to standardize the implementation of the equal 
opportunity contract compliance program, including compliance reviews, 
consolidated compliance reviews, and the administration of areawide 
plans.


<R05>
Sec. 230.403  Applicability.

    The procedures set forth hereinafter apply to all nonexempt direct 
Federal and Federal-aid highway construction contracts and subcontracts, 
unless otherwise specified.


<R05>
Sec. 230.405  Administrative responsibilities.

    (a) Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) responsibilities. (1) The 
FHWA has the responsibility to ensure that contractors meet contractural 
equal opportunity requirements under E.O. 11246, as amended, and title 
23 U.S.C., and to provide guidance and direction to States in the 
development and implementation of a program to assure compliance with 
equal opportunity requirements.
    (2) The Federal Highway Administrator or a designee may inquire into 
the status of any matter affecting the FHWA equal opportunity program 
and, when considered necessary, assume jurisdiction over the matter, 
proceeding in coordination with the State concerned. This is without 
derogation of the authority of the Secretary of Transportation, 
Department of Transportation (DOT), the Director, DOT Departmental 
Office of Civil Rights (OCR) or the Director, Office of Federal Contract 
Compliance Programs (OFCCP), Department of Labor.
    (3) Failure of the State highway agency (SHA) to discharge the 
responsibilities stated in Sec. 230.405(b)(1) may result in DOT's 
taking any or all of the following actions (see appendix A to 23 CFR 
part 630, subpart C ``Federal-aid project agreement''):
    (i) Cancel, terminate, or suspend the Federal-aid project agreement 
in whole or in part;
    (ii) Refrain from extending any further assistance to the SHA under 
the program with respect to which the failure or refusal occurred until 
satisfactory assurance of future compliance has been received from the 
SHA; and
    (iii) Refer the case to an appropriate Federal agency for legal 
proceedings.
    (4) Action by the DOT, with respect to noncompliant contractors, 
shall not relieve a SHA of its responsibilities in connection with these 
same matters; nor is such action by DOT a substitute for corrective 
action utilized by a State under applicable State laws or regulations.
    (b) State responsibilities. (1) The SHA's, as contracting agencies, 
have a responsibility to assure compliance by contractors with the 
requirements of Federal-aid construction contracts, including the equal 
opportunity requirements, and to assist in and cooperate with FHWA 
programs to assure equal opportunity.
    (2) The corrective action procedures outlined herein do not preclude 
normal contract administration procedures by the States to ensure the 
contractor's completion of specific contract equal opportunity 
requirements, as long as such procedures support, and sustain the 
objectives of E.O. 11246, as amended. The State shall inform FHWA of any 
actions taken against a contractor under normal State contract 
administration procedures, if that action is precipitated in whole or in 
part by noncompliance with equal opportunity contract requirements.

<R05>
Sec. 230.409  Contract compliance review procedures.

    (a) General. A compliance review consists of the following elements:
    (1) Review Scheduling (Actions R-1 and R-2).
    (2) Contractor Notification (Action R-3).
    (3) Preliminary Analysis (Phase I) (Action R-4).
    (4) Onsite Verification and Interviews (Phase II) (Action R-5).
    (5) Exit Conference (Action R-6).
    (6) Compliance Determination and Formal Notification (Actions R-8, 
R-9, R-10, R-11, R-12).

The compliance review procedure, as described herein and in appendix D 
provides for continual monitoring of the employment process. Monitoring 
officials at all levels shall analyze submissions from field offices to 
ensure proper completion of procedural requirements and to ascertain the 
effectiveness of program implementation.
    (b) Review scheduling. (Actions R-1 and R-2). Because construction 
work forces are not constant, particular attention should be paid to the 
proper scheduling of equal opportunity compliance reviews. Priority in 
scheduling equal opportunity compliance reviews shall be given to 
reviewing those contractor's work forces:
    (1) Which hold the greatest potential for employment and promotion 
of minorities and women (particularly in higher skilled crafts or 
occupations);
    (2) Working in areas which have significant minority and female 
labor forces within a reasonable recruitment area;
    (3) Working on projects that include special training provisions; 
and
    (4) Where compliance with equal opportunity requirements is 
questionable. (Based on previous PR-1391's (23 CFR part 230, subpart A, 
appendix C) Review Reports and Hometown Plan Reports).

In addition, the following considerations shall apply:
    (5) Reviews specifically requested by the Washington Headquarters 
shall receive priority scheduling;
    (6) Compliance Reviews in geographical areas covered by areawide 
plans would normally be reviewed under the Consolidated Compliance 
Review Procedures set forth in Sec. 230.415.
    (7) Reviews shall be conducted prior to or during peak employment 
periods.
    (8) No compliance review shall be conducted that is based on a home 
office work force of less than 15 employees unless requested or approved 
by Washington Headquarters; and
    (9) For compliance reviews based on an area work force (outside of 
areawide plan coverage), the Compliance Specialist shall define the 
applicable geographical area by considering:
    (i) Union geographical boundaries;
    (ii) The geographical area from which the contractor recruits 
employees, i.e., reasonable recruitment area;
    (iii) Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) or census 
tracts; and
    (iv) The county in which the Federal or Federal-aid project(s) is 
located and adjacent counties.
    (c) Contractor notification (Action R-3). (1) The Compliance 
Specialist should usually provide written notification to the contractor 
of the pending compliance review at least 2 weeks prior to the onsite 
verification and interviews. This notification shall include the 
scheduled date(s), an outline of the mechanics and basis of the review, 
requisite interviews, and documents required.
    (2) The contractor shall be requested to provide a meeting place on 
the day

[[Page 60]]

of the visit either at the local office of the contractor or at the 
jobsite.
    (3) The contractor shall be requested to supply all of the following 
information to the Compliance Specialist prior to the onsite 
verification and interviews.
    (i) Current Form PR-1391 developed from the most recent payroll;
    (ii) Copies of all current bargaining agreements;
    (iii) Copies of purchase orders and subcontracts containing the EEO 
clause;
    (iv) A list of recruitment sources available and utilized;
    (v) A statement of the status of any action pertaining to employment 
practices taken by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or 
other Federal, State, or local agency regarding the contractor or any 
source of employees;
    (vi) A list of promotions made during the past 6 months, to include 
race, national origin, and sex of employee, previous job held, job 
promoted into; and corresponding wage rates;
    (vii) An annotated payroll to show job classification, race, 
national origin and sex;
    (viii) A list of minority- or female-owned companies contacted as 
possible subcontractors, vendors, material suppliers, etc.; and
    (ix) Any other necessary documents or statements requested by the 
Compliance Specialist for review prior to the actual onsite visit.
    (4) For a project review, the prime contractor shall be held 
responsible for ensuring that all active subcontractors are present at 
the meeting and have supplied the documentation listed in Sec. 
230.409(c)(3).
    (d) Preliminary analysis (Phase I) (Action R-4). Before the onsite 
verification and interviews, the Compliance Specialist shall analyze the 
employment patterns, policies, practices, and programs of the contractor 
to determine whether or not problems exist by reviewing information 
relative to:
    (1) The contractor's current work force;
    (2) The contractor's relationship with referral sources, e.g., 
unions, employment agencies, community action agencies, minority and 
female organizations, etc.;
    (3) The minority and female representation of sources;
    (4) The availability of minorities and females with requisite skills 
in a reasonable recruitment area;
    (5) Any pending EEOC or Department of Justice cases or local or 
State Fair Employment Agency cases which are relevant to the contractor 
and/or the referral sources; and
    (6) The related projects (and/or contractor) files of FHWA regional 
or division and State Coordinator's offices to obtain current 
information relating to the status of the contractor's project(s), 
value, scheduled duration, written corrective action plans, PR-1391 or 
Manpower Utilization Reports, training requirements, previous compliance 
reviews, and other pertinent correspondence and/or reports.
    (e) Onsite verification and interviews (Phase II) (Action R-5). (1) 
Phase II of the review consists of the construction or home office site 
visit(s). During the initial meeting with the contractor, the following 
topics shall be discussed:
    (i) Objectives of the visit;
    (ii) The material submitted by the contractor, including the actual 
implementation of the employee referral source system and any 
discrepancies found in the material; and
    (iii) Arrangements for the site tour(s) and employee interviews.
    (2) The Compliance Specialist shall make a physical tour of the 
employment site(s) to determine that:
    (i) EEO posters are displayed in conspicuous places in a legible 
fashion;
    (ii) Facilities are provided on a nonsegregated basis (e.g. work 
areas, washroom, timeclocks, locker rooms, storage areas, parking lots, 
and drinking fountains);
    (iii) Supervisory personnel have been oriented to the contractor's 
EEO commitments;
    (iv) The employee referral source system is being implemented;
    (v) Reported employment data is accurate;
    (vi) Meetings have been held with employees to discuss EEO policy, 
particularly new employees; and

[[Page 61]]

    (vii) Employees are aware of their right to file complaints of 
discrimination.
    (3) The Compliance Specialist should interview at least one 
minority, one nonminority, and one woman in each trade, classification, 
or occupation. The contractor's superintendent or home office manager 
should also be interviewed.
    (4) The Compliance Specialist shall, on a sample basis, determine 
the union membership status of union employees on the site (e.g. whether 
they have permits, membership cards, or books, and in what category they 
are classified [e.g., A, B, or C]).
    (5) The Compliance Specialist shall also determine the method 
utilized to place employees on the job and whether equal opportunity 
requirements have been followed.
    (6) The Compliance Specialist shall determine, and the report shall 
indicate the following:
    (i) Is there reasonable representation and utilization of minorities 
and women in each craft, classification or occupation? If not, what has 
the contractor done to increase recruitment, hiring, upgrading, and 
training of minorities and women?
    (ii) What action is the contractor taking to meet the contractual 
requirement to provide equal employment opportunity?
    (iii) Are the actions taken by the contractor acceptable? Could they 
reasonably be expected to result in increased utilization of minorities 
and women?
    (iv) Is there impartiality in treatment of minorities and women?
    (v) Are affirmative action measures of an isolated nature or are 
they continuing?
    (vi) Have the contractor's efforts produced results?
    (f) Exit conference (Action R-6). (1) During the exit conference 
with the contractor, the following topics shall be discussed:
    (i) Any preliminary findings that, if not corrected immediately or 
not corrected by the adoption of an acceptable voluntary corrective 
action plan, would necessitate a determination of noncompliance;
    (ii) The process and time in which the contractor shall be informed 
of the final determination (15 days following the onsite verification 
and interviews); and
    (iii) Any other matters that would best be resolved before 
concluding the onsite portion of the review.
    (2) Voluntary corrective action plans may be negotiated at the exit 
conference, so that within 15 days following the exit portion of the 
review, the Compliance Specialist shall prepare the review report and 
make a determination of either:
    (i) Compliance, and so notify the contractor; or
    (ii) Noncompliance, and issue a 30-day show cause notice.

The acceptance of a voluntary corrective action plan at the exit 
conference does not preclude a determination of noncompliance, 
particularly if deficiencies not addressed by the plan are uncovered 
during the final analysis and report writing. (Action R-7) A voluntary 
corrective action plan should be accepted with the understanding that it 
only address those problems uncovered prior to the exit conference.
    (g) Compliance determinations (Action R-8). (1) The evidence 
obtained at the compliance review shall constitute a sufficient basis 
for an objective determination by the Compliance Specialist conducting 
the review of the contractor's compliance or noncompliance with 
contractual provisions pursuant to E.O. 11246, as amended, and FHWA EEO 
Special Provisions implementing the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968, 
where applicable.
    (2) Compliance determinations on contractors working in a Hometown 
Plan Area shall reflect the status of those crafts covered by part II of 
the plan bid conditions. Findings regarding part I crafts shall be 
transmitted through channels to the Washington Headquarters, Office of 
Civil Rights.
    (3) The compliance status of the contractor will usually be 
reflected by positive efforts in the following areas:
    (i) The contractor's equal employment opportunity (EEO) policy;
    (ii) Dissemination of the policy and education of supervisory 
employees concerning their responsibilities in implementing the EEO 
policy;

[[Page 62]]

    (iii) The authority and responsibilities of the EEO officer;
    (iv) The contractor's recruitment activities, especially 
establishing minority and female recruitment and referral procedures;
    (v) The extent of participation and minority and female utilization 
in FHWA training programs;
    (vi) The contractor's review of personnel actions to ensure equal 
opportunities;
    (vii) The contractor's participation in apprenticeship or other 
training;
    (viii) The contractor's relationship (if any) with unions and 
minority and female union membership;
    (ix) Effective measures to assure nonsegregated facilities, as 
required by contract provisions;
    (x) The contractor's procedures for monitoring subcontractors and 
utilization of minority and female subcontractors and/or subcontractors 
with substantial minority and female employment; and
    (xi) The adequacy of the contractor's records and reports.
    (4) A contractor shall be considered to be in compliance (Action R-
9) when the equal opportunity requirements have been effectively 
implemented, or there is evidence that every good faith effort has been 
made toward achieving this end. Efforts to acheive this goal shall be 
result-oriented, initiated and maintained in good faith, and emphasized 
as any other vital management function.
    (5) A contractor shall be considered to be in noncompliance (Action 
R-10) when:
    (i) The contractor has discriminated against applicants or employees 
with respect to the conditions or privileges of employment; or
    (ii) The contractor fails to provide evidence of every good faith 
effort to provide equal opportunity.
    (h) Show cause procedures--(1) General. Once the onsite verification 
and exit conference (Action R-5) have been completed and a compliance 
determination made, (Action R-8), the contractor shall be notified in 
writing of the compliance determination. (Action R-11 or R-12) This 
written notification shall be sent to the contractor within 15 days 
following the completion of the onsite verification and exit conference. 
If a contractor is found in noncompliance (Action R-10), action efforts 
to bring the contractor into compliance shall be initiated through the 
issuance of a show cause notice (Action R-12). The notice shall advise 
the contractor to show cause within 30 days why sanctions should not be 
imposed.
    (2) When a show cause notice is required. A show cause notice shall 
be issued when a determination of noncompliance is made based upon:
    (i) The findings of a compliance review;
    (ii) The results of an investigation which verifies the existence of 
discrimination; or
    (iii) Areawide plan reports that show an underutilization of 
minorities (based on criteria of U.S. Department of Labor's Optional 
Form 66 ``Manpower Utilization Report'') throughout the contractor's 
work force covered by part II of the plan bid conditions.
    (3) Responsibility for issuance. (i) Show cause notices will 
normally be issued by SHA's to federally assisted contractors when the 
State has made a determination of noncompliance, or when FHWA has made 
such a determination and has requested the State to issue the notice.
    (ii) When circumstances warrant, the Regional Federal Highway 
Administrator or a designee may exercise primary compliance 
responsibility by issuing the notice directly to the contractor.
    (iii) The Regional Federal Highway Administrators in Regions 8, 10, 
and the Regional Engineer in Region 15, shall issue show cause notices 
to direct Federal contractors found in noncompliance.
    (4) Content of show cause notice. The show cause notice must: (See 
sample--appendix A of this subpart)
    (i) Notify the contractor of the determination of noncompliance;
    (ii) Provide the basis for the determination of noncompliance;
    (iii) Notify the contractor of the obligation to show cause within 
30 days why formal proceedings should not be instituted;

[[Page 63]]

    (iv) Schedule (date, time, and place) a compliance conference to be 
held approximately 15 days from the contractor's receipt of the notice;
    (v) Advise the contractor that the conference will be held to 
receive and discuss the acceptability of any proposed corrective action 
plan and/or correction of deficiencies; and
    (vi) Advise the contractor of the availability and willingness of 
the Compliance Specialist to conciliate within the time limits of the 
show cause notice.
    (5) Preparing and processing the show cause notice. (i) The State or 
FHWA official who conducted the investigation or review shall develop 
complete background data for the issuance of the show cause notice and 
submit the recommendation to the head of the SHA or the Regional Federal 
Highway Administrator, as appropriate.
    (ii) The recommendation, background data, and final draft notice 
shall be reviewed by appropriate State or FHWA legal counsel.
    (iii) Show cause notices issued by the SHA shall be issued by the 
head of that agency or a designee.
    (iv) The notice shall be personally served to the contractor or 
delivered by certified mail, return receipt requested, with a 
certificate of service or the return receipt filed with the case record.
    (v) The date of the contractor's receipt of the show cause notice 
shall begin the 30-day show cause period. (Action R-13).
    (vi) The 30-day show cause notice shall be issued directly to the 
noncompliant contractor or subcontractor with an informational copy sent 
to any concerned prime contractors.
    (6) Conciliation efforts during show cause period. (i) The 
Compliance Specialist is required to attempt conciliation with the 
contractor throughout the show cause time period. Conciliation and 
negotiation efforts shall be directed toward correcting contractor 
program deficiencies and initiating corrective action which will 
maintain and assure equal opportunity. Records shall be maintained in 
the State, FHWA division, or FHWA regional office's case files, as 
appropriate, indicating actions and reactions of the contractor, a brief 
synopsis of any meetings with the contractor, notes on verbal 
communication and written correspondence, requests for assistance or 
interpretations, and other relevant matters.
    (ii) In instances where a contractor is determined to be in 
compliance after a show cause notice has been issued, the show cause 
notice will be recinded and the contractor formally notified (Action R-
17). The FHWA Washington Headquarters, Office of Civil Rights, shall 
immediately be notified of any change in status.
    (7) Corrective action plans. (i) When a contractor is required to 
show cause and the deficiencies cannot be corrected within the 30-day 
show cause period, a written corrective action plan may be accepted. The 
written corrective action plan shall specify clear unequivocal action by 
the contractor with time limits for completion. Token actions to correct 
cited deficiencies will not be accepted. (See Sample Corrective Action 
Plan--appendix B of this subpart)
    (ii) When a contractor submits an acceptable written corrective 
action plan, the contractor shall be considered in compliance during the 
plan's effective implementation and submission of required progress 
reports. (Action R-15 and R-17).
    (iii) When an acceptable corrective action plan is not agreed upon 
and the contractor does not otherwise show cause as required, the formal 
hearing process shall be recommended through appropriate channels by the 
compliance specialist immediately upon expiration of the 30-day show 
cause period. (Action R-16, R-18, R-19)
    (iv) When a contractor, after having submitted an acceptable 
corrective action plan and being determined in compliance is 
subsequently determined to be in noncompliance based upon the 
contractor's failure to implement the corrective action plan, the formal 
hearing process must be recommended immediately. There are no provisions 
for reinstituting a show cause notice.
    (v) When, however, a contractor operating under an acceptable 
corrective action plan carries out the provisions of the corrective 
action plan but the actions do not result in the necessary

[[Page 64]]

changes, the corrective action plan shall be immediately amended through 
negotiations. If, at this point, the contractor refuses to appropriately 
amend the corrective action plan, the formal hearing process shall be 
recommended immediately.
    (vi) A contractor operating under an approved voluntary corrective 
action plan (i.e., plan entered into prior to the issuance of a show 
cause) must be issued a 30-day show cause notice in the situations 
referred to in paragraphs (h) (7) (iv) and (v) of this section, i.e., 
failure to implement an approved corrective action plan or failure of 
corrective actions to result in necessary changes.
    (i) Followup reviews. (1) A followup review is an extension of the 
initial review process to verify the contractors performance of 
corrective action and to validate progress report information. 
Therefore, followup reviews shall only be conducted of those contractors 
where the initial review resulted in a finding of noncompliance and a 
show cause notice was issued.
    (2) Followup reviews shall be reported as a narrative summary 
referencing the initial review report.
    (j) Hearing process. (1) When such procedures as show cause issuance 
and conciliation conferences have been unsuccessful in bringing 
contractors into compliance within the prescribed 30 days, the reviewer 
(or other appropriate level) shall immediately recommend, through 
channels, that the Department of Transportation obtain approval from the 
Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs for a formal hearing 
(Action R-19). The Contractor should be notified of this action.
    (2) Recommendations to the Federal Highway Administrator for hearing 
approval shall be accompanied by full reports of findings and case files 
containing any related correspondence. The following items shall be 
included with the recommendation:
    (i) Copies of all Federal and Federal-aid contracts and/or 
subcontracts to which the contractor is party;
    (ii) Copies of any contractor or subcontractor certifications;
    (iii) Copy of show cause notice;
    (iv) Copies of any corrective action plans; and
    (v) Copies of all pertinent Manpower Utilization Reports, if 
applicable.
    (3) SHA's through FHWA regional and division offices, will be 
advised of decisions and directions affecting contractors by the FHWA 
Washington Headquarters, Office of Civil Rights, for the Department of 
Transportation.
    (k) Responsibility determinations. (1) In instances where requests 
for formal hearings are pending OFCCP approval, the contractor may be 
declared a nonresponsible contractor for inability to comply with the 
equal opportunity requirements.
    (2) SHA's shall refrain from entering into any contract or contract 
modification subject to E.O. 11246, as amended, with a contractor who 
has not demonstrated eligibility for Government contracts and federally 
assisted construction contracts pursuant to E.O. 11246, as amended.


<R05>
Sec. 230.411  Guidance for conducting reviews.

    (a) Extensions of time. Reasonable extensions of time limits set 
forth in these instructions may be authorized by the SHA's or the FHWA 
regional office, as appropriate. However, all extensions are subject to 
Washington Headquarters approval and should only be granted with this 
understanding. The Federal Highway Administrator shall be notified of 
all time extensions granted and the justification therefor. In sensitive 
or special interest cases, simultaneous transmittal of reports and other 
pertinent documents is authorized.
    (b) Contract completion. Completion of a contract or seasonal 
shutdown shall not preclude completion of the administrative procedures 
outlined herein or the possible imposition of sanctions or debarment.
    (c) Home office reviews outside regions. When contractor's home 
offices are located outside the FHWA region in which the particular 
contract is being performed, and it is determined that the contractors' 
home offices should be reviewed, requests for such reviews with 
accompanying justification shall be forwarded through appropriate

[[Page 65]]

channels to the Washington Headquarters, Office of Civil Rights. After 
approval, the Washington Headquarters, Office of Civil Rights, (OCR) 
shall request the appropriate region to conduct the home office review.
    (d) Employment of women. Executive Order 11246, as amended, 
implementing rules and regulations regarding sex discrimination are 
outlined in 41 CFR part 60-20. It is the responsibility of the 
Compliance Specialist to ensure that contractors provide women full 
participation in their work forces.
    (e) Effect of exclusive referral agreements. (1) The OFCCP has 
established the following criteria for determining compliance when an 
exclusive referral agreement is involved;
    (i) It shall be no excuse that the union, with which the contractor 
has a collective bargaining agreement providing for exclusive referral, 
failed to refer minority or female employees.
    (ii) Discrimination in referral for employment, even if pursuant to 
provisions of a collective bargaining agreement, is prohibited by the 
National Labor Relations Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 
1964, as amended.
    (iii) Contractors and subcontractors have a responsibility to 
provide equal opportunity if they want to participate in federally 
involved contracts. To the extent they have delegated the responsibility 
for some of their employment practices to some other organization or 
agency which prevents them from meeting their obligations, these 
contractors must be found in noncompliance.
    (2) If the contractor indicates that union action or inaction is a 
proximate cause of the contractor's failure to provide equal 
opportunity, a finding of noncompliance will be made and a show cause 
notice issued, and:
    (i) The contractor will be formally directed to comply with the 
equal opportunity requirements.
    (ii) Reviews of other contractors with projects within the 
jurisdiction of the applicable union locals shall be scheduled.
    (iii) If the reviews indicate a pattern and/or practice of 
discrimination on the part of specific union locals, each contractor in 
the area shall be informed of the criteria outlined in Sec. 
230.411(e)(1) of this section. Furthermore, the FHWA Washington 
Headquarters, OCR, shall be provided with full documentary evidence to 
support the discriminatory pattern indicated.
    (iv) In the event the union referral practices prevent the 
contractor from meeting the equal opportunity requirements pursuant to 
the E.O. 11246, as amended, such contractor shall immediately notify the 
SHA.


<R05>

<R05>
Sec. 230.415  Consolidated compliance reviews.

    (a) General. Consolidated compliance reviews shall be implemented to 
determine employment opportunities on an areawide rather than an 
individual project basis. The consolidated compliance review approach 
shall be adopted and directed by either Headquarters, region, division, 
or SHA, however, consolidated reviews shall at all times remain a 
cooperative effort.
    (b) OFCCP policy requires contracting agencies to ensure compliance, 
in hometown an imposed plan areas, on an areawide rather than a project 
basis. The consolidated compliance review approach facilitates 
implementation of this policy.
    (c) Methodology--(1) Selection of a target area. In identifying the 
target area of a consolidated compliance review (e.g. SMSA, hometown or 
imposed plan area, a multicounty area, or an entire State), 
consideration shall at least be given to the following facts:
    (i) Minority and female work force concentrations;
    (ii) Suspected or alleged discrimination in union membership or 
referral practices by local unions involved in highway construction;
    (iii) Present or potential problem areas;
    (iv) The number of highway projects in the target area; and
    (v) Hometown or imposed plan reports that indicate underutilization 
of minorities or females.
    (2) Determine the review period. After the target area has been 
selected, the dates for the actual onsite reviews shall be established.
    (3) Obtain background information. EEO-3's Local Union Reports, 
should be obtained from regional offices of the EEOC. Target area 
civilian labor force statistics providing percent minorities and percent 
females in the target area shall be obtained from State employment 
security agencies or similar State agencies.
    (4) Identify contractors. Every nonexempt federally assisted or 
direct Federal contractor and subcontractor in the target area shall be 
identified. In order to establish areawide employment patterns in the 
target area, employment data is needed for all contractors and 
subcontractors in the area. However, only those contractors with 
significant work forces (working prior to peak and not recently 
reviewed) may need to be actually reviwed onsite. Accordingly, once all 
contractors are identified, those contractors which will actually be 
reviewed onsite shall be determined. Compliance determinations shall 
only reflect the status of crafts covered by part II of plan bid 
conditions. Employment data of crafts covered by part I of plan bid 
conditions shall be gathered and identified as such in the composite 
report, however, OFCCP has reserved the responsibility for compliance 
determinations on crafts covered by part I of the plan bid conditions.
    (5) Contractor notification. Those contractors selected for onsite 
review shall be sent a notification letter as outlined in Sec. 
230.409(c) along with a request for current workforce data \2\ for 
completion

[[Page 68]]

and submission at the onsite review. Those contractors in the target 
area not selected for onsite review shall also be requested to supply 
current workforce data as of the onsite review period, and shall return 
the data within 15 days following the onsite review period.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ The Consolidated Workforce Questionnaire is convenient for the 
purpose and appears as attachment 4 to volume 2, chapter 2, section 3 of 
the Federal-Aid Highway Program Manual, which is available at the 
offices listed in 49 CFR part 7, appendix D.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (6) Onsite reviews. Compliance reviews shall then be conducted in 
accordance with the requirements set forth in Sec. 230.409. Reviewers 
may use Form FHWA-86, Compliance Data Report, if appropriate. It is of 
particular importance during the onsite reviews that the review team 
provide for adequate coordination of activities at every stage of the 
review process.
    (7) Compliance determinations. Upon completion of the consolidated 
reviews, compliance determinations shall be made on each review by the 
reviewer. Individual show cause notices or compliance notifications 
shall be sent (as appropriate) to each reviewed contractor.

The compliance determination shall be based on the contractor's target 
area work force (Federal, Federal-aid and non-Federal), except when the 
target area is coincidental with hometown plan area, compliance 
determinations must not be based on that part of a contractor's work 
force covered by part I of the plan bid conditions, as previously set 
forth in this regulation. For example: ABC Contracting, Inc. employs 
carpenters, operating engineers, and cement masons. Carpenters and 
operating engineers are covered by part II of the plan bid conditions, 
however, cement masons are covered by part I of the plan bid conditions. 
The compliance determination must be based only on the contractor's 
utilization of carpenters and operating engineers.
    (d) Reporting--(1) Composite report. A final composite report shall 
be submitted as a complete package to the Washington Headquarters, OCR, 
within 45 days after the review period and shall consist of the 
following:
    (i) Compliance review report, for each contractor and subcontractor 
with accompanying show cause notice or compliance notification.
    (ii) Work force data to show the aggregate employment of all 
contractors in the target area.
    (iii) A narrative summary of findings and recommendations to include 
the following:
    (A) A summary of highway construction employment in the target area 
by craft, race, and sex. This summary should explore possible patterns 
of discrimination or underutilization and possible causes, and should 
compare the utilization of minorities and females on contractor's work 
forces to the civilian labor force percent for minorities and females in 
the target area.
    (B) If the target area is a plan area, a narrative summary of the 
plan's effectiveness with an identification of part I and part II 
crafts. This summary shall discuss possible differences in minority and 
female utilization between part I and part II crafts, documenting any 
inferences drawn from such comparisons.
    (C) If applicable, discuss local labor unions' membership and/or 
referral practices that impact on the utilization of minorities and 
females in the target area. Complete and current copies of all 
collective bargaining agreements and copies of EEO-3, Local Union 
Reports, for all appropriate unions shall accompany the composite 
report.
    (D) Any other appropriate data, analyses, or information deemed 
necessary for a complete picture of the areawide employment.
    (E) Considering the information compiled from the summaries listed 
above, make concrete recommendations on possible avenues for correcting 
problems uncovered by the analyses.
    (2) Annual planning report. The proper execution of consolidated 
compliance reviews necessitates scheduling, along with other fiscal 
program planning. The Washington Headquarters, OCR, shall be notified of 
all planned consolidated reviews by August 10 of each year and of any 
changes in the target area or review periods, as they become known. The 
annual consolidated planning report shall indicate:
    (i) Selected target areas:

[[Page 69]]

    (ii) The basis for selection of each area; and
    (iii) The anticipated review period (dates) for each target area.

   Sec. Appendix A to Subpart D of Part 230--Sample Show Cause Notice

Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested
Date
Contractor's Name
Address
City, State, and Zip Code.

    Dear Contractor: As a result of the review of your (Project Number) 
project located at (Project Location) conducted on (Date) by (Reviewing 
Agency), it is our determination that you are not in compliance with 
your equal opportunity requirements and that good faith efforts have not 
been made to meet your equal opportunity requirements in the following 
areas:
    List of Deficiencies
    1.
    2.
    3.

    Your failure to take the contractually required affirmative action 
has contributed to the unacceptable level of minority and female 
employment in your operations, particularly in the semiskilled and 
skilled categories of employees.
    The Department of Labor regulations (41 CFR 60) implementing 
Executive Order 11246, as amended, are applicable to your Federal-aid 
highway construction contract and are controlling in this matter (see 
Required Contract Provisions, Form PR-1273, Clause II). Section 60-
1.20(b) of these regulations provides that when equal opportunity 
deficiencies exist, it is necessary that you make a commitment in 
writing to correct such deficiencies before you may be found in 
compliance. The commitment must include the specific action which you 
propose to take to correct each deficiency and the date of completion of 
such action. The time period allotted shall be no longer than the 
minimum period necessary to effect the necessary correction. In 
accordance with instructions issued by the Office of Federal Contract 
Compliance Programs (OFCCP), U.S. Department of Labor, your written 
commitment must also provide for the submission of monthly progress 
reports which shall include a head count of minority and female 
representation at each level of each trade and a list of minority 
employees.
    You are specifically advised that making the commitment discussed 
above will not preclude a further determination of noncompliance upon a 
finding that the commitment is not sufficient to achieve compliance.
    We will hold a compliance conference at ----------------(Address) at 
---------------- (Time) on ----------------(Date) for you to submit and 
discuss your written commitment. If your written commitment is 
acceptable and if the commitment is sufficient to achieve compliance, 
you will be found in compliance during the effective implementation of 
that commitment. You are cautioned, however, that our determination is 
subject to review by the Federal Highway Administration, the Department 
of Transportation, and OFCCP and may be disapproved if your written 
commitment is not considered sufficient to achieve compliance.
    If you indicate either directly or by inaction that you do not wish 
to participate in the scheduled conference and do not otherwise show 
cause within 30 days from receipt of this notice why enforcement 
proceedings should not be instituted, this agency will commence 
enforcement proceedings under Executive Order 11246, as amended.
    If your written commitment is accepted and it is subsequently found 
that you have failed to comply with its provisions, you will be advised 
of this determination and formal sanction proceedings will be instituted 
immediately.
    In the event formal sanction proceedings are instituted and the 
final determination is that a violation of your equal opportunity 
contract requirements has taken place, any Federal-aid highway 
construction contracts or subcontracts which you hold may be canceled, 
terminated, or suspended, and you may be debarred from further such 
contracts or subcontracts. Such other sanctions as are authorized by 
Executive Order 11246, as amended, may also be imposed.
    We encourage you to take whatever action is necessary to resolve 
this matter and are anxious to assist you in achieving compliance. Any 
questions concerning this notice should be addressed to (Name, Address, 
and Phone).
Sincerely yours,

[41 FR 34245, Aug. 13, 1976]

 Sec. Appendix B to Subpart D of Part 230--Sample Corrective Action Plan

    Deficiency 1: Sources likely to yield minority employees have not 
been contacted for recruitment purposes.
    Commitment: We have developed a system of written job applications 
at our home office which readily identifies minority applicants. In 
addition to this, as a minimum, we will contact the National Association 
for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), League of Latin American 
Citizens (LULAC), Urban League, and the Employment Security Office 
within 20 days to establish a referral system for minority group 
applicants and expand our recruitment base. We are in the process of 
identifying other community organizations and associations that may be 
able to provide minority applicants and will

[[Page 70]]

submit an updated listing of recruitment sources and evidence of contact 
by ----------------(Date).
    Deficiency 2: There have been inadequate efforts to locate, qualify, 
and increase skills of minority and female employees and applicants for 
employment.
    Commitment: We will set up an individual file for each apprentice or 
trainee by ------------(Date) in order to carefully screen the progress, 
ensure that they are receiving the necessary training, and being 
promoted promptly upon completion of training requirements. We have 
established a goal of at least 50 percent of our apprentices and 
trainees will be minorities and 15 percent will be female. In addition 
to the commitment made to deficiency number 1, we will conduct a similar 
identification of organizations able to supply female applicants. Based 
on our projected personnel needs, we expect to have reached our 50 
percent goal for apprentices and trainees by --------------(Date).
    Deficiency 3: Very little effort to assure subcontractors have 
meaningful minority group representation among their employees.
    Commitment: In cooperation with the Regional Office of Minority 
Business Enterprise, Department of Commerce, and the local NAACP, we 
have identified seven minority-owned contractors that may be able to 
work on future contracts we may receive. These contractors (identified 
in the attached list) will be contacted prior to our bidding on all 
future contracts. In addition, we have scheduled a meeting with all 
subcontractors currently working on our contracts. This meeting will be

<R05>
Sec. 260.107  Eligibility.

    (a) Prior recipients of FHWA scholarships or fellowships are 
eligible if they will have completed all specific work commitments 
before beginining study under the programs for which applications are 
made.
    (b) Candidates for the fellowship program shall have earned 
bachelor's or comparable college-level degrees prior to beginining 
advanced studies under the program.

acceptance, for study in programs that will enhance their contributions 
to their employers. Evidence of probable acceptance may be a letter from 
the department chairman or other school official.
    (d) Candidates shall agree to pursue certain minimum study loads as 
determined by the FHWA and designated in the FHWA notices announcing the 
programs each year.
    (e) FHWA employees who receive awards will be required to execute 
continued service agreements, consistent with the Government Employees 
Training Act requirements, which obligate the employees to continue to 
work for the agency for three times the duration of the training 
received.
    (f) Candidates who are students or employees of State or local 
highway/transportation agencies shall agree in writing to work on a 
full-time basis in public service with State or local highway/
transportation agencies for a specified period of time after completing 
study under the program. The FHWA notices announcing the programs each

leave that will affect the acceptance of awards by recipients should be 
made at the earliest possible date to provide adequate time for the FHWA 
to select alternates to replace candidates that decline their awards.
    (c) Agencies are responsible for negotiations with their candidates 
concerning conditions of reinstatement and the candidates' commitments 
to return to work.
    (d) Employing agencies are encouraged to publicize the availability 
of these grants throughout the agencies, to implement procedures for 
internal evaluation of applications, and to forward the applications to 
the FHWA division office in their State.
    (e) Employing agencies that choose to process their employees' 
applications are responsible for observing the cutoff date for the FHWA 
to receive applications. This date will be stipulated in the Notices 
announcing the program for each academic year.


<R05>
Sec. 260.115  Equal opportunity.

    (a) If the FHWA determines that planning activities of national 
significance, identified in paragraph (b) of this section, and the 
requirements of 23 U.S.C. 134, 135, 303, and 505 are being adequately 
addressed, the FHWA will allow State DOTs and MPOs:
    (1) Maximum possible flexibility in the use of FHWA planning and 
research funds to meet highway and local public transportation planning 
and RD&T needs at the national, State, and local levels while ensuring 
legal use of such funds and avoiding unnecessary duplication of efforts; 
and
    (2) To determine which eligible planning and RD&T activities they 
desire

[[Page 80]]

to support with FHWA planning and research funds and at what funding 
level.
    (b) The State DOTs must provide data that support the FHWA's 
responsibilities to the Congress and to the public. These data include, 
but are not limited to, information required for: preparing proposed 
legislation and reports to the Congress; evaluating the extent, 
performance, condition, and use of the Nation's transportation systems; 
analyzing existing and proposed Federal-aid funding methods and levels 
and the assignment of user cost responsibility; maintaining a critical 
information base on fuel availability, use, and revenues generated; and 
calculating apportionment factors.
    (c) The policy in paragraph (a) of this section does not remove the 
FHWA's responsibility and authority to determine which activities are 
eligible for funding. Activities proposed to be funded with FHWA 
planning and research funds by the State DOTs and their subrecipients 
shall be documented and submitted for FHWA approval and authorization as 
prescribed in Sec. Sec. 420.111 and 420.113. (The information 
collection requirements in paragraph (b) of Sec. 420.105 have been 
approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under control

<R05>
Sec. 420.107  What is the minimum required expenditure of State 

planning and research funds for research development and technology transfer?

    (a) A State DOT must expend no less than 25 percent of its annual 
SPR funds on RD&T activities relating to highway, public transportation, 
and intermodal transportation systems in accordance with the provisions 
of 23 U.S.C. 505(b), unless a State DOT certifies, and the FHWA accepts 
the State DOT's certification, that total expenditures by the State DOT 
during the fiscal year for transportation planning under 23 U.S.C. 134 
and 135 will exceed 75 percent of the amount apportioned for the fiscal 
year.
    (b) Prior to submitting a request for an exception to the 25 percent 
requirement, the State DOT must ensure that:
    (1) The additional planning activities are essential, and there are 
no other reasonable options available for funding these planning 
activities (including the use of NHS, STP, MG, or FTA State planning and 
research funds (49 U.S.C. 5313(b)) or by deferment of lower priority 
planning activities);
    (2) The planning activities have a higher priority than RD&T 
activities in the overall needs of the State DOT for a given fiscal 
year; and
    (3) The total level of effort by the State DOT in RD&T (using both 
Federal and State funds) is adequate.
    (c) If the State DOT chooses to pursue an exception, it must send 
the request, along with supporting justification, to the FHWA Division 
Administrator for action by the FHWA Associate Administrator for 
Research, Development, and Technology. The Associate Administrator's 
decision will be based upon the following considerations:
    (1) Whether the State DOT has a process for identifying RD&T needs 
and for implementing a viable RD&T program.
    (2) Whether the State DOT is contributing to cooperative RD&T 
programs or activities, such as the National Cooperative Highway 
Research Program, the Transportation Research Board, and transportation 
pooled fund studies.
    (3) Whether the State DOT is using SPR funds for technology transfer 
and for transit or intermodal research and development to help meet the 
25 percent minimum requirement.
    (4) Whether the State DOT can demonstrate that it will meet the 
requirement or substantially increase its RD&T expenditures over a 
multi-year period, if an exception is granted for the fiscal year.
    (5) Whether Federal funds needed for planning exceed the 75 percent 
limit for the fiscal year and whether any unused planning funds are 
available from previous fiscal years.
    (d) If the FHWA Associate Administrator for Research, Development, 
and Technology approves the State DOT's request for an exception, the 
exception is valid only for that fiscal year's funds. A new request must 
be submitted and approved for subsequent fiscal year funds.

[[Page 81]]


<R05>
Sec. 420.109  What are the requirements for distribution of metropolitan planning funds?

    (a) The State DOTs shall make all PL funds authorized by 23 U.S.C. 
104(f) available to the MPOs in accordance with a formula developed by 
the State DOT, in consultation with the MPOs, and approved by the FHWA 
Division Administrator. The formula may allow for a portion of the PL 
funds to be used by the State DOT, or other agency agreed to by the 
State DOT and the MPOs, for activities that benefit all MPOs in the 
State, but State DOTs shall not use any PL funds for grant or subgrant 
administration. The formula may also provide for a portion of the funds 
to be made available for discretionary grants to MPOs to supplement 
their annual amount received under the distribution formula.
    (b) In developing the formula for distributing PL funds, the State 
DOT shall consider population, status of planning, attainment of air 
quality standards, metropolitan area transportation needs, and other 
factors necessary to provide for an appropriate distribution of funds to 
carry out the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 134 and other applicable 
requirements of Federal law.
    (c) The State DOTs shall inform the MPOs and the FHWA Division 
Office of the amounts allocated to each MPO as soon as possible after PL 
funds have been apportioned by the FHWA to the State DOTs.
    (d) If the State DOT, in a State receiving the minimum apportionment 
of PL funds under the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 104(f)(2), determines that 
the share of funds to be allocated to any MPO results in the MPO 
receiving more funds than necessary to carry out the provisions of 23 
U.S.C. 134, the State DOT may, after considering the views of the 
affected MPO(s) and with the approval of the FHWA Division 
Administrator, use those funds for transportation planning outside of 
metropolitan planning areas.
    (e) In accordance with the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 134(n), any PL 
funds not needed for carrying out the metropolitan planning provisions 
of 23 U.S.C. 134 in any State may be made available by the MPO(s) to the 
State DOT for funding statewide planning activities under 23 U.S.C. 135, 
subject to approval by the FHWA Division Administrator.
    (f) Any State PL fund distribution formula that does not meet the 
requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall be brought 
into conformance with those requirements before distribution on any new 
apportionment of PL funds.

Sec. 420.111  What are the documentation requirements for use of FHWA planning and research funds?

    (a) Proposed use of FHWA planning and research funds must be 
documented by the State DOTs and subrecipients in a work program, or 
other document that describes the work to be accomplished, that is 
acceptable to the FHWA Division Administrator. Statewide, metropolitan, 
other transportation planning activities, and transportation RD&T 
activities may be documented in separate programs, paired in various 
combinations, or brought together as a single work program. The 
expenditure of PL funds for transportation planning outside of 
metropolitan planning areas under Sec. 420.109(d) may be included in 
the work program for statewide transportation planning activities or in 
a separate work program submitted by the State DOT.
    (b)(1) A work program(s) for transportation planning activities must 
include a description of work to be accomplished and cost estimates by 
activity or task. In addition, each work program must include a summary 
that shows:
    (i) Federal share by type of fund;
    (ii) Matching rate by type of fund;
    (iii) State and/or local matching share; and
    (iv) Other State or local funds.
    (2) Additional information on metropolitan planning area work 
programs is contained in 23 CFR part 450. Additional information on RD&T 
work program content and format is contained in subpart B of this part.
    (c) In areas not designated as TMAs, a simplified statement of work 
that describes who will perform the work and the work that will be 
accomplished using Federal funds may be used in lieu of a work program. 
If a simplified statement of work is used, it may be

[[Page 82]]

submitted separately or as part of the Statewide planning work program.
    (d) The State DOTs that use separate Federal-aid projects in 
accordance with paragraph (a) of this section must submit an overall 
summary that identifies the amounts and sources of FHWA planning and 
research funds available, matching funds, and the amounts budgeted for 
each activity (e.g., statewide planning, RD&T, each metropolitan area, 
contributions to NCHRP and transportation pooled fund studies, etc.).
    (e) The State DOTs and MPOs also are encouraged to include cost 
estimates for transportation planning, research, development, and 
technology transfer related activities funded with other Federal or 
State and/or local funds; particularly for producing the FHWA-required 
data specified in paragraph (b) of Sec. 420.105, for planning for other 
transportation modes, and for air quality planning activities in areas 
designated as non-attainment for transportation-related pollutants in 
their work programs. The MPOs in TMAs must include such information in 
their work programs. (The information collection requirements in 
Sec. Sec. 420.111 have been approved by the OMB and assigned control 
numbers 2125-0039 for States and 2132-0529 for MPOs.)


<R05>
Sec. 420.113  What costs are eligible?

    (a) Costs will be eligible for FHWA participation provided that the 
costs:
    (1) Are for work performed for activities eligible under the section 
of title 23, U.S.C., applicable to the class of funds used for the 
activities;
    (2) Are verifiable from the State DOT's or the subrecipient's 
records;
    (3) Are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient 
accomplishment of project objectives and meet the other criteria for 
allowable costs in the applicable cost principles cited in 49 CFR 18.22;
    (4) Are included in the approved budget, or amendment thereto; and
    (5) Were not incurred prior to FHWA authorization.
    (b) Indirect costs of State DOTs and their subrecipients are 
allowable if supported by a cost allocation plan and indirect cost 
proposal prepared, submitted (if required), and approved by the 
cognizant or oversight agency in accordance with the OMB requirements 
applicable to the State DOT or subrecipient specified in 49 CFR 
18.22(b).


<R05>
Sec. 420.115  What are the FHWA approval and authorization requirements?

    (a) The State DOT and its subrecipients must obtain approval and 
authorization to proceed prior to beginning work on activities to be 
undertaken with FHWA planning and research funds. Such approvals and 
authorizations should be based on final work programs or other documents 
that describe the work to be performed. The State DOT and its 
subrecipients also must obtain prior approval for budget and 
programmatic changes as specified in 49 CFR 18.30 or 49 CFR 19.25 and 
for those items of allowable costs which require approval in accordance 
with the cost principles specified in 49 CFR 18.22(b) applicable to the 
entity expending the funds.
    (b) Authorization to proceed with the FHWA funded work in whole or 
in part is a contractual obligation of the Federal government pursuant 
to 23 U.S.C. 106 and requires that appropriate funds be available for 
the full Federal share of the cost of work authorized. Those State DOTs 
that do not have sufficient FHWA planning and research funds or 
obligation authority available to obligate the full Federal share of a 
work program or project may utilize the advance construction provisions 
of 23 U.S.C. 115(a) in accordance with the requirements of 23 CFR part 
630, subpart G. The State DOTs that do not meet the advance construction 
provisions, or do not wish to utilize them, may request authorization to 
proceed with that portion of the work for which FHWA planning and 
research funds are available. In the latter case, authorization to 
proceed may be given for either selected work activities or for a 
portion of the program period, but such authorization does not 
constitute a commitment by the FHWA to fund the remaining portion of the 
work if additional funds do become available.
    (c) A project agreement must be executed by the State DOT and the 
FHWA Division Office for each statewide transportation planning, 
metropolitan

[[Page 83]]

planning area, or RD&T work program, individual activity or study, or 
any combination administered as a single Federal-aid project. The 
project agreement may be executed concurrent with or after authorization 
has been given by the FHWA Division Administrator to proceed with the 
work in whole or in part. In the event that the project agreement is 
executed for only part of the work, the project agreement must be 
amended when authorization is given to proceed with additional work.

(The information collection requirements in Sec. 420.115(c) have been 
approved by the OMB and assigned control numbers 2125-0529)


<R05>
Sec. 420.117  What are the program monitoring and reporting requirements?

    (a) In accordance with 49 CFR 18.40, the State DOT shall monitor all 
activities performed by its staff or by subrecipients with FHWA planning 
and research funds to assure that the work is being managed and 
performed satisfactorily and that time schedules are being met.
    (b)(1) The State DOT must submit performance and expenditure 
reports, including a report from each subrecipient, that contain as a 
minimum:
    (i) Comparison of actual performance with established goals;
    (ii) Progress in meeting schedules;
    (iii) Status of expenditures in a format compatible with the work 
program, including a comparison of budgeted (approved) amounts and 
actual costs incurred;
    (iv) Cost overruns or underruns;
    (v) Approved work program revisions; and
    (vi) Other pertinent supporting data.
    (2) Additional information on reporting requirements for individual 
RD&T studies is contained in subpart B of this part.
    (c) Reports required by paragraph (b) of this section shall be 
annual unless more frequent reporting is determined to be necessary by 
the FHWA Division Administrator. The FHWA may not require more frequent 
than quarterly reporting unless the criteria in 49 CFR 18.12 or 49 CFR 
19.14 are met. Reports are due 90 days after the end of the reporting 
period for annual and final reports and no later than 30 days after the 
end of the reporting period for other reports.
    (d) Events that have significant impact on the work must be reported 
as soon as they become known. The types of events or conditions that 
require reporting include: problems, delays, or adverse conditions that 
will materially affect the ability to attain program objectives. This 
disclosure must be accompanied by a statement of the action taken, or 
contemplated, and any Federal assistance needed to resolve the 
situation.
    (e) Suitable reports that document the results of activities 
performed with FHWA planning and research funds must be prepared by the 
State DOT or subrecipient and submitted for approval by the FHWA 
Division Administrator prior to publication. The FHWA Division 
Administrator may waive this requirement for prior approval. The FHWA's 
approval of reports constitutes acceptance of such reports as evidence 
of work performed but does not imply endorsement of a report's findings 
or recommendations. Reports prepared for FHWA-funded work must include 
appropriate credit references and disclaimer statements. (The 
information collection requirements in Sec. 420.117 have been approved 
by the OMB and assigned control numbers 2125-0039 for States and 2132-
0529 for MPOs.)


<R05>
Sec. 420.119  What are the fiscal requirements?

    (a) The maximum rate of Federal participation for FHWA planning and 
research funds shall be as prescribed in title 23, U.S.C., for the 
specific class of funds used (i.e., SPR, PL, NHS, STP, or MG) except as 
specified in paragraph (d) of this section. The provisions of 49 CFR 
18.24 or 49 CFR 19.23 are applicable to any necessary matching of FHWA 
planning and research funds.
    (b) The value of third party in-kind contributions may be accepted 
as the match for FHWA planning and research funds, in accordance with 
the provisions of 49 CFR 18.24(a)(2) or 49 CFR 19.23(a) and may be on 
either a total planning work program basis or for specific line items or 
projects. The use of third party in-kind contributions must be 
identified in the original work program/scope of work and the grant/

[[Page 84]]

subgrant agreement, or amendments thereto. The use of third-party in-
kind contributions must be approved in advance by the FHWA Division 
Administrator and may not be made retroactive prior to approval of the 
work program/scope of work or an amendment thereto. The State DOT or 
subrecipient is responsible for ensuring that the following additional 
criteria are met:
    (1) The third party performing the work agrees to allow the value of 
the work to be used as the match;
    (2) The cost of the third party work is not paid for by other 
Federal funds or used as a match for other federally funded grants/
subgrants;
    (3) The work performed by the third party is an eligible 
transportation planning or RD&T related activity that benefits the 
federally funded work;
    (4) The third party costs (i.e., salaries, fringe benefits, etc.) 
are allowable under the applicable Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 
cost principles (i.e., OMB Circular A-21, A-87, or A-122);\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ OMB Circulars are available on the Internet at http://
www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/index.html.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (5) The third party work is performed during the period to which the 
matching requirement applies;
    (6) The third party in-kind contributions are verifiable from the 
records of the State DOT or subrecipient and these records show how the 
value placed on third party in-kind contributions was derived; and
    (7) If the total amount of third party expenditures at the end of 
the program period is not sufficient to match the total expenditure of 
Federal funds by the recipient/subrecipient, the recipient/subrecipient 
will need to make up any shortfall with its own funds.
    (c) In accordance with the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 120(j), toll 
revenues that are generated and used by public, quasi-public, and 
private agencies to build, improve, or maintain highways, bridges, or 
tunnels that serve the public purpose of interstate commerce may be used 
as a credit for the non-Federal share of an FHWA planning and research 
funded project.
    (d) In accordance with 23 U.S.C. 505(c) or 23 U.S.C. 104(f)(3), the 
requirement for matching SPR or PL funds may be waived if the FHWA 
determines the interests of the Federal-aid highway program would be 
best served. Waiver of the matching requirement is intended to encourage 
State DOTs and/or MPOs to pool SPR and/or PL funds to address national 
or regional high priority planning or RD&T problems that would benefit 
multiple States and/or MPOs. Requests for waiver of matching 
requirements must be submitted to the FHWA headquarters office for 
approval by the Associate Administrator for Planning and Environment 
(for planning activities) or the Associate Administrator for Research, 
Development, and Technology (for RD&T activities). The matching 
requirement may not be waived for NHS, STP, or MG funds.
    (e) NHS, STP, or MG funds used for eligible planning and RD&T 
purposes must be identified separately from SPR or PL funds in the work 
program(s) and must be administered and accounted for separately for 
fiscal purposes. In accordance with the statewide and metropolitan 
planning process requirements for fiscally constrained transportation 
improvement program (TIPs) planning or RD&T activities funded with NHS, 
STP, or MG funds must be included in the Statewide and/or metropolitan 
TIP(s) unless the State DOT and MPO (for a metropolitan area) agree that 
they may be excluded from the TIP.
    (f) Payment shall be made in accordance with the provisions of 49 
CFR 18.21 or 49 CFR 19.22.


<R05>
Sec. 420.121  What other requirements apply to the administration of FHWA planning and research funds?

    (a) Audits. Audits of the State DOTs and their subrecipients shall 
be performed in accordance with OMB Circular A-133, Audits of States, 
Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations. \2\ Audits of for-
profit contractors are to be performed in accordance with State DOT or

Sec. 420.205  What is the FHWA's policy for research, development, and technology transfer funding?

    (a) It is the FHWA's policy to administer the RD&T program 
activities utilizing FHWA planning and research funds consistent with 
the policy specified in Sec. 420.105 and the following general 
principles in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section.
    (b) The State DOTs must provide information necessary for peer 
exchanges.
    (c) The State DOTs are encouraged to develop, establish, and 
implement an RD&T program, funded with Federal and State DOT resources 
that anticipates and addresses transportation concerns before they 
become critical problems. Further, the State DOTs are encouraged to 
include in this program development and technology transfer programs to 
share the results of their own research efforts and promote the use of 
new technology.
    (d) To promote effective use of available resources, the State DOTs 
are encouraged to cooperate with other State DOTs, the FHWA, and other 
appropriate agencies to achieve RD&T objectives established at the 
national level and to develop a technology transfer program to promote 
and use those results. This includes contributing to cooperative RD&T 
programs such as the NCHRP, the TRB, and transportation pooled fund 
studies as a means of addressing national and regional issues and as a 
means of leveraging funds.
    (e) The State DOTs will be allowed the authority and flexibility to 
manage and direct their RD&T activities as presented in their work 
programs, and to initiate RD&T activities supported by FHWA planning and 
research funds, subject to the limitation of Federal funds and to 
compliance with program conditions set forth in subpart A of this part 
and Sec. 420.207.
    (f) The State DOTs will have primary responsibility for managing 
RD&T activities supported with FHWA planning and research funds carried 
out by other State agencies and organizations and for ensuring that such 
funds are expended for purposes consistent with this subpart.
    (g) Each State DOT must develop, establish, and implement a 
management process that ensures effective use of available FHWA planning 
and research funds for RD&T activities on a statewide basis. Each State 
DOT is permitted to tailor its management process to meet State or local 
needs; however, the process must comply with the minimum requirements 
and conditions of this subpart.
    (h) The State DOTs are encouraged to make effective use of the FHWA 
Division, Resource Center, and Headquarters office expertise in 
developing and carrying out their RD&T activities. Participation of the 
FHWA on advisory panels and in program exchange meetings is encouraged.

Sec. 420.207  What are the requirements for research, development, and technology transfer work programs?

    (a) The State DOT's RD&T work program must, as a minimum, consist of 
a description of RD&T activities to be accomplished during the program 
period, estimated costs for each eligible

[[Page 88]]

activity, and a description of any cooperative activities including the 
State DOT's participation in any transportation pooled fund studies and 
the NCHRP. The State DOT's work program should include a list of the 
major items with a cost estimate for each item. The work program should 
also include any study funded under a previous work program until a 
final report has been completed for the study.
    (b) The State DOT's RD&T work program must include financial 
summaries showing the funding levels and share (Federal, State, and 
other sources) for RD&T activities for the program year. State DOTs are 
encouraged to include any activity funded 100 percent with State or 
other funds for information purposes.
    (c) Approval and authorization procedures in Sec. 420.115 are 
applicable to the State DOT's RD&T work program.

a management process that identifies and results in implementation of 
RD&T activities expected to address high priority transportation issues. 
The management process must include:
    (1) An interactive process for identification and prioritization of 
RD&T activities for inclusion in an RD&T work program;
    (2) Use of all FHWA planning and research funds set aside for RD&T 
activities, either internally or for participation in transportation 
pooled fund studies or other cooperative RD&T programs, to the maximum 
extent possible;
    (3) Procedures for tracking program activities, schedules, 
accomplishments, and fiscal commitments;
    (4) Support and use of the TRIS database for program development, 
reporting of active RD&T activities, and input of the final report 
information;
    (5) Procedures to determine the effectiveness of the State DOT's 
management process in implementing the RD&T program, to determine the 
utilization of the State DOT's RD&T outputs, and to facilitate peer 
exchanges of its RD&T Program on a periodic basis;
    (6) Procedures for documenting RD&T activities through the 
preparation of final reports. As a minimum, the documentation must 
include the data collected, analyses performed, conclusions, and 
recommendations. The State DOT must actively implement appropriate 
research findings and should document benefits; and
    (7) Participation in peer exchanges of its RD&T management process 
and of other State DOTs' programs on a periodic basis. To assist peer 
exchange teams in conducting an effective exchange, the State DOT must 
provide to them the information and documentation required to be 
collected and maintained under this subpart. Travel and other costs 
associated with the State DOT's peer exchange may be identified as a 
line item in the State DOT's work program and will be eligible for 100 
percent Federal funding. The peer exchange team must prepare a written 
report of the exchange.
    (b) Documentation that describes the State DOT's management process 
and the procedures for selecting and implementing RD&T activities must 
be developed by the State DOT and submitted to the FHWA Division office 
for approval. Significant changes in the management process also must be 
submitted by the State DOT to the FHWA for approval. The State DOT must 
make the documentation available, as necessary, to facilitate peer 
exchanges.
    (c) The State DOT must include a certification that it is in full 
compliance with the requirements of this subpart in each RD&T work 
program. If the State DOT is unable to certify full compliance, the FHWA 
Division Administrator may grant conditional approval of the State DOT's 
work program. A conditional approval must cite those areas of the State 
DOT's management process that are deficient and require that the 
deficiencies be corrected within 6 months of conditional approval. The 
certification must consist of a statement signed by the Administrator, 
or an official designated by the Administrator, of the State DOT 
certifying as follows: ``I (name of certifying official), (position 
title), of the State (Commonwealth) of --------, do hereby

[[Page 89]]

certify that the State (Commonwealth) is in compliance with all 
requirements of 23 U.S.C. 505 and its implementing regulations with 
respect to the research, development, and technology transfer program, 
and contemplate no changes in statutes, regulations, or administrative 
procedures which would affect such compliance.''
    (d) The FHWA Division Administrator shall periodically review the 
State DOT's management process to determine if the State is in 
compliance with the requirements of this subpart. If the Division 
Administrator determines that a State DOT is not complying with the 
requirements of this subpart, or is not performing in accordance with 
its RD&T management process, the FHWA Division Administrator shall issue 
a written notice of proposed determination of noncompliance to the State 
DOT. The notice will set forth the reasons for the proposed 
determination and inform the State DOT that it may reply in writing 
within 30 calendar days from the date of the notice. The State DOT's 
reply should address the deficiencies cited in the notice and provide 
documentation as necessary. If the State DOT and the Division 
Administrator cannot resolve the differences set forth in the 
determination of nonconformity, the State DOT may appeal to the Federal 
Highway Administrator whose action shall constitute the final decision 
of the FHWA. An adverse decision shall result in immediate withdrawal of 
approval of FHWA planning and research funds for the State DOT's RD&T 
activities until the State DOT is in full compliance.

(The information collection requirements in Sec. 420.209 have been 
approved by the OMB and assigned control number 2125-0039)

<R04>
      Subpart A_Transportation Planning and Programming Definitions


<R05>
Sec. 450.100  Purpose.

    The purpose of this subpart is to provide definitions for terms used 
in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 450.102  Applicability.

    The definitions in this subpart are applicable to this part, except 
as otherwise provided.


<R05>
Sec. 450.104  Definitions.

    Unless otherwise specified, the definitions in 23 U.S.C. 101(a) and 
49 U.S.C. 5302 are applicable to this part.
    Administrative modification means a minor revision to a long-range 
statewide or metropolitan transportation plan, Transportation 
Improvement Program (TIP), or Statewide Transportation Improvement 
Program (STIP) that includes minor changes to project/project phase 
costs, minor changes to funding sources of previously-included projects, 
and minor changes to project/project phase initiation dates. An 
administrative modification is a revision that does not require public 
review and comment, redemonstration of fiscal constraint, or a 
conformity determination (in nonattainment and maintenance areas).
    Alternatives analysis (AA) means a study required for eligibility of 
funding under the Federal Transit Administration's (FTA's) Capital 
Investment Grant program (49 U.S.C. 5309), which includes an assessment 
of a range of alternatives designed to address a transportation problem 
in a corridor or subarea, resulting in sufficient information to support 
selection by State and local officials of a locally preferred 
alternative for adoption into a metropolitan transportation plan, and 
for the Secretary to make decisions to advance the locally preferred 
alternative through the project development process, as set forth in 49 
CFR part 611 (Major Capital Investment Projects).
    Amendment means a revision to a long-range statewide or metropolitan 
transportation plan, TIP, or STIP that involves a major change to a 
project included in a metropolitan transportation plan, TIP, or STIP, 
including the addition or deletion of a project or a major change in 
project cost, project/project phase initiation dates, or a major change 
in design concept or design scope (e.g., changing project termini or the 
number of through traffic lanes). Changes to projects that are included 
only for illustrative purposes do not require an amendment. An amendment 
is a revision that requires public review and comment, redemonstration 
of fiscal constraint, or a conformity determination (for metropolitan 
transportation plans and TIPs involving ``non-exempt'' projects in 
nonattainment and maintenance areas). In the context of a long-range 
statewide transportation plan, an amendment is a revision approved by 
the State in accordance with its public involvement process.
    Attainment area means any geographic area in which levels of a given 
criteria air pollutant (e.g., ozone, carbon monoxide, PM10, PM2.5, and 
nitrogen dioxide) meet the health-based National Ambient Air Quality 
Standards (NAAQS) for that pollutant. An area may be an attainment area 
for one pollutant and a nonattainment area for others. A ``maintenance 
area'' (see definition below) is not considered an attainment area for 
transportation planning purposes.
    Available funds means funds derived from an existing source 
dedicated to or historically used for transportation purposes. For 
Federal funds, authorized and/or appropriated funds and the 
extrapolation of formula and discretionary funds at historic rates of 
increase are considered ``available.'' A similar approach may be used 
for State and local funds that are dedicated to or historically used for 
transportation purposes.
    Committed funds means funds that have been dedicated or obligated 
for transportation purposes. For State funds that are not dedicated to 
transportation purposes, only those funds over which the Governor has 
control

[[Page 91]]

may be considered ``committed.'' Approval of a TIP by the Governor is 
considered a commitment of those funds over which the Governor has 
control. For local or private sources of funds not dedicated to or 
historically used for transportation purposes (including donations of 
property), a commitment in writing (e.g., letter of intent) by the 
responsible official or body having control of the funds may be 
considered a commitment. For projects involving 49 U.S.C. 5309 funding, 
execution of a Full Funding Grant Agreement (or equivalent) or a Project 
Construction Grant Agreement with the USDOT shall be considered a multi-
year commitment of Federal funds.
    Conformity means a Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7506(c)) requirement 
that ensures that Federal funding and approval are given to 
transportation plans, programs and projects that are consistent with the 
air quality goals established by a State Implementation Plan (SIP). 
Conformity, to the purpose of the SIP, means that transportation 
activities will not cause new air quality violations, worsen existing 
violations, or delay timely attainment of the NAAQS. The transportation 
conformity rule (40 CFR part 93) sets forth policy, criteria, and 
procedures for demonstrating and assuring conformity of transportation 
activities.
    Conformity lapse means, pursuant to section 176(c) of the Clean Air 
Act (42 U.S.C. 7506(c)), as amended, that the conformity determination 
for a metropolitan transportation plan or TIP has expired and thus there 
is no currently conforming metropolitan transportation plan or TIP.
    Congestion management process means a systematic approach required 
in transportation management areas (TMAs) that provides for effective 
management and operation, based on a cooperatively developed and 
implemented metropolitan-wide strategy, of new and existing 
transportation facilities eligible for funding under title 23 U.S.C., 
and title 49 U.S.C., through the use of operational management 
strategies.
    Consideration means that one or more parties takes into account the 
opinions, action, and relevant information from other parties in making 
a decision or determining a course of action.
    Consultation means that one or more parties confer with other 
identified parties in accordance with an established process and, prior 
to taking action(s), considers the views of the other parties and 
periodically informs them about action(s) taken. This definition does 
not apply to the ``consultation'' performed by the States and the MPOs 
in comparing the long-range statewide transportation plan and the 
metropolitan transportation plan, respectively, to State and Tribal 
conservation plans or maps or inventories of natural or historic 
resources (see Sec. 450.214(i) and Sec. 450.322(g)(1) and (g)(2)).
    Cooperation means that the parties involved in carrying out the 
transportation planning and programming processes work together to 
achieve a common goal or objective.
    Coordinated public transit-human services transportation plan means 
a locally developed, coordinated transportation plan that identifies the 
transportation needs of individuals with disabilities, older adults, and 
people with low incomes, provides strategies for meeting those local 
needs, and prioritizes transportation services for funding and 
implementation.
    Coordination means the cooperative development of plans, programs, 
and schedules among agencies and entities with legal standing and 
adjustment of such plans, programs, and schedules to achieve general 
consistency, as appropriate.
    Design concept means the type of facility identified for a 
transportation improvement project (e.g., freeway, expressway, arterial 
highway, grade-separated highway, toll road, reserved right-of-way rail 
transit, mixed-traffic rail transit, or busway).
    Design scope means the aspects that will affect the proposed 
facility's impact on the region, usually as they relate to vehicle or 
person carrying capacity and control (e.g., number of lanes or tracks to 
be constructed or added, length of project, signalization, safety 
features, access control including approximate number and location of 
interchanges, or preferential treatment for high-occupancy vehicles).

[[Page 92]]

    Designated recipient means an entity designated, in accordance with 
the planning process under 49 U.S.C. 5303, 5304, and 5306, by the chief 
executive officer of a State, responsible local officials, and publicly-
owned operators of public transportation, to receive and apportion 
amounts under 49 U.S.C. 5336 that are attributable to transportation 
management areas (TMAs) identified under 49 U.S.C. 5303, or a State 
regional authority if the authority is responsible under the laws of a 
State for a capital project and for financing and directly providing 
public transportation.
    Environmental mitigation activities means strategies, policies, 
programs, actions, and activities that, over time, will serve to avoid, 
minimize, or compensate for (by replacing or providing substitute 
resources) the impacts to or disruption of elements of the human and 
natural environment associated with the implementation of a long-range 
statewide transportation plan or metropolitan transportation plan. The 
human and natural environment includes, for example, neighborhoods and 
communities, homes and businesses, cultural resources, parks and 
recreation areas, wetlands and water sources, forested and other natural 
areas, agricultural areas, endangered and threatened species, and the 
ambient air. The environmental mitigation strategies and activities are 
intended to be regional in scope, and may not necessarily address 
potential project-level impacts.
    Federal land management agency means units of the Federal Government 
currently responsible for the administration of public lands (e.g., U.S. 
Forest Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land 
Management, and the National Park Service).
    Federally funded non-emergency transportation services means 
transportation services provided to the general public, including those 
with special transport needs, by public transit, private non-profit 
service providers, and private third-party contractors to public 
agencies.
    Financial plan means documentation required to be included with a 
metropolitan transportation plan and TIP (and optional for the long-
range statewide transportation plan and STIP) that demonstrates the 
consistency between reasonably available and projected sources of 
Federal, State, local, and private revenues and the costs of 
implementing proposed transportation system improvements.
    Financially constrained or Fiscal constraint means that the 
metropolitan transportation plan, TIP, and STIP includes sufficient 
financial information for demonstrating that projects in the 
metropolitan transportation plan, TIP, and STIP can be implemented using 
committed, available, or reasonably available revenue sources, with 
reasonable assurance that the federally supported transportation system 
is being adequately operated and maintained. For the TIP and the STIP, 
financial constraint/fiscal constraint applies to each program year. 
Additionally, projects in air quality nonattainment and maintenance 
areas can be included in the first two years of the TIP and STIP only if 
funds are ``available'' or ``committed.''
    Freight shippers means any business that routinely transports its 
products from one location to another by providers of freight 
transportation services or by its own vehicle fleet.
    Full funding grant agreement means an instrument that defines the 
scope of a project, the Federal financial contribution, and other terms 
and conditions for funding New Starts projects as required by 49 U.S.C. 
5309(d)(1).
    Governor means the Governor of any of the 50 States or the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or the Mayor of the District of Columbia.
    Illustrative project means an additional transportation project that 
may (but is not required to) be included in a financial plan for a 
metropolitan transportation plan, TIP, or STIP if reasonable additional 
resources were to become available.
    Indian Tribal government means a duly formed governing body for an 
Indian or Alaska Native tribe, band, nation, pueblo, village, or 
community that the Secretary of the Interior acknowledges to exist as an 
Indian Tribe pursuant to the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act 
of 1994, Public Law 103-454.

[[Page 93]]

statewide, multimodal, transportation plan covering a period of no less 
than 20 years developed through the statewide transportation planning 
process.
    Maintenance area means any geographic region of the United States 
that the EPA previously designated as a nonattainment area for one or 
more pollutants pursuant to the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and 
subsequently redesignated as an attainment area subject to the 
requirement to develop a maintenance plan under section 175A of the 
Clean Air Act, as amended.
    Management system means a systematic process, designed to assist 
decisionmakers in selecting cost effective strategies/actions to improve 
the efficiency or safety of, and protect the investment in the nation's 
infrastructure. A management system can include: Identification of 
performance measures; data collection and analysis; determination of 
needs; evaluation and selection of appropriate strategies/actions to 
address the needs; and evaluation of the effectiveness of the 
implemented strategies/actions.
    Metropolitan planning area (MPA) means the geographic area 
determined by agreement between the metropolitan planning organization 
(MPO) for the area and the Governor, in which the metropolitan 
transportation planning process is carried out.
    Metropolitan planning organization (MPO) means the policy board of

transportation planning process.
    Metropolitan transportation plan means the official multimodal 
transportation plan addressing no less than a 20-year planning horizon 
that is developed, adopted, and updated by the MPO through the 
metropolitan transportation planning process.
    National ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) means those standards 
established pursuant to section 109 of the Clean Air Act.
    Nonattainment area means any geographic region of the United States 
that has been designated by the EPA as a nonattainment area under

exists.
    Non-metropolitan area means a geographic area outside a designated 
metropolitan planning area.
    Non-metropolitan local officials means elected and appointed 
officials of general purpose local government in a non-metropolitan area 
with responsibility for transportation.
    Obligated projects means strategies and projects funded under title 
23 U.S.C. and title 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53 for which the supporting 
Federal funds were authorized and committed by the State or designated 
recipient in the preceding program year, and authorized by the FHWA or 
awarded as a grant by the FTA.

transportation to the public, but does not include school bus, charter, 
or intercity bus transportation or intercity passenger rail 
transportation provided by Amtrak.
    Regional ITS architecture means a regional framework for ensuring 
institutional agreement and technical integration for the implementation 
of ITS projects or groups of projects.
    Regionally significant project means a transportation project (other 
than projects that may be grouped in the TIP and/or STIP or exempt 
projects as defined in EPA's transportation conformity regulation (40 
CFR part 93)) that is on a facility which serves regional transportation 
needs (such as access to and from the area outside the region; major 
activity centers in the region; major planned developments such as new 
retail malls, sports complexes, or employment centers; or transportation 
terminals) and would normally be included in the modeling of the 
metropolitan area's transportation network. At a minimum, this includes 
all principal arterial highways and all fixed guideway transit 
facilities that offer a significant alternative to regional highway 
travel.
    Revision means a change to a long-range statewide or metropolitan 
transportation plan, TIP, or STIP that occurs between scheduled periodic

either one of the types listed in section 108 of the Clean Air Act or 
any other measure for the purpose of reducing emissions or 
concentrations of air pollutants from transportation sources by reducing 
vehicle use or changing traffic flow or congestion conditions. 
Notwithstanding the above, vehicle technology-based, fuel-based, and 
maintenance-based measures that control the emissions from vehicles 
under fixed traffic conditions are not TCMs.
    Transportation improvement program (TIP) means a prioritized 
listing/program of transportation projects covering a period of four

carry out a continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive statewide 
multimodal transportation planning process, including the development of 
a long-range statewide transportation plan and statewide transportation 
improvement program (STIP), that facilitates the safe and efficient 
management, operation, and development of surface transportation systems 
that will serve the mobility needs of people and freight (including 
accessible pedestrian walkways and bicycle transportation facilities) 
and that fosters economic growth and development within and between 
States and urbanized areas, while minimizing transportation-related fuel 
consumption and air pollution in all areas of the State, including those 
areas subject to the metropolitan transportation planning requirements 
of 23 U.S.C. 134 and 49 U.S.C. 5303.

    (8) Emphasize the preservation of the existing transportation 
system.
    (b) Consideration of the planning factors in paragraph (a) of this 
section shall be reflected, as appropriate, in the statewide 
transportation planning process. The degree of consideration and 
analysis of the factors should be based on the scale and complexity of 
many issues, including transportation systems development, land use, 
employment, economic development, human and natural environment, and 
housing and community development.
    (c) The failure to consider any factor specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section shall not be reviewable by any court under title 23 U.S.C., 
49 U.S.C. Chapter 53, subchapter II of title 5 U.S.C. Chapter 5, or 
title 5 U.S.C Chapter 7 in any matter affecting a long-range statewide 
transportation plan, STIP, project or strategy, or the statewide 
transportation planning process findings.
    (d) Funds provided under 23 U.S.C. 505 and 49 U.S.C. 5305(e) are 
available to the State to accomplish activities in this subpart. At the 
State's option, funds provided under 23 U.S.C. 104(b)(1) and (3) and 105 
and 49 U.S.C. 5307 may also be used. Statewide transportation planning

<R05>
Sec. 450.210  Interested parties, public involvement, and consultation.

    (a) In carrying out the statewide transportation planning process, 
including development of the long-range statewide transportation plan 
and the STIP, the State shall develop and use a documented public 
involvement process that provides opportunities for public review and 
comment at key decision points.
    (1) The State's public involvement process at a minimum shall:
    (i) Establish early and continuous public involvement opportunities 
that provide timely information about transportation issues and 
decisionmaking processes to citizens, affected public agencies, 
representatives of public transportation employees, freight shippers, 
private providers of transportation, representatives of users of public 
transportation, representatives of users of pedestrian walkways and 
bicycle transportation facilities, representatives of the disabled, 
providers of freight transportation services, and other interested 
parties;
    (ii) Provide reasonable public access to technical and policy 
information used in the development of the long-range statewide 
transportation plan and the STIP;
    (iii) Provide adequate public notice of public involvement 
activities and time for public review and comment at key decision

accessing employment and other services; and
    (ix) Provide for the periodic review of the effectiveness of the 
public involvement process to ensure that the process provides full and 
open access to all interested parties and revise the process, as 
appropriate.
    (2) The State shall provide for public comment on existing and 
proposed processes for public involvement in the development of the 
long-range statewide transportation plan and the STIP. At a minimum, the 
State shall allow 45 calendar days for public review and

[[Page 98]]

written comment before the procedures and any major revisions to 
existing procedures are adopted. The State shall provide copies of the 
approved public involvement process document(s) to the FHWA and the FTA 
for informational purposes.
    (b) The State shall provide for non-metropolitan local official 
participation in the development of the long-range statewide 
transportation plan and the STIP. The State shall have a documented 
process(es) for consulting with non-metropolitan local officials 
representing units of general purpose local government and/or local 
officials with responsibility for transportation that is separate and 
discrete from the public involvement process and provides an opportunity 
for their participation in the development of the long-range statewide 
transportation plan and the STIP. Although the FHWA and the FTA shall 
not review or approve this consultation process(es), copies of the 
process document(s) shall be provided to the FHWA and the FTA for 
informational purposes.
    (1) At least once every five years (as of February 24, 2006), the 
State shall review and solicit comments from non-metropolitan local 
officials and other interested parties for a period of not less than 60 
calendar days regarding the effectiveness of the consultation process 
and any proposed changes. A specific request for comments shall be 
directed to the State association of counties, State municipal league, 
regional planning agencies, or directly to non-metropolitan local 
officials.
    (2) The State, at its discretion, shall be responsible for 
determining whether to adopt any proposed changes. If a proposed change 
is not adopted, the State shall make publicly available its reasons for 
not accepting the proposed change, including notification to non-
metropolitan local officials or their associations.
    (c) For each area of the State under the jurisdiction of an Indian 
Tribal government, the State shall develop the long-range statewide 
transportation plan and STIP in consultation with the Tribal government 
and the Secretary of Interior. States shall, to the extent practicable, 
develop a documented process(es) that outlines roles, responsibilities, 
and key decision points for consulting with Indian Tribal governments 
and Federal land management agencies in the development of the long-
range statewide transportation plan and the STIP.


<R05>
Sec. 450.212  Transportation planning studies and project development.

    (a) Pursuant to section 1308 of the Transportation Equity Act for 
the 21st Century, TEA-21 (Pub. L. 105-178), a State(s), MPO(s), or 
public transportation operator(s) may undertake a multimodal, systems-
level corridor or subarea planning study as part of the statewide 
transportation planning process. To the extent practicable, development 
of these transportation planning studies shall involve consultation 
with, or joint efforts among, the State(s), MPO(s), and/or public 
transportation operator(s). The results or decisions of these 
transportation planning studies may be used as part of the overall 
project development process consistent with the National Environmental 
Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and associated 
implementing regulations (23 CFR part 771 and 40 CFR parts 1500-1508). 
Specifically, these corridor or subarea studies may result in producing 
any of the following for a proposed transportation project:
    (1) Purpose and need or goals and objective statement(s);
    (2) General travel corridor and/or general mode(s) definition (e.g., 
highway, transit, or a highway/transit combination);
    (3) Preliminary screening of alternatives and elimination of 
unreasonable alternatives;
    (4) Basic description of the environmental setting; and/or
    (5) Preliminary identification of environmental impacts and 
environmental mitigation.
    (b) Publicly available documents or other source material produced 
by, or in support of, the transportation planning process described in 
this subpart may be incorporated directly or by reference into 
subsequent NEPA documents, in accordance with 40 CFR 1502.21, if:

[[Page 99]]

    (1) The NEPA lead agencies agree that such incorporation will aid in 
establishing or evaluating the purpose and need for the Federal action, 
reasonable alternatives, cumulative or other impacts on the human and 
natural environment, or mitigation of these impacts; and
    (2) The systems-level, corridor, or subarea planning study is 
conducted with:
    (i) Involvement of interested State, local, Tribal, and Federal 
agencies;
    (ii) Public review;
    (iii) Reasonable opportunity to comment during the statewide 
transportation planning process and development of the corridor or 
subarea planning study;
    (iv) Documentation of relevant decisions in a form that is 
identifiable and available for review during the NEPA scoping process 
and can be appended to or referenced in the NEPA document; and
    (v) The review of the FHWA and the FTA, as appropriate.
    (c) By agreement of the NEPA lead agencies, the above integration 
may be accomplished through tiering (as described in 40 CFR 1502.20), 
incorporating the subarea or corridor planning study into the draft 
Environmental Impact Statement or Environmental Assessment, or other 
means that the NEPA lead agencies deem appropriate. Additional 
information to further explain the linkages between the transportation 
planning and project development/NEPA processes is contained in Appendix 
A to this part, including an explanation that is non-binding guidance 
material.


<R05>
Sec. 450.214  Development and content of the long-range statewide transportation plan.

    (a) The State shall develop a long-range statewide transportation 
plan, with a minimum 20-year forecast period at the time of adoption, 
that provides for the development and implementation of the multimodal 
transportation system for the State. The long-range statewide 
transportation plan shall consider and include, as applicable, elements 
and connections between public transportation, non-motorized modes, 
rail, commercial motor vehicle, waterway, and aviation facilities, 
particularly with respect to intercity travel.
    (b) The long-range statewide transportation plan should include 
capital, operations and management strategies, investments, procedures, 
and other measures to ensure the preservation and most efficient use of 
the existing transportation system. The long-range statewide 
transportation plan may consider projects and strategies that address 
areas or corridors where current or projected congestion threatens the 
efficient functioning of key elements of the State's transportation 
system.
    (c) The long-range statewide transportation plan shall reference, 
summarize, or contain any applicable short-range planning studies; 
strategic planning and/or policy studies; transportation needs studies; 
management systems reports; emergency relief and disaster preparedness 
plans; and any statements of policies, goals, and objectives on issues 
(e.g., transportation, safety, economic development, social and 
environmental effects, or energy) that were relevant to the development 
of the long-range statewide transportation plan.
    (d) The long-range statewide transportation plan should include a 
safety element that incorporates or summarizes the priorities, goals, 
countermeasures, or projects contained in the Strategic Highway Safety 
Plan required by 23 U.S.C. 148.
    (e) The long-range statewide transportation plan should include a 
security element that incorporates or summarizes the priorities, goals, 
or projects set forth in other transit safety and security planning and 
review processes, plans, and programs, as appropriate.
    (f) Within each metropolitan area of the State, the long-range 
statewide transportation plan shall be developed in cooperation with the 
affected MPOs.
    (g) For non-metropolitan areas, the long-range statewide 
transportation plan shall be developed in consultation with affected 
non-metropolitan officials with responsibility for transportation using 
the State's consultation process(es) established under Sec. 450.210(b).

[[Page 100]]

    (h) For each area of the State under the jurisdiction of an Indian 
Tribal government, the long-range statewide transportation plan shall be 
developed in consultation with the Tribal government and the Secretary 
of the Interior consistent with Sec. 450.210(c).
    (i) The long-range statewide transportation plan shall be developed, 
as appropriate, in consultation with State, Tribal, and local agencies 
responsible for land use management, natural resources, environmental 
protection, conservation, and historic preservation. This consultation 
shall involve comparison of transportation plans to State and Tribal 
conservation plans or maps, if available, and comparison of 
transportation plans to inventories of natural or historic resources, if 
available.
    (j) A long-range statewide transportation plan shall include a 
discussion of potential environmental mitigation activities and 
potential areas to carry out these activities, including activities that 
may have the greatest potential to restore and maintain the 
environmental functions affected by the long-range statewide 
transportation plan. The discussion may focus on policies, programs, or 
strategies, rather than at the project level. The discussion shall be 
developed in consultation with Federal, State, and Tribal land 
management, wildlife, and regulatory agencies. The State may establish 
reasonable timeframes for performing this consultation.
    (k) In developing and updating the long-range statewide 
transportation plan, the State shall provide citizens, affected public 
agencies, representatives of public transportation employees, freight 
shippers, private providers of transportation, representatives of users 
of public transportation, representatives of users of pedestrian 
walkways and bicycle transportation facilities, representatives of the 
disabled, providers of freight transportation services, and other 
interested parties with a reasonable opportunity to comment on the 
proposed long-range statewide transportation plan. In carrying out these 
requirements, the State shall, to the maximum extent practicable, 
utilize the public involvement process described under Sec. 450.210(a).
    (l) The long-range statewide transportation plan may (but is not 
required to) include a financial plan that demonstrates how the adopted 
long-range statewide transportation plan can be implemented, indicates 
resources from public and private sources that are reasonably expected 
to be made available to carry out the plan, and recommends any 
additional financing strategies for needed projects and programs. In 
addition, for illustrative purposes, the financial plan may (but is not 
required to) include additional projects that would be included in the 
adopted long-range statewide transportation plan if additional resources 
beyond those identified in the financial plan were to become available.
    (m) The State shall not be required to select any project from the 
illustrative list of additional projects included in the financial plan 
described in paragraph (l) of this section.
    (n) The long-range statewide transportation plan shall be published 
or otherwise made available, including (to the maximum extent 
practicable) in electronically accessible formats and means, such as the 
World Wide Web, as described in Sec. 450.210(a).
    (o) The State shall continually evaluate, revise, and periodically 
update the long-range statewide transportation plan, as appropriate, 
using the procedures in this section for development and establishment 
of the long-range statewide transportation plan.
    (p) Copies of any new or amended long-range statewide transportation 
plan documents shall be provided to the FHWA and the FTA for 
informational purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 450.216  Development and content of the statewide transportation improvement program (STIP).

    (a) The State shall develop a statewide transportation improvement 
program (STIP) for all areas of the State. The STIP shall cover a period 
of no less than four years and be updated at least every four years, or 
more frequently if the Governor elects a more frequent update cycle. 
However, if the STIP covers more than four years, the FHWA and the FTA 
will consider the projects

[[Page 101]]

in the additional years as informational. In case of difficulties 
developing a portion of the STIP for a particular area (e.g., 
metropolitan planning area, nonattainment or maintenance area, or Indian 
Tribal lands), a partial STIP covering the rest of the State may be 
developed.
    (b) For each metropolitan area in the State, the STIP shall be 
developed in cooperation with the MPO designated for the metropolitan 
area. Each metropolitan transportation improvement program (TIP) shall 
be included without change in the STIP, directly or by reference, after 
approval of the TIP by the MPO and the Governor. A metropolitan TIP in a 
nonattainment or maintenance area is subject to a FHWA/FTA conformity 
finding before inclusion in the STIP. In areas outside a metropolitan 
planning area but within an air quality nonattainment or maintenance 
area containing any part of a metropolitan area, projects must be 
included in the regional emissions analysis that supported the 
conformity determination of the associated metropolitan TIP before they 
are added to the STIP.
    (c) For each non-metropolitan area in the State, the STIP shall be 
developed in consultation with affected non-metropolitan local officials 
with responsibility for transportation using the State's consultation 
process(es) established under Sec. 450.210.
    (d) For each area of the State under the jurisdiction of an Indian 
Tribal government, the STIP shall be developed in consultation with the 
Tribal government and the Secretary of the Interior.
    (e) Federal Lands Highway program TIPs shall be included without 
change in the STIP, directly or by reference, once approved by the FHWA 
pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 204(a) or (j).
    (f) The Governor shall provide all interested parties with a 
reasonable opportunity to comment on the proposed STIP as required by 
Sec. 450.210(a).
    (g) The STIP shall include capital and non-capital surface 
transportation projects (or phases of projects) within the boundaries of 
the State proposed for funding under title 23 U.S.C. and title 49 U.S.C. 
Chapter 53 (including transportation enhancements; Federal Lands Highway 
program projects; safety projects included in the State's Strategic 
Highway Safety Plan; trails projects; pedestrian walkways; and bicycle 
facilities), except the following that may (but are not required to) be 
included:
    (1) Safety projects funded under 23 U.S.C. 402 and 49 U.S.C. 31102;
    (2) Metropolitan planning projects funded under 23 U.S.C. 104(f), 49 
U.S.C. 5305(d), and 49 U.S.C. 5339;
    (3) State planning and research projects funded under 23 U.S.C. 505 
and 49 U.S.C. 5305(e);
    (4) At the State's discretion, State planning and research projects 
funded with National Highway System, Surface Transportation Program, 
and/or Equity Bonus funds;
    (5) Emergency relief projects (except those involving substantial 
functional, locational, or capacity changes);
    (6) National planning and research projects funded under 49 U.S.C. 
5314; and
    (7) Project management oversight projects funded under 49 U.S.C. 
5327.
    (h) The STIP shall contain all regionally significant projects 
requiring an action by the FHWA or the FTA whether or not the projects 
are to be funded with 23 U.S.C. Chapters 1 and 2 or title 49 U.S.C. 
Chapter 53 funds (e.g., addition of an interchange to the Interstate 
System with State, local, and/or private funds, and congressionally 
designated projects not funded under title 23 U.S.C. or title 49 U.S.C. 
Chapter 53). For informational and conformity purposes, the STIP shall 
include (if appropriate and included in any TIPs) all regionally 
significant projects proposed to be funded with Federal funds other than 
those administered by the FHWA or the FTA, as well as all regionally 
significant projects to be funded with non-Federal funds.
    (i) The STIP shall include for each project or phase (e.g., 
preliminary engineering, environment/NEPA, right-of-way, design, or 
construction) the following:
    (1) Sufficient descriptive material (i.e., type of work, termini, 
and length) to identify the project or phase;
    (2) Estimated total project cost, or a project cost range, which may 
extend beyond the four years of the STIP;

[[Page 102]]

    (3) The amount of Federal funds proposed to be obligated during each 
program year (for the first year, this includes the proposed category of 
Federal funds and source(s) of non-Federal funds. For the second, third, 
and fourth years, this includes the likely category or possible 
categories of Federal funds and sources of non-Federal funds); and
    (4) Identification of the agencies responsible for carrying out the 
project or phase.
    (j) Projects that are not considered to be of appropriate scale for 
individual identification in a given program year may be grouped by 
function, work type, and/or geographic area using the applicable 
classifications under 23 CFR 771.117(c) and (d) and/or 40 CFR part 93. 
In nonattainment and maintenance areas, project classifications must be 
consistent with the ``exempt project'' classifications contained in the 
EPA's transportation conformity regulation (40 CFR part 93). In 
addition, projects proposed for funding under title 23 U.S.C. Chapter 2 
that are not regionally significant may be grouped in one line item or 
identified individually in the STIP.
    (k) Each project or project phase included in the STIP shall be 
consistent with the long-range statewide transportation plan developed 
under Sec. 450.214 and, in metropolitan planning areas, consistent with 
an approved metropolitan transportation plan developed under Sec. 
450.322.
    (l) The STIP may include a financial plan that demonstrates how the 
approved STIP can be implemented, indicates resources from public and 
private sources that are reasonably expected to be made available to 
carry out the STIP, and recommends any additional financing strategies 
for needed projects and programs. In addition, for illustrative 
purposes, the financial plan may (but is not required to) include 
additional projects that would be included in the adopted STIP if 
reasonable additional resources beyond those identified in the financial 
plan were to become available. The State is not required to select any 
project from the illustrative list for implementation, and projects on 
the illustrative list cannot be advanced to implementation without an 
action by the FHWA and the FTA on the STIP. Starting December 11, 2007, 
revenue and cost estimates for the STIP must use an inflation rate(s) to 
reflect ``year of expenditure dollars,'' based on reasonable financial 
principles and information, developed cooperatively by the State, MPOs, 
and public transportation operators.
    (m) The STIP shall include a project, or an identified phase of a 
project, only if full funding can reasonably be anticipated to be 
available for the project within the time period contemplated for 
completion of the project. In nonattainment and maintenance areas, 
projects included in the first two years of the STIP shall be limited to 
those for which funds are available or committed. Financial constraint 
of the STIP shall be demonstrated and maintained by year and shall 
include sufficient financial information to demonstrate which projects 
are to be implemented using current and/or reasonably available 
revenues, while federally-supported facilities are being adequately 
operated and maintained. In the case of proposed funding sources, 
strategies for ensuring their availability shall be identified in the 
financial plan consistent with paragraph (l) of this section. For 
purposes of transportation operations and maintenance, the STIP shall 
include financial information containing system-level estimates of costs 
and revenue sources that are reasonably expected to be available to 
adequately operate and maintain Federal-aid highways (as defined by 23 
U.S.C. 101(a)(5)) and public transportation (as defined by title 49 
U.S.C. Chapter 53).
    (n) Projects in any of the first four years of the STIP may be 
advanced in place of another project in the first four years of the 
STIP, subject to the project selection requirements of Sec. 450.220. In 
addition, the STIP may be revised at any time under procedures agreed to 
by the State, MPO(s), and public transportation operator(s) consistent 
with the STIP development procedures established in this section, as 
well as the procedures for participation by interested parties (see 
Sec. 450.210(a)), subject to FHWA/FTA approval (see Sec. 450.218). 
Changes that affect fiscal constraint must take place by amendment of 
the STIP.

[[Page 103]]

    (o) In cases that the FHWA and the FTA find a STIP to be fiscally 
constrained and a revenue source is subsequently removed or 
substantially reduced (i.e., by legislative or administrative actions), 
the FHWA and the FTA will not withdraw the original determination of 
fiscal constraint. However, in such cases, the FHWA and the FTA will not 
act on an updated or amended STIP that does not reflect the changed 
revenue situation.


<R05>
Sec. 450.218  Self-certifications, Federal findings, and Federal approvals.

    (a) At least every four years, the State shall submit an updated 
STIP concurrently to the FHWA and the FTA for joint approval. STIP 
amendments shall also be submitted to the FHWA and the FTA for joint 
approval. At the time the entire proposed STIP or STIP amendments are 
submitted to the FHWA and the FTA for joint approval, the State shall 
certify that the transportation planning process is being carried out in

    (10) Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) 
and 49 CFR part 27 regarding discrimination against individuals with 
disabilities.
    (b) The FHWA and the FTA shall review the STIP or the amended STIP, 
and make a joint finding on the extent to which the STIP is based on a 
statewide transportation planning process that meets or substantially 
meets the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 134 and 135, 49 U.S.C. 5303 and 
5304, and subparts A, B, and C of this part. Approval of the STIP by the 
FHWA and the FTA, in its entirety or in part, will be based upon the 
results of this joint finding.
    (1) If the FHWA and the FTA determine that the STIP or amended STIP 
is based on a statewide transportation planning process that meets or 
substantially meets the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 135, 49 U.S.C. 5304, 
and this part, the FHWA and the FTA may jointly:
    (i) Approve the entire STIP;
    (ii) Approve the STIP subject to certain corrective actions being 
taken; or
    (iii) Under special circumstances, approve a partial STIP covering 
only a portion of the State.
    (2) If the FHWA and the FTA jointly determine and document in the 
planning finding that a submitted STIP or amended STIP does not 
substantially meet the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 135, 49 U.S.C. 5304, 
and this part for any identified categories of projects, the FHWA and 
the FTA will not approve the STIP.
    (c) The approval period for a new or amended STIP shall not exceed 
four years. If a State demonstrates, in writing, that extenuating 
circumstances will delay the submittal of a new or amended STIP past its 
update deadline, the FHWA and the FTA will consider and take appropriate 
action on a request to extend the approval beyond four years for all or 
part of the STIP for a period not to exceed 180 calendar days. In these 
cases, priority consideration will be given to projects and strategies 
involving the operation and management of the multimodal transportation 
system. Where the request

[[Page 104]]

involves projects in a metropolitan planning area(s), the affected 
MPO(s) must concur in the request. If the delay was due to the 
development and approval of a metropolitan TIP(s), the affected MPO(s) 
must provide supporting information, in writing, for the request.
    (d) Where necessary in order to maintain or establish highway and 
transit operations, the FHWA and the FTA may approve operating 
assistance for specific projects or programs, even though the projects 
or programs may not be included in an approved STIP.


<R05>
Sec. 450.220  Project selection from the STIP.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 450.216(g) and Sec. 450.218(d), 
only projects in a FHWA/FTA approved STIP shall be eligible for funds 
administered by the FHWA or the FTA.
    (b) In metropolitan planning areas, transportation projects proposed 
for funds administered by the FHWA or the FTA shall be selected from the 
approved STIP in accordance with project selection procedures provided 
in Sec. 450.330.
    (c) In non-metropolitan areas, transportation projects undertaken on 
the National Highway System, under the Bridge and Interstate Maintenance 
programs in title 23 U.S.C. and under sections 5310, 5311, 5316, and 
5317 of title 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53 shall be selected from the approved 
STIP by the State in consultation with the affected non-metropolitan 
local officials with responsibility for transportation.
    (d) Federal Lands Highway program projects shall be selected from 
the approved STIP in accordance with the procedures developed pursuant 
to 23 U.S.C. 204.
    (e) The projects in the first year of an approved STIP shall 
constitute an ``agreed to'' list of projects for subsequent scheduling 
and implementation. No further action under paragraphs (b) through (d) 
of this section is required for the implementing agency to proceed with 
these projects. If Federal funds available are significantly less than 
the authorized amounts, or where there is significant shifting of 
projects among years, Sec. 450.330(a) provides for a revised list of 
``agreed to'' projects to be developed upon the request of the State, 
MPO, or public transportation operator(s). If an implementing agency 
wishes to proceed with a project in the second, third, or fourth year of 
the STIP, the procedures in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section 
or expedited procedures that provide for the advancement of projects 
from the second, third, or fourth years of the STIP may be used, if 
agreed to by all parties involved in the selection process.


<R05>
Sec. 450.222  Applicability of NEPA to statewide transportation plans and programs.

    Any decision by the Secretary concerning a long-range statewide 
transportation plan or STIP developed through the processes provided for 
in 23 U.S.C. 135, 49 U.S.C. 5304, and this subpart shall not be 
considered to be a Federal action subject to review under NEPA.


<R05>
Sec. 450.224  Phase-in of new requirements.

    (a) Long-range statewide transportation plans and STIPs adopted or 
approved prior to July 1, 2007 may be developed using the TEA-21 
requirements or the provisions and requirements of this part.
    (b) For STIPs that are developed under TEA-21 requirements prior to 
July 1, 2007, the FHWA/FTA action (i.e., STIP approval) must be 
completed no later than June 30, 2007. For long-range statewide 
transportation plans that are completed under TEA-21 requirements prior 
to July 1, 2007, the State adoption action must be completed no later 
than June 30, 2007. If these actions are completed on or after July 1, 
2007, the provisions and requirements of this part shall take effect, 
regardless of when the long-range statewide transportation plan or the 
STIP were developed.
    (c) The applicable action (see paragraph (b) of this section) on any 
amendments or updates to STIPs or long-range statewide transportation 
plans on or after July 1, 2007, shall be based on the provisions and 
requirements of this part. However, administrative modifications may be 
made to the STIP on or after July 1, 2007 in the

[[Page 105]]

absence of meeting the provisions and requirements of this part.

<R05>
Sec. 450.300  Purpose.

    The purposes of this subpart are to implement the provisions of 23 
U.S.C. 134 and 49 U.S.C. 5303, as amended, which:
    (a) Sets forth the national policy that the MPO designated for each 
urbanized area is to carry out a continuing, cooperative, and 
comprehensive multimodal transportation planning process, including the 
development of a metropolitan transportation plan and a transportation 
improvement program (TIP), that encourages and promotes the safe and 
efficient development, management, and operation of surface 
transportation systems to serve the mobility needs of people and freight 
(including accessible pedestrian walkways and bicycle transportation 
facilities) and foster economic growth and development, while minimizing 
transportation-related fuel consumption and air pollution; and
    (b) Encourages continued development and improvement of metropolitan 
transportation planning processes guided by the planning factors set 
forth in 23 U.S.C. 134(h) and 49 U.S.C. 5303(h).


<R05>
Sec. 450.302  Applicability.

    The provisions of this subpart are applicable to organizations and 
entities responsible for the transportation planning and programming 
processes in metropolitan planning areas.


<R05>
Sec. 450.304  Definitions.

    Except as otherwise provided in subpart A of this part, terms 
defined in 23 U.S.C. 101(a) and 49 U.S.C. 5302 are used in this subpart 
as so defined.


<R05>
Sec. 450.306  Scope of the metropolitan transportation planning process.

    (a) The metropolitan transportation planning process shall be 
continuous, cooperative, and comprehensive, and provide for 
consideration and implementation of projects, strategies, and services 
that will address the following factors:
    (1) Support the economic vitality of the metropolitan area, 
especially by enabling global competitiveness, productivity, and 
efficiency;
    (2) Increase the safety of the transportation system for motorized 
and non-motorized users;
    (3) Increase the security of the transportation system for motorized 
and non-motorized users;
    (4) Increase accessibility and mobility of people and freight;
    (5) Protect and enhance the environment, promote energy 
conservation, improve the quality of life, and promote consistency 
between transportation improvements and State and local planned growth 
and economic development patterns;
    (6) Enhance the integration and connectivity of the transportation 
system, across and between modes, for people and freight;
    (7) Promote efficient system management and operation; and
    (8) Emphasize the preservation of the existing transportation 
system.
    (b) Consideration of the planning factors in paragraph (a) of this 
section shall be reflected, as appropriate, in the metropolitan 
transportation planning process. The degree of consideration and 
analysis of the factors should be based on the scale and complexity of 
many issues, including transportation system development, land use, 
employment, economic development, human and natural environment, and 
housing and community development.
    (c) The failure to consider any factor specified in paragraph (a) of 
this section shall not be reviewable by any court under title 23 U.S.C., 
49 U.S.C. Chapter 53, subchapter II of title 5, U.S.C. Chapter 5, or 
title 5 U.S.C. Chapter 7 in any matter affecting a metropolitan 
transportation plan, TIP, a project or strategy, or the certification of 
a metropolitan transportation planning process.
    (d) The metropolitan transportation planning process shall be 
carried out in coordination with the statewide transportation planning 
process required by 23 U.S.C. 135 and 49 U.S.C. 5304.
    (e) In carrying out the metropolitan transportation planning 
process,

[[Page 106]]

MPOs, States, and public transportation operators may apply asset 
management principles and techniques in establishing planning goals, 
defining TIP priorities, and assessing transportation investment 
decisions, including transportation system safety, operations, 
preservation, and maintenance, as well as strategies and policies to 
support homeland security and to safeguard the personal security of all 
motorized and non-motorized users.
    (f) The metropolitan transportation planning process shall (to the 
maximum extent practicable) be consistent with the development of 
applicable regional intelligent transportation systems (ITS) 
architectures, as defined in 23 CFR part 940.
    (g) Preparation of the coordinated public transit-human services 
transportation plan, as required by 49 U.S.C. 5310, 5316, and 5317, 
should be coordinated and consistent with the metropolitan 
transportation planning process.
    (h) The metropolitan transportation planning process should be 
consistent with the Strategic Highway Safety Plan, as specified in 23 
U.S.C. 148, and other transit safety and security planning and review 
processes, plans, and programs, as appropriate.
    (i) The FHWA and the FTA shall designate as a transportation 
management area (TMA) each urbanized area with a population of over 
200,000 individuals, as defined by the Bureau of the Census. The FHWA 
and the FTA shall also designate any additional urbanized area as a TMA 
on the request of the Governor and the MPO designated for that area.
    (j) In an urbanized area not designated as a TMA that is an air 
quality attainment area, the MPO(s) may propose and submit to the FHWA 
and the FTA for approval a procedure for developing an abbreviated 
metropolitan transportation plan and TIP. In developing proposed 
simplified planning procedures, consideration shall be given to whether 
the abbreviated metropolitan transportation plan and TIP will achieve 
the purposes of 23 U.S.C. 134, 49 U.S.C. 5303, and these regulations, 
taking into account the complexity of the transportation problems in the 
area. The simplified procedures shall be developed by the MPO in 
cooperation with the State(s) and public transportation operator(s).


<R05>
Sec. 450.308  Funding for transportation planning and unified planning work programs.

    (a) Funds provided under 23 U.S.C. 104(f), 49 U.S.C. 5305(d), 49 
U.S.C. 5307, and 49 U.S.C. 5339 are available to MPOs to accomplish 
activities in this subpart. At the State's option, funds provided under 
23 U.S.C. 104(b)(1) and (b)(3) and 23 U.S.C. 105 may also be provided to 
MPOs for metropolitan transportation planning. In addition, an MPO 
serving an urbanized area with a population over 200,000, as designated 
by the Bureau of the Census, may at its discretion use funds sub-
allocated under 23 U.S.C. 133(d)(3)(E) for metropolitan transportation 
planning activities.
    (b) Metropolitan transportation planning activities performed with 
funds provided under title 23 U.S.C. and title 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53 
shall be documented in a unified planning work program (UPWP) or 
simplified statement of work in accordance with the provisions of this 
section and 23 CFR part 420.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, each MPO, 
in cooperation with the State(s) and public transportation operator(s), 
shall develop a UPWP that includes a discussion of the planning 
priorities facing the MPA. The UPWP shall identify work proposed for the 
next one- or two-year period by major activity and task (including 
activities that address the planning factors in Sec. 450.306(a)), in 
sufficient detail to indicate who (e.g., MPO, State, public 
transportation operator, local government, or consultant) will perform 
the work, the schedule for completing the work, the resulting products, 
the proposed funding by activity/task, and a summary of the total 
amounts and sources of Federal and matching funds.
    (d) With the prior approval of the State and the FHWA and the FTA, 
an MPO in an area not designated as a TMA may prepare a simplified 
statement of work, in cooperation with the State(s) and the public 
transportation

[[Page 107]]

operator(s), in lieu of a UPWP. A simplified statement of work would 
include a description of the major activities to be performed during the 
next one- or two-year period, who (e.g., State, MPO, public 
transportation operator, local government, or consultant) will perform 
the work, the resulting products, and a summary of the total amounts and 
sources of Federal and matching funds. If a simplified statement of work 
is used, it may be submitted as part of the State's planning work 
program, in accordance with 23 CFR part 420.
    (e) Arrangements may be made with the FHWA and the FTA to combine 
the UPWP or simplified statement of work with the work program(s) for 
other Federal planning funds.
    (f) Administrative requirements for UPWPs and simplified statements 
of work are contained in 23 CFR part 420 and FTA Circular C8100.1B 
(Program Guidance and Application Instructions for Metropolitan Planning 
Grants).


<R05>
Sec. 450.310  Metropolitan planning organization designation and redesignation.

    (a) To carry out the metropolitan transportation planning process 
under this subpart, a metropolitan planning organization (MPO) shall be 
designated for each urbanized area with a population of more than 50,000 
individuals (as determined by the Bureau of the Census).
    (b) MPO designation shall be made by agreement between the Governor 
and units of general purpose local government that together represent at 
least 75 percent of the affected population (including the largest 
incorporated city, based on population, as named by the Bureau of the 
Census) or in accordance with procedures established by applicable State 
or local law.
    (c) Each Governor with responsibility for a portion of a multistate 
metropolitan area and the appropriate MPOs shall, to the extent 
practicable, provide coordinated transportation planning for the entire 
MPA. The consent of Congress is granted to any two or more States to:
    (1) Enter into agreements or compacts, not in conflict with any law 
of the United States, for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in 
support of activities authorized under 23 U.S.C. 134 and 49 U.S.C. 5303 
as the activities pertain to interstate areas and localities within the 
States; and
    (2) Establish such agencies, joint or otherwise, as the States may 
determine desirable for making the agreements and compacts effective.
    (d) Each MPO that serves a TMA, when designated or redesignated 
under this section, shall consist of local elected officials, officials 
of public agencies that administer or operate major modes of 
transportation in the metropolitan planning area, and appropriate State 
transportation officials. Where appropriate, MPOs may increase the 
representation of local elected officials, public transportation 
agencies, or appropriate State officials on their policy boards and 
other committees as a means for encouraging greater involvement in the 
metropolitan transportation planning process, subject to the 
requirements of paragraph (k) of this section.
    (e) To the extent possible, only one MPO shall be designated for 
each urbanized area or group of contiguous urbanized areas. More than 
one MPO may be designated to serve an urbanized area only if the 
Governor(s) and the existing MPO, if applicable, determine that the size 
and complexity of the urbanized area make designation of more than one 
MPO appropriate. In those cases where two or more MPOs serve the same 
urbanized area, the MPOs shall establish official, written agreements 
that clearly identify areas of coordination and the division of 
transportation planning responsibilities among the MPOs.
    (f) Nothing in this subpart shall be deemed to prohibit an MPO from 
using the staff resources of other agencies, non-profit organizations, 
or contractors to carry out selected elements of the metropolitan 
transportation planning process.
    (g) An MPO designation shall remain in effect until an official 
redesignation has been made in accordance with this section.
    (h) An existing MPO may be redesignated only by agreement between 
the Governor and units of general purpose

[[Page 108]]

local government that together represent at least 75 percent of the 
existing metropolitan planning area population (including the largest 
incorporated city, based on population, as named by the Bureau of the 
Census).
    (i) Redesignation of an MPO serving a multistate metropolitan 
planning area requires agreement between the Governors of each State 
served by the existing MPO and units of general purpose local government 
that together represent at least 75 percent of the existing metropolitan 
planning area population (including the largest incorporated city, based 
on population, as named by the Bureau of the Census).
    (j) For the purposes of redesignation, units of general purpose 
local government may be defined as elected officials from each unit of 
general purpose local government located within the metropolitan 
planning area served by the existing MPO.
    (k) Redesignation of an MPO (in accordance with the provisions of 
this section) is required whenever the existing MPO proposes to make:
    (1) A substantial change in the proportion of voting members on the 
existing MPO representing the largest incorporated city, other units of 
general purpose local government served by the MPO, and the State(s); or
    (2) A substantial change in the decisionmaking authority or 
responsibility of the MPO, or in decisionmaking procedures established 
under MPO by-laws.
    (l) The following changes to an MPO do not require a redesignation 
(as long as they do not trigger a substantial change as described in 
paragraph (k) of the section):
    (1) The identification of a new urbanized area (as determined by the 
Bureau of the Census) within an existing metropolitan planning area;
    (2) Adding members to the MPO that represent new units of general 
purpose local government resulting from expansion of the metropolitan 
planning area;
    (3) Adding members to satisfy the specific membership requirements 
for an MPO that serves a TMA; or
    (4) Periodic rotation of members representing units of general-
purpose local government, as established under MPO by-laws.


<R05>
Sec. 450.312  Metropolitan planning area boundaries.

    (a) The boundaries of a metropolitan planning area (MPA) shall be 
determined by agreement between the MPO and the Governor. At a minimum, 
the MPA boundaries shall encompass the entire existing urbanized area 
(as defined by the Bureau of the Census) plus the contiguous area 
expected to become urbanized within a 20-year forecast period for the 
metropolitan transportation plan. The MPA boundaries may be further 
expanded to encompass the entire metropolitan statistical area or 
combined statistical area, as defined by the Office of Management and 
Budget.
    (b) An MPO that serves an urbanized area designated as a 
nonattainment area for ozone or carbon monoxide under the Clean Air Act 
(42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) as of August 10, 2005, shall retain the MPA 
boundary that existed on August 10, 2005. The MPA boundaries for such 
MPOs may only be adjusted by agreement of the Governor and the affected 
MPO in accordance with the redesignation procedures described in Sec. 
450.310(h). The MPA boundary for an MPO that serves an urbanized area 
designated as a nonattainment area for ozone or carbon monoxide under 
the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) after August 10, 2005 may be 
established to coincide with the designated boundaries of the ozone and/
or carbon monoxide nonattainment area, in accordance with the 
requirements in Sec. 450.310(b).
    (c) An MPA boundary may encompass more than one urbanized area.
    (d) MPA boundaries may be established to coincide with the geography 
of regional economic development and growth forecasting areas.
    (e) Identification of new urbanized areas within an existing 
metropolitan planning area by the Bureau of the Census shall not require 
redesignation of the existing MPO.
    (f) Where the boundaries of the urbanized area or MPA extend across 
two or more States, the Governors with responsibility for a portion of 
the multistate area, MPO(s), and the public

[[Page 109]]

transportation operator(s) are strongly encouraged to coordinate 
transportation planning for the entire multistate area.
    (g) The MPA boundaries shall not overlap with each other.
    (h) Where part of an urbanized area served by one MPO extends into 
an adjacent MPA, the MPOs shall, at a minimum, establish written 
agreements that clearly identify areas of coordination and the division 
of transportation planning responsibilities among and between the MPOs. 
Alternatively, the MPOs may adjust their existing boundaries so that the 
entire urbanized area lies within only one MPA. Boundary adjustments 
that change the composition of the MPO may require redesignation of one 
or more such MPOs.
    (i) The MPA boundaries shall be reviewed after each Census by the 
MPO (in cooperation with the State and public transportation 
operator(s)) to determine if existing MPA boundaries meet the minimum 
statutory requirements for new and updated urbanized area(s), and shall 
be adjusted as necessary. As appropriate, additional adjustments should 
be made to reflect the most comprehensive boundary to foster an 
effective planning process that ensures connectivity between modes, 
reduces access disadvantages experienced by modal systems, and promotes 
efficient overall transportation investment strategies.
    (j) Following MPA boundary approval by the MPO and the Governor, the 
MPA boundary descriptions shall be provided for informational purposes 
to the FHWA and the FTA. The MPA boundary descriptions shall be 
submitted either as a geo-spatial database or described in sufficient 
detail to enable the boundaries to be accurately delineated on a map.


<R05>
Sec. 450.314  Metropolitan planning agreements.

    (a) The MPO, the State(s), and the public transportation operator(s) 
shall cooperatively determine their mutual responsibilities in carrying 
out the metropolitan transportation planning process. These 
responsibilities shall be clearly identified in written agreements among 
the MPO, the State(s), and the public transportation operator(s) serving 
the MPA. To the extent possible, a single agreement between all 
responsible parties should be developed. The written agreement(s) shall 
include specific provisions for cooperatively developing and sharing 
information related to the development of financial plans that support 
the metropolitan transportation plan (see Sec. 450.322) and the 
metropolitan TIP (see Sec. 450.324) and development of the annual 
listing of obligated projects (see Sec. 450.332).
    (b) If the MPA does not include the entire nonattainment or 
maintenance area, there shall be a written agreement among the State 
department of transportation, State air quality agency, affected local 
agencies, and the MPO describing the process for cooperative planning 
and analysis of all projects outside the MPA within the nonattainment or 
maintenance area. The agreement must also indicate how the total 
transportation-related emissions for the nonattainment or maintenance 
area, including areas outside the MPA, will be treated for the purposes 
of determining conformity in accordance with the EPA's transportation 
conformity rule (40 CFR part 93). The agreement shall address policy 
mechanisms for resolving conflicts concerning transportation-related 
emissions that may arise between the MPA and the portion of the 
nonattainment or maintenance area outside the MPA.
    (c) In nonattainment or maintenance areas, if the MPO is not the 
designated agency for air quality planning under section 174 of the 
Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7504), there shall be a written agreement 
between the MPO and the designated air quality planning agency 
describing their respective roles and responsibilities for air quality 
related transportation planning.
    (d) If more than one MPO has been designated to serve an urbanized 
area, there shall be a written agreement among the MPOs, the State(s), 
and the public transportation operator(s) describing how the 
metropolitan transportation planning processes will be coordinated to 
assure the development of consistent metropolitan transportation plans 
and TIPs across the MPA boundaries, particularly in cases in which a

[[Page 110]]

proposed transportation investment extends across the boundaries of more 
than one MPA. If any part of the urbanized area is a nonattainment or 
maintenance area, the agreement also shall include State and local air 
quality agencies. The metropolitan transportation planning processes for 
affected MPOs should, to the maximum extent possible, reflect 
coordinated data collection, analysis, and planning assumptions across 
the MPAs. Alternatively, a single metropolitan transportation plan and/
or TIP for the entire urbanized area may be developed jointly by the 
MPOs in cooperation with their respective planning partners. 
Coordination efforts and outcomes shall be documented in subsequent 
transmittals of the UPWP and other planning products, including the 
metropolitan transportation plan and TIP, to the State(s), the FHWA, and 
the FTA.
    (e) Where the boundaries of the urbanized area or MPA extend across 
two or more States, the Governors with responsibility for a portion of 
the multistate area, the appropriate MPO(s), and the public 
transportation operator(s) shall coordinate transportation planning for 
the entire multistate area. States involved in such multistate 
transportation planning may:
    (1) Enter into agreements or compacts, not in conflict with any law 
of the United States, for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in 
support of activities authorized under this section as the activities 
pertain to interstate areas and localities within the States; and
    (2) Establish such agencies, joint or otherwise, as the States may 
determine desirable for making the agreements and compacts effective.
    (f) If part of an urbanized area that has been designated as a TMA 
overlaps into an adjacent MPA serving an urbanized area that is not 
designated as a TMA, the adjacent urbanized area shall not be treated as 
a TMA. However, a written agreement shall be established between the 
MPOs with MPA boundaries including a portion of the TMA, which clearly 
identifies the roles and responsibilities of each MPO in meeting 
specific TMA requirements (e.g., congestion management process, Surface 
Transportation Program funds suballocated to the urbanized area over 
200,000 population, and project selection).


<R05>
Sec. 450.316  Interested parties, participation, and consultation.

    (a) The MPO shall develop and use a documented participation plan 
that defines a process for providing citizens, affected public agencies, 
representatives of public transportation employees, freight shippers, 
providers of freight transportation services, private providers of 
transportation, representatives of users of public transportation, 
representatives of users of pedestrian walkways and bicycle 
transportation facilities, representatives of the disabled, and other 
interested parties with reasonable opportunities to be involved in the 
metropolitan transportation planning process.
    (1) The participation plan shall be developed by the MPO in 
consultation with all interested parties and shall, at a minimum, 
describe explicit procedures, strategies, and desired outcomes for:
    (i) Providing adequate public notice of public participation 
activities and time for public review and comment at key decision 
points, including but not limited to a reasonable opportunity to comment 
on the proposed metropolitan transportation plan and the TIP;
    (ii) Providing timely notice and reasonable access to information 
about transportation issues and processes;
    (iii) Employing visualization techniques to describe metropolitan 
transportation plans and TIPs;
    (iv) Making public information (technical information and meeting 
notices) available in electronically accessible formats and means, such 
as the World Wide Web;
    (v) Holding any public meetings at convenient and accessible 
locations and times;
    (vi) Demonstrating explicit consideration and response to public 
input received during the development of the metropolitan transportation 
plan and the TIP;

[[Page 111]]

    (vii) Seeking out and considering the needs of those traditionally 
underserved by existing transportation systems, such as low-income and 
minority households, who may face challenges accessing employment and 
other services;
    (viii) Providing an additional opportunity for public comment, if 
the final metropolitan transportation plan or TIP differs significantly 
from the version that was made available for public comment by the MPO 
and raises new material issues which interested parties could not 
reasonably have foreseen from the public involvement efforts;
    (ix) Coordinating with the statewide transportation planning public 
involvement and consultation processes under subpart B of this part; and
    (x) Periodically reviewing the effectiveness of the procedures and 
strategies contained in the participation plan to ensure a full and open 
participation process.
    (2) When significant written and oral comments are received on the 
draft metropolitan transportation plan and TIP (including the financial 
plans) as a result of the participation process in this section or the 
interagency consultation process required under the EPA transportation 
conformity regulations (40 CFR part 93), a summary, analysis, and report 
on the disposition of comments shall be made as part of the final 
metropolitan transportation plan and TIP.
    (3) A minimum public comment period of 45 calendar days shall be 
provided before the initial or revised participation plan is adopted by 
the MPO. Copies of the approved participation plan shall be provided to 
the FHWA and the FTA for informational purposes and shall be posted on 
the World Wide Web, to the maximum extent practicable.
    (b) In developing metropolitan transportation plans and TIPs, the 
MPO should consult with agencies and officials responsible for other 
planning activities within the MPA that are affected by transportation 
(including State and local planned growth, economic development, 
environmental protection, airport operations, or freight movements) or 
coordinate its planning process (to the maximum extent practicable) with 
such planning activities. In addition, metropolitan transportation plans 
and TIPs shall be developed with due consideration of other related 
planning activities within the metropolitan area, and the process shall 
provide for the design and delivery of transportation services within 
the area that are provided by:
    (1) Recipients of assistance under title 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53;
    (2) Governmental agencies and non-profit organizations (including 
representatives of the agencies and organizations) that receive Federal 
assistance from a source other than the U.S. Department of 
Transportation to provide non-emergency transportation services; and
    (3) Recipients of assistance under 23 U.S.C. 204.
    (c) When the MPA includes Indian Tribal lands, the MPO shall 
appropriately involve the Indian Tribal government(s) in the development 
of the metropolitan transportation plan and the TIP.
    (d) When the MPA includes Federal public lands, the MPO shall 
appropriately involve the Federal land management agencies in the 
development of the metropolitan transportation plan and the TIP.
    (e) MPOs shall, to the extent practicable, develop a documented 
process(es) that outlines roles, responsibilities, and key decision 
points for consulting with other governments and agencies, as defined in 
paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, which may be included in 
the agreement(s) developed under Sec. 450.314.

Sec. 450.318  Transportation planning studies and project development.

    (a) Pursuant to section 1308 of the Transportation Equity Act for 
the 21st Century, TEA-21 (Pub. L. 105-178), an MPO(s), State(s), or 
public transportation operator(s) may undertake a multimodal, systems-
level corridor or subarea planning study as part of the metropolitan 
transportation planning process. To the extent practicable, development 
of these transportation planning studies shall involve consultation 
with, or joint efforts among, the MPO(s), State(s), and/or public

[[Page 112]]

transportation operator(s). The results or decisions of these 
transportation planning studies may be used as part of the overall 
project development process consistent with the National Environmental 
Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and associated 
implementing regulations (23 CFR part 771 and 40 CFR parts 1500-1508). 
Specifically, these corridor or subarea studies may result in producing 
any of the following for a proposed transportation project:
    (1) Purpose and need or goals and objective statement(s);
    (2) General travel corridor and/or general mode(s) definition (e.g., 
highway, transit, or a highway/transit combination);
    (3) Preliminary screening of alternatives and elimination of 
unreasonable alternatives;
    (4) Basic description of the environmental setting; and/or
    (5) Preliminary identification of environmental impacts and 
environmental mitigation.
    (b) Publicly available documents or other source material produced 
by, or in support of, the transportation planning process described in 
this subpart may be incorporated directly or by reference into 
subsequent NEPA documents, in accordance with 40 CFR 1502.21, if:
    (1) The NEPA lead agencies agree that such incorporation will aid in 
establishing or evaluating the purpose and need for the Federal action, 
reasonable alternatives, cumulative or other impacts on the human and 
natural environment, or mitigation of these impacts; and
    (2) The systems-level, corridor, or subarea planning study is 
conducted with:
    (i) Involvement of interested State, local, Tribal, and Federal 
agencies;
    (ii) Public review;
    (iii) Reasonable opportunity to comment during the metropolitan 
transportation planning process and development of the corridor or 
subarea planning study;
    (iv) Documentation of relevant decisions in a form that is 
identifiable and available for review during the NEPA scoping process 
and can be appended to or referenced in the NEPA document; and
    (v) The review of the FHWA and the FTA, as appropriate.
    (c) By agreement of the NEPA lead agencies, the above integration 
may be accomplished through tiering (as described in 40 CFR 1502.20), 
incorporating the subarea or corridor planning study into the draft 
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) or Environmental Assessment, or 
other means that the NEPA lead agencies deem appropriate.
    (d) For transit fixed guideway projects requiring an Alternatives 
Analysis (49 U.S.C. 5309(d) and (e)), the Alternatives Analysis 
described in 49 CFR part 611 constitutes the planning required by 
section 1308 of the TEA-21. The Alternatives Analysis may or may not be 
combined with the preparation of a NEPA document (e.g., a draft EIS). 
When an Alternatives Analysis is separate from the preparation of a NEPA 
document, the results of the Alternatives Analysis may be used during a 
subsequent environmental review process as described in paragraph (a).
    (e) Additional information to further explain the linkages between 
the transportation planning and project development/NEPA processes is 
contained in Appendix A to this part, including an explanation that it 
is non-binding guidance material.


<R05>
Sec. 450.320  Congestion management process in transportation management areas.

    (a) The transportation planning process in a TMA shall address 
congestion management through a process that provides for safe and 
effective integrated management and operation of the multimodal 
transportation system, based on a cooperatively developed and 
implemented metropolitan-wide strategy, of new and existing 
transportation facilities eligible for funding under title 23 U.S.C. and 
title 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53 through the use of travel demand reduction 
and operational management strategies.
    (b) The development of a congestion management process should result 
in

[[Page 113]]

multimodal system performance measures and strategies that can be 
reflected in the metropolitan transportation plan and the TIP. The level 
of system performance deemed acceptable by State and local 
transportation officials may vary by type of transportation facility, 
geographic location (metropolitan area or subarea), and/or time of day. 
In addition, consideration should be given to strategies that manage 
demand, reduce single occupant vehicle (SOV) travel, and improve 
transportation system management and operations. Where the addition of 
general purpose lanes is determined to be an appropriate congestion 
management strategy, explicit consideration is to be given to the 
incorporation of appropriate features into the SOV project to facilitate 
future demand management strategies and operational improvements that 
will maintain the functional integrity and safety of those lanes.
    (c) The congestion management process shall be developed, 
established, and implemented as part of the metropolitan transportation 
planning process that includes coordination with transportation system 
management and operations activities. The congestion management process 
shall include:
    (1) Methods to monitor and evaluate the performance of the 
multimodal transportation system, identify the causes of recurring and 
non-recurring congestion, identify and evaluate alternative strategies, 
provide information supporting the implementation of actions, and 
evaluate the effectiveness of implemented actions;
    (2) Definition of congestion management objectives and appropriate 
performance measures to assess the extent of congestion and support the 
evaluation of the effectiveness of congestion reduction and mobility 
enhancement strategies for the movement of people and goods. Since 
levels of acceptable system performance may vary among local 
communities, performance measures should be tailored to the specific 
needs of the area and established cooperatively by the State(s), 
affected MPO(s), and local officials in consultation with the operators 
of major modes of transportation in the coverage area;
    (3) Establishment of a coordinated program for data collection and 
system performance monitoring to define the extent and duration of 
congestion, to contribute in determining the causes of congestion, and 
evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of implemented actions. To the 
extent possible, this data collection program should be coordinated with 
existing data sources (including archived operational/ITS data) and 
coordinated with operations managers in the metropolitan area;
    (4) Identification and evaluation of the anticipated performance and 
expected benefits of appropriate congestion management strategies that 
will contribute to the more effective use and improved safety of 
existing and future transportation systems based on the established 
performance measures. The following categories of strategies, or 
combinations of strategies, are some examples of what should be 
appropriately considered for each area:
    (i) Demand management measures, including growth management and 
congestion pricing;
    (ii) Traffic operational improvements;
    (iii) Public transportation improvements;
    (iv) ITS technologies as related to the regional ITS architecture; 
and
    (v) Where necessary, additional system capacity;
    (5) Identification of an implementation schedule, implementation 
responsibilities, and possible funding sources for each strategy (or 
combination of strategies) proposed for implementation; and
    (6) Implementation of a process for periodic assessment of the 
effectiveness of implemented strategies, in terms of the area's 
established performance measures. The results of this evaluation shall 
be provided to decisionmakers and the public to provide guidance on 
selection of effective strategies for future implementation.
    (d) In a TMA designated as nonattainment area for ozone or carbon 
monoxide pursuant to the Clean Air Act, Federal funds may not be 
programmed for any project that will result in a significant increase in 
the carrying capacity for SOVs (i.e., a new

[[Page 114]]

general purpose highway on a new location or adding general purpose 
lanes, with the exception of safety improvements or the elimination of 
bottlenecks), unless the project is addressed through a congestion 
management process meeting the requirements of this section.
    (e) In TMAs designated as nonattainment for ozone or carbon 
monoxide, the congestion management process shall provide an appropriate 
analysis of reasonable (including multimodal) travel demand reduction 
and operational management strategies for the corridor in which a 
project that will result in a significant increase in capacity for SOVs 
(as described in paragraph (d) of this section) is proposed to be 
advanced with Federal funds. If the analysis demonstrates that travel 
demand reduction and operational management strategies cannot fully 
satisfy the need for additional capacity in the corridor and additional 
SOV capacity is warranted, then the congestion management process shall 
identify all reasonable strategies to manage the SOV facility safely and 
effectively (or to facilitate its management in the future). Other 
travel demand reduction and operational management strategies 
appropriate for the corridor, but not appropriate for incorporation into 
the SOV facility itself, shall also be identified through the congestion 
management process. All identified reasonable travel demand reduction 
and operational management strategies shall be incorporated into the SOV 
project or committed to by the State and MPO for implementation.
    (f) State laws, rules, or regulations pertaining to congestion 
management systems or programs may constitute the congestion management 
process, if the FHWA and the FTA find that the State laws, rules, or 
regulations are consistent with, and fulfill the intent of, the purposes 
of 23 U.S.C. 134 and 49 U.S.C. 5303.


<R05>
Sec. 450.322  Development and content of the metropolitan transportation plan.

    (a) The metropolitan transportation planning process shall include 
the development of a transportation plan addressing no less than a 20-
year planning horizon as of the effective date. In nonattainment and 
maintenance areas, the effective date of the transportation plan shall 
be the date of a conformity determination issued by the FHWA and the 
FTA. In attainment areas, the effective date of the transportation plan 
shall be its date of adoption by the MPO.
    (b) The transportation plan shall include both long-range and short-
range strategies/actions that lead to the development of an integrated 
multimodal transportation system to facilitate the safe and efficient 
movement of people and goods in addressing current and future 
transportation demand.
    (c) The MPO shall review and update the transportation plan at least 
every four years in air quality nonattainment and maintenance areas and 
at least every five years in attainment areas to confirm the 
transportation plan's validity and consistency with current and 
forecasted transportation and land use conditions and trends and to 
extend the forecast period to at least a 20-year planning horizon. In 
addition, the MPO may revise the transportation plan at any time using 
the procedures in this section without a requirement to extend the 
horizon year. The transportation plan (and any revisions) shall be 
approved by the MPO and submitted for information purposes to the 
Governor. Copies of any updated or revised transportation plans must be 
provided to the FHWA and the FTA.
    (d) In metropolitan areas that are in nonattainment for ozone or 
carbon monoxide, the MPO shall coordinate the development of the 
metropolitan transportation plan with the process for developing 
transportation control measures (TCMs) in a State Implementation Plan 
(SIP).
    (e) The MPO, the State(s), and the public transportation operator(s) 
shall validate data utilized in preparing other existing modal plans for 
providing input to the transportation plan. In updating the 
transportation plan, the MPO shall base the update on the latest 
available estimates and assumptions for population, land use, travel, 
employment, congestion, and economic activity. The MPO shall approve 
transportation plan contents and

[[Page 115]]

supporting analyses produced by a transportation plan update.
    (f) The metropolitan transportation plan shall, at a minimum, 
include:
    (1) The projected transportation demand of persons and goods in the 
metropolitan planning area over the period of the transportation plan;
    (2) Existing and proposed transportation facilities (including major 
roadways, transit, multimodal and intermodal facilities, pedestrian 
walkways and bicycle facilities, and intermodal connectors) that should 
function as an integrated metropolitan transportation system, giving 
emphasis to those facilities that serve important national and regional 
transportation functions over the period of the transportation plan. In 
addition, the locally preferred alternative selected from an 
Alternatives Analysis under the FTA's Capital Investment Grant program 
(49 U.S.C. 5309 and 49 CFR part 611) needs to be adopted as part of the 
metropolitan transportation plan as a condition for funding under 49 
U.S.C. 5309;
    (3) Operational and management strategies to improve the performance 
of existing transportation facilities to relieve vehicular congestion 
and maximize the safety and mobility of people and goods;
    (4) Consideration of the results of the congestion management 
process in TMAs that meet the requirements of this subpart, including 
the identification of SOV projects that result from a congestion 
management process in TMAs that are nonattainment for ozone or carbon 
monoxide;
    (5) Assessment of capital investment and other strategies to 
preserve the existing and projected future metropolitan transportation 
infrastructure and provide for multimodal capacity increases based on 
regional priorities and needs. The metropolitan transportation plan may 
consider projects and strategies that address areas or corridors where 
current or projected congestion threatens the efficient functioning of 
key elements of the metropolitan area's transportation system;
    (6) Design concept and design scope descriptions of all existing and 
proposed transportation facilities in sufficient detail, regardless of 
funding source, in nonattainment and maintenance areas for conformity 
determinations under the EPA's transportation conformity rule (40 CFR 
part 93). In all areas (regardless of air quality designation), all 
proposed improvements shall be described in sufficient detail to develop 
cost estimates;
    (7) A discussion of types of potential environmental mitigation 
activities and potential areas to carry out these activities, including 
activities that may have the greatest potential to restore and maintain 
the environmental functions affected by the metropolitan transportation 
plan. The discussion may focus on policies, programs, or strategies, 
rather than at the project level. The discussion shall be developed in 
consultation with Federal, State, and Tribal land management, wildlife, 
and regulatory agencies. The MPO may establish reasonable timeframes for 
performing this consultation;
    (8) Pedestrian walkway and bicycle transportation facilities in 
accordance with 23 U.S.C. 217(g);
    (9) Transportation and transit enhancement activities, as 
appropriate; and
    (10) A financial plan that demonstrates how the adopted 
transportation plan can be implemented.
    (i) For purposes of transportation system operations and 
maintenance, the financial plan shall contain system-level estimates of 
costs and revenue sources that are reasonably expected to be available 
to adequately operate and maintain Federal-aid highways (as defined by 
23 U.S.C. 101(a)(5)) and public transportation (as defined by title 49 
U.S.C. Chapter 53).
    (ii) For the purpose of developing the metropolitan transportation 
plan, the MPO, public transportation operator(s), and State shall 
cooperatively develop estimates of funds that will be available to 
support metropolitan transportation plan implementation, as required 
under Sec. 450.314(a). All necessary financial resources from public 
and private sources that are reasonably expected to be made available to 
carry out the transportation plan shall be identified.
    (iii) The financial plan shall include recommendations on any 
additional financing strategies to fund projects and programs included 
in the metropolitan

[[Page 116]]

transportation plan. In the case of new funding sources, strategies for 
ensuring their availability shall be identified.
    (iv) In developing the financial plan, the MPO shall take into 
account all projects and strategies proposed for funding under title 23 
U.S.C., title 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53 or with other Federal funds; State 
assistance; local sources; and private participation. Starting December 
11, 2007, revenue and cost estimates that support the metropolitan 
transportation plan must use an inflation rate(s) to reflect ``year of 
expenditure dollars,'' based on reasonable financial principles and 
information, developed cooperatively by the MPO, State(s), and public 
transportation operator(s).
    (v) For the outer years of the metropolitan transportation plan 
(i.e., beyond the first 10 years), the financial plan may reflect 
aggregate cost ranges/cost bands, as long as the future funding 
source(s) is reasonably expected to be available to support the 
projected cost ranges/cost bands.
    (vi) For nonattainment and maintenance areas, the financial plan 
shall address the specific financial strategies required to ensure the 
implementation of TCMs in the applicable SIP.
    (vii) For illustrative purposes, the financial plan may (but is not 
required to) include additional projects that would be included in the 
adopted transportation plan if additional resources beyond those 
identified in the financial plan were to become available.
    (viii) In cases that the FHWA and the FTA find a metropolitan 
transportation plan to be fiscally constrained and a revenue source is 
subsequently removed or substantially reduced (i.e., by legislative or 
administrative actions), the FHWA and the FTA will not withdraw the 
original determination of fiscal constraint; however, in such cases, the 
FHWA and the FTA will not act on an updated or amended metropolitan 
transportation plan that does not reflect the changed revenue situation.
    (g) The MPO shall consult, as appropriate, with State and local 
agencies responsible for land use management, natural resources, 
environmental protection, conservation, and historic preservation 
concerning the development of the transportation plan. The consultation 
shall involve, as appropriate:
    (1) Comparison of transportation plans with State conservation plans 
or maps, if available; or
    (2) Comparison of transportation plans to inventories of natural or 
historic resources, if available.
    (h) The metropolitan transportation plan should include a safety 
element that incorporates or summarizes the priorities, goals, 
countermeasures, or projects for the MPA contained in the Strategic 
Highway Safety Plan required under 23 U.S.C. 148, as well as (as 
appropriate) emergency relief and disaster preparedness plans and 
strategies and policies that support homeland security (as appropriate) 
and safeguard the personal security of all motorized and non-motorized 
users.
    (i) The MPO shall provide citizens, affected public agencies, 
representatives of public transportation employees, freight shippers, 
providers of freight transportation services, private providers of 
transportation, representatives of users of public transportation, 
representatives of users of pedestrian walkways and bicycle 
transportation facilities, representatives of the disabled, and other 
interested parties with a reasonable opportunity to comment on the 
transportation plan using the participation plan developed under Sec. 
450.316(a).
    (j) The metropolitan transportation plan shall be published or 
otherwise made readily available by the MPO for public review, including 
(to the maximum extent practicable) in electronically accessible formats 
and means, such as the World Wide Web.
    (k) A State or MPO shall not be required to select any project from 
the illustrative list of additional projects included in the financial 
plan under paragraph (f)(10) of this section.
    (l) In nonattainment and maintenance areas for transportation-
related pollutants, the MPO, as well as the FHWA and the FTA, must make 
a conformity determination on any updated or amended transportation plan 
in accordance with the Clean Air Act and the EPA transportation 
conformity regulations (40 CFR part 93). During a conformity lapse, MPOs 
can prepare an

[[Page 117]]

interim metropolitan transportation plan as a basis for advancing 
projects that are eligible to proceed under a conformity lapse. An 
interim metropolitan transportation plan consisting of eligible projects 
from, or consistent with, the most recent conforming transportation plan 
and TIP may proceed immediately without revisiting the requirements of 
this section, subject to interagency consultation defined in 40 CFR part 
93. An interim metropolitan transportation plan containing eligible 
projects that are not from, or consistent with, the most recent 
conforming transportation plan and TIP must meet all the requirements of 
this section.


<R05>
Sec. 450.324  Development and content of the transportation improvement program (TIP).

    (a) The MPO, in cooperation with the State(s) and any affected 
public transportation operator(s), shall develop a TIP for the 
metropolitan planning area. The TIP shall cover a period of no less than 
four years, be updated at least every four years, and be approved by the 
MPO and the Governor. However, if the TIP covers more than four years, 
the FHWA and the FTA will consider the projects in the additional years 
as informational. The TIP may be updated more frequently, but the cycle 
for updating the TIP must be compatible with the STIP development and 
approval process. The TIP expires when the FHWA/FTA approval of the STIP 
expires. Copies of any updated or revised TIPs must be provided to the 
FHWA and the FTA. In nonattainment and maintenance areas subject to 
transportation conformity requirements, the FHWA and the FTA, as well as 
the MPO, must make a conformity determination on any updated or amended 
TIP, in accordance with the Clean Air Act requirements and the EPA's 
transportation conformity regulations (40 CFR part 93).
    (b) The MPO shall provide all interested parties with a reasonable 
opportunity to comment on the proposed TIP as required by Sec. 
450.316(a). In addition, in nonattainment area TMAs, the MPO shall 
provide at least one formal public meeting during the TIP development 
process, which should be addressed through the participation plan 
described in Sec. 450.316(a). In addition, the TIP shall be published 
or otherwise made readily available by the MPO for public review, 
including (to the maximum extent practicable) in electronically 
accessible formats and means, such as the World Wide Web, as described 
in Sec. 450.316(a).
    (c) The TIP shall include capital and non-capital surface 
transportation projects (or phases of projects) within the boundaries of 
the metropolitan planning area proposed for funding under 23 U.S.C. and 
49 U.S.C. Chapter 53 (including transportation enhancements; Federal 
Lands Highway program projects; safety projects included in the State's 
Strategic Highway Safety Plan; trails projects; pedestrian walkways; and 
bicycle facilities), except the following that may (but are not required 
to) be included:
    (1) Safety projects funded under 23 U.S.C. 402 and 49 U.S.C. 31102;
    (2) Metropolitan planning projects funded under 23 U.S.C. 104(f), 49 
U.S.C. 5305(d), and 49 U.S.C. 5339;
    (3) State planning and research projects funded under 23 U.S.C. 505 
and 49 U.S.C. 5305(e);
    (4) At the discretion of the State and MPO, State planning and 
research projects funded with National Highway System, Surface 
Transportation Program, and/or Equity Bonus funds;
    (5) Emergency relief projects (except those involving substantial 
functional, locational, or capacity changes);
    (6) National planning and research projects funded under 49 U.S.C. 
5314; and
    (7) Project management oversight projects funded under 49 U.S.C. 
5327.
    (d) The TIP shall contain all regionally significant projects 
requiring an action by the FHWA or the FTA whether or not the projects 
are to be funded under title 23 U.S.C. Chapters 1 and 2 or title 49 
U.S.C. Chapter 53 (e.g., addition of an interchange to the Interstate 
System with State, local, and/or private funds and congressionally 
designated projects not funded under 23 U.S.C. or 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53). 
For public information and conformity purposes, the TIP shall include 
all regionally significant projects proposed to be funded with Federal 
funds other than

[[Page 118]]

those administered by the FHWA or the FTA, as well as all regionally 
significant projects to be funded with non-Federal funds.
    (e) The TIP shall include, for each project or phase (e.g., 
preliminary engineering, environment/NEPA, right-of-way, design, or 
construction), the following:
    (1) Sufficient descriptive material (i.e., type of work, termini, 
and length) to identify the project or phase;
    (2) Estimated total project cost, which may extend beyond the four 
years of the TIP;
    (3) The amount of Federal funds proposed to be obligated during each 
program year for the project or phase (for the first year, this includes 
the proposed category of Federal funds and source(s) of non-Federal 
funds. For the second, third, and fourth years, this includes the likely 
category or possible categories of Federal funds and sources of non-
Federal funds);
    (4) Identification of the agencies responsible for carrying out the 
project or phase;
    (5) In nonattainment and maintenance areas, identification of those 
projects which are identified as TCMs in the applicable SIP;
    (6) In nonattainment and maintenance areas, included projects shall 
be specified in sufficient detail (design concept and scope) for air 
quality analysis in accordance with the EPA transportation conformity 
regulation (40 CFR part 93); and
    (7) In areas with Americans with Disabilities Act required 
paratransit and key station plans, identification of those projects that 
will implement these plans.
    (f) Projects that are not considered to be of appropriate scale for 
individual identification in a given program year may be grouped by 
function, work type, and/or geographic area using the applicable 
classifications under 23 CFR 771.117(c) and (d) and/or 40 CFR part 93. 
In nonattainment and maintenance areas, project classifications must be 
consistent with the ``exempt project'' classifications contained in the 
EPA transportation conformity regulation (40 CFR part 93). In addition, 
projects proposed for funding under title 23 U.S.C. Chapter 2 that are 
not regionally significant may be grouped in one line item or identified 
individually in the TIP.
    (g) Each project or project phase included in the TIP shall be 
consistent with the approved metropolitan transportation plan.
    (h) The TIP shall include a financial plan that demonstrates how the 
approved TIP can be implemented, indicates resources from public and 
private sources that are reasonably expected to be made available to 
carry out the TIP, and recommends any additional financing strategies 
for needed projects and programs. In developing the TIP, the MPO, 
State(s), and public transportation operator(s) shall cooperatively 
develop estimates of funds that are reasonably expected to be available 
to support TIP implementation, in accordance with Sec. 450.314(a). Only 
projects for which construction or operating funds can reasonably be 
expected to be available may be included. In the case of new funding 
sources, strategies for ensuring their availability shall be identified. 
In developing the financial plan, the MPO shall take into account all 
projects and strategies funded under title 23 U.S.C., title 49 U.S.C. 
Chapter 53 and other Federal funds; and regionally significant projects 
that are not federally funded. For purposes of transportation operations 
and maintenance, the financial plan shall contain system-level estimates 
of costs and revenue sources that are reasonably expected to be 
available to adequately operate and maintain Federal-aid highways (as 
defined by 23 U.S.C. 101(a)(5)) and public transportation (as defined by 
title 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53). In addition, for illustrative purposes, the 
financial plan may (but is not required to) include additional projects 
that would be included in the TIP if reasonable additional resources 
beyond those identified in the financial plan were to become available. 
Starting December 11, 2007, revenue and cost estimates for the TIP must 
use an inflation rate(s) to reflect ``year of expenditure dollars,'' 
based on reasonable financial principles and information, developed 
cooperatively by the MPO, State(s), and public transportation 
operator(s).
    (i) The TIP shall include a project, or a phase of a project, only 
if full funding

[[Page 119]]

can reasonably be anticipated to be available for the project within the 
time period contemplated for completion of the project. In nonattainment 
and maintenance areas, projects included in the first two years of the 
TIP shall be limited to those for which funds are available or 
committed. For the TIP, financial constraint shall be demonstrated and 
maintained by year and shall include sufficient financial information to 
demonstrate which projects are to be implemented using current and/or 
reasonably available revenues, while federally supported facilities are 
being adequately operated and maintained. In the case of proposed 
funding sources, strategies for ensuring their availability shall be 
identified in the financial plan consistent with paragraph (h) of this 
section. In nonattainment and maintenance areas, the TIP shall give 
priority to eligible TCMs identified in the approved SIP in accordance 
with the EPA transportation conformity regulation (40 CFR part 93) and 
shall provide for their timely implementation.
    (j) Procedures or agreements that distribute suballocated Surface 
Transportation Program funds or funds under 49 U.S.C. 5307 to individual 
jurisdictions or modes within the MPA by pre-determined percentages or 
formulas are inconsistent with the legislative provisions that require 
the MPO, in cooperation with the State and the public transportation 
operator, to develop a prioritized and financially constrained TIP and 
shall not be used unless they can be clearly shown to be based on 
considerations required to be addressed as part of the metropolitan 
transportation planning process.
    (k) For the purpose of including projects funded under 49 U.S.C. 
5309 in a TIP, the following approach shall be followed:
    (1) The total Federal share of projects included in the first year 
of the TIP shall not exceed levels of funding committed to the MPA; and
    (2) The total Federal share of projects included in the second, 
third, fourth, and/or subsequent years of the TIP may not exceed levels 
of funding committed, or reasonably expected to be available, to the 
MPA.
    (l) As a management tool for monitoring progress in implementing the 
transportation plan, the TIP should:
    (1) Identify the criteria and process for prioritizing 
implementation of transportation plan elements (including multimodal 
trade-offs) for inclusion in the TIP and any changes in priorities from 
previous TIPs;
    (2) List major projects from the previous TIP that were implemented 
and identify any significant delays in the planned implementation of 
major projects; and
    (3) In nonattainment and maintenance areas, describe the progress in 
implementing any required TCMs, in accordance with 40 CFR part 93.
    (m) During a conformity lapse, MPOs may prepare an interim TIP as a 
basis for advancing projects that are eligible to proceed under a 
conformity lapse. An interim TIP consisting of eligible projects from, 
or consistent with, the most recent conforming metropolitan 
transportation plan and TIP may proceed immediately without revisiting 
the requirements of this section, subject to interagency consultation 
defined in 40 CFR part 93. An interim TIP containing eligible projects 
that are not from, or consistent with, the most recent conforming 
transportation plan and TIP must meet all the requirements of this 
section.
    (n) Projects in any of the first four years of the TIP may be 
advanced in place of another project in the first four years of the TIP, 
subject to the project selection requirements of Sec. 450.330. In 
addition, the TIP may be revised at any time under procedures agreed to 
by the State, MPO(s), and public transportation operator(s) consistent 
with the TIP development procedures established in this section, as well 
as the procedures for the MPO participation plan (see Sec. 450.316(a)) 
and FHWA/FTA actions on the TIP (see Sec. 450.328).
    (o) In cases that the FHWA and the FTA find a TIP to be fiscally 
constrained and a revenue source is subsequently removed or 
substantially reduced (i.e., by legislative or administrative actions), 
the FHWA and the FTA will not withdraw the original determination of 
fiscal constraint. However, in such cases, the FHWA and the

[[Page 120]]

FTA will not act on an updated or amended TIP that does not reflect the 
changed revenue situation.

<R05>
Sec. 450.326  TIP revisions and relationship to the STIP.

    (a) An MPO may revise the TIP at any time under procedures agreed to 
by the cooperating parties consistent with the procedures established in 
this part for its development and approval. In nonattainment or 
maintenance areas for transportation-related pollutants, if a TIP 
amendment involves non-exempt projects (per 40 CFR part 93), or is 
replaced with an updated TIP, the MPO and the FHWA and the FTA must make 
a new conformity determination. In all areas, changes that affect fiscal 
constraint must take place by amendment of the TIP. Public participation 
procedures consistent with Sec. 450.316(a) shall be utilized in 
revising the TIP, except that these procedures are not required for 
administrative modifications.
    (b) After approval by the MPO and the Governor, the TIP shall be 
included without change, directly or by reference, in the STIP required 
under 23 U.S.C. 135. In nonattainment and maintenance areas, a 
conformity finding on the TIP must be made by the FHWA and the FTA 
before it is included in the STIP. A copy of the approved TIP shall be 
provided to the FHWA and the FTA.
    (c) The State shall notify the MPO and Federal land management 
agencies when a TIP including projects under the jurisdiction of these 
agencies has been included in the STIP.


<R05>
Sec. 450.328  TIP action by the FHWA and the FTA.

    (a) The FHWA and the FTA shall jointly find that each metropolitan 
TIP is consistent with the metropolitan transportation plan produced by 
the continuing and comprehensive transportation process carried on 
cooperatively by the MPO(s), the State(s), and the public transportation 
operator(s) in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 134 and 49 U.S.C. 5303. This 
finding shall be based on the self-certification statement submitted by 
the State and MPO under Sec. 450.334, a review of the metropolitan 
transportation plan by the FHWA and the FTA, and upon other reviews as 
deemed necessary by the FHWA and the FTA.
    (b) In nonattainment and maintenance areas, the MPO, as well as the 
FHWA and the FTA, shall determine conformity of any updated or amended 
TIP, in accordance with 40 CFR part 93. After the FHWA and the FTA issue 
a conformity determination on the TIP, the TIP shall be incorporated, 
without change, into the STIP, directly or by reference.
    (c) If the metropolitan transportation plan has not been updated in 
accordance with the cycles defined in Sec. 450.322(c), projects may 
only be advanced from a TIP that was approved and found to conform (in 
nonattainment and maintenance areas) prior to expiration of the 
metropolitan transportation plan and meets the TIP update requirements 
of Sec. 450.324(a). Until the MPO approves (in attainment areas) or the 
FHWA/FTA issues a conformity determination on (in nonattainment and 
maintenance areas) the updated metropolitan transportation plan, the TIP 
may not be amended.
    (d) In the case of extenuating circumstances, the FHWA and the FTA 
will consider and take appropriate action on requests to extend the STIP 
approval period for all or part of the TIP in accordance with Sec. 
450.218(c).
    (e) If an illustrative project is included in the TIP, no Federal 
action may be taken on that project by the FHWA and the FTA until it is 
formally included in the financially constrained and conforming 
metropolitan transportation plan and TIP.
    (f) Where necessary in order to maintain or establish operations, 
the FHWA and the FTA may approve highway and transit operating 
assistance for specific projects or programs, even though the projects 
or programs may not be included in an approved TIP.


<R05>
Sec. 450.330  Project selection from the TIP.

    (a) Once a TIP that meets the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 134(j), 49 
U.S.C. 5303(j), and Sec. 450.324 has been developed and approved, the 
first year of the TIP shall constitute an ``agreed to'' list of projects 
for project selection purposes and no further project selection action

[[Page 121]]

is required for the implementing agency to proceed with projects, except 
where the appropriated Federal funds available to the metropolitan 
planning area are significantly less than the authorized amounts or 
where there are significant shifting of projects between years. In this 
case, a revised ``agreed to'' list of projects shall be jointly 
developed by the MPO, the State, and the public transportation 
operator(s) if requested by the MPO, the State, or the public 
transportation operator(s). If the State or public transportation 
operator(s) wishes to proceed with a project in the second, third, or 
fourth year of the TIP, the specific project selection procedures stated 
in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section must be used unless the MPO, 
the State, and the public transportation operator(s) jointly develop 
expedited project selection procedures to provide for the advancement of 
projects from the second, third, or fourth years of the TIP.
    (b) In metropolitan areas not designated as TMAs, projects to be 
implemented using title 23 U.S.C. funds (other than Federal Lands 
Highway program projects) or funds under title 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53, 
shall be selected by the State and/or the public transportation 
operator(s), in cooperation with the MPO from the approved metropolitan 
TIP. Federal Lands Highway program projects shall be selected in 
accordance with procedures developed pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 204.
    (c) In areas designated as TMAs, all 23 U.S.C. and 49 U.S.C. Chapter 
53 funded projects (excluding projects on the National Highway System 
(NHS) and projects funded under the Bridge, Interstate Maintenance, and 
Federal Lands Highway programs) shall be selected by the MPO in 
consultation with the State and public transportation operator(s) from 
the approved TIP and in accordance with the priorities in the approved 
TIP. Projects on the NHS and projects funded under the Bridge and 
Interstate Maintenance programs shall be selected by the State in 
cooperation with the MPO, from the approved TIP. Federal Lands Highway 
program projects shall be selected in accordance with procedures 
developed pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 204.
    (d) Except as provided in Sec. 450.324(c) and Sec. 450.328(f), 
projects not included in the federally approved STIP shall not be 
eligible for funding with funds under title 23 U.S.C. or 49 U.S.C. 
Chapter 53.
    (e) In nonattainment and maintenance areas, priority shall be given 
to the timely implementation of TCMs contained in the applicable SIP in 
accordance with the EPA transportation conformity regulations (40 CFR 
part 93).


<R05>
Sec. 450.332  Annual listing of obligated projects.

    (a) In metropolitan planning areas, on an annual basis, no later 
than 90 calendar days following the end of the program year, the State, 
public transportation operator(s), and the MPO shall cooperatively 
develop a listing of projects (including investments in pedestrian 
walkways and bicycle transportation facilities) for which funds under 23 
U.S.C. or 49 U.S.C. Chapter 53 were obligated in the preceding program 
year.
    (b) The listing shall be prepared in accordance with Sec. 
450.314(a) and shall include all federally funded projects authorized or 
revised to increase obligations in the preceding program year, and shall 
at a minimum include the TIP information under Sec. 450.324(e)(1) and 
(4) and identify, for each project, the amount of Federal funds 
requested in the TIP, the Federal funding that was obligated during the 
preceding year, and the Federal funding remaining and available for 
subsequent years.
    (c) The listing shall be published or otherwise made available in 
accordance with the MPO's public participation criteria for the TIP.


<R05>
Sec. 450.334  Self-certifications and Federal certifications.

    (a) For all MPAs, concurrent with the submittal of the entire 
proposed TIP to the FHWA and the FTA as part of the STIP approval, the 
State and the MPO shall certify at least every four years that the 
metropolitan transportation planning process is being carried out in 
accordance with all applicable requirements including:
    (1) 23 U.S.C. 134, 49 U.S.C. 5303, and this subpart;

[[Page 122]]

    (2) In nonattainment and maintenance areas, sections 174 and 176 (c)

(d)) and 40 CFR part 93;
    (3) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (42 U.S.C. 
2000d-1) and 49 CFR part 21;
    (4) 49 U.S.C. 5332, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, 
color, creed, national origin, sex, or age in employment or business 
opportunity;
    (5) Section 1101(b) of the SAFETEA-LU (Pub. L. 109-59) and 49 CFR 
part 26 regarding the involvement of disadvantaged business enterprises 
in USDOT funded projects;
    (6) 23 CFR part 230, regarding the implementation of an equal 
employment opportunity program on Federal and Federal-aid highway 
construction contracts;
    (7) The provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 
(42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) and 49 CFR parts 27, 37, and 38;
    (8) The Older Americans Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 6101), 
prohibiting discrimination on the basis of age in programs or activities 
receiving Federal financial assistance;
    (9) Section 324 of title 23 U.S.C. regarding the prohibition of 
discrimination based on gender; and
    (10) Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) 
and 49 CFR part 27 regarding discrimination against individuals with 
disabilities.
    (b) In TMAs, the FHWA and the FTA jointly shall review and evaluate 
the transportation planning process for each TMA no less than once every 
four years to determine if the process meets the requirements of 
applicable provisions of Federal law and this subpart.
    (1) After review and evaluation of the TMA planning process, the 
FHWA and FTA shall take one of the following actions:
    (i) If the process meets the requirements of this part and a TIP has 
been approved by the MPO and the Governor, jointly certify the 
transportation planning process;
    (ii) If the process substantially meets the requirements of this 
part and a TIP has been approved by the MPO and the Governor, jointly 
certify the transportation planning process subject to certain specified 
corrective actions being taken; or
    (iii) If the process does not meet the requirements of this part, 
jointly certify the planning process as the basis for approval of only 
those categories of programs or projects that the FHWA and the FTA 
jointly determine, subject to certain specified corrective actions being 
taken.
    (2) If, upon the review and evaluation conducted under paragraph 
(b)(1)(iii) of this section, the FHWA and the FTA do not certify the 
transportation planning process in a TMA, the Secretary may withhold up 
to 20 percent of the funds attributable to the metropolitan planning 
area of the MPO for projects funded under title 23 U.S.C. and title 49 
U.S.C. Chapter 53 in addition to corrective actions and funding 
restrictions. The withheld funds shall be restored to the MPA when the 
metropolitan transportation planning process is certified by the FHWA 
and FTA, unless the funds have lapsed.
    (3) A certification of the TMA planning process will remain in 
effect for four years unless a new certification determination is made 
sooner by the FHWA and the FTA or a shorter term is specified in the 
certification report.
    (4) In conducting a certification review, the FHWA and the FTA shall 
provide opportunities for public involvement within the metropolitan 
planning area under review. The FHWA and the FTA shall consider the 
public input received in arriving at a decision on a certification 
action.
    (5) The MPO(s), the State(s), and public transportation operator(s) 
shall be notified of the actions taken under paragraphs (b)(1) and 
(b)(2) of this section. The FHWA and the FTA will update the 
certification status of the TMA when evidence of satisfactory completion 
of a corrective action(s) is provided to the FHWA and the FTA.

  Sec. Appendix A to Part 450--Linking the Transportation Planning and 
                             NEPA Processes

                        Background and Overview:

    This Appendix provides additional information to explain the linkage 
between the transportation planning and project development/National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) processes. It is intended to be non-
binding and should not be construed as a rule of general applicability.
    For 40 years, the Congress has directed that federally-funded 
highway and transit projects must flow from metropolitan and statewide 
transportation planning processes (pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 134-135 and 49 
U.S.C. 5303-5306). Over the years, the Congress has refined and 
strengthened the transportation planning process as the foundation for 
project decisions, emphasizing public involvement, consideration of 
environmental and other factors, and a Federal role that oversees the 
transportation planning process but does not second-guess the content of 
transportation plans and programs.
    Despite this statutory emphasis on transportation planning, the 
environmental analyses produced to meet the requirements of the NEPA of 
1969 (42 U.S.C. 4231 et seq.) have often been conducted de novo, 
disconnected from the analyses used to develop long-range transportation 
plans, statewide and metropolitan Transportation Improvement Programs 
(STIPs/TIPs), or planning-level corridor/subarea/feasibility studies. 
When the NEPA and transportation planning processes are not well 
coordinated, the NEPA process may lead to the development of information 
that is more appropriately developed in the planning process, resulting 
in duplication of work and delays in transportation improvements.
    The purpose of this Appendix is to change this culture, by 
supporting congressional intent that statewide and metropolitan 
transportation planning should be the foundation for highway and transit 
project decisions. This Appendix was crafted to recognize that 
transportation planning processes vary across the country. This document 
provides details on how information, analysis, and products from 
transportation planning can be incorporated into and relied upon in NEPA 
documents under existing laws, regardless of when the Notice of Intent 
has been published. This Appendix presents environmental review as a 
continuum of sequential study, refinement, and expansion performed in 
transportation planning and during project development/NEPA, with 
information developed and conclusions drawn in early stages utilized in 
subsequent (and more detailed) review stages.
    The information below is intended for use by State departments of 
transportation

[[Page 124]]

(State DOTs), metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), and public 
transportation operators to clarify the circumstances under which 
transportation planning level choices and analyses can be adopted or 
incorporated into the process required by NEPA. Additionally, the FHWA 
and the FTA will work with Federal environmental, regulatory, and 
resource agencies to incorporate the principles of this Appendix in 
their day-to-day NEPA policies and procedures related to their 
involvement in highway and transit projects.
    This Appendix does not extend NEPA requirements to transportation 
plans and programs. The Transportation Efficiency Act for the 21st 
Century (TEA-21) and the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient 
Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) specifically 
exempted transportation plans and programs from NEPA review. Therefore, 
initiating the NEPA process as part of, or concurrently with, a 
transportation planning study does not subject transportation plans and 
programs to NEPA.
    Implementation of this Appendix by States, MPOs, and public 
transportation operators is voluntary. The degree to which studies, 
analyses, or conclusions from the transportation planning process can be 
incorporated into the project development/NEPA processes will depend 
upon how well they meet certain standards established by NEPA 
regulations and guidance. While some transportation planning processes 
already meet these standards, others will need some modification.
    The remainder of this Appendix document utilizes a ``Question and 
Answer'' format, organized into three primary categories (``Procedural 
Issues,'' ``Substantive Issues,'' and ``Administrative Issues'').

                          I. Procedural Issues:

    1. In what format should the transportation planning information be 
included?
    To be included in the NEPA process, work from the transportation 
planning process must be documented in a form that can be appended to 
the NEPA document or incorporated by reference. Documents may be 
incorporated by reference if they are readily available so as to not 
impede agency or public review of the action. Any document incorporated 
by reference must be ``reasonably available for inspection by 
potentially interested persons within the time allowed for comment.'' 
Incorporated materials must be cited in the NEPA document and their 
contents briefly described, so that the reader understands why the 
document is cited and knows where to look for further information. To 
the extent possible, the documentation should be in a form such as 
official actions by the MPO, State DOT, or public transportation 
operator and/or correspondence within and among the organizations 
involved in the transportation planning process.
    2. What is a reasonable level of detail for a planning product that 
is intended to be used in a NEPA document? How does this level of detail 
compare to what is considered a full NEPA analysis?
    For purposes of transportation planning alone, a planning-level 
analysis does not need to rise to the level of detail required in the 
NEPA process. Rather, it needs to be accurate and up-to-date, and should 
adequately support recommended improvements in the statewide or 
metropolitan long-range transportation plan. The SAFETEA-LU requires 
transportation planning processes to focus on setting a context and 
following acceptable procedures. For example, the SAFETEA-LU requires a 
``discussion of the types of potential environmental mitigation 
activities'' and potential areas for their implementation, rather than 
details on specific strategies. The SAFETEA-LU also emphasizes 
consultation with Federal, State, and Tribal land management, wildlife, 
and regulatory agencies.
    However, the Environmental Assessment (EA) or Environmental Impact 
Statement (EIS) ultimately will be judged by the standards applicable 
under the NEPA regulations and guidance from the Council on 
Environmental Quality (CEQ). To the extent the information incorporated 
from the transportation planning process, standing alone, does not 
contain all of the information or analysis required by NEPA, then it 
will need to be supplemented by other information contained in the EIS 
or EA that would, in conjunction with the information from the plan, 
collectively meet the requirements of NEPA. The intent is not to require 
NEPA studies in the transportation planning process. As an option, the 
NEPA analyses prepared for project development can be integrated with 
transportation planning studies (see the response to Question 9 for 
additional information).
    3. What type and extent of involvement from Federal, Tribal, State, 
and local environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies is needed in 
the transportation planning process in order for planning-level 
decisions to be more readily accepted in the NEPA process?
    Sections 3005, 3006, and 6001 of the SAFETEA-LU established formal 
consultation requirements for MPOs and State DOTs to employ with 
environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies in the development of 
long-range transportation plans. For example, metropolitan 
transportation plans now ``shall include a discussion of the types of 
potential environmental mitigation activities and potential areas to 
carry out these activities, including activities that may have the 
greatest potential to restore and maintain the environmental functions 
affected by the

[[Page 125]]

[transportation] plan,'' and that these planning-level discussions 
``shall be developed in consultation with Federal, State, and Tribal 
land management, wildlife, and regulatory agencies.'' In addition, MPOs 
``shall consult, as appropriate, with State and local agencies 
responsible for land use management, natural resources, environmental 
protection, conservation, and historic preservation concerning the 
development of a long-range transportation plan,'' and that this 
consultation ``shall involve, as appropriate, comparison of 
transportation plans with State conservation plans or maps, if 
available, or comparison of transportation plans to inventories of 
natural or historic resources, if available.'' Similar SAFETEA-LU 
language addresses the development of the long-range statewide 
transportation plan, with the addition of Tribal conservation plans or 
maps to this planning-level ``comparison.''
    In addition, section 6002 of the SAFETEA-LU established several 
mechanisms for increased efficiency in environmental reviews for project 
decision-making. For example, the term ``lead agency'' collectively 
means the U. S. Department of Transportation and a State or local 
governmental entity serving as a joint lead agency for the NEPA process. 
In addition, the lead agency is responsible for inviting and designating 
``participating agencies'' (i.e., other Federal or non-Federal agencies 
that may have an interest in the proposed project). Any Federal agency 
that is invited by the lead agency to participate in the environmental 
review process for a project shall be designated as a participating 
agency by the lead agency unless the invited agency informs the lead 
agency, in writing, by the deadline specified in the invitation that the 
invited agency:
    (a) Has no jurisdiction or authority with respect to the project; 
(b) has no expertise or information relevant to the project; and (c) 
does not intend to submit comments on the project.
    Past successful examples of using transportation planning products 
in NEPA analysis are based on early and continuous involvement of 
environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies. Without this early 
coordination, environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies are more 
likely to expect decisions made or analyses conducted in the 
transportation planning process to be revisited during the NEPA process. 
Early participation in transportation planning provides environmental, 
regulatory, and resource agencies better insight into the needs and 
objectives of the locality. Additionally, early participation provides 
an important opportunity for environmental, regulatory, and resource 
agency concerns to be identified and addressed early in the process, 
such as those related to permit applications. Moreover, Federal, Tribal, 
State, and local environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies are 
able to share data on particular resources, which can play a critical 
role in determining the feasibility of a transportation solution with 
respect to environmental impacts. The use of other agency planning 
outputs can result in a transportation project that could support 
multiple goals (transportation, environmental, and community). Further, 
planning decisions by these other agencies may have impacts on long-
range transportation plans and/or the STIP/TIP, thereby providing 
important input to the transportation planning process and advancing 
integrated decision-making.
    4. What is the procedure for using decisions or analyses from the 
transportation planning process?
    The lead agencies jointly decide, and must agree, on what processes 
and consultation techniques are used to determine the transportation 
planning products that will be incorporated into the NEPA process. At a 
minimum, a robust scoping/early coordination process (which explains to 
Federal and State environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies and 
the public the information and/or analyses utilized to develop the 
planning products, how the purpose and need was developed and refined, 
and how the design concept and scope were determined) should play a 
critical role in leading to informed decisions by the lead agencies on 
the suitability of the transportation planning information, analyses, 
documents, and decisions for use in the NEPA process. As part of a 
rigorous scoping/early coordination process, the FHWA and the FTA should 
ensure that the transportation planning results are appropriately 
documented, shared, and used.
    5. To what extent can the FHWA/FTA provide up-front assurance that 
decisions and additional investments made in the transportation planning 
process will allow planning-level decisions and analyses to be used in 
the NEPA process?
    There are no guarantees. However, the potential is greatly improved 
for transportation planning processes that address the ``3-C'' planning 
principles (comprehensive, cooperative, and continuous); incorporate the 
intent of NEPA through the consideration of natural, physical, and 
social effects; involve environmental, regulatory, and resource 
agencies; thoroughly document the transportation planning process 
information, analysis, and decision; and vet the planning results 
through the applicable public involvement processes.
    6. What considerations will the FHWA/FTA take into account in their 
review of transportation planning products for acceptance in project 
development/NEPA?
    The FHWA and the FTA will give deference to decisions resulting from 
the transportation planning process if the FHWA and FTA determine that 
the planning process is

[[Page 126]]

consistent with the ``3-C'' planning principles and when the planning 
study process, alternatives considered, and resulting decisions have a 
rational basis that is thoroughly documented and vetted through the 
applicable public involvement processes. Moreover, any applicable 
program-specific requirements (e.g., those of the Congestion Mitigation 
and Air Quality Improvement Program or the FTA's Capital Investment 
Grant program) also must be met.
    The NEPA requires that the FHWA and the FTA be able to stand behind 
the overall soundness and credibility of analyses conducted and 
decisions made during the transportation planning process if they are 
incorporated into a NEPA document. For example, if systems-level or 
other broad objectives or choices from the transportation plan are 
incorporated into the purpose and need statement for a NEPA document, 
the FHWA and the FTA should not revisit whether these are the best 
objectives or choices among other options. Rather, the FHWA and the FTA 
review would include making sure that objectives or choices derived from 
the transportation plan were: Based on transportation planning factors 
established by Federal law; reflect a credible and articulated planning 
rationale; founded on reliable data; and developed through 
transportation planning processes meeting FHWA and FTA statutory and 
regulatory requirements. In addition, the basis for the goals and 
choices must be documented and included in the NEPA document. The FHWA/
FTA reviewers do not need to review whether assumptions or analytical 
methods used in the studies are the best available, but, instead, need 
to assure that such assumptions or analytical methods are reasonable, 
scientifically acceptable, and consistent with goals, objectives, and 
policies set forth in long-range transportation plans. This review would 
include determining whether: (a) Assumptions have a rational basis and 
are up-to-date and (b) data, analytical methods, and modeling techniques 
are reliable, defensible, reasonably current, and meet data quality 
requirements.

                         II. Substantive Issues

    General Issues To Be Considered:
    7. What should be considered in order to rely upon transportation 
planning studies in NEPA?
    The following questions should be answered prior to accepting 
studies conducted during the transportation planning process for use in 
NEPA. While not a ``checklist,'' these questions are intended to guide 
the practitioner's analysis of the planning products:
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> How much time has passed since the planning 
studies and corresponding decisions were made?
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Were the future year policy assumptions used in 
the transportation planning process related to land use, economic 
development, transportation costs, and network expansion consistent with 
those to be used in the NEPA process?
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Is the information still relevant/valid?
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> What changes have occurred in the area since the 
study was completed?
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Is the information in a format that can be 
appended to an environmental document or reformatted to do so?
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Are the analyses in a planning-level report or 
document based on data, analytical methods, and modeling techniques that 
are reliable, defensible, and consistent with those used in other 
regional transportation studies and project development activities?
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Were the FHWA and FTA, other agencies, and the 
public involved in the relevant planning analysis and the corresponding 
planning decisions?
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Were the planning products available to other 
agencies and the public during NEPA scoping?
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> During NEPA scoping, was a clear connection 
between the decisions made in planning and those to be made during the 
project development stage explained to the public and others? What was 
the response?
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Are natural resource and land use plans being 
informed by transportation planning products, and vice versa?
    Purpose and Need:
    8. How can transportation planning be used to shape a project's 
purpose and need in the NEPA process?
    A sound transportation planning process is the primary source of the 
project purpose and need. Through transportation planning, State and 
local governments, with involvement of stakeholders and the public, 
establish a vision for the region's future transportation system, define 
transportation goals and objectives for realizing that vision, decide 
which needs to address, and determine the timeframe for addressing these 
issues. The transportation planning process also provides a potential 
forum to define a project's purpose and need by framing the scope of the 
problem to be addressed by a proposed project. This scope may be further 
refined during the transportation planning process as more information 
about the transportation need is collected and consultation with the 
public and other stakeholders clarifies other issues and goals for the 
region.
    23 U.S.C. 139(f), as amended by the SAFETEA-LU Section 6002, 
provides additional focus regarding the definition of the purpose and 
need and objectives. For example, the lead agency, as early as 
practicable during the environmental review process, shall provide an 
opportunity for involvement by participating agencies and the public in 
defining the purpose and need for a project.

[[Page 127]]

The statement of purpose and need shall include a clear statement of the 
objectives that the proposed action is intended to achieve, which may 
include: (a) Achieving a transportation objective identified in an 
applicable statewide or metropolitan transportation plan; (b) supporting 
land use, economic development, or growth objectives established in 
applicable Federal, State, local, or Tribal plans; and (c) serving 
national defense, national security, or other national objectives, as 
established in Federal laws, plans, or policies.
    The transportation planning process can be utilized to develop the 
purpose and need in the following ways:
    (a) Goals and objectives from the transportation planning process 
may be part of the project's purpose and need statement;
    (b) A general travel corridor or general mode or modes (e.g., 
highway, transit, or a highway/transit combination) resulting from 
planning analyses may be part of the project's purpose and need 
statement;
    (c) If the financial plan for a metropolitan transportation plan 
indicates that funding for a specific project will require special 
funding sources (e.g., tolls or public-private financing), such 
information may be included in the purpose and need statement; or
    (d) The results of analyses from management systems (e.g., 
congestion, pavement, bridge, and/or safety) may shape the purpose and 
need statement.
    The use of these planning-level goals and choices must be 
appropriately explained during NEPA scoping and in the NEPA document.
    Consistent with NEPA, the purpose and need statement should be a 
statement of a transportation problem, not a specific solution. However, 
the purpose and need statement should be specific enough to generate 
alternatives that may potentially yield real solutions to the problem 
at-hand. A purpose and need statement that yields only one alternative 
may indicate a purpose and need that is too narrowly defined.
    Short of a fully integrated transportation decisionmaking process, 
many State DOTs develop information for their purpose and need 
statements when implementing interagency NEPA/Section 404 process merger 
agreements. These agreements may need to be expanded to include 
commitments to share and utilize transportation planning products when 
developing a project's purpose and need.
    9. Under what conditions can the NEPA process be initiated in 
conjunction with transportation planning studies?
    The NEPA process may be initiated in conjunction with transportation 
planning studies in a number of ways. A common method is the ``tiered 
EIS,'' in which the first-tier EIS evaluates general travel corridors, 
modes, and/or packages of projects at a planning level of detail, 
leading to the refinement of purpose and need and, ideally, selection of 
the design concept and scope for a project or series of projects. 
Subsequently, second-tier NEPA review(s) of the resulting projects would 
be performed in the usual way. The first-tier EIS uses the NEPA process 
as a tool to involve environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies 
and the public in the planning decisions, as well as to ensure the 
appropriate consideration of environmental factors in these planning 
decisions.
    Corridor or subarea analyses/studies are another option when the 
long-range transportation plan leaves open the possibility of multiple 
approaches to fulfill its goals and objectives. In such cases, the 
formal NEPA process could be initiated through publication of a NOI in 
conjunction with a corridor or subarea planning study. Similarly, some 
public transportation operators developing major capital projects 
perform the mandatory planning Alternatives Analysis required for 
funding under FTA's Capital Investment Grant program [49 U.S.C. 5309(d) 
and (e)] within the NEPA process and combine the planning Alternatives 
Analysis with the draft EIS.
    Alternatives:
    10. In the context of this Appendix, what is the meaning of the term 
``alternatives''?
    This Appendix uses the term ``alternatives'' as specified in the 
NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1502.14), where it is defined in its broadest 
sense to include everything from major modal alternatives and location 
alternatives to minor design changes that would mitigate adverse 
impacts. This Appendix does not use the term as it is used in many other 
contexts (e.g., ``prudent and feasible alternatives'' under Section 4(f) 
of the Department of Transportation Act, the ``Least Environmentally 
Damaging Practicable Alternative'' under the Clean Water Act, or the 
planning Alternatives Analysis in 49 U.S.C. 5309(d) and (e)).
    11. Under what circumstances can alternatives be eliminated from 
detailed consideration during the NEPA process based on information and 
analysis from the transportation planning process?
    There are two ways in which the transportation planning process can 
begin limiting the alternative solutions to be evaluated during the NEPA 
process: (a) Shaping the purpose and need for the project; or (b) 
evaluating alternatives during planning studies and eliminating some of 
the alternatives from detailed study in the NEPA process prior to its 
start. Each approach requires careful attention, and is summarized 
below.
    (a) Shaping the Purpose and Need for the Project: The transportation 
planning process should shape the purpose and need and,

[[Page 128]]

thereby, the range of reasonable alternatives. With proper documentation 
and public involvement, a purpose and need derived from the planning 
process can legitimately narrow the alternatives analyzed in the NEPA 
process. See the response to Question 8 for further discussion on how 
the planning process can shape the purpose and need used in the NEPA 
process.
    For example, the purpose and need may be shaped by the 
transportation planning process in a manner that consequently narrows 
the range of alternatives that must be considered in detail in the NEPA 
document when:
    (1) The transportation planning process has selected a general 
travel corridor as best addressing identified transportation problems 
and the rationale for the determination in the planning document is 
reflected in the purpose and need statement of the subsequent NEPA 
document;
    (2) The transportation planning process has selected a general mode 
(e.g., highway, transit, or a highway/transit combination) that 
accomplishes its goals and objectives, and these documented 
determinations are reflected in the purpose and need statement of the 
subsequent NEPA document; or
    (3) The transportation planning process determines that the project 
needs to be funded by tolls or other non-traditional funding sources in 
order for the long-range transportation plan to be fiscally constrained 
or identifies goals and objectives that can only be met by toll roads or 
other non-traditional funding sources, and that determination of those 
goals and objectives is reflected in the purpose and need statement of 
the subsequent NEPA document.
    (b) Evaluating and Eliminating Alternatives During the 
Transportation Planning Process: The evaluation and elimination of 
alternatives during the transportation planning process can be 
incorporated by reference into a NEPA document under certain 
circumstances. In these cases, the planning study becomes part of the 
NEPA process and provides a basis for screening out alternatives. As 
with any part of the NEPA process, the analysis of alternatives to be 
incorporated from the process must have a rational basis that has been 
thoroughly documented (including documentation of the necessary and 
appropriate vetting through the applicable public involvement 
processes). This record should be made available for public review 
during the NEPA scoping process.
    See responses to Questions 4, 5, 6, and 7 for additional elements to 
consider with respect to acceptance of planning products for NEPA 
documentation and the response to Question 12 on the information or 
analysis from the transportation planning process necessary for 
supporting the elimination of an alternative(s) from detailed 
consideration in the NEPA process.
    For instance, under FTA's Capital Investment Grant program, the 
alternatives considered in the NEPA process may be narrowed in those 
instances that the planning Alternatives Analysis required by 49 U.S.C. 
5309(e) is conducted as a planning study prior to the NEPA review. In 
fact, the FTA may be able to narrow the alternatives considered in 
detail in the NEPA document to the No-Build (No Action) alternative and 
the Locally Preferred Alternative. Alternatives must meet the following 
criteria if they are deemed sufficiently considered by a planning 
Alternatives Analysis under FTA's Capital Investment Grant program 
conducted prior to NEPA without a programmatic NEPA analysis and 
documentation:
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> During the planning Alternatives Analysis, all of 
the reasonable alternatives under consideration must be fully evaluated 
in terms of their transportation impacts; capital and operating costs; 
social, economic, and environmental impacts; and technical 
considerations;
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> There must be appropriate public involvement in 
the planning Alternatives Analysis;
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> The appropriate Federal, State, and local 
environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies must be engaged in the 
planning Alternatives Analysis;
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> The results of the planning Alternatives Analysis 
must be documented;
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> The NEPA scoping participants must agree on the 
alternatives that will be considered in the NEPA review; and
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> The subsequent NEPA document must include the 
evaluation of alternatives from the planning Alternatives Analysis.
    The above criteria apply specifically to FTA's Capital Investment 
Grant process. However, for other transportation projects, if the 
planning process has included the analysis and stakeholder involvement 
that would be undertaken in a first tier NEPA process, then the 
alternatives screening conducted in the transportation planning process 
may be incorporated by reference, described, and relied upon in the 
project-level NEPA document. At that point, the project-level NEPA 
analysis can focus on the remaining alternatives.
    12. What information or analysis from the transportation planning 
process is needed in an EA or EIS to support the elimination of an 
alternative(s) from detailed consideration?
    The section of the EA or EIS that discusses alternatives considered 
but eliminated from detailed consideration should:
    (a) Identify any alternatives eliminated during the transportation 
planning process (this could include broad categories of alternatives, 
as when a long-range transportation plan selects a general travel 
corridor based

[[Page 129]]

on a corridor study, thereby eliminating all alternatives along other 
alignments);
    (b) Briefly summarize the reasons for eliminating the alternative; 
and
    (c) Include a summary of the analysis process that supports the 
elimination of alternatives (the summary should reference the relevant 
sections or pages of the analysis or study) and incorporate it by 
reference or append it to the NEPA document.
    Any analyses or studies used to eliminate alternatives from detailed 
consideration should be made available to the public and participating 
agencies during the NEPA scoping process and should be reasonably 
available during comment periods.
    Alternatives passed over during the transportation planning process 
because they are infeasible or do not meet the NEPA ``purpose and need'' 
can be omitted from the detailed analysis of alternatives in the NEPA 
document, as long as the rationale for elimination is explained in the 
NEPA document. Alternatives that remain ``reasonable'' after the 
planning-level analysis must be addressed in the EIS, even when they are 
not the preferred alternative. When the proposed action evaluated in an 
EA involves unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of 
available resources, NEPA requires that appropriate alternatives be 
studied, developed, and described.
    Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences:
    13. What types of planning products provide analysis of the affected 
environment and environmental consequences that are useful in a project-
level NEPA analysis and document?
    The following planning products are valuable inputs to the 
discussion of the affected environment and environmental consequences 
(both its current state and future state in the absence of the proposed 
action) in the project-level NEPA analysis and document:
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Regional development and growth analyses;
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Local land use, growth management, or development 
plans; and
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> Population and employment projections.
    The following are types of information, analysis, and other products 
from the transportation planning process that can be used in the 
discussion of the affected environment and environmental consequences in 
an EA or EIS:
    (a) Geographic information system (GIS) overlays showing the past, 
current, or predicted future conditions of the natural and built 
environments;
    (b) Environmental scans that identify environmental resources and 
environmentally sensitive areas;
    (c) Descriptions of airsheds and watersheds;
    (d) Demographic trends and forecasts;
    (e) Projections of future land use, natural resource conservation 
areas, and development; and
    (f) The outputs of natural resource planning efforts, such as 
wildlife conservation plans, watershed plans, special area management 
plans, and multiple species habitat conservation plans.
    However, in most cases, the assessment of the affected environment 
and environmental consequences conducted during the transportation 
planning process will not be detailed or current enough to meet NEPA 
standards and, thus, the inventory and evaluation of affected resources 
and the analysis of consequences of the alternatives will need to be 
supplemented with more refined analysis and possibly site-specific 
details during the NEPA process.
    14. What information from the transportation planning process is 
useful in describing a baseline for the NEPA analysis of indirect and 
cumulative impacts?
    Because the nature of the transportation planning process is to look 
broadly at future land use, development, population increases, and other 
growth factors, the planning analysis can provide the basis for the 
assessment of indirect and cumulative impacts required under NEPA. The 
consideration in the transportation planning process of development, 
growth, and consistency with local land use, growth management, or 
development plans, as well as population and employment projections, 
provides an overview of the multitude of factors in an area that are 
creating pressures not only on the transportation system, but on the 
natural ecosystem and important environmental and community resources. 
An analysis of all reasonably foreseeable actions in the area also 
should be a part of the transportation planning process. This planning-
level information should be captured and utilized in the analysis of 
indirect and cumulative impacts during the NEPA process.
    To be used in the analysis of indirect and cumulative impacts, such 
information should:
    (a) Be sufficiently detailed that differences in consequences of 
alternatives can be readily identified;
    (b) Be based on current data (e.g., data from the most recent 
Census) or be updated by additional information;
    (c) Be based on reasonable assumptions that are clearly stated; and/
or
    (d) Rely on analytical methods and modeling techniques that are 
reliable, defensible, and reasonably current.
    Environmental Mitigation:
    15. How can planning-level efforts best support advance mitigation, 
mitigation banking, and priorities for environmental mitigation 
investments?
    A lesson learned from efforts to establish mitigation banks and 
advance mitigation

[[Page 130]]

agreements and alternative mitigation options is the importance of 
beginning interagency discussions during the transportation planning 
process. Development pressures, habitat alteration, complicated real 
estate transactions, and competition for potential mitigation sites by 
public and private project proponents can encumber the already difficult 
task of mitigating for ``like'' value and function and reinforce the 
need to examine mitigation strategies as early as possible.
    Robust use of remote sensing, GIS, and decision support systems for 
evaluating conservation strategies are all contributing to the 
advancement of natural resource and environmental planning. The outputs 
from environmental planning can now better inform transportation 
planning processes, including the development of mitigation strategies, 
so that transportation and conservation goals can be optimally met. For 
example, long-range transportation plans can be screened to assess the 
effect of general travel corridors or density, on the viability of 
sensitive plant and animal species or habitats. This type of screening 
provides a basis for early collaboration among transportation and 
environmental staffs, the public, and regulatory agencies to explore 
areas where impacts must be avoided and identify areas for mitigation 
investments. This can lead to mitigation strategies that are both more 
economical and more effective from an environmental stewardship 
perspective than traditional project-specific mitigation measures.

                       III. Administrative Issues:

    16. Are Federal funds eligible to pay for these additional, or more 
in depth, environmental studies in transportation planning?
    Yes. For example, the following FHWA and FTA funds may be utilized 
for conducting environmental studies and analyses within transportation 
planning:
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> FHWA planning and research funds, as defined 
under 23 CFR Part 420 (e.g., Metropolitan Planning (PL), Statewide 
Planning and Research (SPR), National Highway System (NHS), Surface 
Transportation Program (STP), and Equity Bonus); and
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> FTA planning and research funds (49 U.S.C. 5303 
and 49 U.S.C. 5313(b)), urban formula funds (49 U.S.C. 5307), and (in 
limited circumstances) transit capital investment funds (49 U.S.C. 
5309).
    The eligible transportation planning-related uses of these funds may 
include: (a) Conducting feasibility or subarea/corridor needs studies 
and (b) developing system-wide environmental information/inventories 
(e.g., wetland banking inventories or standards to identify historically 
significant sites). Particularly in the case of PL and SPR funds, the 
proposed expenditure must be closely related to the development of 
transportation plans and programs under 23 U.S.C. 134-135 and 49 U.S.C. 
5303-5306.
    For FHWA funding programs, once a general travel corridor or 
specific project has progressed to a point in the preliminary 
engineering/NEPA phase that clearly extends beyond transportation 
planning, additional in-depth environmental studies must be funded 
through the program category for which the ultimate project qualifies 
(e.g., NHS, STP, Interstate Maintenance, and/or Bridge), rather than PL 
or SPR funds.
    Another source of funding is FHWA's Transportation Enhancement 
program, which may be used for activities such as: conducting 
archeological planning and research; developing inventories such as 
those for historic bridges and highways, and other surface 
transportation-related structures; conducting studies to determine the 
extent of water pollution due to highway runoff; and conducting studies 
to reduce vehicle-caused wildlife mortality while maintaining habitat 
connectivity.
    The FHWA and the FTA encourage State DOTs, MPOs, and public 
transportation operators to seek partners for some of these studies from 
environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies, non-government 
organizations, and other government and private sector entities with 
similar data needs, or environmental interests. In some cases, these 
partners may contribute data and expertise to the studies, as well as 
funding.
    17. What staffing or organizational arrangements may be helpful in 
allowing planning products to be accepted in the NEPA process?
    Certain organizational and staffing arrangements may support a more 
integrated approach to the planning/NEPA decision-making continuum. In 
many cases, planning organizations do not have environmental expertise 
on staff or readily accessible. Likewise, the review and regulatory 
responsibilities of many environmental, regulatory, and resource 
agencies make involvement in the transportation planning process a 
challenge for staff resources. These challenges may be partially met by 
improved use of the outputs of each agency's planning resources and by 
augmenting their capabilities through greater use of GIS and remote 
sensing technologies (see http://www.gis.fhwa.dot.gov/ for additional 
information on the use of GIS). Sharing databases and the planning 
products of local land use decision-makers and State and Federal 
environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies also provide 
efficiencies in acquiring and sharing the data and information needed 
for both transportation planning and NEPA work.
    Additional opportunities such as shared staff, training across 
disciplines, and (in some cases) reorganizing to eliminate structural 
divisions between planning and NEPA practitioners may also need to be 
considered

[[Page 131]]

in order to better integrate NEPA considerations into transportation 
planning studies. The answers to the following two questions also 
contain useful information on training and staffing opportunities.
    18. How have environmental, regulatory, and resource agency liaisons 
(Federally- and State DOT-funded positions) and partnership agreements 
been used to provide the expertise and interagency participation needed 
to enhance the consideration of environmental factors in the planning 
process?
    For several years, States have utilized Federal and State 
transportation funds to support focused and accelerated project review 
by a variety of local, State, Tribal, and Federal agencies. While 
Section 1309(e) of the TEA-21 and its successor in SAFETEA-LU section 
6002 speak specifically to transportation project streamlining, there 
are other authorities that have been used to fund positions, such as the 
Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (31 U.S.C. 6505). In addition, long-
term, on-call consultant contracts can provide backfill support for 
staff that are detailed to other parts of an agency for temporary 
assignments. At last count (as of 2003), 246 positions were being 
funded. Additional information on interagency funding agreements is 
available at: http://environment.fhwa.dot.gov/strmlng/igdocs/index.htm.
    Moreover, every State has advanced a variety of stewardship and 
streamlining initiatives that necessitate early involvement of 
environmental, regulatory, and resource agencies in the project 
development process. Such process improvements have: addressed the 
exchange of data to support avoidance and impact analysis; established 
formal and informal consultation and review schedules; advanced 
mitigation strategies; and resulted in a variety of programmatic 
reviews. Interagency agreements and workplans have evolved to describe 
performance objectives, as well as specific roles and responsibilities 
related to new streamlining initiatives. Some States have improved 
collaboration and efficiency by co-locating environmental, regulatory, 
and resource and transportation agency staff.
    19. What training opportunities are available to MPOs, State DOTs, 
public transportation operators and environmental, regulatory, and 
resource agencies to assist in their understanding of the transportation 
planning and NEPA processes?
    Both the FHWA and the FTA offer a variety of transportation 
planning, public involvement, and NEPA courses through the National 
Highway Institute and/or the National Transit Institute. Of particular 
note is the Linking Planning and NEPA Workshop, which provides a forum 
and facilitated group discussion among and between State DOT; MPO; 
Federal, Tribal, and State environmental, regulatory, and resource 
agencies; and FHWA/FTA representatives (at both the executive and 
program manager levels) to develop a State-specific action plan that 
will provide for strengthened linkages between the transportation 
planning and NEPA processes.
    Moreover, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service offers Green 
Infrastructure Workshops that are focused on integrating planning for 
natural resources (``green infrastructure'') with the development, 
economic, and other infrastructure needs of society (``gray 
infrastructure'').
    Robust planning and multi-issue environmental screening requires 
input from a wide variety of disciplines, including information 
technology; transportation planning; the NEPA process; and regulatory, 
permitting, and environmental specialty areas (e.g., noise, air quality, 
and biology). Senior managers at transportation and partner agencies can 
arrange a variety of individual training programs to support learning 
curves and skill development that contribute to a strengthened link of 
the transportation planning and NEPA processes. Formal and informal 
mentoring on an intra-agency basis can be arranged. Employee exchanges 
within and between agencies can be periodically scheduled, and persons 
involved with professional leadership programs can seek temporary 
assignments with partner agencies.

                IV. Additional Information on this Topic

    Valuable sources of information are FHWA's environment website 
(http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/index.htm) and FTA's environmental 
streamlining website (http://www.environment.fta.dot.gov). Another 
source of information and case studies is NCHRP Report 8-38 
(Consideration of Environmental Factors in Transportation Systems 
Planning), which is available at http://www4.trb.org/trb/crp.nsf/
All+Projects/NCHRP+8-38. In addition, AASHTO's Center for Environmental

<R05>
Sec. 460.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to prescribe the policies and procedures 
followed in identifying and reporting public road mileage for 
utilization in the statutory formula for the apportionment of highway 
safety funds under 23 U.S.C. 402(c).


<R05>
Sec. 460.2  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    (a) Public road means any road under the jurisdiction of and 
maintained by a public authority and open to public travel.
    (b) Public authority means a Federal, State, county, town, or 
township, Indian tribe, municipal or other local government or 
instrumentality thereof, with authority to finance, build, operate or 
maintain toll or toll-free highway facilities.
    (c) Open to public travel means that the road section is available, 
except during scheduled periods, extreme weather or emergency 
conditions, passable by four-wheel standard passenger cars, and open to 
the general public for use without restrictive gates, prohibitive signs, 
or regulation other than restrictions based on size, weight, or class of 
registration. Toll plazas of public toll roads are not considered 
restrictive gates.
    (d) Maintenance means the preservation of the entire highway, 
including surfaces, shoulders, roadsides, structures, and such traffic 
control devices as are necessary for its safe and efficient utilization.
    (e) State means any one of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, 
Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa. For the 
purpose of the application of 23 U.S.C. 402 on Indian reservations, 
State and Governor of a State include the Secretary of the Interior.

    Effective Date Note: At 76 FR 12849, Mar. 9, 2011, Sec. 460.2 was 
amended by revising paragraph (e), effective Apr. 8, 2011. For the

    (e) State means any one of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, 
Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. For the purpose of the 
application of 23 U.S.C. 402 on Indian reservations, State and Governor 
of a State include the Secretary of the Interior.


<R05>
Sec. 460.3  Procedures.

    (a) General requirements. 23 U.S.C. 402(c) provides that funds 
authorized to carry out section 402 shall be apportioned according to a 
formula based on population and public road mileage of each State. 
Public road mileage shall be determined as of the end of the calendar 
year preceding the year in which the funds are apportioned and shall be 
certified to by the Governor of the State or his designee and subject to 
the approval of the Federal Highway Administrator.
    (b) State public road mileage. Each State must annually submit a 
certification of public road mileage within the State to the Federal 
Highway Administration Division Administrator by the date specified by 
the Division Administrator. Public road mileage on Indian reservations 
within the State shall be identified and included in the State mileage 
and in computing the State's apportionment.
    (c) Indian reservation public road mileage. The Secretary of the 
Interior or his designee will submit a certification of public road 
mileage within Indian reservations to the Federal Highway Administrator 
by June 1 of each year.
    (d) Action by the Federal Highway Administrator. (1) The 
certification of Indian reservation public road mileage, and the State 
certifications of public road mileage together with comments thereon, 
will be reviewed by the Federal Highway Administrator. He will make a 
final determination of the public road mileage to be used as the basis 
for apportionment of funds under 23 U.S.C. 402(c). In any instance in 
which the Administrator's final determination differs from the public 
road mileage certified by a State or the Secretary of the Interior, the 
Administrator will advise the State or the Secretary of the Interior of 
his final determination and the reasons therefor.

[[Page 133]]

    (2) If a State fails to submit a certification of public road 
mileage as required by this part, the Federal Highway Administrator may 
make a determination of the State's public road mileage for the purpose 
of apportioning funds under 23 U.S.C. 402(c). The State's public road 
mileage determined by the Administrator under this subparagraph may not 
exceed 90 percent of the State's public road mileage utilized in 
determining the most recent apportionment of funds under 23 U.S.C. 
402(c).

<R05>
Sec. 470.109  System procedures--General.

    (a) The State transportation agency, in consultation with 
responsible local officials, shall have the responsibility for proposing 
to the Federal Highway Administration all official actions regarding the 
designation, or revision, of the Federal-aid highway systems.
    (b) The routes of the Federal-aid highway systems shall be proposed 
by coordinated action of the State transportation agencies where the 
routes involve State-line connections.
    (c) The designation of routes on the Federal-aid highway systems 
shall be in accordance with the planning process required, pursuant to 
the provisions at 23 U.S.C. 135, and, in urbanized areas, the provisions 
at 23 U.S.C. 134(a). The State shall cooperate with local and regional 
officials. In urbanized areas, the local officials shall act through the 
metropolitan planning organizations designated for such areas under 23 
U.S.C. 134.
    (d) In areas under Federal jurisdiction, the designation of routes 
on the Federal-aid highway systems shall be coordinated with the 
appropriate Federal agency.


<R05>
Sec. 470.111  Interstate System procedures.

    (a) Proposals for system actions on the Interstate System shall 
include a route description and a statement of justification. Proposals 
shall also include statements regarding coordination with adjoining 
States on State-line connections, with responsible local officials, and 
with officials of areas under Federal jurisdiction.
    (b) Proposals for Interstate or future Interstate designation under 
23 U.S.C. 103(c)(4)(A) or (B), as logical additions or connections, 
shall consider the criteria contained in appendix A of this subpart. For 
designation as a part of the Interstate system, 23 U.S.C. 103(c)(4)(A) 
requires that a highway meet all the standards of a highway on the 
Interstate System, be a logical addition or connection to the Interstate 
System, and have the affirmative recommendation of the State or States 
involved. For designation as a future part of the Interstate System, 23 
U.S.C. 103(c)(4)(B) requires that a highway be a logical addition or 
connection to the Interstate System, have the affirmative recommendation 
of the State or States involved, and have the written agreement of the 
State or States involved that such highway will be constructed to meet 
all the standards of a highway on the Interstate System within twenty-
five years of the date of the agreement between the FHWA Administrator 
and the State or States involved. Such highways must also be on the 
National Highway System.
    (c) Routes proposed for Interstate designation under section 
332(a)(2) of the NHS Designation Act of 1995 (NHS Act) shall be 
constructed to Interstate standards and connect to the Interstate 
System. Proposals shall consider the criteria contained in appendix B of 
this subpart.
    (d) Proposals for Interstate route numbering shall be submitted by 
the State transportation agency to the Route Numbering Committee of the 
American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.
    (e) Signing of corridors federally designated as future Interstate 
routes can follow the criteria contained in appendix C of this subpart. 
No law, rule, regulation, map, document, or other record of the United 
States, or of any State or political subdivision thereof, shall refer to 
any highway under 23 U.S.C. 103(c), nor shall any such highway be signed 
or marked, as a highway on the Interstate System until such time as such 
highway is constructed to the geometric and construction standards for 
the Interstate System and has been designated as a part of the 
Interstate System.

<R05>
Sec. 470.113  National Highway System procedures.

    (a) Proposals for system actions on the National Highway System 
shall include a route description, a statement of justification, and 
statements of coordination with adjoining States on

[[Page 136]]

State-line connections, with responsible local officials, and with 
officials of areas under Federal jurisdiction.
    (b) Proposed modifications to the National Highway System shall 
enhance the national transportation characteristics of the National 
Highway System and shall follow the criteria listed in Sec. 470.107. 
Proposals shall also consider the criteria contained in appendix D of 
this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 470.115  Approval authority.

    (a) The Federal Highway Administrator will approve Federal-aid 
highway system actions involving the designation, or revision, of routes 
on the Interstate System, including route numbers, future Interstate 
routes, and routes on the National Highway System.
    (b) The Federal Highway Administrator will approve functional 
classification actions.


<R05>
    Sec. Appendix A to Subpart A of Part 470--Guidance Criteria for 
 Evaluating Requests for Interstate System Designations under 23 U.S.C. 
                          103(c)(4)(A) and (B)

    Section 103(c)(4)(A) and (B), of title 23, U.S.C., permits States to 
request the designation of National Highway System routes as parts or 
future parts of the Interstate System. The FHWA Administrator may 
approve such a request if the route is a logical addition or connection 
to the Interstate System and has been, or will be, constructed to meet 
Interstate standards. The following are the general criteria to be used 
to evaluate 23 U.S.C. 103(c) requests for Interstate System 
designations.
    1. The proposed route should be of sufficient length to serve long-
distance Interstate travel, such as connecting routes between principal 
metropolitan cities or industrial centers important to national defense 
and economic development.
    2. The proposed route should not duplicate other Interstate routes. 
It should serve Interstate traffic movement not provided by another 
Interstate route.
    3. The proposed route should directly serve major highway traffic 
generators. The term ``major highway traffic generator'' means either an 
urbanized area with a population over 100,000 or a similar major 
concentrated land use activity that produces and attracts long-distance 
Interstate and statewide travel of persons and goods. Typical examples 
of similar major concentrated land use activities would include a 
principal industrial complex, government center, military installation, 
or transportation terminal.
    4. The proposed route should connect to the Interstate System at 
each end, with the exception of Interstate routes that connect with 
continental routes at an international border, or terminate in a ``major 
highway traffic generator'' that is not served by another Interstate 
route. In the latter case, the terminus of the Interstate route should 
connect to routes of the National Highway System that will adequately 
handle the traffic. The proposed route also must be functionally 
classified as a principal arterial and be a part of the National Highway 
System system.
    5. The proposed route must meet all the current geometric and safety 
standards criteria as set forth in 23 CFR part 625 for highways on the 
Interstate System, or a formal agreement to construct the route to such 
standards within 25 years must be executed between the State(s) and the 
Federal Highway Administration. Any proposed exceptions to the standards 
shall be approved at the time of designation.
    6. A route being proposed for designation under 23 U.S.C. 
103(c)(4)(B) must have an approved final environmental document 
(including, if required, a 49 U.S.C. 303(c) [Section 4(f)] approval) 
covering the route and project action must be ready to proceed with 
design at the time of designation. Routes constructed to Interstate 
standards are not necessarily logical additions to the Interstate System 
unless they clearly meet all of the above criteria.

<R05>
  Sec. Appendix B to Subpart A of Part 470--Designation of Segments of 
      Section 332(a)(2) Corridors as Parts of the Interstate System

    The following guidance is comparable to current procedures for 
Interstate System designation requests under 23 U.S.C. 103(c)(4)(A). All 
Interstate System additions must be approved by the Federal Highway 
Administrator. The provisions of section 332(a)(2) of the NHS Act have 
also been incorporated into the ISTEA as section 1105(e)(5)(A).
    1. The request must be submitted through the appropriate FHWA 
Division Office to the Associate Administrator for Program Development 
(HEP-10). Comments and recommendations by the division and regional 
offices are requested.
    2. The State DOT secretary (or equivalent) must request that the 
route segment be added to the Interstate System. The exact location and 
termini must be specified. If the route segment involves more than one 
State,

[[Page 137]]

each affected State must submit a separate request.
    3. The request must provide information to support findings that the 
segment (a) is built to Interstate design standards and (b) connects to 
the existing Interstate System. The segment should be of sufficient 
length to provide substantial service to the travelling public.
    4. The request must also identify and justify any design exceptions 
for which approval is requested.
    5. Proposed Interstate route numbering for the segment must be 
submitted to FHWA and the American Association of State Highway and 
Transportation Officials Route Numbering.

  Sec. Appendix C to Subpart A of Part 470--Policy for the Signing and 
 
 Numbering of Future Interstate Corridors Designated by Section 332 of 
     the NHS Designation Act of 1995 or Designated Under 23 U.S.C. 
                              103(c)(4)(B)

                                 Policy

    State transportation agencies are permitted to erect informational 
Interstate signs along a federally designated future Interstate corridor 
only after the specific route location has been established for the 
route to be constructed to Interstate design standards.

                               Conditions

    1. The corridor must have been designated a future part of the 
Interstate System under section 332(a)(2) of the NHS Designation Act of 
1995 or 23 U.S.C. 103(c)(4)(B).
    2. The specific route location to appropriate termini must have 
received Federal Highway (FHWA) environmental clearance. Where FHWA 
environmental clearance is not required or Interstate standards have 
been met, the route location must have been publicly announced by the 
State.
    3. Numbering of future Interstate route segments must be coordinated 
with affected States and be approved by the American Association of 
State Highway and Transportation Officials and the FHWA at Headquarters. 
Short portions of a multistate corridor may require use of an interim 3-
digit number.
    4. The State shall coordinate the location and content of signing 
near the State line with the adjacent State.
    5. Signing and other identification of a future Interstate route 
segment must not indicate, nor imply, that the route is on the 
Interstate System.
    6. The FHWA Division Office must confirm in advance that the above 
conditions have been met and approve the general locations of signs.

                              Sign Details

    1. Signs may not be used to give directions and should be away from 
directional signs, particularly at interchanges.
    2. An Interstate shield may be located on a green informational sign 
of a few words. For example: Future Interstate Corridor or Future I-00 
Corridor.
    3. The Interstate shield may not include the word ``Interstate.''
    4. The FHWA Division Office must approve the signs as to design, 
wording, and detailed location.

<R05>
    Sec. Appendix D to Subpart A of Part 470--Guidance Criteria for 
  Evaluating Requests for Modifications to the National Highway System

    Section 103(b), of title 23, U.S.C., allows the States to propose 
modifications to the National Highway System (NHS) and authorizes the 
Secretary to approve such modifications provided that they meet the 
criteria established for the NHS and enhance the characteristics of the 
NHS. In proposing modifications under 23 U.S.C. 103(b), the States must 
cooperate with local and regional officials. In urbanized areas, the 
local officials must act through the metropolitan planning organization 
(MPO) designated for such areas under 23 U.S.C. 134. The following 
guidance criteria should be used by the States to develop proposed 
modifications to the NHS.
    1. Proposed additions to the NHS should be included in either an 
adopted State or metropolitan transportation plan or program.
    2. Proposed additions should connect at each end with other routes 
on the NHS or serve a major traffic generator.
    3. Proposals should be developed in consultation with local and 
regional officials.
    4. Proposals to add routes to the NHS should include information on 
the type of traffic served (i.e., percent of trucks, average trip 
length, local, commuter, interregional, interstate) by the route, the 
population centers or major traffic generators served by the route, and 
how this service compares with existing NHS routes.
    5. Proposals should include information on existing and anticipated 
needs and any planned improvements to the route.
    6. Proposals should include information concerning the possible 
effects of adding or deleting a route to or from the NHS might

[[Page 138]]

have on other existing NHS routes that are in close proximity.
    7. Proposals to add routes to the NHS should include an assessment 
of whether modifications (adjustments or deletions) to existing NHS 
routes, which provide similar service, may be appropriate.
    8. Proposed modifications that might affect adjoining States should 
be developed in cooperation with those States.
    9. Proposed modifications consisting of connections to major 
intermodal facilities should be developed using the criteria set forth 
below. These criteria were used for identifying initial NHS connections 
to major intermodal terminals. The primary criteria are based on annual 
passenger volumes, annual freight volumes, or daily vehicular traffic on 
one or more principal routes that serve the intermodal facility. The 
secondary criteria include factors which underscore the importance of an 
intermodal facility within a specific State.

                            Primary Criteria

                      Commercial Aviation Airports

    1. Passengers--scheduled commercial service with more than 250,000 
annual enplanements.
    2. Cargo--100 trucks per day in each direction on the principal 
connecting route, or 100,000 tons per year arriving or departing by 
highway mode.

                                  Ports

    1. Terminals that handle more than 50,000 TEUs (a volumetric measure 
of containerized cargo which stands for twenty-foot equivalent units) 
per year, or other units measured that would convert to more than 100 
trucks per day in each direction. (Trucks are defined as large single-
unit trucks or combination vehicles handling freight.)
    2. Bulk commodity terminals that handle more than 500,000 tons per 
year by highway or 100 trucks per day in each direction on the principal 
connecting route. (If no individual terminal handles this amount of 
freight, but a cluster of terminals in close proximity to each other 
does, then the cluster of terminals could be considered in meeting the 
criteria. In such cases, the connecting route might terminate at a point 
where the traffic to several terminals begins to separate.)
    3. Passengers--terminals that handle more than 250,000 passengers 
per year or 1,000 passengers per day for at least 90 days during the 
year.

                               Truck/Rail

    1. 50,000 TEUs per year, or 100 trucks per day, in each direction on 
the principal connecting route, or other units measured that would 
convert to more than 100 trucks per day in each direction. (Trucks are 
defined as large single-unit trucks or combination vehicles carrying 
freight.)

                                Pipelines

    1. 100 trucks per day in each direction on the principal connecting 
route.

                                 Amtrak

    1. 100,000 passengers per year (entrainments and detrainments). 
Joint Amtrak, intercity bus and public transit terminals should be 
considered based on the combined passenger volumes. Likewise, two or 
more separate facilities in close proximity should be considered based 
on combined passenger volumes.

                              Intercity Bus

    1. 100,000 passengers per year (boardings and deboardings).

                             Public Transit

    1. Stations with park and ride lots with more than 500 vehicle 
parking spaces, or 5,000 daily bus or rail passengers, with significant 
highway access (i.e., a high percentage of the passengers arrive by cars 
and buses using a route that connects to another NHS route), or a major 
hub terminal that provides for the transfer of passengers among several 
bus routes. (These hubs should have a significant number of buses using 
a principal route connecting with the NHS.)

                                 Ferries

    1. Interstate/international--1,000 passengers per day for at least 
90 days during the year. (A ferry which connects two terminals within 
the same metropolitan area should be considered as local, not 
interstate.)
    2. Local--see public transit criteria above.

                           Secondary Criteria

    Any of the following criteria could be used to justify an NHS 
connection to an intermodal terminal where there is a significant 
highway interface:
    1. Intermodal terminals that handle more than 20 percent of 
passenger or freight volumes by mode within a State;
    2. Intermodal terminals identified either in the Intermodal 
Management System or the State and metropolitan transportation plans as 
a major facility;
    3. Significant investment in, or expansion of, an intermodal 
terminal; or
    4. Connecting routes targeted by the State, MPO, or others for 
investment to address an existing, or anticipated, deficiency as a 
result of increased traffic.

                          Proximate Connections

    Intermodal terminals, identified under the secondary criteria noted 
above, may not

[[Page 139]]

have sufficient highway traffic volumes to justify an NHS connection to 
the terminal. States and MPOs should fully consider whether a direct 
connection should be identified for such terminals, or whether being in 
the proximity (2 to 3 miles) of an NHS route is sufficient.

<R05>
Sec. 500.101  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to implement the requirements of 23 
U.S.C. 303(a) which directs the Secretary of Transportation (the 
Secretary) to issue regulations for State development, establishment, 
and implementation of systems for managing highway pavement of Federal-
aid highways (PMS), bridges on and off Federal-aid highways (BMS), 
highway safety (SMS), traffic congestion (CMS), public transportation 
facilities and equipment (PTMS), and intermodal transportation 
facilities and systems (IMS). This regulation also implements 23 U.S.C. 
303(b) which directs the Secretary to issue guidelines and requirements 
for State development, establishment, and implementation of a traffic 
monitoring system for highways and public transportation facilities and 
equipment (TMS).


<R05>
Sec. 500.102  Policy.

    (a) Federal, State, and local governments are under increasing 
pressure to balance their budgets and, at the same time, respond to 
public demands for quality services. Along with the need to invest in 
America's future, this leaves transportation agencies with the task of 
trying to manage current transportation systems as cost-effectively as 
possible to meet evolving, as well as backlog needs. The use of existing 
or new transportation management systems provides a framework for cost-
effective decision making that emphasizes enhanced service at reduced 
public and private life-cycle cost. The primary outcome of 
transportation management systems is improved system performance and 
safety. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Federal 
Transit Administration (FTA) strongly encourage implementation of 
transportation management systems consistent with State, metropolitan 
planning organization, transit operator, or local government needs.
    (b) Whether the systems are developed under the provisions of this 
part or under a State's own procedures, the following categories of FHWA 
administered funds may be used for development, establishment, and 
implementation of any of the management systems and the traffic 
monitoring system: National highway system; surface transportation 
program; State planning and research and metropolitan planning funds 
(including the optional use of minimum allocation funds authorized under 
23 U.S.C. 157(c) and restoration funds authorized under Sec. 202(f) of 
the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995 (Pub.L. 104-59) for 
carrying out the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 307(c)(1) and 23 U.S.C. 
134(a)); congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program funds 
for those management systems that can be shown to contribute to the 
attainment of a national ambient air quality standard; and apportioned 
bridge funds for development

[[Page 141]]

and establishment of the bridge management system. The following 
categories of FTA administered funds may be used for development, 
establishment, and implementation of the CMS, PTMS, IMS, and TMS: 
Metropolitan planning; State planning and research, and formula transit 
funds.


<R05>
Sec. 500.103  Definitions.

    Unless otherwise specified in this part, the definitions in 23 
U.S.C. 101(a) are applicable to this part. As used in this part:
    Federal-aid highways means those highways eligible for assistance 
under title 23, U.S.C., except those functionally classified as local or 
rural minor collectors.
    Metropolitan planning organization (MPO) means the forum for 
cooperative transportation decision making for a metropolitan planning 
area.
    National Highway System (NHS) means the system of highways

103(b).
    State means any one of the fifty States, the District of Columbia, 
or Puerto Rico.
    Transportation management area (TMA) means an urbanized area with a 
population over 200,000 (as determined by the latest decennial census) 
or other area when TMA designation is requested by the Governor and the 
MPO (or affected local officials), and officially designated by the 
Administrators of the FHWA and the FTA. The TMA designation applies to 
the entire metropolitan planning area(s).


<R05>
Sec. 500.104  State option.

    Except as specified in Sec. 500.105 (a) and (b), a State may elect 
at any time not to implement any one or more of the management systems 
required under 23 U.S.C. 303, in whole or in part.


<R05>
Sec. 500.105  Requirements.

    (a) The metropolitan transportation planning process (23 U.S.C. 134 
and 49 U.S.C. 5303-5005) in TMAs shall include a CMS that meets the 
requirements of Sec. 500.109 of this regulation.
    (b) States shall develop, establish, and implement a TMS that meets 
the requirements of subpart B of this regulation.
    (c) Any of the management systems that the State chooses to 
implement under 23 U.S.C. 303 and this regulation shall be developed in 
cooperation with MPOs in metropolitan areas, affected agencies receiving 
assistance under the Federal Transit Act (49 U.S.C., Chapter 53), and 
other agencies (including private owners and operators) that have 
responsibility for operation of the affected transportation systems or 
facilities.
    (d) The results (e.g., policies, programs, projects, etc.) of any of 
the management systems that a State chooses to develop under 23 U.S.C. 
303 and this regulation shall be considered in the development of 
metropolitan and statewide transportation plans and improvement programs 
and in making project selection decisions under title 23, U.S.C., and 
under the Federal Transit Act. Plans and programs adopted after 
September 30, 1997, shall demonstrate compliance with this requirement.


<R05>
Sec. 500.106  PMS.

    An effective PMS for Federal-aid highways is a systematic process 
that provides information for use in implementing cost-effective 
pavement reconstruction, rehabilitation, and preventative maintenance 
programs and that results in pavements designed to accommodate current 
and forecasted traffic in a safe, durable, and cost-effective manner. 
The PMS should be based on the ``AASHTO Guidelines for Pavement 
Management Systems.'' \1\

    (g) Recommending programs and schedules for implementation within 
policy and budget constraints.


<R05>
Sec. 500.108  SMS.

    An SMS is a systematic process with the goal of reducing the number 
and severity of traffic crashes by ensuring that all opportunities to 
improve highway safety are identified, considered, implemented as 
appropriate, and evaluated in all phases of highway planning, design, 
construction, maintenance, and operation and by providing information 
for selecting and implementing effective highway safety strategies and 
projects. The development of the SMS may be based on the guidance in 
``Safety Management Systems: Good Practices for Development and 
Implementation.'' \3\ An effective SMS should include, at a minimum:

    \3\ Safety Management Systems: Good Practices for Development and 
Implementation, FHWA and NHTSA, May 1996. Available for inspection and 
copying as prescribed in 49 CFR part 7, appendix D.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (a) Communication, coordination, and cooperation among the 
organizations responsible for the roadway, human, and vehicle safety 
elements;
    (b) A focal point for coordination of the development, 
establishment, and implementation of the SMS among the agencies 
responsible for these major safety elements;
    (c) Establishment of short- and long-term highway safety goals to 
address identified safety problems;
    (d) Collection, analysis, and linkage of highway safety data;
    (e) Identification of the safety responsibilities of units and 
positions;
    (f) Public information and education activities; and
    (g) Identification of skills, resources, and training needs to 
implement highway safety programs.


<R05>
Sec. 500.109  CMS.

    (a) For purposes of this part, congestion means the level at which 
transportation system performance is unacceptable due to excessive 
travel times and delays. Congestion management means the application of 
strategies to improve system performance and reliability by reducing the 
adverse impacts of congestion on the movement of people and goods in a 
region. A congestion management system or process is a systematic and 
regionally accepted approach for managing congestion that provides 
accurate, up-to-date information on transportation system operations and 
performance and assesses alternative strategies for congestion 
management that meet State and local needs.
    (b) The development of a congestion management system or process 
should result in performance measures and strategies that can be 
integrated into transportation plans and programs. The level of system 
performance deemed acceptable by State and local officials may vary by 
type of transportation facility, geographic location (metropolitan area 
or subarea and/or non-metropolitan area), and/or time of day. In both 
metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas, consideration needs to be given 
to strategies that manage demand, reduce single occupant vehicle (SOV) 
travel, and improve transportation system management and operations. 
Where the addition of general purpose lanes is determined to be an 
appropriate congestion management strategy, explicit consideration is to 
be given to the incorporation of appropriate features into the SOV 
project to facilitate future demand management strategies and 
operational improvements that will maintain the functional integrity of 
those lanes.

<R05>
Sec. 500.110  PTMS.

    An effective PTMS for public transportation facilities (e.g., 
maintenance facilities, stations, terminals, transit related 
structures), equipment, and rolling stock is a systematic process that 
collects and analyzes information on the condition and cost of transit 
assets on a continual basis, identifies needs, and enables decision 
makers to select cost-effective strategies for providing and maintaining 
transit assets in serviceable condition. The PTMS should cover public 
transportation systems operated by the State, local jurisdictions, 
public transportation agencies and authorities, and private (for profit 
and non-profit) transit operators receiving funds under the Federal 
Transit Act and include, at a minimum:
    (a) Development of transit asset condition measures and standards;
    (b) An inventory of the transit assets including age, condition, 
remaining useful life, and replacement cost; and
    (c) Identification, evaluation, and implementation of appropriate 
strategies and projects.


<R05>
Sec. 500.111  IMS.

    An effective IMS for intermodal facilities and systems provides 
efficient, safe, and convenient movement of people and goods through 
integration of transportation facilities and systems and improvement in 
the coordination in planning, and implementation of air, water, and the 
various land-based transportation facilities and systems. An IMS should 
include, at a minimum:
    (a) Establishment of performance measures;
    (b) Identification of key linkages between one or more modes of 
transportation, where the performance or use of one mode will affect 
another;
    (c) Definition of strategies for improving the effectiveness of 
these modal interactions; and
    (d) Evaluation and implementation of these strategies to enhance the 
overall performance of the transportation system.

                   Subpart B_Traffic Monitoring System


<R05>
Sec. 500.201  Purpose.

    The purpose of this subpart is to set forth requirements for 
development, establishment, implementation, and continued operation of a 
traffic monitoring system for highways and public transportation 
facilities and equipment (TMS) in each State in accordance with the 
provisions of 23 U.S.C. 303 and subpart A of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 500.202  TMS definitions.

    Unless otherwise specified in this part, the definitions in 23 
U.S.C. 101(a) and Sec. 500.103 are applicable to this subpart. As used 
in this part:
    Highway traffic data means data used to develop estimates of the 
amount of person or vehicular travel, vehicle usage, or vehicle 
characteristics associated with a system of highways or with a 
particular location on a highway. These types of data support the 
estimation of the number of vehicles traversing a section of highway or 
system of highways during a prescribed time period (traffic volume), the 
portion of such vehicles that may be of a particular type (vehicle 
classification), the weights of such vehicles including the weight of 
each axle and associated distances between axles on a vehicle (vehicle 
weight), or the average number of persons being transported in a vehicle 
(vehicle occupancy).
    Traffic monitoring system means a systematic process for the 
collection, analysis, summary, and retention of highway and transit 
related person and vehicular traffic data.
    Transit traffic data means person and vehicular data for public 
transportation on public highways and streets and the number of vehicles 
and ridership for dedicated transit rights-of-way (e.g., rail and 
busways), at the maximum load points for the peak period in the peak 
direction and for the daily time period.


<R05>
Sec. 500.203  TMS general requirements.

    (a) Each State shall develop, establish, and implement, on a

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) The TMS shall cover all public roads except those functionally 
classified as local or rural minor collector or those that are federally 
owned. Coverage of federally owned public roads shall be determined 
cooperatively by the State, the FHWA, and the agencies that own the 
roads.
    (d) The State's TMS shall apply to the activities of local 
governments and other public or private non-State government entities 
collecting highway traffic data within the State if the collected data 
are to be used for any of the purposes enumerated in Sec. 500.203(a) of 
this subpart.
    (e) Procedures other than those referenced in this subpart may be 
used if the alternative procedures are documented by the State to 
furnish the precision levels as defined for the various purposes 
enumerated in Sec. 500.203(a) of this subpart and are found acceptable 
by the FHWA.
    (f) Nothing in this subpart shall prohibit the collection of 
additional highway traffic data if such data are needed in the 
administration or management of a highway activity or are needed in the 
design of a highway project.
    (g) Transit traffic data shall be collected in cooperation with MPOs 
and transit operators.
    (h) The TMS for highways and public transportation facilities and

<R05>
Sec. 500.204  TMS components for highway traffic data.

    (a) General. Each State's TMS, including those using alternative 
procedures, shall address the components in paragraphs (b) through (h) 
of this section.
    (b) Precision of reported data. Traffic data supplied for the 
purposes identified in Sec. 500.203(a) of this subpart shall be to the 
statistical precision applicable at the time of the data's collection as 
specified by the data users at various levels of government. A State's 
TMS shall meet the statistical precisions established by FHWA for the 
HPMS.
    (c) Continuous counter operations. Within each State, there shall be 
sufficient continuous counters of traffic volumes, vehicle 
classification, and vehicle weight to provide estimates of changes in 
highway travel patterns and to provide for the development of day-of-
week, seasonal, axle correction, growth factors, or other comparable 
factors approved by the FHWA that support the development of traffic 
estimates to meet the statistical precision requirements of the data 
uses identified in Sec. 500.203(a) of this subpart. As appropriate, 
sufficient continuous

[[Page 145]]

counts of vehicle classification and vehicle weight should be available 
to address traffic data program needs.
    (d) Short term traffic monitoring. (1) Count data for traffic 
volumes collected in the field shall be adjusted to reflect annual 
average conditions. The estimation of annual average daily traffic will 
be through the appropriate application of only the following: Seasonal 
factors, day-of-week factors, and, when necessary, axle correction and 
growth factors or other comparable factors approved by the FHWA. Count 
data that have not been adjusted to represent annual average conditions 
will be noted as being unadjusted when they are reported. The duration 
and frequency of such monitoring shall comply to the data needs 
identified in Sec. 500.203(a) of this subpart.
    (2) Vehicle classification activities on the National Highway System 
(NHS), shall be sufficient to assure that, on a cycle of no greater than 
three years, every major system segment (i.e., segments between 
interchanges or intersections of principal arterials of the NHS with 
other principal arterials of the NHS) will be monitored to provide 
information on the numbers of single-trailer combination trucks, 
multiple-trailer combination trucks, two-axle four-tire vehicles, buses 
and the total number of vehicles operating on an average day. If it is 
determined that two or more continuous major system segments have both 
similar traffic volumes and distributions of the vehicle types 
identified above, a single monitoring session will be sufficient to 
monitor these segments.
    (e) Vehicle occupancy monitoring. As deemed appropriate to support 
the data uses identified in Sec. 500.203(a) of this subpart, data will 
be collected on the average number of persons per automobile, light two-
axle truck, and bus. The duration, geographic extent, and level of 
detail shall be consistent with the intended use of the data, as 
cooperatively agreed to by the organizations that will use the data and 
the organizations that will collect the data. Such vehicle occupancy 
data shall be reviewed at least every three years and updated as 
necessary. Acceptable data collection methods include roadside 
monitoring, traveler surveys, the use of administrative records (e.g., 
accident reports or reports developed in support of public 
transportation programs), or any other method mutually acceptable to the 
responsible organizations and the FHWA.
    (f) Field operations. (1) Each State's TMS for highway traffic data 
shall include the testing of equipment used in the collection of the 
data. This testing shall be based on documented procedures developed by 
the State. This documentation will describe the test procedure as well 
as the frequency of testing. Standards of the American Society for 
Testing and Materials or guidance from the AASHTO may be used. Only 
equipment passing the test procedures will be used for the collection of 
data for the purposes identified in Sec. 500.203(a) of this subpart.
    (2) Documentation of field operations shall include the number of 
counts, the period of monitoring, the cycle of monitoring, and the 
spatial and temporal distribution of count sites. Copies of the State's 
documentation shall be provided to the FHWA Division Administrator when 
it is initially developed and after each revision.
    (g) Source data retention. For estimates of traffic or travel, the 
value or values collected during a monitoring session, as well as 
information on the date(s) and hour(s) of monitoring, will remain 
available until the traffic or travel estimates based on the count 
session are updated. Data shall be available in formats that conform to 
those in the version of the TMG current at the time of data collection 
or as then amended by the FHWA.
    (h) Office factoring procedures. (1) Factors to adjust data from 
short term monitoring sessions to estimates of average daily conditions 
shall be used to adjust for month, day of week, axle correction, and 
growth or other comparable factors approved by the FHWA. These factors 
will be reviewed annually and updated at least every three years.
    (2) The procedures used by a State to edit and adjust highway 
traffic data collected from short term counts at field locations to 
estimates of average traffic volume shall be documented. The 
documentation shall include the factors discussed in paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section. The documentation shall remain available as long as the 
traffic

[[Page 146]]

or travel estimates discussed in paragraph (g) of this section remain 
current. Copies of the State's documentation shall be provided to the 
FHWA Division Administrator when it is initially developed and after 
each revision.

    Metropolitan areas means the geographic areas designated as 
Metropolitan Statistical Areas by the Office of Management and Budget in 
the Executive Office of the President with a population exceeding 
1,000,000 inhabitants.
    Real-time information program means the program by which States 
gather and make available the data for traffic and travel conditions. 
Such means may involve State-only activity (including cooperative 
activities engaging multiple State agencies), State partnership with 
commercial providers of value-added information products, or other 
effective means that enable the State to satisfy the provisions for 
traffic and travel time conditions reporting stated in this section.
    Routes of significance are non-Interstate roadways in metropolitan 
areas that are designated by States as meriting the collection and 
provision of information related to traffic and travel conditions. 
Factors to be considered in designating routes of significance include 
roadway safety (e.g., crash rate, routes affected by environmental 
events), public safety (e.g., routes used for evacuations), economic 
productivity, severity and frequency of congestion, and utility of the 
highway to serve as a diversion route for congestion locations. All 
public roadways including arterial highways, toll facilities and other 
facilities that apply end user pricing mechanisms shall be considered 
when designating routes of significance. In identifying these routes, 
States shall apply the collaborative practices and procedures that are 
used for compliance with 23 CFR part 940 and 23 CFR part 420.

construction on new location and removed from the Federal-aid system and 
the replaced section thereof is approved by the FHWA as the new location 
of the Federal-aid route. Federal-aid funds may not participate in 
rehabilitation work performed for the purpose of placing the superseded 
section of the highway in a condition acceptable to the local authority. 
The relinquishment of any Interstate mileage shall be submitted to the 
Federal Highway Administrator as a special case for prior approval.
    (2) Sections of reconstructed local facilities that are located 
outside the control of access lines, such as turn-arounds of severed 
local roads or streets adjacent to the Federal-aid project's right-of-
way, and local roads and streets crossing over or under said project 
that have been adjusted in grade and/or alignment, including new right-
of-way required for adjustments. Eligibility for Federal-aid 
participation in the costs of the foregoing adjustments is as determined 
at the time of PS&E approval under policies of the FHWA.
    (3) Frontage roads or portions thereof that are constructed 
generally parallel to and outside the control of access lines of a 
Federal-aid project for the purpose of permitting access to private 
properties rather than to serve as extensions of ramps to connect said 
Federal-aid project with the nearest crossroad or street.
    (d) The following facilities may be relinquished only with the 
approval of the Federal Highway Administrator in accordance with 
paragraph 203(g).
    (1) Frontage roads or portions thereof located outside the access 
control lines of a Federal-aid project that are constructed to service 
(in lieu of or in addition to the purposes outlined under paragraph 
(c)(3) of this section) as connections between ramps to or from the 
Federal-aid project and existing public roads or streets.
    (2) Ramps constructed to serve as connections for interchange of 
traffic between the Federal-aid project and local roads or streets.
    (e) Where a frontage road is not on an approved Federal-aid system 
title to the right-of-way may be acquired initially in the name of the 
political subdivision which is to assume control thus eliminating the 
necessity of a formal transfer later. Such procedure would be subject to 
prior FHWA approval and would be limited to those facilities which meet 
the criteria set forth in paragraphs (c) (2) and (3) of this section.
    (f) Upon presentation by a State that it intends to relinquish 
facilities such as described in paragraph (c) (1), (2) or (3) of this 
section to local authorities, the division engineer of the FHWA shall 
have appropriate field and office examination made thereof to assure 
that such relinquishments are in accordance with the provisions of the 
cited paragraphs. Relinquishments of the types described in paragraph 
(c) (1), (2) or (3) of this section may be made on an individual basis 
or on a project or route basis subject to the following conditions and 
understandings:
    (1) Immediately following action by the State in approving a 
relinquishment, it shall furnish to the Division Administrator for 
record purposes a

[[Page 155]]

copy of a suitable map or maps identified by the Federal-aid project 
number, with the facilities to be relinquished and the date of such 
relinquishment action clearly delineated thereon.
    (2) If it is found at any time after relinquishment that a 
relinquished facility is in fact required for the safe and proper 
operation of the Federal-aid highway, the State shall take immediate 
action to restore such facility to its jurisdiction without cost to 
Federal-aid highway funds.
    (3) If it is found at any time that a relinquished frontage road or 
portion thereof or any part of the right-of-way therefor has been 
abandoned by local governmental authority and a showing cannot be made 
that such abandoned facility is no longer required as a public road, it 
is to be understood that the Federal Highway Administrator may cause to 
be withheld from Federal-aid highway funds due to the State an amount 
equal to the Federal-aid participation in the abandoned facility.
    (4) In no case shall any relinquishment include any portion of the 
right-of-way within the access control lines as shown on the plans for a 
Federal-aid project approved by the FHWA, without the prior approval of 
the Federal Highway Administrator.
    (5) There cannot be additional Federal-aid participation in future 
construction or reconstruction on any relinquished ``off the Federal-aid 
system'' facility unless the underlying reason for such future work is 
caused by future improvement of the associated Federal-aid highway.
    (g) In the event that a State desires to apply for approval by the 
Federal Highway Administrator for the relinquishment of a facility such 
as described in paragraph (d) (1) and (2) of this section, the facts 
pertinent to such proposal are to be presented to the division engineer 
of the FHWA. The division engineer shall have appropriate review made of 
such presentation and forward the material presented by the State 
together with his findings thereon through the Regional Federal Highway 
Administrator for consideration by the Federal Highway Administrator and 
determination of action to be taken.
    (h) No change may be made in control of access, without the joint 
determination and approval of the SHA and FHWA. This would not prevent 
the relinquishment of title, without prior approval of the FHWA, of a 
segment of the right-of-way provided there is an abandonment of a 
section of highway inclusive of such segment.
    (i) Relinquishments must be justified by the State's finding 
concurred in by the FHWA, that:
    (1) The subject land will not be needed for Federal-aid highway 
purposes in the foreseeable future;
    (2) That the right-of-way being retained is adequate under present 
day standards for the facility involved;
    (3) That the release will not adversely affect the Federal-aid 
highway facility or the traffic thereon;
    (4) That the lands to be relinquished are not suitable for retention 
in order to restore, preserve, or improve the scenic beauty adjacent to 
the highway consonant with the intent of 23 U.S.C. 319 and Pub. L. 89-
285, Title III, sections 302-305 (Highway Beautification Act of 1965).
    (j) If a relinquishment is to a Federal, State, or local government 
agency for highway purposes, there need not be a charge to the said 
agency, nor in such event any credit to Federal funds. If for any reason 
there is a charge, the STD may retain the Federal share of the proceeds 
if used for projects eligible under title 23 of the United States Code.

<R05>
Sec. 625.1  Purpose.

    To designate those standards, policies, and standard specifications 
that are acceptable to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for 
application in the geometric and structural design of highways.


<R05>
Sec. 625.2  Policy.

    (a) Plans and specifications for proposed National Highway System 
(NHS) projects shall provide for a facility that will--
    (1) Adequately serve the existing and planned future traffic of the 
highway in a manner that is conducive to safety, durability, and economy 
of maintenance; and
    (2) Be designed and constructed in accordance with criteria best 
suited to accomplish the objectives described in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section and to conform to the particular needs of each locality.
    (b) Resurfacing, restoration, and rehabilitation (RRR) projects, 
other than those on the Interstate system and other freeways, shall be 
constructed in accordance with standards which preserve and extend the 
service life of highways and enhance highway safety. Resurfacing, 
restoration, and rehabilitation work includes placement of additional 
surface material and/or other work necessary to return an existing 
roadway, including shoulders, bridges, the roadside, and appurtenances 
to a condition of structural or functional adequacy.
    (c) An important goal of the FHWA is to provide the highest 
practical and feasible level of safety for people and property 
associated with the Nation's highway transportation systems and to 
reduce highway hazards and the resulting number and severity of 
accidents on all the Nation's highways.


<R05>
Sec. 625.3  Application.

    (a) Applicable Standards. (1) Design and construction standards for 
new construction, reconstruction, resurfacing (except for maintenance 
resurfacing), restoration, or rehabilitation of a highway on the NHS 
(other than a highway also on the Interstate System or other freeway) 
shall be those approved by the Secretary in cooperation with the State 
highway departments. These standards may take into account, in addition 
to the criteria described in Sec. 625.2(a), the following:
    (i) The constructed and natural environment of the area;
    (ii) The environmental, scenic, aesthetic, historic, community, and 
preservation impacts of the activity; and
    (iii) Access for other modes of transportation.
    (2) Federal-aid projects not on the NHS are to be designed, 
constructed, operated, and maintained in accordance with State laws, 
regulations, directives, safety standards, design standards, and 
construction standards.
    (b) The standards, policies, and standard specifications cited in 
Sec. 625.4 of this part contain specific criteria and controls for the 
design of NHS projects. Deviations from specific minimum values therein 
are to be handled in accordance with procedures in paragraph (f) of this 
section. If there is a conflict between criteria in the documents 
enumerated in Sec. 625.4 of this part, the latest listed standard, 
policy, or standard specification will govern.
    (c) Application of FHWA regulations, although cited in Sec. 625.4 
of this part as standards, policies, and standard specifications, shall 
be as set forth therein.
    (d) This regulation establishes Federal standards for work on the 
NHS regardless of funding source.
    (e) The Division Administrator shall determine the applicability of 
the roadway geometric design standards to traffic engineering, safety, 
and preventive maintenance projects which include very minor or no 
roadway work. Formal findings of applicability are expected only as 
needed to resolve controversies.
    (f) Exceptions. (1) Approval within the delegated authority provided 
by FHWA Order M1100.1A may be given on a project basis to designs which 
do not conform to the minimum criteria as set forth in the standards, 
policies, and standard specifications for:
    (i) Experimental features on projects; and
    (ii) Projects where conditions warrant that exceptions be made.
    (2) The determination to approve a project design that does not 
conform to the minimum criteria is to be made only after due 
consideration is given to

[[Page 157]]

all project conditions such as maximum service and safety benefits for 
the dollar invested, compatibility with adjacent sections of roadway and 
the probable time before reconstruction of the section due to increased 
traffic demands or changed conditions.

<R05>
Sec. 627.1  Purpose and applicability.

    (a) This regulation will establish a program to improve project 
quality, reduce project costs, foster innovation, eliminate unnecessary 
and costly design elements, and ensure efficient investments by 
requiring the application of value engineering (VE) to all Federal-aid 
highway projects on the National Highway System (NHS) with an estimated 
cost of $25 million or more.
    (b) In accordance with the Federal-State relationship established 
under the Federal-aid highway program, State transportation departments 
(STDs) shall assure that a VE analysis has been performed on all 
applicable projects and that all resulting, approved recommendations are 
incorporated into the plans, specifications and estimate.

[62 FR 6868, Feb. 14, 1997, as amended at 67 FR 75924, Dec. 10, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 627.3  Definitions.

    Project. A portion of a highway that a State proposes to construct, 
reconstruct, or improve as described in the preliminary design report or 
applicable environmental document. A project may consist of several 
contracts or phases over several years.
    Value engineering. The systematic application of recognized 
techniques by a multi-disciplined team to identify the function of a 
product or service, establish a worth for that function, generate 
alternatives through the use of creative thinking, and provide the 
needed functions to accomplish the original purpose of the project, 
reliably, and at the lowest life-cycle cost without sacrificing safety, 
necessary quality, and environmental attributes of the project.


<R05>
Sec. 627.5  General principles and procedures.

    (a) State VE programs. State transportation departments must 
establish programs to assure that VE studies are performed on all 
Federal-aid highway projects on the NHS with an estimated cost of $25 
million or more. Program

[[Page 159]]

procedures should provide for the identification of candidate projects 
for VE studies early in the development of the State's multi-year 
Statewide Transportation Improvement Program.
    (1) Project selection. The program may, at the State's discretion, 
establish specific criteria and guidelines for selecting other highway 
projects for VE studies.
    (2) Studies. Value engineering studies shall follow the widely 
recognized systematic problem-solving analysis process that is used 
throughout private industry and governmental agencies. Studies must be 
performed using multi-disciplined teams of individuals not personally 
involved in the design of the project. Study teams should consist of a 
team leader and individuals from different speciality areas, such as 
design, construction, environment, planning, maintenance, right-of-way, 
and other areas depending upon the type of project being reviewed. 
Individuals from the public and other agencies may also be included on 
the team when their inclusion is found to be in the public interest.
    (i) Each team leader should be trained and knowledgeable in VE 
techniques and be able to serve as the coordinator and facilitator of 
the team.
    (ii) Studies should be employed as early as possible in the project 
development or design process so that accepted VE recommendations can be 
implemented without delaying the progress of the project.
    (iii) Studies should conclude with a formal report outlining the 
study team's recommendations for improving the project and reducing its 
overall cost.
    (3) Recommendations. The program should include procedures to 
approve or reject recommendations and ensure the prompt review of VE 
recommendations by staff offices whose speciality areas are implicated 
in proposed changes and by offices responsible for implementing accepted 
recommendations. Reviews by these offices should be performed promptly 
to minimize delays to the project.
    (4) Incentives. The program may include a VE or cost reduction 
incentive clause in an STD's standard specifications or project special 
provisions that allows construction contractors to submit change 
proposals and share the resulting cost savings with the STD.
    (5) Monitoring. The program should include procedures for monitoring 
the implementation of VE study team recommendations and VE change 
proposal recommendations submitted by construction contractors.
    (b) State VE coordinators. Individuals knowledgeable in VE shall be 
assigned responsibilities to coordinate and monitor the STD's program 
and be actively involved in all phases of the program.
    (c) Use of consultants. Consultants or firms with experience in VE 
may be retained by STDs to conduct the studies of Federal-aid highway 
projects or elements of Federal-aid highway projects required under 
Sec. 627.1(a) of this part. Consultants or firms should not be retained 
to conduct studies of their own designs unless they maintain separate 
and distinct organizational separation of their VE and design sections.
    (d) Funding eligibility. The cost of performing VE studies is 
project related and is, therefore, eligible for reimbursement with 
Federal-aid highway funds at the appropriate pro-rata share for the 
project studied.
    (e) In the case of a Federal-aid design-build project meeting the 
project criteria in 23 CFR 627.1(a), the STDs shall fulfill the value 
engineering analysis requirement by performing a value engineering 
analysis prior to the release of the Request for Proposals document.

<R05>
Sec. 630.102  Purpose.

    The purpose of this subpart is to prescribe policies for authorizing 
Federal-aid projects through execution of the project agreement required 
by 23 U.S.C. 106(a)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 630.104  Applicability.

    (a) This subpart is applicable to all Federal-aid projects unless 
specifically exempted.
    (b) Other projects which involve special procedures are to be 
approved, or authorized as set out in the implementing instructions or 
regulations for those projects.


<R05>
Sec. 630.106  Authorization to proceed.

    (a)(1) The State transportation department (STD) must obtain an 
authorization to proceed from the FHWA before beginning work on any 
Federal-aid project. The STD may request an authorization to proceed in 
writing or by electronic mail for a project or a group of projects.
    (2) The FHWA will issue the authorization to proceed either through 
or after the execution of a formal project agreement with the State. The 
agreement can be executed only after applicable prerequisite 
requirements of Federal laws and implementing regulations and directives 
are satisfied. Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of 
this section, the FHWA will obligate Federal funds in the project or 
group of projects upon execution of the project agreement.
    (3) The State's request that Federal funds be obligated shall be 
supported by a documented cost estimate that is based on the State's 
best estimate of costs.
    (4) The State shall maintain a process to adjust project cost 
estimates. For example, the process would require a review of the 
project cost estimate when the bid is approved, a project phase is 
completed, a design change is approved, etc. Specifically, the State 
shall revise the Federal funds obligated

[[Page 161]]

within 90 days after it has determined that the estimated Federal share 
of project costs has decreased by $250,000 or more.
    (5) The State shall review, on a quarterly basis, inactive projects 
(for the purposes of this subpart an ``inactive project'' means a 
project for which no expenditures have been charged against Federal 
funds for the past 12 months) with unexpended Federal obligations and 
shall revise the Federal funds obligated for a project within 90 days to 
reflect the current cost estimate, based on the following criteria:
    (i) Projects inactive for the past 12 months with unexpended 
balances more than $500,000,
    (ii) Projects inactive for the past 24 months with unexpended 
balances of $50,000 to $500,000, and
    (iii) Projects inactive for the past 36 months with unexpended 
balances less than $50,000.
    (6) If the State fails to comply with the requirements of paragraphs 
(a)(3), (4), or (5) of this section, then the FHWA shall revise the 
obligations or take such other action as authorized by 23 CFR 1.36. The 
FHWA shall advise the State of its proposed actions and provide the 
State with the opportunity to respond before actions are taken. The FHWA 
shall not adjust obligations without a State's consent during the August 
redistribution process, August 1 to September 30.
    (7) For design-build projects, the execution or modification of the 
project agreement for final design and physical construction, and 
authorization to proceed, shall not occur until after the completion of 
the NEPA process. However, preliminary design (as defined in 23 CFR 
636.103) and preliminary engineering may be authorized in accordance 
with this section.
    (b) Federal funds shall not participate in costs incurred prior to 
the date of a project agreement except as provided by 23 CFR 1.9(b).
    (c) The execution of the project agreement shall be deemed a 
contractual obligation of the Federal government under 23 U.S.C. 106 and 
shall require that appropriate funds be available at the time of 
authorization for the agreed Federal share, either pro rata or lump sum, 
of the cost of eligible work to be incurred by the State except as 
follows:
    (1) Advance construction projects authorized under 23 U.S.C. 115.
    (2) Projects for preliminary studies for the portion of the 
preliminary engineering and right-of-way (ROW) phase(s) through the 
selection of a location.
    (3) Projects for ROW acquisition in hardship and protective buying 
situations through the selection of a particular location. This includes 
ROW acquisition within a potential highway corridor under consideration 
where necessary to preserve the corridor for future highway purposes. 
Authorization of work under this paragraph shall be in accord with the 
provisions of 23 CFR part 710.
    (4) In special cases where the Federal Highway Administrator 
determines it to be in the best interest of the Federal-aid highway 
program.
    (d) For projects authorized to proceed under paragraphs (c)(1) 
through (c)(4) of this section, the executed project agreement shall 
contain the following statement: ``Authorization to proceed is not a 
commitment or obligation to provide Federal funds for that portion of 
the undertaking not fully funded herein.''
    (e) For projects authorized under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of 
this section, subsequent authorizations beyond the location stage shall 
not be given until appropriate available funds have been obligated to 
cover eligible costs of the work covered by the previous authorization.
    (f)(1) The Federal-aid share of eligible project costs shall be 
established at the time the project agreement is executed in one of the 
following manners:
    (i) Pro rata, with the agreement stating the Federal share as a 
specified percentage; or
    (ii) Lump sum, with the agreement stating that Federal funds are 
limited to a specified dollar amount not to exceed the legal pro rata.
    (2) The pro-rata or lump sum share may be adjusted before or shortly 
after contract award to reflect any substantive change in the bids 
received as compared to the STD's estimated cost

[[Page 162]]

of the project at the time of FHWA authorization, provided that Federal 
funds are available.
    (3) Federal participation is limited to the agreed Federal share of 
eligible costs actually incurred by the State, not to exceed the maximum 
permitted by enabling legislation.
    (g) The State may contribute more than the normal non-Federal share 
of title 23, U.S.C. projects. In general, financing proposals that 
result in only minimal amounts of Federal funds in projects should be 
avoided unless they are based on sound project management decisions.
    (h)(1) Donations of cash, land, material or services may be credited 
to the State's non-Federal share of the participating project work in 
accordance with title 23, U.S.C., and implementing regulations.
    (2) Contributions may not exceed the total costs incurred by the 
State on the project. Cash contributions from all sources plus the 
Federal funds may not exceed the total cost of the project.

    Source: 69 FR 54569, Sept. 9, 2004, unless otherwise noted.

[[Page 166]]


<R05>
Sec. 630.1002  Purpose.

    Work zones directly impact the safety and mobility of road users and 
highway workers. These safety and mobility impacts are exacerbated by an 
aging highway infrastructure and growing congestion in many locations. 
Addressing these safety and mobility issues requires considerations that 
start early in project development and continue through project 
completion. Part 6 of the Manual On Uniform Traffic Control Devices 
(MUTCD) \1\ sets forth basic principles and prescribes standards for the 
design, application, installation, and maintenance of traffic control 
devices for highway and street construction, maintenance operation, and 
utility work. In addition to the provisions in the MUTCD, there are 
other actions that could be taken to further help mitigate the safety 
and mobility impacts of work zones. This subpart establishes 
requirements and provides guidance for systematically addressing the 
safety and mobility impacts of work zones, and developing strategies to 
help manage these impacts on all Federal-aid highway projects.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The MUTCD is approved by the FHWA and recognized as the national 
standard for traffic control on all public roads. It is incorporated by 
reference into the Code of Federal Regulations at 23 CFR part 655. It is 
available on the FHWA's Web site at http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov and is 
available for inspection and copying at the FHWA Washington, DC 
Headquarters and all FHWA Division Offices as prescribed at 49 CFR part 
7.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 630.1004  Definitions and explanation of terms.

    As used in this subpart:
    Highway workers include, but are not limited to, personnel of the 
contractor, subcontractor, DOT, utilities, and law enforcement, 
performing work within the right-of-way of a transportation facility.
    Mobility is the ability to move from place to place and is 
significantly dependent on the availability of transportation facilities 
and on system operating conditions. With specific reference to work 
zones, mobility pertains to moving road users efficiently through or 
around a work zone area with a minimum delay compared to baseline travel 
when no work zone is present, while not compromising the safety of 
highway workers or road users. The commonly used performance measures 
for the assessment of mobility include delay, speed, travel time and 
queue lengths.
    Safety is a representation of the level of exposure to potential 
hazards for users of transportation facilities and highway workers. With 
specific reference to work zones, safety refers to minimizing potential 
hazards to road users in the vicinity of a work zone and highway workers 
at the work zone interface with traffic. The commonly used measures for 
highway safety are the number of crashes or the consequences of crashes 
(fatalities and injuries) at a given location or along a section of 
highway during a period of time. Highway worker safety in work zones 
refers to the safety of workers at the work zone interface with traffic 
and the impacts of the work zone design on worker safety. The number of 
worker fatalities and injuries at a given location or along a section of 
highway, during a period of time are commonly used measures for highway 
worker safety.
    Work zone \2\ is an area of a highway with construction, 
maintenance, or utility work activities. A work zone is typically marked 
by signs, channelizing devices, barriers, pavement markings, and/or work 
vehicles. It extends from the first warning sign or high-intensity 
rotating, flashing, oscillating, or strobe lights on a vehicle to the 
END ROAD WORK sign or the last temporary traffic control (TTC) device.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ MUTCD, Part 6, ``Temporary Traffic Control,'' Section 6C.02, 
``Temporary Traffic Control Zones.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Work zone crash \3\ means a traffic crash in which the first harmful 
event

[[Page 167]]

occurs within the boundaries of a work zone or on an approach to or exit 
from a work zone, resulting from an activity, behavior, or control 
related to the movement of the traffic units through the work zone. This 
includes crashes occurring on approach to, exiting from or adjacent to 
work zones that are related to the work zone.

Ed. (Electronic), 2003, produced by National Center for Statistics and 
Analysis, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). 
Telephone 1-(800)-934-8517. Available at the URL: http://www-
nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov. The NHTSA, the FHWA, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Administration (FMCSA), and the Governors Highway Safety Association 
(GHSA) sponsored the development of the MMUCC Guideline which recommends 
voluntary implementation of the 111 MMUCC data elements and serves as a 
reporting threshold that includes all persons (injured and uninjured) in 
crashes statewide involving death, personal injury, or property damage 
of $1,000 or more. The Guideline is a tool to strengthen existing State 
crash data systems.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Work zone impacts refer to work zone-induced deviations from the 
normal range of transportation system safety and mobility. The extent of 
the work zone impacts may vary based on factors such as, road 
classification, area type (urban, suburban, and rural), traffic and 
travel characteristics, type of work being performed, time of day/night, 
and complexity of the project. These impacts may extend beyond the 
physical location of the work zone itself, and may occur on the roadway 
on which the work is being performed, as well as other highway 
corridors, other modes of transportation, and/or the regional 
transportation network.


<R05>
Sec. 630.1006  Work zone safety and mobility policy.

    Each State shall implement a policy for the systematic consideration 
and management of work zone impacts on all Federal-aid highway projects. 
This policy shall address work zone impacts throughout the various 
stages of the project development and implementation process. This 
policy may take the form of processes, procedures, and/or guidance, and 
may vary based on the characteristics and expected work zone impacts of 
individual projects or classes of projects. The States should institute 
this policy using a multi-disciplinary team and in partnership with the 
FHWA. The States are encouraged to implement this policy for non-
Federal-aid projects as well.


<R05>
Sec. 630.1008  State-level processes and procedures.

    (a) This section consists of State-level processes and procedures 
for States to implement and sustain their respective work zone safety 
and mobility policies. State-level processes and procedures, data and 
information resources, training, and periodic evaluation enable a 
systematic approach for addressing and managing the safety and mobility 
impacts of work zones.
    (b) Work zone assessment and management procedures. States should 
develop and implement systematic procedures to assess work zone impacts 
in project development, and to manage safety and mobility during project 
implementation. The scope of these procedures shall be based on the 
project characteristics.
    (c) Work zone data. States shall use field observations, available 
work zone crash data, and operational information to manage work zone 
impacts for specific projects during implementation. States shall 
continually pursue improvement of work zone safety and mobility by 
analyzing work zone crash and operational data from multiple projects to 
improve State processes and procedures. States should maintain elements 
of the data and information resources that are necessary to support 
these activities.
    (d) Training. States shall require that personnel involved in the 
development, design, implementation, operation, inspection, and 
enforcement of work zone related transportation management and traffic 
control be trained, appropriate to the job decisions each individual is 
required to make. States shall require periodic training updates that 
reflect changing industry practices and State processes and procedures.
    (e) Process review. In order to assess the effectiveness of work 
zone safety and mobility procedures, the States shall perform a process 
review at least every two years. This review may include the evaluation 
of work zone data at the State level, and/or review of randomly selected 
projects throughout their jurisdictions. Appropriate personnel who 
represent the project development stages and the different offices 
within the State, and the FHWA should participate in this review. Other 
non-State stakeholders may also be included in this review, as 
appropriate. The results of the review are intended to lead to 
improvements in work zone

[[Page 168]]

processes and procedures, data and information resources, and training 
programs so as to enhance efforts to address safety and mobility on 
current and future projects.


<R05>
Sec. 630.1010  Significant projects.

    (a) A significant project is one that, alone or in combination with 
other concurrent projects nearby is anticipated to cause sustained work 
zone impacts (as defined in Sec. 630.1004) that are greater than what 
is considered tolerable based on State policy and/or engineering 
judgment.
    (b) The applicability of the provisions in Sec. Sec. 630.1012(b)(2) 
and 630.1012(b)(3) is dependent upon whether a project is determined to 
be significant. The State shall identify upcoming projects that are 
expected to be significant. This identification of significant projects 
should be done as early as possible in the project delivery and 
development process, and in cooperation with the FHWA. The State's work 
zone policy provisions, the project's characteristics, and the magnitude 
and extent of the anticipated work zone impacts should be considered 
when determining if a project is significant or not.
    (c) All Interstate system projects within the boundaries of a 
designated Transportation Management Area (TMA) that occupy a location 
for more than three days with either intermittent or continuous lane 
closures shall be considered as significant projects.
    (d) For an Interstate system project or categories of Interstate 
system projects that are classified as significant through the 
application of the provisions in Sec. 630.1010(c), but in the judgment 
of the State they do not cause sustained work zone impacts, the State 
may request from the FHWA, an exception to Sec. Sec. 630.1012(b)(2) and 
630.1012(b)(3). Exceptions to these provisions may be granted by the 
FHWA based on the State's ability to show that the specific Interstate 
system project or categories of Interstate system projects do not have 
sustained work zone impacts.


<R05>
Sec. 630.1012  Project-level procedures.

    (a) This section provides guidance and establishes procedures for 
States to manage the work zone impacts of individual projects.
    (b) Transportation Management Plan (TMP). A TMP consists of 
strategies to manage the work zone impacts of a project. Its scope, 
content, and degree of detail may vary based upon the State's work zone 
policy, and the State's understanding of the expected work zone impacts 
of the project. For significant projects (as defined in Sec. 630.1010), 
the State shall develop a TMP that consists of a Temporary Traffic 
Control (TTC) plan and addresses both Transportation Operations (TO) and 
Public Information (PI) components. For individual projects or classes 
of projects that the State determines to have less than significant work 
zone impacts, the TMP may consist only of a TTC plan. States are 
encouraged to consider TO and PI issues for all projects.
    (1) A TTC plan describes TTC measures to be used for facilitating 
road users through a work zone or an incident area. The TTC plan plays a 
vital role in providing continuity of reasonably safe and efficient road 
user flow and highway worker safety when a work zone, incident, or other 
event temporarily disrupts normal road user flow. The TTC plan shall be 
consistent with the provisions under Part 6 of the MUTCD and with the 
work zone hardware recommendations in Chapter 9 of the American 
Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) 
Roadside Design Guide. Chapter 9 of the AASHTO Roadside Design Guide: 
``Traffic Barriers, Traffic Control Devices, and Other Safety Features 
for Work Zones'' 2002, is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 
U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51 and is on file at the National Archives 
and Record Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of 
this material at NARA call (202) 741-6030, or go to http://
www.archives.gov/federal--register/code--of--federal--regulations/ibr--
locations.html. The entire document is available for purchase from the 
American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials 
(AASHTO), 444 North Capitol Street, NW., Suite 249, Washington, DC 20001 
or

[[Page 169]]

at the URL: http://www.aashto.org/bookstore. It is available for 
inspection from the FHWA Washington Headquarters and all Division 
Offices as listed in 49 CFR part 7. In developing and implementing the 
TTC plan, pre-existing roadside safety hardware shall be maintained at 
an equivalent or better level than existed prior to project 
implementation. The scope of the TTC plan is determined by the project 
characteristics, and the traffic safety and control requirements 
identified by the State for that project. The TTC plan shall either be a 
reference to specific TTC elements in the MUTCD, approved standard TTC 
plans, State transportation department TTC manual, or be designed 
specifically for the project.
    (2) The TO component of the TMP shall include the identification of 
strategies that will be used to mitigate impacts of the work zone on the 
operation and management of the transportation system within the work 
zone impact area. Typical TO strategies may include, but are not limited 
to, demand management, corridor/network management, safety management 
and enforcement, and work zone traffic management. The scope of the TO 
component should be determined by the project characteristics, and the 
transportation operations and safety strategies identified by the State.
    (3) The PI component of the TMP shall include communications 
strategies that seek to inform affected road users, the general public, 
area residences and businesses, and appropriate public entities about 
the project, the expected work zone impacts, and the changing conditions 
on the project. This may include traveler information strategies. The 
scope of the PI component should be determined by the project 
characteristics and the public information and outreach strategies 
identified by the State. Public information should be provided through 
methods best suited for the project, and may include, but not be limited 
to, information on the project characteristics, expected impacts, 
closure details, and commuter alternatives.
    (4) States should develop and implement the TMP in sustained 
consultation with stakeholders (e.g., other transportation agencies, 
railroad agencies/operators, transit providers, freight movers, utility 
suppliers, police, fire, emergency medical services, schools, business 
communities, and regional transportation management centers).
    (c) The Plans, Specifications, and Estimates (PS&Es) shall include 
either a TMP or provisions for contractors to develop a TMP at the most 
appropriate project phase as applicable to the State's chosen 
contracting methodology for the project. A contractor developed TMP 
shall be subject to the approval of the State, and shall not be 
implemented before it is approved by the State.
    (d) The PS&Es shall include appropriate pay item provisions for 
implementing the TMP, either through method or performance based 
specifications.
    (1) For method-based specifications individual pay items, lump sum 
payment, or a combination thereof may be used.
    (2) For performance based specifications, applicable performance 
criteria and standards may be used (e.g., safety performance criteria 
such as number of crashes within the work zone; mobility performance 
criteria such as travel time through the work zone, delay, queue length, 
traffic volume; incident response and clearance criteria; work duration 
criteria).
    (e) Responsible persons. The State and the contractor shall each 
designate a trained person, as specified in Sec. 630.1008(d), at the 
project level who has the primary responsibility and sufficient 
authority for implementing the TMP and other safety and mobility aspects 
of the project.


<R05>
Sec. 630.1014  Implementation.

    Each State shall work in partnership with the FHWA in the 
implementation of its policies and procedures to improve work zone 
safety and mobility. At a minimum, this shall involve an FHWA review of 
conformance of the State's policies and procedures with this regulation 
and reassessment of the State's implementation of its procedures at 
appropriate intervals. Each State is encouraged to address 
implementation of this regulation in its

[[Page 170]]

stewardship agreement with the FHWA.


<R05>
Sec. 630.1016  Compliance date.

    States shall comply with all the provisions of this rule no later 
than October 12, 2007. For projects that are in the later stages of 
development at or about the compliance date, and if it is determined 
that the delivery of those projects would be significantly impacted as a 
result of this rule's provisions, States may request variances for those 
projects from the FHWA, on a project-by-project basis.

injuries to workers and road users by establishing minimum requirements 
and providing guidance for the use of positive protection devices 
between the work space and motorized traffic, installation and 
maintenance of temporary traffic control devices, and use of uniformed 
law enforcement officers during construction, utility, and maintenance 
operations, and by requiring contract pay items to ensure the 
availability of funds for these provisions. This subpart is applicable 
to all Federal-aid highway projects, and its application is encouraged 
on other highway projects as well.


<R05>
Sec. 630.1104  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this subpart, the following definitions apply:
    Agency means a State or local highway agency or authority that 
receives Federal-aid highway funding.
    Exposure Control Measures means traffic management strategies to 
avoid work zone crashes involving workers and motorized traffic by 
eliminating or reducing traffic through the work zone, or diverting 
traffic away from the work space.
    Federal-aid Highway Project means highway construction, maintenance, 
and utility projects funded in whole or in part with Federal-aid funds.
    Motorized Traffic means the motorized traveling public. This term 
does not include motorized construction or maintenance vehicles and 
equipment within the work space.
    Other Traffic Control Measures means all strategies and temporary 
traffic controls other than Positive Protection Devices and Exposure 
Control Measures, but including uniformed law enforcement officers, used

    Work Zone Safety Management means the entire range of traffic 
management and control and highway safety strategies and devices used to 
avoid crashes in work zones that can lead to worker and road user 
injuries and fatalities, including Positive Protection Devices, Exposure 
Control Measures, and Other Traffic Control Measures.


<R05>
Sec. 630.1106  Policy and procedures for work zone safety management.

    (a) Each agency's policy and processes, procedures, and/or guidance 
for the systematic consideration and management of work zone impacts, to 
be

[[Page 171]]

established in accordance with 23 CFR 630.1006, shall include the 
consideration and management of road user and worker safety on Federal-
aid highway projects. These processes, procedures, and/or guidance, to 
be developed in partnership with the FHWA, shall address the use of 
Positive Protection Devices to prevent the intrusion of motorized 
traffic into the work space and other potentially hazardous areas in the 
work zone; Exposure Control Measures to avoid or minimize worker 
exposure to motorized traffic and road user exposure to work activities; 
Other Traffic Control Measures including uniformed law enforcement 
officers to minimize work zone crashes; and the safe entry/exit of work 
vehicles onto/from the travel lanes. Each of these strategies should be 
used to the extent that they are possible, practical, and adequate to 
manage work zone exposure and reduce the risks of crashes resulting in 
fatalities or injuries to workers and road users.
    (b) Agency processes, procedures, and/or guidance should be based on 
consideration of standards and/or guidance contained in the Manual on 
Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) and the AASHTO Roadside Design 
Guide, as well as project characteristics and factors. The strategies 
and devices to be used may be determined by a project-specific 
engineering study, or determined from agency guidelines that define 
strategies and approaches to be used based on project and highway 
characteristics and factors. The types of measures and strategies to be 
used are not mutually exclusive, and should be considered in combination 
as appropriate based on characteristics and factors such as those listed 
below:
    (1) Project scope and duration;
    (2) Anticipated traffic speeds through the work zone;
    (3) Anticipated traffic volume;
    (4) Vehicle mix;
    (5) Type of work (as related to worker exposure and crash risks);
    (6) Distance between traffic and workers, and extent of worker 
exposure;
    (7) Escape paths available for workers to avoid a vehicle intrusion 
into the work space;
    (8) Time of day (e.g., night work);
    (9) Work area restrictions (including impact on worker exposure);
    (10) Consequences from/to road users resulting from roadway 
departure;
    (11) Potential hazard to workers and road users presented by device 
itself and during device placement and removal;
    (12) Geometrics that may increase crash risks (e.g., poor sight 
distance, sharp curves);
    (13) Access to/from work space;
    (14) Roadway classification; and
    (15) Impacts on project cost and duration.
    (c) Uniformed Law Enforcement Policy. Each agency, in partnership 
with the FHWA, shall develop a policy addressing the use of uniformed 
law enforcement on Federal-aid highway projects. The policy may consist 
of processes, procedures, and/or guidance. The processes, procedures, 
and/or guidance should address the following:
    (1) Basic interagency agreements between the highway agency and 
appropriate law enforcement agencies to address work zone enforcement 
needs;
    (2) Interaction between highway and law-enforcement agency during 
project planning and development;
    (3) Conditions where law enforcement involvement in work zone 
traffic control may be needed or beneficial, and criteria to determine 
the project-specific need for law enforcement;
    (4) General nature of law enforcement services to be provided, and 
procedures to determine project-specific services;
    (5) Appropriate work zone safety and mobility training for the 
officers, consistent with the training requirements in 23 CFR 
630.1008(d);
    (6) Procedures for interagency and project-level communications 
between highway agency and law enforcement personnel; and
    (7) Reimbursement agreements for law enforcement service.


<R05>
Sec. 630.1108  Work zone safety management measures and strategies.

    (a) Positive Protection Devices. The need for longitudinal traffic 
barrier and other positive protection devices shall be based on an 
engineering study. The engineering study may be used to develop positive 
protection guidelines

[[Page 172]]

for the agency, or to determine the measures to be applied on an 
individual project. The engineering study should be based on 
consideration of the factors and characteristics described in section 
630.1106(b). At a minimum, positive protection devices shall be 
considered in work zone situations that place workers at increased risk 
from motorized traffic, and where positive protection devices offer the 
highest potential for increased safety for workers and road users, such 
as:
    (1) Work zones that provide workers no means of escape from 
motorized traffic (e.g., tunnels, bridges, etc.);
    (2) Long duration work zones (e.g., two weeks or more) resulting in 
substantial worker exposure to motorized traffic;
    (3) Projects with high anticipated operating speeds (e.g., 45 mph or 
greater), especially when combined with high traffic volumes;
    (4) Work operations that place workers close to travel lanes open to 
traffic; and
    (5) Roadside hazards, such as drop-offs or unfinished bridge decks, 
that will remain in place overnight or longer.
    (b) Exposure Control Measures. Exposure Control Measures should be 
considered where appropriate to avoid or minimize worker exposure to 
motorized traffic and exposure of road users to work activities, while 
also providing adequate consideration to the potential impacts on 
mobility. A wide range of measures may be appropriate for use on 
individual projects, such as:
    (1) Full road closures;
    (2) Ramp closures;
    (3) Median crossovers;
    (4) Full or partial detours or diversions;
    (5) Protection of work zone setup and removal operations using 
rolling road blocks;
    (6) Performing work at night or during off-peak periods when traffic 
volumes are lower; and
    (7) Accelerated construction techniques.
    (c) Other Traffic Control Measures. Other Traffic Control Measures 
should be given appropriate consideration for use in work zones to 
reduce work zone crashes and risks and consequences of motorized traffic 
intrusion into the work space. These measures, which are not mutually 
exclusive and should be considered in combination as appropriate, 
include a wide range of other traffic control measures such as:
    (1) Effective, credible signing;
    (2) Changeable message signs;
    (3) Arrow panels;
    (4) Warning flags and lights on signs;
    (5) Longitudinal and lateral buffer space;
    (6) Trained flaggers and spotters;
    (7) Enhanced flagger station setups;
    (8) Intrusion alarms;
    (9) Rumble strips;
    (10) Pace or pilot vehicle;
    (11) High quality work zone pavement markings and removal of 
misleading markings;
    (12) Channelizing device spacing reduction;
    (13) Longitudinal channelizing barricades;
    (14) Work zone speed management (including changes to the regulatory 
speed and/or variable speed limits);
    (15) Law enforcement;
    (16) Automated speed enforcement (where permitted by State/local 
laws);
    (17) Drone radar;
    (18) Worker and work vehicle/equipment visibility;
    (19) Worker training;
    (20) Public information and traveler information; and
    (21) Temporary traffic signals.
    (d) Uniformed Law Enforcement Officers. (1) A number of conditions 
may indicate the need for or benefit of uniformed law enforcement in 
work zones. The presence of a uniformed law enforcement officer and 
marked law enforcement vehicle in view of motorized traffic on a highway 
project can affect driver behavior, helping to maintain appropriate 
speeds and improve driver alertness through the work zone. However, such 
law enforcement presence is not a substitute for the temporary traffic 
control devices required by Part 6 of the MUTCD. In general, the need 
for law enforcement is greatest on projects with high traffic speeds and 
volumes, and where the work zone is expected to result in substantial 
disruption to or changes in normal traffic flow patterns. Specific 
project conditions should be examined to determine

[[Page 173]]

the need for or potential benefit of law enforcement, such as the 
following:
    (i) Frequent worker presence adjacent to high-speed traffic without 
positive protection devices;
    (ii) Traffic control setup or removal that presents significant 
risks to workers and road users;
    (iii) Complex or very short term changes in traffic patterns with 
significant potential for road user confusion or worker risk from 
traffic exposure;
    (iv) Night work operations that create substantial traffic safety 
risks for workers and road users;
    (v) Existing traffic conditions and crash histories that indicate a 
potential for substantial safety and congestion impacts related to the 
work zone activity, and that may be mitigated by improved driver 
behavior and awareness of the work zone;
    (vi) Work zone operations that require brief stoppage of all traffic 
in one or both directions;
    (vii) High-speed roadways where unexpected or sudden traffic queuing 
is anticipated, especially if the queue forms a considerable distance in 
advance of the work zone or immediately adjacent to the work space; and
    (viii) Other work site conditions where traffic presents a high risk 
for workers and road users, such that the risk may be reduced by 
improving road user behavior and awareness.
    (2) Costs associated with the provision of uniformed law enforcement 
to help protect workers and road users, and to maintain safe and 
efficient travel through highway work zones, are eligible for Federal-
aid participation. Federal-aid eligibility excludes law enforcement 
activities that would normally be expected in and around highway problem 
areas requiring routine or ongoing law enforcement traffic control and 
enforcement activities. Payment for the services of uniformed law 
enforcement in work zones may be included in the construction contract, 
or be provided by direct reimbursement from the highway agency to the 
law enforcement agency. When payment is included through the 
construction contract, the contractor will be responsible for 
reimbursing the law enforcement agency, and in turn will recover those 
costs through contract pay items. Direct interagency reimbursement may 
be made on a project-specific basis, or on a program-wide basis that 
considers the overall level of services to be provided by the law 
enforcement agency. Contract pay items for law enforcement service may 
be either unit price or lump sum items. Unit price items should be 
utilized when the highway agency can estimate and control the quantity 
of law enforcement services required on the project. The use of lump sum 
payment should be limited to situations where the quantity of services 
is directly affected by the contractor's choice of project scheduling 
and chosen manner of staging and performing the work. Innovative payment 
items may also be considered when they offer an advantage to both the 
highway agency and the contractor. When reimbursement to the law 
enforcement agency is made by interagency transfer of funds, the highway 
agency should establish a program-level or project-level budget that is 
adequate to meet anticipated program or project needs, and include 
provisions to address unplanned needs and other contingencies.
    (e) Work Vehicles and Equipment. In addition to addressing risks to 
workers and road users from motorized traffic, the agency processes, 
procedures, and/or guidance established in accordance with 23 CFR 
630.1006 should also address safe means for work vehicles and equipment 
to enter and exit traffic lanes and for delivery of construction 
materials to the work space, based on individual project characteristics 
and factors.
    (f) Payment for Traffic Control. Consistent with the requirements of 
23 CFR 630.1012, Project-level Procedures, project plans, specifications 
and estimates (PS&Es) shall include appropriate pay item provisions for 
implementing the project Transportation Management Plan (TMP), which 
includes a Temporary Traffic Control (TTC) plan, either through method 
or performance based specifications. Pay item provisions include, but 
are not limited to, the following:
    (1) Payment for work zone traffic control features and operations 
shall not be incidental to the contract, or included in payment for 
other items of

[[Page 174]]

work not related to traffic control and safety;
    (2) As a minimum, separate pay items shall be provided for major 
categories of traffic control devices, safety features, and work zone 
safety activities, including but not limited to positive protection 
devices, and uniformed law enforcement activities when funded through 
the project;
    (3) For method based specifications, the specifications and other 
PS&E documents should provide sufficient details such that the quantity 
and types of devices and the overall effort required to implement and 
maintain the TMP can be determined;
    (4) For method-based specifications, unit price pay items, lump sum 
pay items, or a combination thereof may be used;
    (5) Lump sum payment should be limited to items for which an 
estimate of the actual quantity required is provided in the PS&E or for 
items where the actual quantity required is dependent upon the 
contractor's choice of work scheduling and methodology;
    (6) For Lump Sum items, a contingency provision should be included 
such that additional payment is provided if the quantity or nature of 
the required work changes, either an increase or decrease, due to 
circumstances beyond the control of the contractor;
    (7) Unit price payment should be provided for those items over which 
the contractor has little or no control over the quantity, and no firm 
estimate of quantities is provided in the PS&Es, but over which the 
highway agency has control of the actual quantity to be required during 
the project;
    (8) Specifications should clearly indicate how placement, movement/
relocation, and maintenance of traffic control devices and safety 
features will be compensated; and
    (9) The specifications should include provisions to require and 
enforce contractor compliance with the contract provisions relative to 
implementation and maintenance of the project TMP and related traffic 
control items. Enforcement provisions may include remedies such as 
liquidated damages, work suspensions, or withholding payment for 
noncompliance.


<R05>
Sec. 630.1110  Maintenance of temporary traffic control devices.

    To provide for the continued effectiveness of temporary traffic 
control devices, each agency shall develop and implement quality 
guidelines to help maintain the quality and adequacy of the temporary 
traffic control devices for the duration of the project. Agencies may 
choose to adopt existing quality guidelines such as those developed by 
the American Traffic Safety Services Association (ATSSA) or other state 
highway agencies. \1\ A level of inspection necessary to provide ongoing 
compliance with the quality guidelines shall be provided.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

written descriptions to help judge when a traffic control device has 
outlived its usefulness. These guidelines are available for purchase

the labor area as designated by the United States Department of Labor 
wherein the contract

[[Page 179]]

work is situated, or the subregion, or the Appalachian counties of the 
State wherein the contract work is situated, except:
    a. To the extent that qualified persons regularly residing in the 
area are not available.
    b. For the reasonable needs of the contractor to employ supervisory 
or specially experienced personnel necessary to assure an efficient 
execution of the contract work.
    c. For the obligation of the contractor to offer employment to 
present or former employees as the result of a lawful collective 
bargaining contract, provided that the number of nonresident persons 
employed under this subparagraph 1c shall not exceed 20 percent of the 
total number of employees employed by the contractor on the contract 
work, except as provided in subparagraph 4 below.
    2. The contractor shall place a job order with the State Employment

Service will forward a certificate to the contractor indicating the 
unavailability of applicants. Such certificate shall be made a part of 
the contractor's permanent project records. Upon receipt of this 
certificate, the contractor may employ persons who do not normally 
reside in the labor area to fill the positions covered by the 
certificate, notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph 1c above.
    5. The contractor shall include the provisions of section II-1 
through II-4 in every subcontract for work which is, or reasonably may 
be, done as on-site work.

III. Equal opportunity: employment practices.

    During the performance of this contract, the contractor agrees as 
follows:
    a. The contractor will not discriminate against any employee or 
applicant for employment because of race, color, religion, sex, or 
national origin. The contractor will take affirmative action to ensure 
that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during 
employment without regard to their race, color, religion, sex, or 
national origin. Such action shall include, but not be limited to the 
following: Employment, upgrading, demotion or transfer; recruitment or 
recruitment advertising; layoffs or termination; rates of pay or other 
forms of compensation; and selection of training, including 
apprenticeship. The contractor agrees to post in conspicuous places, 
available to employees and applicants for employment, notices to be 
provided by the State highway department setting forth the provisions of 
this nondiscrimination clause.
    b. The contractor will, in all solicitations or advertisements for 
employees placed by or on behalf of the contractor, state that all 
qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without 
regard to race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.

workers with which he has a collective bargaining agreement or other 
contract or understanding, a notice to be provided by the State highway 
department advising the said labor union or workers' representative of 
the contractor's commitments under this section III and shall post 
copies of the notice in conspicuous places available to employees and 
applicants for employment.
    d. The contractor will comply with all provisions of Executive Order 
11246 of September 24, 1965, and of the rules, regulations and relevant 
orders of the Secretary of Labor.
    e. The contractor will furnish all information and reports required 
by Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, and by rules, 
regulations and orders of the Secretary of Labor or pursuant thereto, 
and will permit access to his books, records and accounts by the Federal 
Highway Administration and the Secretary of Labor for purposes of 
investigation to ascertain compliance with such rules, regulations and 
orders.
    f. In the event of the contractor's noncompliance with the 
nondiscrimination clauses of this contract or with any of the said 
rules, regulations or orders, this contract may be canceled, terminated 
or suspended in whole or in part and the contractor may be declared 
ineligible for further Government contracts or federally-assisted 
construction contracts in accordance with procedures authorized in 
Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, and such other sanctions 
may be imposed and remedies invoked as provided in Executive Order 11246 
of

[[Page 180]]

September 24, 1965, or by rule, regulation or order of the Secretary of 
Labor, or as otherwise provided by law.
    g. The contractor will include the provisions of this section III in 
every subcontract or purchase order unless exempted by rules, 
regulations or orders of the Secretary of Labor issued pursuant to 
section 204 of Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, so that such 
provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor or vendor. The 
contractor will take such action with respect to any subcontract or 
purchase order as the State Highway Department or the Federal Highway 
Administration may direct as a means of enforcing such provisions 
including sanctions for noncompliance: Provided, however, That in the 
event a contractor becomes involved in, or is threatened with litigation 
with a subcontractor or vendor as a result of such direction by the 
Federal Highway Administration, the contractor may request the United 
States to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the 
United States.

IV. Equal opportunity selection of subcontractors, procurement of 
          materials, and leasing of equipment.

    During the performance of this contract, the contractor, for itself, 
its assignees and successors in interest (hereinafter referred to as the 
contractor), agrees as follows:
    1. Compliance with regulations. The contractor shall comply with the 
provisions of 23 U.S.C. 324 and with the regulations relative to 
nondiscrimination in Federally-assisted programs of the Department of 
Transportation (hereinafter, ``DOT'') title 49, Code of Federal 
Regulations, part 21, as they may be amended from time to time 
(hereinafter referred to as the Regulations), which are herein 
incorporated by reference and made a part of this contract.
    2. Nondiscrimination. The contractor, with regard to the work 
performed by it during the contract, shall not discriminate on the 
grounds of race, color, sex, or national origin in the selection and 
retention of subcontractors, including procurements of materials and 
leases of equipments. The contractor shall not participate either 
directly or indirectly in the discrimination prohibited by section 21.5 
of the Regulations, including employment practices.
    3. Solicitations for subcontracts including procurement of materials 
and equipment. In all solicitations either by competitive bidding or 
negotiation made by the contractor for work to be performed under a 
subcontract, including procurements of materials or leases of equipment, 
each potential subcontractor or supplier, shall be notified by the 
contractor of the contractor's obligations under this contract and the 
Regulations relative to nondiscrimination on the grounds of race, color, 
sex, or national origin.
    4. Information and reports. The contractor shall provide all 
information and reports required by the Regulations, or directives 
issued pursuant thereto, and shall permit access to its books, records, 
accounts, other sources of information, and its facilities as may be 
determined by the State highway department or the Federal Highway 
Administration to be pertinent to ascertain compliance with such 
Regulations, orders and instructions. Where any information required of 
a contractor is in the exclusive possession of another who fails or 
refuses to furnish this information, the contractor shall so certify to 
the State highway department, or the Federal Highway Administration, as 
appropriate, and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the 
information.
    5. Sanctions for noncompliance. In the event of the contractor's 
noncompliance with the nondiscrimination provisions of this contract, 
the State highway department shall impose such contract sanctions as it 
or the Federal Highway Administration may determine to be appropriate, 
including, but not limited to:
    a. Withholding of payments to the contractor under the contract 
until the contractor complies, and/or
    b. Cancellation, termination or suspension of the contract, in whole 
or in part.
    6. Incorporation of provisions. The contractor will include the 
provisions of paragraphs (1) through (6) in every subcontract, including 
procurements of materials and leases of equipment, unless exempt by the 
Regulations, or directives issued pursuant thereto. The contractor shall 
take such action with respect to any subcontract or procurement, as the 
State highway department or the Federal Highway Administration may 
direct as a means of enforcing such provisions including sanctions for 
noncompliance: Provided, however, That, in the event a contractor 
becomes involved in, or is threatened with, litigation with a 
subcontractor or supplier, as a result of such direction, the contractor 
may request the State to enter into such litigation to protect the 
interests of the State, and, in addition, the contractor may request the 
United States to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of 
the United States.

V. Nonsegregated facilities.

    (Applicable to Federal-aid construction contracts and related 
subcontracts exceeding $10,000 which are not exempt from the Equal 
Opportunity clause.)
    By submission of this bid, the execution of this contract or 
subcontract, or the consummation of this material supply agreement, as 
appropriate, the bidder, Federal-aid construction contractor, 
subcontractor, or material supplier, as appropriate, certifies that he 
does not maintain or provide for his employees any segregated facilities 
at any of

[[Page 181]]

his establishments, and that he does not permit his employees to perform 
their services at any location, under his control, where segregated 
facilities are maintained. He certifies further that he will not 
maintain or provide for his employees any segregated facilities at any 
of his establishments, and that he will not permit his employees to 
perform their services at any location, under his control, where 
segregated facilities are maintained. He agrees that a breach of this 
certification is a violation of the Equal Opportunity clause in this 
contract. As used in this certification, the term segregated facilities 
means any waiting rooms, work areas, restrooms and washrooms, 
restaurants and other eating areas, timeclocks, locker rooms and other 
storage or dressing areas, parking lots, drinking fountains, recreation 
or entertainment areas, transportation, and housing facilities provided 
for employees which are segregated by explicit directive or are in fact 
segregated on the basis of race, creed, color, or national origin, 
because of habit, local custom, or otherwise. He agrees that (except 
where he has obtained identical certifications from proposed 
subcontractors and material suppliers for specific time periods), he 
will obtain identical certifications from proposed subcontractors or 
material suppliers prior to the award of subcontracts or the 
consummation of material supply agreements, exceeding $10,000 which are 
not exempt from the provisions of the Equal Opportunity clause, and that 
he will retain such certification in his files.

VI. Payment of predetermined minimum wages.

    1. General. All mechanics and laborers employed or working upon the 
site of the work will be paid unconditionally and not less than once a 
week, and without subsequent deduction or rebate on any account, except 
such payroll deductions as are permitted by regulations issued by the 
Secretary of Labor under the Copeland Act (29 CFR part 3), the full 
amounts due at time of payment computed at wage rates not less than 
those contained in the wage determination decision of the Secretary of 
Labor which is attached hereto and made a part thereof, regardless of 
any contractual relationship which may be alleged to exist between the 
contractor and such laborers and mechanics; and the wage determination 
decision shall be posted by the contractor at the site of the work in a 
prominent place where it can be easily seen by the workers. For the 
purpose of this clause, contributions made or costs reasonably 
anticipated under section 1(b)(2) of the Davis-Bacon Act on behalf of 
laborers or mechanics are considered wages paid to such laborers or 
mechanics, subject to the provisions of section VI, paragraph 3b, 
hereof. Also for the purpose of this clause, regular contributions made 
or costs incurred for more than a weekly period under plans, funds, or 
programs, but covering the particular weekly period, are deemed to be 
constructively made or incurred during such weekly period.
    2. Classifications--a. The State highway department contracting 
officer shall require that any class of laborers or mechanics which is 
not listed in the wage determination and which is to be employed under 
the contract, shall be classified or reclassified conformably to the 
wage determination, and a report of the action taken shall be sent by 
the State highway department contracting officer to the Secretary of 
Labor.
    b. In the event the interested parties cannot agree on the proper 
classification or reclassification of a particular class of laborers and 
mechanics to be used, the question accompanied by the recommendation of 
the State highway department contracting officer shall be referred to 
the Secretary for final determination.
    3. Payment of fringe benefits--a. The State highway department 
contracting officer shall require, whenever the minimum wage rate 
prescribed in the contract for a class of laborers or mechanics includes 
a fringe benefit which is not expressed as an hourly wage rate and the 
contractor is obligated to pay a cash equivalent of such a fringe 
benefit, an hourly cash equivalent thereof to be established. In the 
event the interested parties cannot agree upon a cash equivalent of the 
fringe benefits, the question, accompanied by the recommendation of the 
contracting officer, shall be referred to the Secretary of Labor for 
determination.
    b. If the contractor does not make payments to a trustee or other 
third person, he may consider as part of the wage of any laborer or 
mechanic the amount of any costs reasonably anticipated in providing 
benefits under a plan or program of a type expressly listed in the wage 
determination decision of the Secretary of Labor which is part of this 
contract: Provided, however, The Secretary of Labor has found, upon the 
written request of the contractor, that the applicable standards of the 
Davis-Bacon Act have been met. The Secretary of Labor may require the 
contractor to set aside in a separate account assets for the meeting of 
obligations under the plan or program.
    4. Payment of excess wages. While the wage rates shown are the 
minimum rates required by the contract to be paid during its life, this 
is not a representation that labor can be obtained at these rates. No 
increase in the contract price shall be allowed or authorized on account 
of the payment of wage rates in excess of those listed herein.
    5. Apprentices and trainees (Programs of Department of Labor). a. 
Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than the predetermined 
rate for the work they performed when they are employed and individually

[[Page 182]]

registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with the 
U.S. Department of Labor, Manpower Administration, Bureau of 
Apprenticeship and Training, or with a State Apprenticeship Agency 
recognized by the Bureau, or if a person is employed in his first 90 
days of probationary employment as an apprentice in such an 
apprenticeship program, who is not individually registered in the 
program, but who has been certified by the Bureau of Apprenticeship and 
Training or a State Apprenticeship Agency (where appropriate) to be 
eligible for probationary employment as an apprentice. The allowable 
ratio of apprentices to journeymen in any craft classification shall not 
be greater than the ratio permitted to the contractor as to his entire 
work force under the registered program. Any employee listed on a 
payroll at an apprentice wage rate, who is not a trainee as defined in 
29 CFR 5.2(c)(2) or is not registered or otherwise employed as stated 
above, shall be paid the wage rate determined by the Secretary of Labor 
for the classification of work he actually performed. The contractor or 
subcontractor will be required to furnish to the State highway 
department or to a representative of the Wage-Hour Division of the U.S. 
Department of Labor written evidence of the registration of his program 
and apprentices as well as the appropriate ratios and wage rates 
(expressed in percentages of the journeyman hourly rates), for the area 
of construction prior to using any apprentices on the contract work. The 
wage rate paid apprentices shall be not less than the appropriate 
percentage of the journeyman's rate contained in the applicable wage 
determination.
    b. Trainees, except as provided in 29 CFR 5.15, will not be 
permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work 
performed unless they are employed pursuant to and individually 
registered in a program which has received prior approval, evidenced by 
formal certification, by the U.S. Department of Labor, Manpower 
Administration, Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training. The ratio of 
trainees to journeymen shall not be greater than permitted under the 
plan approved by the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training. Every 
trainee must be paid at not less than the rate specified in the approved 
program for his level of progress. Any employee listed on the payroll at 
a trainee rate who is not registered and participating in a training 
plan approved by the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training shall be paid 
not less than the wage rate determined by the Secretary of Labor for the 
classification of work he actually performed. The contractor or 
subcontractor will be required to furnish the State highway department 
or a representative of the Wage-Hour Division of the U.S. Department of 
Labor written evidence of the certification of his program, the 
registration of the trainees, and the ratios and wage rates prescribed 
in that program. In the event the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training 
withdraws approval of a training program, the contractor will no longer 
be permitted to utilize trainees at less than the applicable 
predetermined rate for the work performed until an acceptable program is 
approved.
    c. The utilization of apprentices, trainees and journeymen shall be 
in conformity with the equal employment opportunity requirements of 
Executive Order 11246, as amended, and 29 CFR part 30.
    6. Apprentices and trainees (Programs of Department of 
Transportation). Apprentices and trainees working under apprenticeship 
and skill training programs which have been certified by the Secretary 
of Transportation as promoting equal opportunity in connection with 
Federal-aid highway construction programs are not subject to the 
requirements of section VI, paragraph 5 above. The straight time hourly 
wage rates for apprentices and trainees under such programs will be 
established by the particular programs.
    7. Withholding for unpaid wages. The State highway department 
contracting officer may withhold or cause to be withheld from the 
contractor so much of the accrued payments or advances as may be 
considered necessary to pay laborers, mechanics, (including apprentices 
and trainees) watchmen, or guards employed by the contractor or any 
subcontractor on the work the full amount of wages required by the 
contract. In the event of failure to pay any laborer, mechanic, 
(including apprentices and trainees) watchman or guard employed or 
working on the site of the work, all or part of the wages required by 
the contract, the State highway department contracting officer may, 
after written notice to the contractor, take such action as may be 
necessary to cause the suspension of any further payment, advance, or 
guarantee of funds until such violations have ceased.
    8. Overtime requirements. a. No contractor or subcontractor 
contracting for any part of the contract work which may require or 
involve the employment of laborers, mechanics, watchmen or guards 
(including apprentices and trainees described in paragraphs 5 and 6 
above) shall require or permit any laborer, mechanic, watchman or guard 
in any workweek in which he is employed on such work, to work in excess 
of eight hours in any calendar day or in excess of forty hours in such 
workweek unless such laborer, mechanic, watchman or guard receives 
compensation at a rate not less than one and one-half times his basic 
rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of eight hours in any 
calendar day or in excess of forty hours in such workweek, as the case 
may be.
    b. In the event of any violation of paragraph 8a, the contractor and 
any subcontractor responsible therefor shall be liable to any affected 
employee for his unpaid wages.

[[Page 183]]

In addition, such contractor and subcontractor shall be liable to the 
United States for liquidated damages. Such liquidated damages shall be 
computed with respect to each individual laborer, mechanic, watchman or 
guard employed in violation of paragraph 8a, in the sum of $10 for each 
calendar day on which such employee was required or permitted to work in 
excess of eight hours or in excess of the standard workweek of forty 
hours without payment of the overtime wages required by paragraph 8a.
    c. The State highway department contracting officer may withhold or 
cause to be withheld, from any moneys payable on account of work 
performed by the contractor or subcontractor, such sums as may 
administratively be determined to be necessary to satisfy any 
liabilities of such contractor or subcontractor for liquidated damages 
as provided in paragraph 8b.

VII. Statements and payrolls.

    1. Compliance with Copeland Regulations (29 CFR part 3). The 
contractor shall comply with the Copeland Regulations (29 CFR part 3) of 
the Secretary of Labor which are herein incorporated by reference.
    2. Weekly statement. Each contractor or subcontractor shall furnish 
each week a statement to the State highway department resident engineer 
with respect to the wages paid each of its employees, including 
apprentices and trainees described in section VI, paragraphs 5 and 6, 
and watchmen and guards on work covered by the Copeland Regulations 
during the preceding weekly payroll period. The statement shall be 
executed by the contractor or subcontractor or by an authorized officer 
or employee of the contractor or subcontractor who supervises the 
payment of wages. Contractors and subcontractors must use the 
certification set forth on U.S. Department of Labor Form WH-348, or the 
same certification appearing on the reverse of Optional U.S. Department 
of Labor Form WH-347, or on any form with identical wording.
    3. Final labor summary. The contractor and each subcontractor shall 
furnish, upon the completion of the contract, a summary of all 
employment, indicating for the completed project the total hours worked 
and the total amount earned. This data shall be submitted to the State 
highway department resident engineer on Form PR-47 together with the 
data required in section VIII, hereof, relative to materials and 
supplies.
    4. Final certificate. Upon completion of the contract, the 
contractor shall submit to the State highway department contracting 
officer, for transmission to the Federal Highway Administration with the 
voucher for final payment for any work performed under the contract, a 
certificate concerning wages and classifications for laborers, 
mechanics, watchmen and guards employed on the project, in the following 
form:

                                * * * * *

    The undersigned, contractor on

                              (Project No.)

hereby certifies that all laborers, mechanics, apprentices, trainees, 
watchmen and guards employed by him or by any subcontractor performing 
work under the contract on the project have been paid wages at rates not 
less than those required by the contract provisions, and that the work 
performed by each such laborer, mechanic, apprentice or trainee 
conformed to the classifications set forth in the contract or training 
program provisions applicable to the wage rate paid.

Signature and title_____________________________________________________

                                * * * * *

    5. Payrolls and payroll records--a. Payrolls and basic records 
relating thereto will be maintained during the course of the work and 
preserved for a period of three years thereafter for all laborers, 
mechanics, apprentices, trainees, watchmen and guards working at the 
site of the work.
    b. The payroll records shall contain the name, social security 
number and address of each such employee, his correct classification, 
rates of pay (including rates of contributions or costs anticipated of 
the types described in section 1(b)(2) of the Davis-Bacon Act), daily 
and weekly number of hours worked, deductions made and actual wages 
paid. Whenever the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to section VI, paragraph 
3.b., has found that the wages of any laborer or mechanic include the 
amount of any costs reasonably anticipated in providing benefits under a 
plan or program described in section I(b)(2)(B) of the Davis-Bacon Act, 
the contractor shall maintain records which show that the commitment to 
provide such benefits is enforceable, that the plan or program is 
financially responsible, and that the plan or program has been 
communicated in writing to the laborers or mechanics affected, and 
records which show the costs anticipated or the actual cost incurred in 
providing such benefits.
    c. The payrolls shall contain the following information:
    1. The employee's full name, address and social security number and 
a notation indicating whether the employee does, or does not, normally 
reside in the labor area as defined in section II, paragraph 1.a. (The 
employee's full name and social security number need only appear on the 
first payroll on which his name appears. The employee's address need 
only be shown on the first submitted payroll on which the employee's

[[Page 184]]

name appears, unless a change of address necessitates a submittal to 
reflect the new address.)
    2. The employee's classification.
    3. Entries indicating the employee's basic hourly wage rate and, 
where applicable, the overtime hourly wage rate. The payroll should 
indicate separately the amounts of employee and employer contributions 
to fringe benefits funds and/or programs. Any fringe benefits paid to 
the employee in cash must be indicated. There is no prescribed or 
mandatory form for showing the above information on payrolls.
    4. The employee's daily and weekly hours worked in each 
classification, including actual overtime hours worked (not adjusted).
    5. The itemized deductions made and
    6. The net wages paid.
    d. The contractor will submit weekly a copy of all payrolls to the 
State highway department resident engineer. The copy shall be 
accompanied by a statement signed by the employer or his agent 
indicating that the payrolls are correct and complete, that the wage 
rates contained therein are not less than those determined by the 
Secretary of Labor and the classifications set forth for each laborer or 
mechanic conform with the work he performed. Submission of a weekly 
statement which is required under this contract by section VII, 
paragraph 2, and the Copeland Regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 
CFR part 3) and the filing with the initial payroll or any subsequent 
payroll of a copy of any findings by the Secretary of Labor pursuant to 
section VI, paragraph 3b, shall satisfy this requirement. The prime 
contractor shall be responsible for the submission of copies of payrolls 
of all subcontractors. The contractor will make the records required 
under the labor standards clauses of the contract available for 
inspection by authorized representatives of the State highway 
department, the Federal Highway Administration and the Department of 
Labor, and will permit such representatives to interview employees 
during working hours on the job.
    e. The wages of labor shall be paid in legal tender of the United 
States, except that this condition will be considered satisfied if 
payment is made by negotiable check, on a solvent bank, which may be 
cashed readily by the employee in the local community for the full 
amount, without discount or collection charges of any kind. Where checks 
are used for payment, the contractor shall make all necessary 
arrangements for them to be cashed and shall given information regarding 
such arrangements.
    f. No fee of any kind shall be asked or accepted by the contractor 
or any of his agents from any person as a condition of employment on the 
project.
    g. No laborers shall be charged for any tools used in performing 
their respective duties except for reasonably avoidable loss or damage 
thereto.
    h. Every employee on the work covered by this contract shall be 
permitted to lodge, board and trade where and with whom he elects and 
neither the contractor nor his agents, nor his employees shall, directly 
or indirectly, require as a condition of employment that an employee 
shall lodge, board or trade at a particular place or with a particular 
person.
    i. No charge shall be made for any transportation furnished by the 
contractor, or his agents, to any person employed on the work.
    j. No individual shall be employed as a laborer or mechanic on this 
contract except on a wage basis, but this shall not be construed to 
prohibit the rental of teams, trucks, or other equipment from 
individuals.

VIII. Record of materials, supplies and labor.

    1. The contractor shall maintain a record of the total cost of all 
materials and supplies purchased for and incorporated in the work, and 
also of the quantities of those specific materials and supplies listed 
on Form PR-47 and in the units shown. Upon completion of the contract, 
this record, together with the final labor summary required in section 
VII, paragraph 3, hereof, shall be transmitted to the State highway 
department resident engineer for the project on Form PR-47 in accordance 
with instructions attached thereto, which will be furnished for this 
purpose upon request. The quantities for the listed items shall be 
reported separately for roadway and for structures over 20 feet long as 
measured along the centerline of the roadway.
    2. The contractor shall become familiar with the list of specific 
materials and supplies contained in Form PR-47 prior to the commencement 
of work under this contract. Any additional materials information 
required will be solicited through revisions of Form PR-47 with 
attendant explanations.
    3. Where subcontracts are involved the contractor shall submit 
either a single report covering work both by himself and all his 
subcontractors, or he may submit separate reports for himself and for 
each of his subcontractors.

IX. Subletting or assigning the contract.

    1. The contractor shall perform with his own organization contract 
work amounting to not less than 50 percent of the original total 
contract price, except that any items designated by the State as 
Specialty Items may be performed by subcontract and the amount of any 
such Specialty Items so performed may be deducted from the original 
total contract price before computing the amount of work required to be 
performed by the contractor with his own organization.
    a. His own organization shall be construed to include only workmen 
employed and paid

[[Page 185]]

directly by the prime contractor and equipment owned or rented by him, 
with or without operators.
    b. Specialty items shall be construed to be limited to work that 
requires highly specialized knowledge, craftsmanship or equipment not 
ordinarily available in contracting organizations qualified to bid on 
the contract as a whole and in general are to be limited to minor 
components of the overall contract.
    2. In addition to the 50 percent requirements set forth in paragraph 
1 above, the contractor shall furnish (a) a competent superintendent or 
foreman who is employed by him, who has full authority to direct 
performance of the work in accordance with the contract requirements, 
and who is in charge of all construction operations (regardless of who 
performs the work), and (b) such other of his own organizational 
capability and responsibility (supervision, management, and engineering 
services) as the State highway department contracting officer determines 
is necessary to assure the performance of the contract.
    3. The contract amount upon which the 50 percent requirement set 
forth in paragraph 1 is computed includes the cost of materials and 
manufactured products which are to be purchased or produced by the 
contractor under the contract provisions.
    4. Any items that have been selected as Specialty Items for the 
contract are listed as such in the Special Provisions, bid schedule, or 
elsewhere in the contract documents.
    5. No portion of the contract shall be sublet, assigned or otherwise 
disposed of except with the written consent of the State highway 
department contracting officer, or his authorized representative, and 
such consent when given shall not be construed to relieve the contractor 
of any responsibility for the fulfillment of the contract. Request for 
permission to sublet, assign or otherwise dispose of any portion of the 
contract shall be in writing and accompanied by (a) a showing that the 
organization which will perform the work is particularly experienced and 
equipped for such work, and (b) an assurance by the contractor that the 
labor standards provisions set forth in thiscontract shall apply to 
labor performed on all work encompassed by the request.

X. Safety: Accident prevention.

    In the performance of this contract, the contractor shall comply 
with all applicable Federal, State and local laws governing safety, 
health and sanitation. The contractor shall provide all safeguards, 
safety devices and protective equipment and take any other needed 
actions, on his own responsibility, or as the State highway department 
contracting officer may determine, reasonably necessary to protect the 
life and health of employees on the job and the safety of the public and 
to protect property in connection with the performance of the work 
covered by the contract.
    It is a condition of this contract, and shall be made a condition of 
each subcontract entered into pursuant to this contract, that the 
contractor and any subcontractor shall not require any laborer or 
mechanic employed in performance of the contract to work in surroundings 
or under working conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous, or 
dangerous to his health or safety, as determined under construction 
safety and health standards (title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, part 
1926, formerly part 1518, as revised from time to time), promulgated by 
the United States Secretary of Labor, in accordance with section 107 of 
the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (83 Stat. 96).

XI. False statements concerning highway projects.

    In order to assure high quality and durable construction in 
conformity with approved plans and specifications and a high degree of 
reliability on statements and representations made by engineers, 
contractors, suppliers, and workers on Federal-aid highway projects, it 
is essential that all persons concerned with the project perform their 
functions as carefully, thoroughly and honestly as possible. Willfull 
falsification, distortion, or misrepresentation with respect to any 
facts related to the project is a violation of Federal law. To prevent 
any misunderstanding regarding the seriousness of these and similar 
acts, the following notice shall be posted on each Federal-aid highway 
project in one or more places where it is readily available to all 
personnel concerned with the project:

                                * * * * *

<R04>
                      Subpart A_Contract Procedures

    Source: 56 FR 37004, Aug. 2, 1991, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 635.101  Purpose.

    To prescribe policies, requirements, and procedures relating to 
Federal-aid highway projects, from the time of authorization to proceed 
to the construction stage, to the time of final acceptance by the 
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).


<R05>
Sec. 635.102  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart:
    Administrator means the Federal Highway Administrator.
    Calendar day means each day shown on the calendar but, if another 
definition is set forth in the State contract specifications, that 
definition will apply.
    Contract time means the number of workdays or calendar days 
specified in a contract for completion of the contract work. The term 
includes authorized time extensions.
    Design-build project means a project to be developed using one or 
more design-build contracts.
    Division Administrator means the chief FHWA official assigned to 
conduct business in a particular State. A State is as defined in 23 
U.S.C. 101.
    Force account means a basis of payment for the direct performance of 
highway construction work with payment based on the actual cost of 
labor, equipment, and materials furnished and consideration for overhead 
and profit.
    Formal approval means approval in writing or the electronic 
transmission of such approval.
    Incentive/disincentive for early completion as used in this subpart, 
describes a contract provision which compensates the contractor a 
certain amount of money for each day identified critical work is 
completed ahead of schedule and assesses a deduction for each day the 
contractor overruns the incentive/disincentive time. Its use is 
primarily intended for those critical projects where traffic 
inconvenience and delays are to be held to a minimum. The amounts are 
based upon estimates of such items as traffic safety, traffic 
maintenance, and road user delay costs.
    Liquidated damages means the daily amount set forth in the contract 
to be deducted from the contract price to cover additional costs 
incurred by a State transportation department because of the 
contractor's failure to complete the contract work within the number of 
calendar days or workdays specified. The term may also mean the total of 
all daily amounts deducted under the terms of a particular contract.
    Local public agency means any city, county, township, municipality, 
or other political subdivision that may be empowered to cooperate with 
the State transportation department in highway matters.
    Major change or major extra work means a change which will 
significantly affect the cost of the project to the Federal Government 
or alter the termini, character or scope of the work.
    Materially unbalanced bid means a bid which generates a reasonable 
doubt that award to the bidder submitting a mathematically unbalanced 
bid will result in the lowest ultimate cost to the Federal Government.
    Mathematically unbalanced bid means a bid containing lump sum or 
unit bid items which do not reflect reasonable actual costs plus a 
reasonable proportionate share of the bidder's anticipated profit, 
overhead costs, and other indirect costs.
    Public agency means any organization with administrative or 
functional responsibilities which are directly or indirectly affiliated 
with a governmental body of any nation, State, or local jurisdiction.
    Publicly owned equipment means equipment previously purchased or 
otherwise acquired by the public agency involved primarily for use in 
its own operations.
    Specialty items means work items identified in the contract which 
are not normally associated with highway construction and require highly 
specialized knowledge, abilities or equipment not ordinarily available 
in the type of contracting organizations qualified and expected to bid 
on the contract; in general, these items are to be limited to

[[Page 190]]

minor components of the overall contract.
    State transportation department (STD) means that department, 
commission, board, or official of any State charged by its laws with the 
responsibility for highway construction. The term ``State'' should be 
considered equivalent to ``State transportation department'' if the 
context so implies.
    Workday means a calendar day during which construction operations 
could proceed for a major part of a shift, normally excluding Saturdays, 
Sundays, and State-recognized legal holidays.

[62 FR 6873, Feb. 14, 1997, as amended at 67 FR 75924, Dec. 10, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 635.103  Applicability.

    The policies, requirements, and procedures prescribed in this 
subpart shall apply to all Federal-aid highway projects.

[69 FR 7118, Feb. 13, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 635.104  Method of construction.

    (a) Actual construction work shall be performed by contract awarded 
by competitive bidding; unless, as provided in Sec. 635.104(b), the STD 
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Division Administrator that some 
other method is more cost effective or that an emergency exists. The STD 
shall assure opportunity for free, open, and competitive bidding, 
including adequate publicity of the advertisements or calls for bids. 
The advertising or calling for bids and the award of contracts shall 
comply with the procedures and requirements set forth in Sec. Sec. 
635.112 and 635.114.
    (b) Approval by the Division Administrator for construction by a 
method other than competitive bidding shall be requested by the State in 
accordance with subpart B of part 635 of this chapter. Before such 
finding is made, the STD shall determine that the organization to 
undertake the work is so staffed and equipped as to perform such work 
satisfactorily and cost effectively.
    (c) In the case of a design-build project, the requirements of 23 
CFR part 636 and the appropriate provisions pertaining to design-build 
contracting in this part will apply. However, no justification of cost 
effectiveness is necessary in selecting projects for the design-build 
delivery method.

[56 FR 37004, Aug. 2, 1991, as amended at 67 FR 75925, Dec. 10, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 635.105  Supervising agency.

    (a) The STD has responsibility for the construction of all Federal-
aid projects, and is not relieved of such responsibility by authorizing 
performance of the work by a local public agency or other Federal 
agency. The STD shall be responsible for insuring that such projects 
receive adequate supervision and inspection to insure that projects are 
completed in conformance with approved plans and specifications.
    (b) Although the STD may employ a consultant to provide construction 
engineering services, such as inspection or survey work on a project, 
the STD shall provide a full-time employed State engineer to be in 
responsible charge of the project.
    (c) When a project is located on a street or highway over which the 
STD does not have legal jurisdiction, or when special conditions 
warrant, the STD, while not relieved of overall project responsibility, 
may arrange for the local public agency having jurisdiction over such 
street or highway to perform the work with its own forces or by 
contract; provided the following conditions are met and the Division 
Administrator approves the arrangements in advance.
    (1) In the case of force account work, there is full compliance with 
subpart B of this part.
    (2) When the work is to be performed under a contract awarded by a 
local public agency, all Federal requirements including those prescribed 
in this subpart shall be met.
    (3) The local public agency is adequately staffed and suitably 
equipped to undertake and satisfactorily complete the work; and
    (4) In those instances where a local public agency elects to use 
consultants for construction engineering services, the local public 
agency shall provide a full-time employee of the agency to be in 
responsible charge of the project.

[[Page 191]]


<R05>
Sec. 635.106  Use of publicly owned equipment.

    (a) Publicly owned equipment should not normally compete with 
privately owned equipment on a project to be let to contract. There may 
be exceptional cases, however, in which the use of equipment of the 
State or local public agency for highway construction purposes may be 
warranted or justified. A proposal by any STD for the use of publicly 
owned equipment on such a project must be supported by a showing that it 
would clearly be cost effective to do so under the conditions peculiar 
to the individual project or locality.
    (b) Where publicly owned equipment is to be made available in 
connection with construction work to be let to contract, Federal funds 
may participate in the cost of such work provided the following 
conditions are met:
    (1) The proposed use of such equipment is clearly set forth in the 
Plans, Specifications and Estimate (PS&E) submitted to the Division 
Administrator for approval.
    (2) The advertised specifications specify the items of publicly 
owned equipment available for use by the successful bidder, the rates to 
be charged, and the points of availability or delivery of the equipment; 
and
    (3) The advertised specifications include a notification that the 
successful bidder has the option either of renting part or all of such 
equipment from the State or local public agency or otherwise providing 
the equipment necessary for the performance of the contract work.
    (c) In the rental of publicly owned equipment to contractors, the 
State or local public agency shall not profit at the expense of Federal 
funds.
    (d) Unforeseeable conditions may make it necessary to provide 
publicly owned equipment to the contractor at rental rates agreed to 
between the contractor and the State or local public agency after the 
work has started. Any such arrangement shall not form the basis for any 
increase in the cost of the project on which Federal funds are to 
participate.
    (e) When publicly owned equipment is used on projects constructed on 
a force account basis, costs may be determined by agreed unit prices or 
on an actual cost basis. When agreed unit prices are applied the 
equipment need not be itemized nor rental rates shown in the estimate. 
However, if such work is to be performed on an actual cost basis, the 
STD shall submit to the Division Administrator for approval the scheduie 
of rates proposed to be charged, exclusive of profit, for the publicly 
owned equipment made available for use.


<R05>
Sec. 635.107  Participation by disadvantaged business enterprises.

    (a) The STD shall schedule contract lettings in a balanced program 
providing contracts of such size and character as to assure an 
opportunity for all sizes of contracting organizations to compete. In 
accordance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, subsequent 
Federal-aid Highway Acts, and 49 CFR part 26, the STD shall ensure equal 
opportunity for disadvantaged business enterprises (DBEs) participating 
in the Federal-aid highway program.
    (b) In the case of a design-build project funded with title 23 
funds, the requirements of 49 CFR part 26 and the State's approved DBE 
plan apply. If DBE goals are set, DBE commitments above the goal must 
not be used as a proposal evaluation factor in determining the 
successful offeror.

[67 FR 75925, Dec. 10, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 635.108  Health and safety.

    Contracts for projects shall include provisions designed:
    (a) To insure full compliance with all applicable Federal, State, 
and local laws governing safety, health and sanitation; and
    (b) To require that the contractor shall provide all safeguards, 
safety devices, and protective equipment and shall take any other 
actions reasonably necessary to protect the life and health of persons 
working at the site of the project and the safety of the public and to 
protect property in connection with the performance of the work covered 
by the contract.


<R05>
Sec. 635.109  Standardized changed condition clauses.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the 
following

[[Page 192]]

changed conditions contract clauses shall be made part of, and 
incorporated in, each highway construction project approved under 23 
U.S.C. 106:
    (1) Differing site conditions. (i) During the progress of the work, 
if subsurface or latent physical conditions are encountered at the site 
differing materially from those indicated in the contract or if unknown 
physical conditions of an unusual nature, differing materially from 
those ordinarily encountered and generally recognized as inherent in the 
work provided for in the contract, are encountered at the site, the 
party discovering such conditions shall promptly notify the other party 
in writing of the specific differing conditions before the site is 
disturbed and before the affected work is performed.
    (ii) Upon written notification, the engineer will investigate the 
conditions, and if it is determined that the conditions materially 
differ and cause an increase or decrease in the cost or time required 
for the performance of any work under the contract, an adjustment, 
excluding anticipated profits, will be made and the contract modified in 
writing accordingly. The engineer will notify the contractor of the 
determination whether or not an adjustment of the contract is warranted.
    (iii) No contract adjustment which results in a benefit to the 
contractor will be allowed unless the contractor has provided the 
required written notice.
    (iv) No contract adjustment will be allowed under this clause for 
any effects caused on unchanged work. (This provision may be omitted by 
the STD's at their option.)
    (2) Suspensions of work ordered by the engineer. (i) If the 
performance of all or any portion of the work is suspended or delayed by 
the engineer in writing for an unreasonable period of time (not 
originally anticipated, customary, or inherent to the construction 
industry) and the contractor believes that additional compensation and/
or contract time is due as a result of such suspension or delay, the 
contractor shall submit to the engineer in writing a request for 
adjustment within 7 calendar days of receipt of the notice to resume 
work. The request shall set forth the reasons and support for such 
adjustment.
    (ii) Upon receipt, the engineer will evaluate the contractor's 
request. If the engineer agrees that the cost and/or time required for 
the performance of the contract has increased as a result of such 
suspension and the suspension was caused by conditions beyond the 
control of and not the fault of the contractor, its suppliers, or 
subcontractors at any approved tier, and not caused by weather, the 
engineer will make an adjustment (excluding profit) and modify the 
contract in writing accordingly. The contractor will be notified of the 
engineer's determination whether or not an adjustment of the contract is 
warranted.
    (iii) No contract adjustment will be allowed unless the contractor 
has submitted the request for adjustment within the time prescribed.
    (iv) No contract adjustment will be allowed under this clause to the 
extent that performance would have been suspended or delayed by any 
other cause, or for which an adjustment is provided or excluded under 
any other term or condition of this contract.
    (3) Significant changes in the character of work. (i) The engineer 
reserves the right to make, in writing, at any time during the work, 
such changes in quantities and such alterations in the work as are 
necessary to satisfactorily complete the project. Such changes in 
quantities and alterations shall not invalidate the contract nor release 
the surety, and the contractor agrees to perform the work as altered.
    (ii) If the alterations or changes in quantities significantly 
change the character of the work under the contract, whether such 
alterations or changes are in themselves significant changes to the 
character of the work or by affecting other work cause such other work 
to become significantly different in character, an adjustment, excluding 
anticipated profit, will be made to the contract. The basis for the 
adjustment shall be agreed upon prior to the performance of the work. If 
a basis cannot be agreed upon, then an adjustment will be made either 
for or against the contractor in such amount as the engineer may 
determine to be fair and equitable.

[[Page 193]]

    (iii) If the alterations or changes in quantities do not 
significantly change the character of the work to be performed under the 
contract, the altered work will be paid for as provided elsewhere in the 
contract.
    (iv) The term ``significant change'' shall be construed to apply 
only to the following circumstances:
    (A) When the character of the work as altered differs materially in 
kind or nature from that involved or included in the original proposed 
construction; or
    (B) When a major item of work, as defined elsewhere in the contract, 
is increased in excess of 125 percent or decreased below 75 percent of 
the original contract quantity. Any allowance for an increase in 
quantity shall apply only to that portion in excess of 125 percent of 
original contract item quantity, or in case of a decrease below 75 
percent, to the actual amount of work performed.
    (b) The provisions of this section shall be governed by the 
following:
    (1) Where State statute does not permit one or more of the contract 
clauses included in paragraph (a) of this section, the State statute 
shall prevail and such clause or clauses need not be made applicable to 
Federal-aid highway contracts.
    (2) Where the State transportation department has developed and 
implemented one or more of the contract clauses included in paragraph 
(a) of this section, such clause or clauses, as developed by the State 
transportation department may be included in Federal-aid highway 
contracts in lieu of the corresponding clause or clauses in paragraph 
(a) of this section. The State's action must be pursuant to a specific 
State statute requiring differing contract conditions clauses. Such 
State developed clause or clauses, however, must be in conformance with 
23 U.S.C., 23 CFR and other applicable Federal statutes and regulations 
as appropriate and shall be subject to the Division Administrator's 
approval as part of the PS&E.
    (c) In the case of a design-build project, STDs are strongly 
encouraged to use ``suspensions of work ordered by the engineer'' 
clauses, and may consider ``differing site condition'' clauses and 
``significant changes in the character of work'' clauses which are 
appropriate for the risk and responsibilities that are shared with the 
design-builder.

[56 FR 37004, Aug. 2, 1991; 57 FR 10062, Mar. 23, 1992, as amended at 67 
FR 75925, Dec. 10, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 635.110  Licensing and qualification of contractors.

    (a) The procedures and requirements a STD proposes to use for 
qualifying and licensing contractors, who may bid for, be awarded, or 
perform Federal-aid highway contracts, shall be submitted to the 
Division Administrator for advance approval. Only those procedures and 
requirements so approved shall be effective with respect to Federal-aid 
highway projects. Any changes in approved procedures and requirements 
shall likewise be subject to approval by the Division Administrator.
    (b) No procedure or requirement for bonding, insurance, 
prequalification, qualification, or licensing of contractors shall be 
approved which, in the judgment of the Division Administrator, may 
operate to restrict competition, to prevent submission of a bid by, or 
to prohibit the consideration of a bid submitted by, any responsible 
contractor, whether resident or nonresident of the State wherein the 
work is to be performed.
    (c) No contractor shall be required by law, regulation, or practice 
to obtain a license before submission of a bid or before the bid may be 
considered for award of a contract. This, however, is not intended to 
preclude requirements for the licensing of a contractor upon or 
subsequent to the award of the contract if such requirements are 
consistent with competitive bidding. Prequalification of contractors may 
be required as a condition for submission of a bid or award of contract 
only if the period between the date of issuing a call for bids and the 
date of opening of bids affords sufficient time to enable a bidder to 
obtain the required prequalification rating.
    (d) Requirements for the prequalification, qualification or 
licensing of contractors, that operate to govern the amount of work that 
may be bid upon by, or may be awarded to, a contractor, shall be 
approved only if

[[Page 194]]

based upon a full and appropriate evaluation of the contractor's 
capability to perform the work.
    (e) Contractors who are currently suspended, debarred or voluntarily 
excluded under 49 CFR part 29 or otherwise determined to be ineligible, 
shall be prohibited from participating in the Federal-aid highway 
program.
    (f) In the case of a design-build project, the STDs may use their 
own bonding, insurance, licensing, qualification or prequalification 
procedure for any phase of design-build procurement.
    (1) The STDs may not impose statutory or administrative requirements 
which provide an in-State or local geographical preference in the 
solicitation, licensing, qualification, pre-qualification, short listing 
or selection process. The geographic location of a firm's office may not 
be one of the selection criteria. However, the STDs may require the 
successful design-builder to establish a local office after the award of 
contract.
    (2) If required by State statute, local statute, or administrative 
policy, the STDs may require prequalification for construction 
contractors. The STDs may require offerors to demonstrate the ability of 
their engineering staff to become licensed in that State as a condition 
of responsiveness; however, licensing procedures may not serve as a 
barrier for the consideration of otherwise responsive proposals. The 
STDs may require compliance with appropriate State or local licensing 
practices as a condition of contract award.

[56 FR 37004, Aug. 2, 1991, as amended at 67 FR 75925, Dec. 10, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 635.111  Tied bids.

    (a) The STD may tie or permit the tying of Federal-aid highway 
projects or Federal-aid and State-financed highway projects for bidding 
purposes where it appears that by so doing more favorable bids may be 
received. To avoid discrimination against contractors desiring to bid 
upon a lesser amount of work than that included in the tied 
combinations, provisions should be made to permit bidding separately on 
the individual projects whenever they are of such character as to be 
suitable for bidding independently.
    (b) When Federal-aid and State-financed highway projects are tied or 
permitted to be tied together for bidding purposes, the bid schedule 
shall set forth the quantities separately for the Federal-aid work and 
the State-financed work. All proposals submitted for the tied projects 
must contain separate bid prices for each project individually. Federal 
participation in the cost of the work shall be on the basis of the 
lowest overall responsive bid proposal unless the analysis of bids 
reveals that mathematical unbalancing has caused an unsupported shift of 
cost liability to the Federal-aid work. If such a finding is made, 
Federal participation shall be based on the unit prices represented in 
the proposal by the individual contractor who would be the lowest 
responsive and responsible bidder if only the Federal-aid project were 
considered.
    (c) Federal-aid highway projects and State-financed highway projects 
may be combined in one contract if the conditions of the projects are so 
similar that the unit costs on the Federal-aid projects should not be 
increased by such combinations of projects. In such cases, like 
quantities should be combined in the proposal to avoid the possibility 
of unbalancing of bids in favor of either of the projects in the 
combination.


<R05>
Sec. 635.112  Advertising for bids and proposals.

    (a) No work shall be undertaken on any Federal-aid project, nor 
shall any project be advertised for bids, prior to authorization by the 
Division Administrator.
    (b) The advertisement and approved plans and specifications shall be 
available to bidders a minimum of 3 weeks prior to opening of bids 
except that shorter periods may be approved by the Division 
Administrator in special cases when justified.
    (c) The STD shall obtain the approval of the Division Administrator 
prior to issuing any addenda which contain a major change to the 
approved plans or specifications during the advertising period. Minor 
addenda need not receive prior approval but should be identified by the 
STD at the time of or prior to requesting FHWA concurrence in

[[Page 195]]

award. The STD shall provide assurance that all bidders have received 
all issued addenda.
    (d) Nondiscriminatory bidding procedures shall be afforded to all 
qualified bidders regardless of National, State or local boundaries and 
without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or 
handicap. If any provisions of State laws, specifications, regulations, 
or policies may operate in any manner contrary to Federal requirements, 
including title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, to prevent 
submission of a bid, or prohibit consideration of a bid submitted by any 
responsible bidder appropriately qualified in accordance with Sec. 
635.110, such provisions shall not be applicable to Federal-aid 
projects. Where such nonapplicable provisions exist, notices of 
advertising, specifications, special provisions or other governing 
documents shall include a positive statement to advise prospective 
bidders of those provisions that are not applicable.
    (e) Except in the case of a concession agreement, as defined in 
section 710.703 of this title, no public agency shall be permitted to 
bid in competition or to enter into subcontracts with private 
contractors.
    (f) The STD shall include a noncollusion provision substantially as 
follows in the bidding documents:

    Each bidder shall file a statement executed by, or on behalf of the 
person, firm, association, or corporation submitting the bid certifying 
that such person, firm, association, or corporation has not, either 
directly or indirectly, entered into any agreement, participated in any 
collusion, or otherwise taken any action, in restraint of free 
competitive bidding in connection with the submitted bid. Failure to 
submit the executed statement as part of the bidding documents will make 
the bid nonresponsive and not eligible for award consideration.

    (1) The required form for the statement will be provided by the 
State to each prospective bidder.
    (2) The statement shall either be in the form of an affidavit 
executed and sworn to by the bidder before a person who is authorized by 
the laws of the State to administer oaths or in the form of an unsworn 
declaration executed under penalty of perjury of the laws of the United 
States.
    (g) The STD shall include the lobbying certification requirement 
pursuant to 49 CFR part 20 and the requirements of 49 CFR part 29 
regarding suspension and debarment certification in the bidding 
documents.
    (h) The STD shall clearly identify in the bidding documents those 
requirements which the bidder must assure are complied with to make the 
bid responsive. Failure to comply with these identified bidding 
requirements shall make the bid nonresponsive and not eligible for award 
consideration.
    (i) In the case of a design-build project, the following 
requirements apply:
    (1) When a Request for Proposals document is issued after the NEPA 
process is complete, the FHWA Division Administrator's approval of the 
Request for Proposals document will constitute the FHWA's project 
authorization and the FHWA's approval of the STD's request to release 
the document. This approval will carry the same significance as plan, 
specification and estimate approval on a design-bid-build Federal-aid 
project.
    (2) Where a Request for Proposals document is issued prior to the 
completion of the NEPA process, the FHWA's approval of the document will 
only constitute the FHWA's approval of the STD's request to release the 
document.
    (3) The STD may decide the appropriate solicitation schedule for all 
design-build requests. This includes all project advertising, the 
release of the Request for Qualifications document, the release of the 
Request for Proposals document and all deadlines for the receipt of 
qualification statements and proposals. Typical advertising periods 
range from six to ten weeks and can be longer for large, complicated 
projects.
    (4) The STD must obtain the approval of the Division Administrator 
prior to issuing addenda which result in major changes to the Request 
for Proposals document. Minor addenda need not receive prior approval 
but may be identified by the STD at the time of or prior to requesting 
the FHWA's concurrence in award. The STD must provide assurance that all

[[Page 196]]

offerors have received all issued addenda.

Sec. 635.113  Bid opening and bid tabulations.

    (a) All bids received in accordance with the terms of the 
advertisement shall be publicly opened and announced either item by item 
or by total amount. If any bid received is not read aloud, the name of 
the bidder and the reason for not reading the bid aloud shall be 
publicly announced at the letting. Negotiation with contractors, during 
the period following the opening of bids and before the award of the 
contract shall not be permitted.
    (b) The STD shall prepare and forward tabulations of bids to the 
Division Administrator. These tabulations shall be certified by a 
responsible STD official and shall show:
    (1) Bid item details for at least the low three acceptable bids and
    (2) The total amounts of all other acceptable bids.
    (c) In the case of a design-build project, the following 
requirements apply:
    (1) All proposals received must be opened and reviewed in accordance 
with the terms of the solicitation. The STD must use its own procedures 
for the following:
    (i) The process of handling proposals and information;
    (ii) The review and evaluation of proposals;
    (iii) The submission, modification, revision and withdrawal of 
proposals; and
    (iv) The announcement of the successful offeror.
    (2) The STD must submit a post-award tabulation of proposal prices 
to the FHWA Division Administrator. The tabulation of price proposal 
information may include detailed pricing information when available or 
lump sum price information if itemized prices are not used.

<R05>
Sec. 635.114  Award of contract and concurrence in award.

    (a) Federal-aid contracts shall be awarded only on the basis of the 
lowest responsive bid submitted by a bidder meeting the criteria of 
responsibility as may have been established by the STD in accordance 
with Sec. 635.110. Award shall be within the time established by the 
STD and subject to the prior concurrence of the Division Administrator.
    (b) The STD shall formally request concurrence by the Division 
Administrator in the award of all Federal-aid contracts. Concurrence in 
award by the Division Administrator is a prerequisite to Federal 
participation in construction costs and is considered as authority to 
proceed with construction, unless specifically stated otherwise. 
Concurrence in award shall be formally approved and shall only be given 
after receipt and review of the tabulation of bids.
    (c) Following the opening of bids, the STD shall examine the unit 
bid prices of the apparent low bid for reasonable conformance with the 
engineer's estimated prices. A bid with extreme variations from the 
engineer's estimate, or where obvious unbalancing of unit prices has 
occurred, shall be thoroughly evaluated.
    (d) Where obvious unbalanced bid items exist, the STD's decision to 
award or reject a bid shall be supported by written justification. A bid 
found to be mathematically unbalanced, but not found to be materially 
unbalanced, may be awarded.
    (e) When a low bid is determined to be both mathematically and 
materially unbalanced, the Division Administrator will take appropriate 
steps to protect the Federal interest. This action may be concurrence in 
a STD decision not to award the contract. If, however, the STD decides 
to proceed with the award and requests FHWA concurrence, the Division 
Administrator's action may range from nonconcurrence to concurrence with 
contingency conditions limiting Federal participation.
    (f) If the STD determines that the lowest bid is not responsive or 
the bidder is not responsible, it shall so notify

[[Page 197]]

and obtain the Division Administrator's concurrence before making an 
award to the next lowest bidder.
    (g) If the STD rejects or declines to read or consider a low bid on 
the grounds that it is not responsive because of noncompliance with a 
requirement which was not clearly identified in the bidding documents, 
it shall submit justification for its action. If such justification is 
not considered by the Division Administrator to be sufficient, 
concurrence will not be given to award to another bidder on the contract 
at the same letting.
    (h) Any proposal by the STD to reject all bids received for a 
Federal-aid contract shall be submitted to the Division Administrator 
for concurrence, accompanied by adequate justification.
    (i) In the event the low bidder selected by the STD for contract 
award forfeits the bid guarantee, the STD may dispose of the amounts of 
such forfeited guarantees in accordance with its normal practices.
    (j) A copy of the executed contract between the STD and the 
construction contractor should be furnished to the Division 
Administrator as soon as practicable after execution.
    (k) In the case of a design-build project, the following 
requirements apply: Design-build contracts shall be awarded in 
accordance with the Request for Proposals document. See 23 CFR Part 636, 
Design-build Contracting, for details.

[56 FR 37004, Aug. 2, 1991, as amended at 67 FR 75925, Dec. 10, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 635.115  Agreement estimate.

    (a) Following the award of contract, an agreement estimate based on 
the contract unit prices and estimated quantities shall be prepared by 
the STD and submitted to the Division Administrator as soon as 
practicable for use in the preparation of the project agreement. The 
agreement estimate shall also include the actual or best estimated costs 
of any other items to be included in the project agreement.
    (b) An agreement estimate shall be submitted by the STD for each 
force account project (see 23 CFR part 635, subpart B) when the plans 
and specifications are submitted to the Division Administrator for 
approval. It shall normally be based on the estimated quantities and the 
unit prices agreed upon in advance between the STD and the Division 
Administrator, whether the work is to be done by the STD or by a local 
public agency. Such agreed unit prices shall constitute a commitment as 
the basis for Federal participation in the cost of the project. The unit 
prices shall be based upon the estimated actual cost of performing the 
work but shall in no case exceed unit prices currently being obtained by 
competitive bidding on comparable highway construction work in the same 
general locality. In special cases involving unusual circumstances, the 
estimate may be based upon the estimated costs for labor, materials, 
equipment rentals, and supervision to complete the work rather than upon 
agreed unit prices. This paragraph shall not be applicable to agreement 
estimates for railroad and utility force account work.


<R05>
Sec. 635.116  Subcontracting and contractor responsibilities.

    (a) Contracts for projects shall specify the minimum percentage of 
work that a contractor must perform with its own organization. This 
percentage shall be not less than 30 percent of the total original 
contract price excluding any identified specialty items. Specialty items 
may be performed by subcontract and the amount of any such specialty 
items so performed may be deducted from the total original contract 
before computing the amount of work required to be performed by the 
contractor's own organization. The contract amount upon which the above 
requirement is computed includes the cost of materials and manufactured 
products which are to be purchased or produced by the contractor under 
the contract provisions.
    (b) The STD shall not permit any of the contract work to be 
performed under a subcontract, unless such arrangement has been 
authorized by the STD in writing. Prior to authorizing a subcontract, 
the STD shall assure that each subcontract is evidenced in writing and 
that it contains all pertinent provisions and requirements of the prime 
contract. The Division Administrator may permit the STD to satisfy

[[Page 198]]

the subcontract assurance requirements by concurrence in a STD process 
which requires the contractor to certify that each subcontract 
arrangement will be in the form of a written agreement containing all 
the requirements and pertinent provisions of the prime contract. Prior 
to the Division Administrator's concurrence, the STD must demonstrate 
that it has an acceptable plan for monitoring such certifications.
    (c) To assure that all work (including subcontract work) is 
performed in accordance with the contract requirements, the contractor 
shall be required to furnish:
    (1) A competent superintendent or supervisor who is employed by the 
firm, has full authority to direct performance of the work in accordance 
with the contract requirements, and is in charge of all construction 
operations (regardless of who performs the work), and;
    (2) Such other of its own organizational resources (supervision, 
management, and engineering services) as the STD contracting officer 
determines are necessary to assure the performance of the contract.
    (d) In the case of a design-build project, the following 
requirements apply:
    (1) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section are not 
applicable to design-build contracts;
    (2) At their discretion, the STDs may establish a minimum percentage 
of work that must be done by the design-builder. For the purpose of this 
section, the term design-builder may include any firms that are equity 
participants in the design-builder, their sister and parent companies, 
and their wholly owned subsidiaries;
    (3) No procedure, requirement or preference shall be imposed which 
prescribes minimum subcontracting requirements or goals (other than 
those necessary to meet the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program 
requirements of 49 CFR part 26).

[56 FR 37004, Aug. 2, 1991, as amended at 67 FR 75925, Dec. 10, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 635.117  Labor and employment.

    (a) No construction work shall be performed by convict labor at the 
work site or within the limits of any Federal-aid highway construction 
project from the time of award of the contract or the start of work on 
force account until final acceptance of the work by the STD unless it is 
labor performed by convicts who are on parole, supervised release, or 
probation.
    (b) No procedures or requirement shall be imposed by any State which 
will operate to discriminate against the employment of labor from any 
other State, possession or territory of the United States, in the 
construction of a Federal-aid project.
    (c) The selection of labor to be employed by the contractor on any 
Federal-aid project shall be by the contractor without regard to race, 
color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or handicap and in 
accordance with 23 CFR part 230, 41 CFR part 60 and Exec. Order No. 
11246 (Sept. 24, 1965), 3 CFR 339 (1964-1965), as amended.
    (d) Pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 140(d), it is permissible for STD's to 
implement procedures or requirements which will extend preferential 
employment to Indians living on or near a reservation on eligible 
projects as defined in paragraph (e) of this section. Indian preference 
shall be applied without regard to tribal affiliation or place of 
enrollment. In no instance should a contractor be compelled to layoff or 
terminate a permanent core-crew employee to meet a preference goal.
    (e) Projects eligible for Indian employment preference consideration 
are projects located on roads within or providing access to an Indian 
reservation or other Indian lands as defined under the term ``Indian 
Reservation Roads'' in 23 U.S.C. 101 and regulations issued thereunder. 
The terminus of a road ``providing access to'' is that point at which it 
intersects with a road functionally classified as a collector or higher 
classification (outside the reservation boundary) in both urban and 
rural areas. In the case of an Interstate highway, the terminus is the 
first interchange outside the reservation.
    (f) The advertisement or call for bids on any contract for the 
construction of a project located on the Federal-aid system either shall 
include the minimum wage rates determined by the Secretary of Labor to 
be prevailing on

[[Page 199]]

the same type of work on similar construction in the immediate locality 
or shall provide that such rates are set out in the bidding documents 
and shall further specify that such rates are a part of the contract 
covering the project.


<R05>
Sec. 635.118  Payroll and weekly statements.

    For all projects, copies of payrolls and statements of wages paid, 
filed with the State as set forth in the required contract provisions 
for the project, are to be retained by the STD for the time period 
pursuant to 49 CFR part 18 for review as needed by the Federal Highway 
Administration, the Department of Labor, the General Accounting Office, 
or other agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 635.119  False statements.

    The following notice shall be posted on each Federal-aid highway 
project in one or more places where it is readily available to and 
viewable by all personnel concerned with the project:

     Notice to All Personnel Engaged on Federal-Aid Highway Projects

    United States Code, title 18, section 1020, reads as follows:
    Whoever, being an officer, agent, or employee of the United States, 
or of any State or Territory, or whoever, whether a person, association, 
firm, or corporation, knowingly makes any false statement, false 
representation, or false report as to the character, quality, quantity, 
or cost of the material used or to be used, or the quantity or quality 
of the work performed or to be performed, or the costs thereof in 
connection with the submission of plans, maps, specifications, 
contracts, or costs of construction of any highway or related project 
submitted for approval to the Secretary of Transportation; or
    Whoever, knowingly makes any false statement, false representation, 
false report, or false claim with respect to the character, quality, 
quantity, or cost of any work performed or to be performed, or materials 
furnished or to be furnished, in connection with the construction of any 
highway or related project approved by the Secretary of Transportation; 
or
    Whoever, knowingly makes any false statement or false representation 
as to a material fact in any statement, certificate, or report submitted 
pursuant to the provisions of the Federal-aid Road Act approved July 11, 
1916 (39 Stat. 355), as amended and supplemented,
    Shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than 
five years, or both.


<R05>
Sec. 635.120  Changes and extra work.

    (a) Following authorization to proceed with a project, all major 
changes in the plans and contract provisions and all major extra work 
shall have formal approval by the Division Administrator in advance of 
their effective dates. However, when emergency or unusual conditions 
justify, the Division Administrator may give tentative advance approval 
orally to such changes or extra work and ratify such approval with 
formal approval as soon thereafter as practicable.
    (b) For non-major changes and non-major extra work, formal approval 
is necessary but such approval may be given retroactively at the 
discretion of the Division Administrator. The STD should establish and 
document with the Division Administrator's concurrence specific 
parameters as to what constitutes a non-major change and non-major extra 
work.
    (c) Changes in contract time, as related to contract changes or 
extra work, should be submitted at the same time as the respective work 
change for approval by the Division Administrator.
    (d) In establishing the method of payment for contract changes or 
extra work orders, force account procedures shall only be used when 
strictly necessary, such as when agreement cannot be reached with the 
contractor on the price of a new work item, or when the extent of work 
is unknown or is of such character that a price cannot be determined to 
a reasonable degree of accuracy. The reason or reasons for using force 
account procedures shall be documented.
    (e) The STD shall perform and adequately document a cost analysis of 
each negotiated contract change or negotiated extra work order. The 
method and degree of the cost analysis shall be subject to the approval 
of the Division Administrator.
    (f) Proposed changes and extra work involved in nonparticipating 
operations that may affect the design or participating construction 
features of a project, shall be subject to review and concurrence by the 
Division Administrator.

[[Page 200]]


<R05>
Sec. 635.121  Contract time and contract time extensions.

    (a) The STD should have adequate written procedures for the 
determination of contract time. These procedures should be submitted for 
approval to the Division Administrator within 6 months of the effective 
date of this Final Rule.
    (b) Contract time extensions granted by a STD shall be subject to 
the concurrence of the Division Administrator and will be considered in 
determining the amount of Federal participation. Contract time 
extensions submitted for approval to the Division Administrator, shall 
be fully justified and adequately documented.


<R05>
Sec. 635.122  Participation in progress payments.

    (a) Federal funds will participate in the costs to the STD of 
construction accomplished as the work progresses, based on a request for 
reimbursement submitted by State transportation departments. When the 
contract provisions provide for payment for stockpiled materials, the 
amount of the reimbursement request upon which participation is based 
may include the appropriate value of approved specification materials 
delivered by the contractor at the project site or at another designated 
location in the vicinity of such construction, provided that:
    (1) The material conforms with the requirements of the plans and 
specifications.
    (2) The material is supported by a paid invoice or a receipt for 
delivery of materials. If supported by a receipt of delivery of 
materials, the contractor must furnish the paid invoice within a 
reasonable time after receiving payment from the STD; and
    (3) The quantity of a stockpiled material eligible for Federal 
participation in any case shall not exceed the total estimated quantity 
required to complete the project. The value of the stockpiled material 
shall not exceed the appropriate portion of the value of the contract 
item or items in which such materials are to be incorporated.
    (b) The materials may be stockpiled by the contractor at a location 
not in the vicinity of the project, if the STD determines that because 
of required fabrication at an off-site location, it is not feasible or 
practicable to stockpile the materials in the vicinity of the project.
    (c) In the case of a design-build project, the STD must define its 
procedures for making progress payments on lump sum contracts in the 
Request for Proposal document.

[56 FR 37004, Aug. 2, 1991, as amended at 67 FR 75925, Dec. 10, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 635.123  Determination and documentation of pay quantities.

    (a) The STD shall have procedures in effect which will provide 
adequate assurance that the quantities of completed work are determined 
accurately and on a uniform basis throughout the State. All such 
determinations and all related source documents upon which payment is 
based shall be made a matter of record.
    (b) Initial source documents pertaining to the determination of pay 
quantities are among those records and documents which must be retained 
pursuant to 49 CFR part 18.


<R05>
Sec. 635.124  Participation in contract claim awards and settlements.

    (a) The eligibility for and extent of Federal-aid participation up 
to the Federal statutory share in a contract claim award made by a State 
to a Federal-aid contractor on the basis of an arbitration or mediation 
proceeding, administrative board determination, court judgment, 
negotiated settlement, or other contract claim settlement shall be 
determined on a case-by-case basis. Federal funds will participate to 
the extent that any contract adjustments made are supported, and have a 
basis in terms of the contract and applicable State law, as fairly 
construed. Further, the basis for the adjustment and contractor 
compensation shall be in accord with prevailing principles of public 
contract law.
    (b) The FHWA shall be made aware by the STD of the details of the 
claim at an early stage so that coordination of efforts can be 
satisfactorily accomplished. It is expected that STDs will diligently 
pursue the satisfactory resolution of claims within a reasonable

[[Page 201]]

period of time. Claims arising on exempt non-NHS projects should be 
processed in accordance with the State's approved Stewardship Plan.
    (c) When requesting Federal participation, the STD shall set forth 
in writing the legal and contractual basis for the claim, together with 
the cost data and other facts supporting the award or settlement. 
Federal-aid participation in such instances shall be supported by a STD 
audit of the actual costs incurred by the contractor unless waived by 
the FHWA as unwarranted. Where difficult, complex, or novel legal issues 
appear in the claim, such that evaluation of legal controversies is 
critical to consideration of the award or settlement, the STD shall 
include in its submission a legal opinion from its counsel setting forth 
the basis for determining the extent of the liability under local law, 
with a level of detail commensurate with the magnitude and complexity of 
the issues involved.
    (d) In those cases where the STD receives an adverse decision in an 
amount more than the STD was able to support prior to the decision or 
settles a claim in an amount more than the STD can support, the FHWA 
will participate up to the appropriate Federal matching share, to the 
extent that it involves a Federal-aid participating portion of the 
contract, provided that:
    (1) The FHWA was consulted and concurred in the proposed course of 
action;
    (2) All appropriate courses of action had been considered; and
    (3) The STD pursued the case diligently and in a professional 
manner.
    (e) Federal funds will not participate:
    (1) If it has been determined that STD employees, officers, or 
agents acted with gross negligence, or participated in intentional acts 
or omissions, fraud, or other acts not consistent with usual State 
practices in project design, plan preparation, contract administration, 
or other activities which gave rise to the claim;
    (2) In such cost items as consequential or punitive damages, 
anticipated profit, or any award or payment of attorney's fees paid by a 
State to an opposing party in litigation; and
    (3) In tort, inverse condemnation, or other claims erroneously 
styled as claims ``under a contract.''
    (f) Payment of interest associated with a claim will be eligible for 
participation provided that the payment to the contractor for interest 
is allowable by State statute or specification and the costs are not a 
result of delays caused by dilatory action of the State or the 
contractor. The interest rates must not exceed the rate provided for by 
the State statute or specification.
    (g) In cases where STD's affirmatively recover compensatory damages 
through contract claims, cross-claims, or counter claims from 
contractors, subcontractors, or their agents on projects on which there 
was Federal-aid participation, the Federal share of such recovery shall 
be equivalent to the Federal share of the project or projects involved. 
Such recovery shall be credited to the project or projects from which 
the claim or claims arose.

[56 FR 37004, Aug. 2, 1991, as amended at 62 FR 6873, Feb. 14, 1997; 69 
FR 7118, Feb. 13, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 635.125  Termination of contract.

    (a) All contracts exceeding $10,000 shall contain suitable 
provisions for termination by the State, including the manner by which 
the termination will be effected and the basis for settlement. In 
addition, such contracts shall describe conditions under which the 
contract may be terminated for default as well as conditions where the 
contract may be terminated because of circumstances beyond the control 
of the contractor.
    (b) The STD prior to termination of a Federal-aid contract shall 
consult with and receive the concurrence of the Division Administrator. 
The extent of Federal-aid participation in contract termination costs, 
including final settlement, will depend upon the merits of the 
individual case. However, under no circumstances shall Federal funds 
participate in anticipated profit on work not performed.
    (c) Except as provided for in paragraph (e) of this section, normal 
Federal-aid plans, specifications, and estimates, advertising, and award 
procedures are to be followed when a STD awards the contract for 
completion of a terminated Federal-aid contract.

[[Page 202]]

    (d) When a STD awards the contract for completion of a Federal-aid 
contract previously terminated for default, the construction amount 
eligible for Federal participation on the project should not exceed 
whichever amount is the lesser, either:
    (1) The amount representing the payments made under the original 
contract plus payments made under the new contract; or
    (2) The amount representing what the cost would have been if the 
construction had been completed as contemplated by the plans and 
specifications under the original contract.
    (e) If the surety awards a contract for completion of a defaulted 
Federal-aid contract or completes it by some other acceptable means, the 
FHWA will consider the terms of the original contract to be in effect 
and that the work will be completed in accordance with the approved 
plans and specifications included therein. No further FHWA approval or 
concurrence action will therefore be needed in connection with any 
defaulted Federal-aid contract awarded by a surety. Under this 
procedure, the construction amount eligible for Federal participation on 
the project should not exceed the amount representing what the cost 
would have been if the construction had been completed as contemplated 
by the plans and specifications under the original contract.


<R05>
Sec. 635.126  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 635.127  Agreement provisions regarding overruns in contract time.

    (a) Each State transportation department (STD) shall establish 
specific liquidated damages rates applicable to projects in that State. 
The rates may be project-specific or may be in the form of a table or 
schedule developed for a range of project costs and/or project types. 
These rates shall, as a minimum, be established to cover the estimated 
average daily construction engineering (CE) costs associated with the 
type of work encountered on the project. The amounts shall be assessed 
by means of deductions, for each calendar day or workday overrun in 
contract time, from payments otherwise due to the contractor for 
performance in accordance with the contract terms.
    (b) The rates established shall be subject to FHWA approval either 
on a project-by-project basis, in the case of project-specific rates, or 
on a periodic basis after initial approval where a rate table or 
schedule is used. In the latter case, the STD shall periodically review 
its cost data to ascertain if the rate table/schedule closely 
approximates, at a minimum, the actual average daily CE costs associated 
with the type and size of the projects in the State. Where rate 
schedules or other means are already included in the STD specifications 
or standard special provisions, verification by the STD that the amounts 
are adequate shall be submitted to the FHWA for review and approval. 
After initial approval by the FHWA of the rates, the STD shall review 
the rates at least every 2 years and provide updated rates, when 
necessary, for FHWA approval. If updated rates are not warranted, 
justification of this fact is to be sent to the FHWA for review and 
acceptance.
    (c) The STD may, with FHWA concurrence, include additional amounts 
as liquidated damages in each contract to cover other anticipated costs 
of project related delays or inconveniences to the STD or the public. 
Costs resulting from winter shutdowns, retaining detours for an extended 
time, additional demurrage, or similar costs as well as road user delay 
costs may be included.
    (d) In addition to the liquidated damages provisions, the STD may 
also include incentive/disincentive for early completion provisions in 
the contract. The incentive/disincentive amounts shall be shown 
separately from the liquidated damages amounts.
    (e) Where there has been an overrun in contract time, the following 
principles shall apply in determining the cost of a project that is 
eligible for Federal-aid reimbursement:
    (1) A proportional share, as used in this section, is the ratio of 
the final contract construction costs eligible for Federal participation 
to the final total contract construction costs of the project.
    (2) Where CE costs are claimed as a participating item based upon 
actual

[[Page 203]]

expenses incurred or where CE costs are not claimed as a participating 
item, and where the liquidated damages rates cover only CE expenses, the 
total CE costs for the project shall be reduced by the assessed 
liquidated damages amounts prior to figuring any Federal pro rata share 
payable. If the amount of liquidated damages assessed is more than the 
actual CE totals for the project, a proportional share of the excess 
shall be deducted from the federally participating contract construction 
cost before determining the final Federal share.
    (3) Where the STD is being reimbursed for CE costs on the basis of 
an approved percentage of the participating construction cost, the total 
contract construction amount that would be eligible for Federal 
participation shall be reduced by a proportional share of the total 
liquidated damages amounts assessed on the project.
    (4) Where liquidated damages include extra anticipated non-CE costs 
due to contractor caused delays, the amount assessed shall be used to 
pay for the actual non-CE expenses incurred by the STD, and, if a 
Federal participating item(s) is involved, to reduce the Federal share 
payable for that item(s). If the amount assessed is more than the actual 
expenses incurred by the STD, a proportional share of the excess shall 
be deducted from the federally participating contract construction cost 
of the project before the Federal share is figured.
    (f) When provisions for incentive/disincentive for early completion 
are used in the contract, a proportion of the increased project costs 
due to any incentive payments to the contractor shall be added to the 
federally participating contract construction cost before calculating 
the Federal share. When the disincentive provision is applicable, a 
proportion of the amount assessed the contractor shall be deducted from 
the federally participating contract construction cost before the 
Federal share calculation. Proportions are to be calculated in the same 
manner as set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

                  Subpart B_Force Account Construction


<R05>
Sec. 635.201  Purpose.

    The purpose of this subpart is to prescribe procedures in accordance 
with 23 U.S.C. 112(b) for a State transportation department to request 
approval that highway construction work be performed by some method 
other than contract awarded by competitive bidding.

[48 FR 22912, May 23, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 635.202  Applicability.

    This subpart applies to all Federal-aid and other highway 
construction projects financed in whole or in part with Federal funds 
and to be constructed by a State transportation department or a 
subdivision thereof in pursuant of agreements between any other State 
transportation department and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).

[69 FR 7119, Feb. 13, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 635.203  Definitions.

    The following definitions shall apply for the purpose of this 
subpart:
    (a) A State transportation department is that department, 
commission, board, or official of any State charged by its laws with the 
responsibility for highway construction. The term State should be 
considered equivalent to State transportation department if the context 
so implies.
    (b) Except as provided for as emergency repair work in Sec. 
668.105(i) and in Sec. 635.204(b), the term some other method of 
construction as used in 23 U.S.C. 112(b) shall mean the force account 
method of construction as defined herein. In the unlikely event that 
circumstances are considered to justify a negotiated contract or another 
unusual method of construction, the policies and procedures prescribed 
herein for force account work will apply.
    (c) The term force account shall mean the direct performance of 
highway construction work by a State transportation department, a 
county, a railroad, or a public utility company by use of labor, 
equipment, materials, and supplies furnished by them and used under 
their direct control.

[[Page 204]]

    (d) The term county shall mean any county, township, municipality or 
other political subdivision that may be empowered to cooperate with the 
State transportation department in highway matters.
    (e) The term cost effective shall mean the efficient use of labor, 
equipment, materials and supplies to assure the lowest overall cost.
    (f) For the purpose of this part, an emergency shall be deemed to 
exist when emergency repair work as provided for in Sec. 668.105(i) is 
necessary or when a major element or segment of the highway system has 
failed and the situation is such that competitive bidding is not 
possible or is impractical because immediate action is necessary to:
    (1) Minimize the extent of the damage,
    (2) Protect remaining facilities, or
    (3) Restore essential travel.

This definition of emergency has no applicability to the Emergency 
Relief Program of 23 CFR part 668.

[39 FR 35158, Sept. 30, 1974, as amended at 48 FR 22912, May 23, 1983; 
52 FR 45172, Nov. 25, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 635.204  Determination of more cost effective method or an emergency.

    (a) Congress has expressly provided that the contract method based 
on competitive bidding shall be used by a State transportation 
department or county for performance of highway work financed with the 
aid of Federal funds unless the State transportation department 
demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, that some other 
method is more cost effective or that an emergency exists.
    (b) When a State transportation department determines it necessary 
due to an emergency to undertake a federally financed highway 
construction project by force account or negotiated contract method, it 
shall submit a request to the Division Administrator identifying and 
describing the project, the kinds of work to be performed, the method to 
be used, the estimated costs, the estimated Federal Funds to be 
provided, and the reason or reasons that an emergency exists.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, when a 
State transportation department desires that highway construction work 
financed with the aid of Federal funds, other than the kinds of work 
designated under Sec. 635.205(b), be undertaken by force account, it 
shall submit a request to the Division Administrator identifying and 
describing the project and the kind of work to be performed, the 
estimated costs, the estimated Federal funds to be provided, and the 
reason or reasons that force account for such project is considered cost 
effective.
    (d) The Division Administrator shall notify the State transportation 
department in writing of his/her determination.

[52 FR 45172, Nov. 25, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 635.205  Finding of cost effectiveness.

    (a) It may be found cost effective for a State transportation 
department or county to undertake a federally financed highway 
construction project by force account when a situation exists in which 
the rights or resposibilities of the community at large are so affected 
as to require some special course of action, including situations where 
there is a lack of bids or the bids received are unreasonable.
    (b) Pursuant to authority in 23 U.S.C. 112(b), it is hereby 
determined that by reason of the inherent nature of the operations 
involved, it is cost effective to perform by force account the 
adjustment of railroad or utility facilities and similar types of 
facilities owned or operated by a public agency, a railroad, or a 
utility company provided that the organization is qualified to perform 
the work in a satisfactory manner. The installation of new facilities 
shall be undertaken by competitive bidding except as provided in Sec. 
635.204(c). Adjustment of railroad facilities shall include minor work 
on the railroad's operating facilities routinely performed by the 
railroad with its own forces such as the installation of grade crossing 
warning devices, crossing surfaces, and minor track and signal work. 
Adjustment of utility facilities shall include minor work on the 
utility's existing facilities routinely performed by the utility with 
its own forces and includes minor installations of new facilities to 
provide power, minor lighting, telephone, water and similar utility 
service to a

[[Page 205]]

rest area, weigh-station, movable bridge, or other highway appurtenance, 
provided such installation cannot feasibly be done as incidental to a 
major installation project such as an extensive highway lighting system.

              Subpart C_Physical Construction Authorization

    Source: 40 FR 17251, Apr. 18, 1975, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 635.301  Purpose.

    To prescribe the policies and procedures under which a State 
transportation department may be authorized to advance a Federal-aid 
highway project to the physical construction stage.


<R05>
Sec. 635.303  Applicability.

    The provisions of this subpart are applicable to all Federal-aid 
highway construction projects.

[69 FR 7119, Feb. 13, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 635.305  Physical construction.

    For purposes of this subpart the physical construction of a project 
is considered to consist of the actual construction of the highway 
itself with its appurtenant facilities. It includes any removal, 
adjustment or demolition of buildings or major obstructions, and utility 
or railroad work that is a part of the contract for the physical 
construction.


<R05>
Sec. 635.307  Coordination.

    (a) The right-of-way clearance, utility, and railroad work are to be 
so coordinated with the physical construction that no unnecessary delay 
or cost for the physical construction will occur.
    (b) All right-of-way clearance, utility, and railroad work performed 
separately from the contract for the physical construction of the 
project are to be accomplished in accordance with provisions of the 
following:
    (1) 23 CFR part 140, subpart I;
    (2) 23 CFR part 646, subpart B;
    (3) 23 CFR 710.403; and
    (4) 23 CFR part 645, subpart A.

64 FR 71289, Dec. 21, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 635.309  Authorization.

    Authorization to advertise the physical construction for bids or to 
proceed with force account construction thereof shall normally be issued 
as soon as, but not until, all of the following conditions have been 
met:
    (a) The plans, specifications, and estimates (PS&E) therefor have 
been approved.
    (b) A statement is received from the State, either separately or 
combined with the information required by Sec. 635.309(c), that either 
all right-of-way clearance, utility, and railroad work has been 
completed or that all necessary arrangements have been made for it to be 
undertaken and completed as required for proper coordination with the 
physical construction schedules. Where it is determined that the 
completion of such work in advance of the highway construction is not 
feasible or practical due to economy, special operational problems and 
the like, there shall be appropriate notification provided in the bid 
proposals identifying the right-of-way clearance, utility, and railroad 
work which is to be underway concurrently with the highway construction.
    (c) A statement is received from the State certifying that all 
individuals and families have been relocated to decent, safe and 
sanitary housing or the State has made available to relocatees adequate 
replacement housing in accordance with the provisions of the current 
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) directive(s) covering the 
administration of the Highway Relocation Assistance Program and that one 
of the following has application:
    (1) All necessary rights-of-way, including control of access rights 
when pertinent, have been acquired including legal and physical 
possession. Trial or appeal of cases may be pending in court but legal 
possession has been obtained. There may be some improvements remaining 
on the right-of-way but all occupants have vacated the lands and 
improvements and the State has physical possession and the right

[[Page 206]]

to remove, salvage, or demolish these improvements and enter on all 
land.
    (2) Although all necessary rights-of-way have not been fully 
acquired, the right to occupy and to use all rights-of-way required for 
the proper execution of the project has been acquired. Trial or appeal 
of some parcels may be pending in court and on other parcels full legal 
possession has not been obtained but right of entry has been obtained, 
the occupants of all lands and improvements have vacated and the State 
has physical possession and right to remove, salvage, or demolish these 
improvements.
    (3) The acquisition or right of occupancy and use of a few remaining 
parcels is not complete, but all occupants of the residences on such 
parcels have had replacement housing made available to them in 
accordance with 49 CFR 24.204. The State may request authorization on 
this basis only in very unusual circumstances. This exception must never 
become the rule. Under these circumstances, advertisement for bids or 
force-account work may be authorized if FHWA finds that it will be in 
the public interest. The physical construction may then also proceed, 
but the State shall ensure that occupants of residences, businesses, 
farms, or non-profit organizations who have not yet moved from the 
right-of-way are protected against unnecessary inconvenience and 
disproportionate injury or any action coercive in nature. When the State 
requests authorization to advertise for bids and to proceed with 
physical construction where acquisition or right of occupancy and use of 
a few parcels has not been obtained, full explanation and reasons 
therefor including identification of each such parcel will be set forth 
in the State's request along with a realistic date when physical 
occupancy and use is anticipated as well as substantiation that such 
date is realistic. Appropriate notification shall be provided in the bid 
proposals identifying all locations where right of occupancy and use has 
not been obtained.
    (d) The State transportation department in accord with 23 CFR 
771.111(h), has submitted public hearing transcripts, certifications and 
reports pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 128.
    (e) An affirmative finding of cost effectiveness or that an 
emergency exists has been made as required by 23 U.S.C. 112, when 
construction by some method other than contract based on competitive 
bidding is contemplated.
    (f) Minimum wage rates determined by the Department of Labor in 
accordance with the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 113, are in effect and will 
not expire before the end of the period within which it can reasonably 
be expected that the contract will be awarded.
    (g) A statement has been received that right-of-way has been 
acquired or will be acquired in accordance with the current FHWA 
directive(s) covering the acquisition of real property or that 
acquisition of right-of-way is not required.
    (h) A statement has been received that the steps relative to 
relocation advisory assistance and payments as required by the current 
FHWA directive(s) covering the administration of the Highway Relocation 
Assistance Program have been taken, or that they are not required.
    (i) The FHWA Division Administrator has determined that appropriate 
measures have been included in the PS&E in keeping with approved 
guidelines, for minimizing possible soil erosion and water pollution as 
a result of highway construction operations.
    (j) The FHWA Division Administrator has determined that requirements 
of 23 CFR part 771 have been fulfilled and appropriate measures have 
been included in the PS&E to ensure that conditions and commitments made 
in the development of the project to mitigate environmental harm will be 
met.
    (k) Where utility facilities are to use and occupy the right-of-way, 
the State has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the FHWA Division 
Administrator that the provisions of 23 CFR 645.119(b) have been 
fulfilled.
    (l) The FHWA Division Administrator has verified the fact that 
adequate replacement housing is in place and has been made available to 
all affected persons.
    (m) Where applicable, areawide agency review has been accomplished 
as required by 42 U.S.C. 3334 and 4231 through 4233.

[[Page 207]]

    (n) The FHWA Division Administrator has determined that the PS&E 
provide for the erection of only those information signs and traffic 
control devices that conform to the standards developed by the Secretary 
of Transportation or mandates of Federal law and do not include 
promotional or other informational signs regarding such matters as 
identification of public officials, contractors, organizational 
affiliations, and related logos and symbols.
    (o) The FHWA Division Administrator has determined that, where 
applicable, provisions are included in the PS&E that require the 
erection of funding source signs, for the life of the construction 
project, in accordance with section 154 of the Surface Transportation 
and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987.
    (p) In the case of a design-build project, the following 
certification requirements apply:
    (1) The FHWA's project authorization for final design and physical 
construction will not be issued until the following conditions have been 
met:
    (i) All projects must conform with the statewide and metropolitan 
transportation planning requirements (23 CFR part 450).
    (ii) All projects in air quality nonattainment and maintenance areas 
must meet all transportation conformity requirements (40 CFR parts 51 
and 93).
    (iii) The NEPA review process has been concluded. (See 23 CFR 
636.109).
    (iv) The Request for Proposals document has been approved.
    (v) A statement is received from the STD that either all right-of-
way, utility, and railroad work has been completed or that all necessary 
arrangements will be made for the completion of right of way, utility, 
and railroad work.
    (vi) If the STD elects to include right-of-way, utility, and/or 
railroad services as part of the design-builder's scope of work, then 
the Request for Proposals document must include:
    (A) A statement concerning scope and current status of the required 
services, and
    (B) A statement which requires compliance with the Uniform 
Relocation and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as 
amended, and 23 CFR part 710.
    (2) During a conformity lapse, a design-build project (including 
right-of-way acquisition activities) may continue if, prior to the 
conformity lapse, the NEPA process was completed and the project has not 
changed significantly in design scope, the FHWA authorized the design-
build project and the project met transportation conformity requirements 
(40 CFR parts 51 and 93).
    (3) Changes to the design-build project concept and scope may 
require a modification of the transportation plan and transportation 
improvement program. The project sponsor must comply with the 
metropolitan and statewide transportation planning requirements in 23 
CFR part 450 and the transportation conformity requirements (40 CFR 
parts 51 and 93) in air quality nonattainment and maintenance areas, and 
provide appropriate approval notification to the design-builder for such 
changes.

                 Subpart D_General Material Requirements

    Source: 41 FR 36204, Aug. 27, 1976, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 635.401  Purpose.

    The purpose of this subpart is to prescribe requirements and 
procedures relating to product and material selection and use on 
Federal-aid highway projects.


<R05>
Sec. 635.403  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, the following terms have the meanings 
indicated:
    (a) FHWA Division Administrator means the chief Federal Highway 
Administration (FHWA) official assigned to conduct business in a 
particular State;

[[Page 208]]

    (b) Material means any tangible substance incorporated into a 
Federal-aid highway project;
    (c) PS&E means plans, specifications, and estimates;
    (d) Special provisions means additions and revisions to the standard 
and supplemental specifications applicable to an individual project;
    (e) Standard specifications means a compilation in book form of 
specifications approved for general application and repetitive use;
    (f) State has the meaning set forth in 23 U.S.C. 101;
    (g) State transportation department means that department, 
commission, board, or official of any State charged by its laws with the 
responsibility for highway construction;
    (h) Supplemental specifications means approved additions and 
revisions to the standard specifications.


<R05>
Sec. 635.405  Applicability.

    The requirements and procedures prescribed in this subpart apply to 
all contracts relating to Federal-aid highway projects.

[69 FR 7119, Feb. 13, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 635.407  Use of materials made available by a public agency.

    (a) Contracts for highway projects shall require the contractor to 
furnish all materials to be incorporated in the work and shall permit 
the contractor to select the sources from which the materials are to be 
obtained. Exception to this requirement may be made when there is a 
definite finding by the State transportation department and concurred in 
by the FHWA Division Administrator, that it is in the public interest to 
require the contractor to use material furnished by the State 
transportation department or from sources designated by the State 
transportation department. In cases such as this, the FHWA does not 
expect mutual sharing of costs unless the State transportation 
department receives a related credit from another agency or political 
subdivision of the State. Where such a credit does accrue to the State 
transportation department, it shall be applied to the Federal-aid 
project involved. The designation of a mandatory material source may be 
permitted based on environmental considerations, provided the 
environment would be substantially enhanced without excessive cost. 
Otherwise, if a State transportation department proposal to designate a 
material source for mandatory use would result in higher project costs, 
Federal-aid funds shall not participate in the increase even if the 
designation would conserve other public funds.
    (b) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section will not 
preclude the designation in the plans and specifications of sources of 
local natural materials, such as borrow aggregates, that have been 
investigated by the State transportation department and found to contain 
materials meeting specification requirements. The use of materials from 
such designated sources shall not be mandatory unless there is a finding 
of public interest as stated in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Federal funds may participate in the cost of specifications 
materials made available by a public agency when they have been actually 
incorporated in accepted items of work, or in the cost of such materials 
meeting the criteria and stockpiled at the locations specified in Sec. 
635.114 of this chapter.
    (d) To be eligible for Federal participation in its cost, any 
material, other than local natural materials, to be purchased by the 
State transportation department and furnished to the contractor for 
mandatory use in the project, must have been acquired on the basis of 
competitive bidding, except when there is a finding of public interest 
justifying the use of another method of acquisition. The location and 
unit price at which such material will be available to the contractor 
must be stated in the special provisions for the benefit of all 
prospective bidders. The unit cost eligible for Federation participation 
will be limited to the unit cost of such material to the State 
transportation department.
    (e) When the State transportation department or another public 
agency owns or has control over the source of a local natural material 
the unit price at which such material will be made available to the 
contractor must be

[[Page 209]]

stated in the plans or special provisions. Federal participation will be 
limited to (1) the cost of the material to the State transportation 
department or other public agency; or (2) the fair and reasonable value 
of the material, whichever is less. Special cases may arise that will 
justify Federal participation on a basis other than that set forth 
above. Such cases should be fully documented and receive advance 
approval by the FHWA Division Administrator.
    (f) Costs incurred by the State transportation department or other 
public agency for acquiring a designated source or the right to take 
materials from it will not be eligible for Federal participation if the 
source is not used by the contractor.
    (g) The contract provisions for one or a combination of Federal-aid 
projects shall not specify a mandatory site for the disposal of surplus 
excavated materials unless there is a finding by the State 
transportation department with the concurrence of the FHWA Division 
Administrator that such placement is the most economical except that the 
designation of a mandatory site may be permitted based on environmental 
considerations, provided the environment would be substantially enhanced 
without excessive cost.


<R05>
Sec. 635.409  Restrictions upon materials.

    No requirement shall be imposed and no procedure shall be enforced 
by any State transportation department in connection with a project 
which may operate:
    (a) To require the use of or provide a price differential in favor 
of articles or materials produced within the State, or otherwise to 
prohibit, restrict or discriminate against the use of articles or 
materials shipped from or prepared, made or produced in any State, 
territory or possession of the United States; or
    (b) To prohibit, restrict or otherwise discriminate against the use 
of articles or materials of foreign origin to any greater extent than is 
permissible under policies of the Department of Transportation as 
evidenced by requirements and procedures prescribed by the FHWA 
Administrator to carry out such policies.


<R05>
Sec. 635.410  Buy America requirements.

    (a) The provisions of this section shall prevail and be given 
precedence over any requirements of this subpart which are contrary to 
this section. However, nothing in this section shall be construed to be 
contrary to the requirements of Sec. 635.409(a) of this subpart.
    (b) No Federal-aid highway construction project is to be authorized 
for advertisement or otherwise authorized to proceed unless at least one 
of the following requirements is met:
    (1) The project either: (i) Includes no permanently incorporated 
steel or iron materials, or (ii) if steel or iron materials are to be 
used, all manufacturing processes, including application of a coating, 
for these materials must occur in the United States. Coating includes 
all processes which protect or enhance the value of the material to 
which the coating is applied.
    (2) The State has standard contract provisions that require the use 
of domestic materials and products, including steel and iron materials, 
to the same or greater extent as the provisions set forth in this 
section.
    (3) The State elects to include alternate bid provisions for foreign 
and domestic steel and iron materials which comply with the following 
requirements. Any procedure for obtaining alternate bids based on 
furnishing foreign steel and iron materials which is acceptable to the 
Division Administrator may be used. The contract provisions must (i) 
require all bidders to submit a bid based on furnishing domestic steel 
and iron materials, and (ii) clearly state that the contract will be 
awarded to the bidder who submits the lowest total bid based on 
furnishing domestic steel and iron materials unless such total bid 
exceeds the lowest total bid based on furnishing foreign steel and iron 
materials by more than 25 percent.
    (4) When steel and iron materials are used in a project, the 
requirements of this section do not prevent a minimal use of foreign 
steel and iron materials, if the cost of such materials used does not 
exceed one-tenth of one percent (0.1 percent) of the total contract cost 
or $2,500, whichever is greater. For purposes of this paragraph, the 
cost is that

[[Page 210]]

shown to be the value of the steel and iron products as they are 
delivered to the project.
    (c)(1) A State may request a waiver of the provisions of this 
section if;
    (i) The application of those provisions would be inconsistent with 
the public interest; or
    (ii) Steel and iron materials/products are not produced in the 
United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities which 
are of a satisfactory quality.
    (2) A request for waiver, accompanied by supporting information, 
must be submitted in writing to the Regional Federal Highway 
Administrator (RFHWA) through the FHWA Division Administrator. A request 
must be submitted sufficiently in advance of the need for the waiver in 
order to allow time for proper review and action on the request. The 
RFHWA will have approval authority on the request.
    (3) Requests for waivers may be made for specific projects, or for 
certain materials or products in specific geographic areas, or for 
combinations of both, depending on the circumstances.
    (4) The denial of the request by the RFHWA may be appealed by the 
State to the Federal Highway Administrator (Administrator), whose action 
on the request shall be considered administratively final.
    (5) A request for a waiver which involves nationwide public interest 
or availability issues or more than one FHWA region may be submitted by 
the RFHWA to the Administrator for action.
    (6) A request for waiver and an appeal from a denial of a request 
must include facts and justification to support the granting of the 
waiver. The FHWA response to a request or appeal will be in writing and 
made available to the public upon request. Any request for a nationwide 
waiver and FHWA's action on such a request may be published in the 
Federal Register for public comment.
    (7) In determining whether the waivers described in paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section will be granted, the FHWA will consider all appropriate 
factors including, but not limited to, cost, administrative burden, and 
delay that would be imposed if the provision were not waived.
    (d) Standard State and Federal-aid contract procedures may be used 
to assure compliance with the requirements of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 635.411  Material or product selection.

    (a) Federal funds shall not participate, directly or indirectly, in 
payment for any premium or royalty on any patented or proprietary 
material, specification, or process specifically set forth in the plans 
and specifications for a project, unless:
    (1) Such patented or proprietary item is purchased or obtained 
through competitive bidding with equally suitable unpatented items; or
    (2) The State transportation department certifies either that such 
patented or proprietary item is essential for synchronization with 
existing highway facilities, or that no equally suitable alternate 
exists; or
    (3) Such patented or proprietary item is used for research or for a 
distinctive type of construction on relatively short sections of road 
for experimental purposes.
    (b) When there is available for purchase more than one nonpatented, 
nonproprietary material, semifinished or finished article or product 
that will fulfill the requirements for an item of work of a project and 
these available materials or products are judged to be of satisfactory 
quality and equally acceptable on the basis of engineering analysis and 
the anticipated prices for the related item(s) of work are estimated to 
be approximately the same, the PS&E for the project shall either contain 
or include by reference the specifications for each such material or 
product that is considered acceptable for incorporation in the work. If 
the State transportation department wishes to substitute some other 
acceptable material or product for the material or product designated by 
the successful bidder or bid as the lowest alternate, and such 
substitution results in an increase in costs, there will not be Federal-
aid participation in any increase in costs.

[[Page 211]]

    (c) A State transportation department may require a specific 
material or product when there are other acceptable materials and 
products, when such specific choice is approved by the Division 
Administrator as being in the public interest. When the Division 
Administrator's approval is not obtained, the item will be 
nonparticipating unless bidding procedures are used that establish the 
unit price of each acceptable alternative. In this case Federal-aid 
participation will be based on the lowest price so established.
    (d) Reference in specifications and on plans to single trade name 
materials will not be approved on Federal-aid contracts.
    (e) In the case of a design-build project, the following 
requirements apply: Federal funds shall not participate, directly or 
indirectly, in payment for any premium or royalty on any patented or 
proprietary material, specification, or process specifically set forth 
in the Request for Proposals document unless the conditions of paragraph 
(a) of this section are applicable.

Sec. 635.413  Guaranty and warranty clauses.

    The STD may include warranty provisions in National Highway System 
(NHS) construction contracts in accordance with the following:
    (a) Warranty provisions shall be for a specific construction product 
or feature. Items of maintenance not eligible for Federal participation 
shall not be covered.
    (b) All warranty requirements and subsequent revisions shall be 
submitted to the Division Administrator for advance approval.
    (c) No warranty requirement shall be approved which, in the judgment 
of the Division Administrator, may place an undue obligation on the 
contractor for items over which the contractor has no control.
    (d) A STD may follow its own procedures regarding the inclusion of 
warranty provisions in non-NHS Federal-aid contracts.
    (e) In the case of a design-build project, the following 
requirements will apply instead of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this 
section.
    (1) General project warranties may be used on NHS projects, 
provided:
    (i) The term of the warranty is short (generally one to two years); 
however, projects developed under a public-private agreement may include 
warranties that are appropriate for the term of the contract or 
agreement.
    (ii) The warranty is not the sole means of acceptance;
    (iii) The warranty must not include items of routine maintenance 
which are not eligible for Federal participation; and,
    (iv) The warranty may include the quality of workmanship, materials 
and other specific tasks identified in the contract.
    (2) Performance warranties for specific products on NHS projects may 
be used at the STD's discretion. If performance warranties are used, 
detailed performance criteria must be provided in the Request for 
Proposal document.
    (3) The STD may follow its own procedures regarding the inclusion of 
warranty provisions on non-NHS Federal-aid design-build contracts.
    (4) For best value selections, the STD may allow proposers to submit 
alternate warranty proposals that improve upon the warranty terms in the 
RFP document. Such alternate warranty proposals must be in addition to 
the base proposal that responds to the RFP requirements.

<R05>
Sec. 635.417  Convict produced materials.

    (a) Materials produced after July 1, 1991, by convict labor may only 
be incorporated in a Federal-aid highway construction project if such 
materials have been:
    (1) Produced by convicts who are on parole, supervised release, or 
probation from a prison or
    (2) Produced in a qualified prison facility and the cumulative 
annual production amount of such materials for use in Federal-aid 
highway construction does not exceed the amount of

[[Page 212]]

such materials produced in such facility for use in Federal-aid highway 
construction during the 12-month period ending July 1, 1987.
    (b) Qualified prison facility means any prison facility in which 
convicts, during the 12-month period ending July 1, 1987, produced 
materials for use in Federal-aid highway construction projects.

<R04>
                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 636.101  What does this part do?

    This part describes the FHWA's policies and procedures for approving 
design-build projects financed under title 23, United States Code 
(U.S.C.). This part satisfies the requirement of section 1307(c) of the 
Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), enacted on June 
9, 1998. The contracting procedures of this part apply to all design-
build project funded under title 23, U.S.C.


<R05>
Sec. 636.102  Does this part apply to me?

    (a) This part uses a plain language format to make the rule easier 
for the general public and business community to use. The section 
headings and text, often in the form of questions and answers, must be 
read together.
    (b) Unless otherwise noted, the pronoun ``you'' means the primary 
recipient of Federal-aid highway funds, the State Transportation 
Department (STD). Where the STD has an agreement with a local public 
agency (or other governmental agency) to administer a Federal-aid 
design-build project, the term ``you'' will also apply to that 
contracting agency.


<R05>
Sec. 636.103  What are the definitions of terms used in this part?

    Unless otherwise specified in this part, the definitions in 23 
U.S.C. 101(a) are applicable to this part. Also, the following 
definitions are used:
    Adjusted low bid means a form of best value selection in which 
qualitative aspects are scored on a 0 to 100 scale expressed as a 
decimal; price is then divided by qualitative score to yield an 
``adjusted bid'' or ``price per quality point.'' Award is made to 
offeror with the lowest adjusted bid.
    Best value selection means any selection process in which proposals 
contain both price and qualitative components and award is based upon a 
combination of price and qualitative considerations.
    Clarifications means a written or oral exchange of information which 
takes place after the receipt of proposals when award without 
discussions is contemplated. The purpose of clarifications is to address 
minor or clerical revisions in a proposal.
    Communications are exchanges, between the contracting agency and 
offerors, after receipt of proposals, which lead to the establishment of 
the competitive range.
    Competitive acquisition means an acquisition process which is 
designed to foster an impartial and comprehensive evaluation of 
offerors' proposals, leading to the selection of the proposal 
representing the best value to the contracting agency.
    Competitive range means a list of the most highly rated proposals 
based on the initial proposal rankings. It is based on the rating of 
each proposal against all evaluation criteria.
    Contracting agency means the public agency awarding and 
administering a design-build contract. The contracting

[[Page 214]]

agency may be the STD or another State or local public agency.
    Deficiency means a material failure of a proposal to meet a 
contracting agency requirement or a combination of significant 
weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful 
contract performance to an unacceptable level.
    Design-bid-build means the traditional project delivery method where 
design and construction are sequential steps in the project development 
process.
    Design-build contract means an agreement that provides for design 
and construction of improvements by a contractor or private developer. 
The term encompasses design-build-maintain, design-build-operate, 
design-build-finance and other contracts that include services in 
addition to design and construction. Franchise and concession agreements 
are included in the term if they provide for the franchisee or 
concessionaire to develop the project which is the subject of the 
agreement.
    Design-builder means the entity contractually responsible for 
delivering the project design and construction.
    Discussions mean written or oral exchanges that take place after the 
establishment of the competitive range with the intent of allowing the 
offerors to revise their proposals.
    Final design means any design activities following preliminary 
design and expressly includes the preparation of final construction 
plans and detailed specifications for the performance of construction 
work.
    Fixed price/best design means a form of best value selection in 
which contract price is established by the owner and stated in the 
Request for Proposals document. Design solutions and other qualitative 
factors are evaluated and rated, with award going to the firm offering 
the best qualitative proposal for the established price.
    Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) services means services 
which provide for the acquisition of technologies or systems of 
technologies (e.g., computer hardware or software, traffic control 
devices, communications link, fare payment system, automatic vehicle 
location system, etc.) that provide or contribute to the provision of 
one or more ITS user services as defined in the National ITS 
Architecture.
    Modified design-build means a variation of design-build in which the 
contracting agency furnishes offerors with partially complete plans. The 
design-builders role is generally limited to the completion of the 
design and construction of the project.
    Organizational conflict of interest means that because of other 
activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable or 
potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the 
owner, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work is or 
might be otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair competitive 
advantage.
    Preliminary design defines the general project location and design 
concepts. It includes, but is not limited to, preliminary engineering 
and other activities and analyses, such as environmental assessments, 
topographic surveys, metes and bounds surveys, geotechnical 
investigations, hydrologic analysis, hydraulic analysis, utility 
engineering, traffic studies, financial plans, revenue estimates, 
hazardous materials assessments, general estimates of the types and 
quantities of materials, and other work needed to establish parameters 
for the final design. Prior to completion of the NEPA review process, 
any such preliminary engineering and other activities and analyses must 
not materially affect the objective consideration of alternatives in the 
NEPA review process.
    Prequalification means the contracting agency's process for 
determining whether a firm is fundamentally qualified to compete for a 
certain project or class of projects. The prequalification process may 
be based on financial, management and other types of qualitative data. 
Prequalification should be distinguished from short listing.
    Price proposal means the price submitted by the offeror to provide 
the required design and construction services.
    Price reasonableness means the determination that the price of the 
work for any project or series of projects is not excessive and is a 
fair and reasonable price for the services to be performed.

[[Page 215]]

    Proposal modification means a change made to a proposal before the 
solicitation closing date and time, or made in response to an amendment, 
or made to correct a mistake at any time before award.
    Proposal revision means a change to a proposal made after the 
solicitation closing date, at the request of or as allowed by a 
contracting officer, as the result of negotiations.
    Public-private agreement means an agreement between a public agency 
and a private party involving design and construction of transportation 
improvements by the private party to be paid for in whole or in part by 
Federal-aid highway funds. The agreement may also provide for project 
financing, at-risk equity investment, operations, or maintenance of the 
project.
    Qualified project means any design-build project (including 
intermodal projects) funded under Title 23, United States Code, which 
meets the requirements of this part and for which the contracting agency 
deems to be appropriate on the basis of project delivery time, cost, 
construction schedule, or quality.
    Request for Proposals (RFP) means the document that describes the 
procurement process, forms the basis for the final proposals and may 
potentially become an element in the contract.
    Request for Qualification (RFQ) means the document issued by the 
owner in Phase I of the two-phased selection process. It typically 
describes the project in enough detail to let potential offerors 
determine if they wish to compete and forms the basis for requesting 
qualifications submissions from which the most highly qualified offerors 
can be identified.
    Short listing means the narrowing of the field of offerors through 
the selection of the most qualified offerors who have responded to an 
RFQ.
    Single-phase selection process means a procurement process where 
price and/or technical proposals are submitted in response to an RFP. 
Short listing is not used.
    Solicitation means a public notification of an owner's need for 
information, qualifications, or proposals related to identified 
services.
    Stipend means a monetary amount sometimes paid to unsuccessful 
offerors.
    Technical proposal means that portion of a design-build proposal 
which contains design solutions and other qualitative factors that are 
provided in response to the RFP document.
    Tradeoff means an analysis technique involving a comparison of price 
and non-price factors to determine the best value when considering the 
selection of other than the lowest priced proposal.
    Two-phase selection process means a procurement process in which the 
first phase consists of short listing (based on qualifications submitted 
in response to an RFQ) and the second phase consists of the submission 
of price and technical proposals in response to an RFP.
    Weakness means a flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of 
unsuccessful contract performance. A significant weakness in the 
proposal is a flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful 
contract performance.
    Weighted criteria process means a form of best value selection in 
which maximum point values are pre-established for qualitative and price 
components, and award is based upon high total points earned by the 
offerors.

[67 FR 75926, Dec. 10, 2002, as amended at 72 FR 45336, Aug. 14, 2007]


<R05>
Sec. 636.104  Does this part apply to all Federal-aid design-build projects?

    The provisions of this part apply to all Federal-aid design-build 
projects within the highway right-of-way or linked to a Federal-aid 
highway project (i.e., the project would not exist without another 
Federal-aid highway project). Projects that are not located within the 
highway right-of-way, and not linked to a Federal-aid highway project 
may utilize State-approved procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 636.105  Is the FHWA requiring the use of design-build?

    No, the FHWA is neither requiring nor promoting the use of the 
design-build contracting method. The design-build contracting technique 
is optional.

[[Page 216]]


<R05>
Sec. 636.106  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 636.107  May contracting agencies use geographic preference 

in Federal-aid design-build or public-private partnership projects?

    No. Contracting agencies must not use geographic preferences 
(including contractual provisions, preferences or incentives for hiring, 
contracting, proposing, or bidding) on Federal-aid highway projects, 
even though the contracting agency may be subject to statutorily or 
administratively imposed in-State or local geographical preferences in 
the evaluation and award of such projects.

[72 FR 45336, Aug. 14, 2007]


<R05>
Sec. 636.108  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 636.109  How does the NEPA process relate to the design-build procurement process?

    The purpose of this section is to ensure that there is an objective 
NEPA process, that public officials and citizens have the necessary 
environmental impact information for federally funded actions before 
actions are taken, and that design-build proposers do not assume an 
unnecessary amount of risk in the event the NEPA process results in a 
significant change in the proposal, and that the amount payable by the 
contracting agency to the design-builder does not include significant 
contingency as the result of risk placed on the design-builder 
associated with significant changes in the project definition arising 
out of the NEPA process. Therefore, with respect to the design-build 
procurement process:
    (a) The contracting agency may:
    (1) Issue an RFQ prior to the conclusion of the NEPA process as long 
as the RFQ informs proposers of the general status of NEPA review;
    (2) Issue an RFP after the conclusion of the NEPA process;
    (3) Issue an RFP prior to the conclusion of the NEPA process as long 
as the RFP informs proposers of the general status of the NEPA process 
and that no commitment will be made as to any alternative under 
evaluation in the NEPA process, including the no-build alternative;
    (4) Proceed with the award of a design-build contract prior to the 
conclusion of the NEPA process;
    (5) Issue notice to proceed with preliminary design pursuant to a 
design-build contract that has been awarded prior to the completion of 
the NEPA process; and
    (6) Allow a design-builder to proceed with final design and 
construction for any projects, or portions thereof, for which the NEPA 
process has been completed.
    (b) If the contracting agency proceeds to award a design-build 
contract prior to the conclusion of the NEPA process, then:
    (1) The contracting agency may permit the design-builder to proceed 
with preliminary design;
    (2) The contracting agency may permit any design and engineering 
activities to be undertaken for the purposes of defining the project 
alternatives and completing the NEPA alternatives analysis and review 
process; complying with other related environmental laws and 
regulations; supporting agency coordination, public involvement, permit 
applications, or development of mitigation plans; or developing the 
design of the preferred alternative to a higher level of detail when the 
lead agencies agree that it is warranted in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 
139(f)(4)(D);
    (3) The design-build contract must include appropriate provisions 
preventing the design-builder from proceeding with final design 
activities and physical construction prior to the completion of the NEPA 
process (contract hold points or another method of issuing multi-step 
approvals must be used);
    (4) The design-build contract must include appropriate provisions 
ensuring that no commitments are made to any alternative being evaluated 
in the NEPA process and that the comparative merits of all alternatives 
presented in the NEPA document, including the no-build alternative, will 
be evaluated and fairly considered;
    (5) The design-build contract must include appropriate provisions 
ensuring that all environmental and mitigation measures identified in 
the NEPA document will be implemented;

[[Page 217]]

    (6) The design-builder must not prepare the NEPA document or have 
any decisionmaking responsibility with respect to the NEPA process;
    (7) Any consultants who prepare the NEPA document must be selected 
by and subject to the exclusive direction and control of the contracting 
agency;
    (8) The design-builder may be requested to provide information about 
the project and possible mitigation actions, and its work product may be 
considered in the NEPA analysis and included in the record; and
    (9) The design-build contract must include termination provisions in 
the event that the no-build alternative is selected.
    (c) The contracting agency must receive prior FHWA concurrence 
before issuing the RFP, awarding a design-build contract and proceeding 
with preliminary design work under the design-build contract. Should the 
contracting agency proceed with any of the activities specified in this 
section before the completion of the NEPA process (with the exception of 
preliminary design, as provided in paragraph (d) of this section), the 
FHWA's concurrence merely constitutes the FHWA approval that any such 
activities complies with Federal requirements and does not constitute 
project authorization or obligate Federal funds.
    (d) The FHWA's authorization and obligation of preliminary 
engineering and other preconstruction funds prior to the completion of 
the NEPA process is limited to preliminary design and such additional 
activities as may be necessary to complete the NEPA process. After the 
completion of the NEPA process, the FHWA may issue an authorization to 
proceed with final design and construction and obligate Federal funds 
for such purposes.

<R05>
Sec. 636.110  What procedures may be used for solicitations and receipt of proposals?

    You may use your own procedures for the solicitation and receipt of 
proposals and information including the following:
    (a) Exchanges with industry before receipt of proposals;
    (b) RFQ, RFP and contract format;
    (c) Solicitation schedules;
    (d) Lists of forms, documents, exhibits, and other attachments;
    (e) Representations and instructions;
    (f) Advertisement and amendments;
    (g) Handling proposals and information; and
    (h) Submission, modification, revisions and withdrawal of proposals.


<R05>
Sec. 636.111  Can oral presentations be used during the procurement process?

    (a) Yes, the use of oral presentations as a substitute for portions 
of a written proposal can be effective in streamlining the source 
selection process. Oral presentations may occur at any time in the 
acquisition process, however, you must comply with the appropriate State 
procurement integrity standards.
    (b) Oral presentations may substitute for, or augment, written 
information. You must maintain a record of oral presentations to 
document what information you relied upon in making the source selection 
decision. You may decide the appropriate method and level of detail for 
the record (e.g., videotaping, audio tape recording, written record, 
contracting agency notes, copies of offeror briefing slides or 
presentation notes). A copy of the record should be placed in the 
contract file and may be provided to offerors upon request.


<R05>
Sec. 636.112  May stipends be used?

    At your discretion, you may elect to pay a stipend to unsuccessful 
offerors who have submitted responsive proposals. The decision to do so 
should be based on your analysis of the estimated proposal development 
costs and the anticipated degree of competition during the procurement 
process.


<R05>
Sec. 636.113  Is the stipend amount eligible for Federal participation?

    (a) Yes, stipends are eligible for Federal-aid participation. 
Stipends are recommended on large projects where there is substantial 
opportunity for innovation and the cost of submitting a proposal is 
significant. On such projects, stipends are used to:
    (1) Encourage competition;

    (2) Compensate unsuccessful offerors for a portion of their costs 
(usually one-third to one-half of the estimated proposal development 
cost); and
    (3) Ensure that smaller companies are not put at a competitive 
disadvantage.
    (b) Unless prohibited by State law, you may retain the right to use 
ideas from unsuccessful offerors if they accept stipends. If stipends 
are used, the RFP should describe the process for distributing the 
stipend to qualifying offerors. The acceptance of any stipend must be 
optional on the part of the unsuccessful offeror to the design-build 
proposal.
    (c) If you intend to incorporate the ideas from unsuccessful 
offerors into the same contract on which they unsuccessfully submitted a 
proposal, you must clearly provide notice of your intent to do so in the 
RFP.

[67 FR 75926, Dec. 10, 2002, as amended at 73 FR 77502, Dec. 19, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 636.114  What factors should be considered in risk allocation?

    (a) You may consider, identify, and allocate the risks in the RFP 
document and define these risks in the contract. Risk should be 
allocated with consideration given to the party who is in the best 
position to manage and control a given risk or the impact of a given 
risk.
    (b) Risk allocation will vary according to the type of project and 
location, however, the following factors should be considered:
    (1) Governmental risks, including the potential for delays, 
modifications, withdrawal, scope changes, or additions that result from 
multi-level Federal, State, and local participation and sponsorship;
    (2) Regulatory compliance risks, including environmental and third-
party issues, such as permitting, railroad, and utility company risks;
    (3) Construction phase risks, including differing site conditions, 
traffic control, interim drainage, public access, weather issues, and 
schedule;
    (4) Post-construction risks, including public liability and meeting 
stipulated performance standards; and
    (5) Right-of-way risks including acquisition costs, appraisals, 
relocation delays, condemnation proceedings, including court costs and 
others.


<R05>
Sec. 636.115  May I meet with industry to gather information concerning the appropriate risk allocation strategies?

    (a) Yes, information exchange at an early project stage is 
encouraged if it facilitates your understanding of the capabilities of 
potential offerors. However, any exchange of information must be 
consistent with State procurement integrity requirements. Interested 
parties include potential offerors, end users, acquisition and 
supporting personnel, and others involved in the conduct or outcome of 
the acquisition.
    (b) The purpose of exchanging information is to improve the 
understanding of your requirements and industry capabilities, thereby 
allowing potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy 
your requirements, and enhancing your ability to obtain quality supplies 
and services, including construction, at reasonable prices, and increase 
efficiency in proposal preparation, proposal evaluation, negotiation, 
and contract award.
    (c) An early exchange of information can identify and resolve 
concerns regarding the acquisition strategy, including proposed contract 
type, terms and conditions, and acquisition planning schedules. This 
also includes the feasibility of the requirement, including performance 
requirements, statements of work, and data requirements; the suitability 
of the proposal instructions and evaluation criteria, including the 
approach for assessing past performance information; the availability of 
reference documents; and any other industry concerns or questions. Some 
techniques to promote early exchanges of information are as follows:
    (1) Industry or small business conferences;
    (2) Public hearings;
    (3) Market research;
    (4) One-on-one meetings with potential offerors (any meetings that 
are substantially involved with potential contract terms and conditions 
should include the contracting officer; also see paragraph (e) of this 
section regarding restrictions on disclosure of information);

[[Page 219]]

    (5) Presolicitation notices;
    (6) Draft RFPs;
    (7) Request for Information (RFI) ;
    (8) Presolicitation or preproposal conferences; and
    (9) Site visits.
    (d) RFIs may be used when you do not intend to award a contract, but 
want to obtain price, delivery, other market information, or 
capabilities for planning purposes. Responses to these notices are not 
offers and cannot be accepted to form a binding contract. There is no 
required format for an RFI.
    (e) When specific information about a proposed acquisition that 
would be necessary for the preparation of proposals is disclosed to one 
or more potential offerors, that information shall be made available to 
all potential offerors as soon as practicable, but no later than the 
next general release of information, in order to avoid creating an 
unfair competitive advantage. Information provided to a particular 
offeror in response to that offeror's request must not be disclosed if 
doing so would reveal the potential offeror's confidential business 
strategy. When a presolicitation or preproposal conference is conducted, 
materials distributed at the conference should be made available to all 
potential offerors, upon request.


<R05>
Sec. 636.116  What organizational conflict of interest requirements apply to design-build projects?

    (a) State statutes or policies concerning organizational conflict of 
interest should be specified or referenced in the design-build RFQ or 
RFP document as well as any contract for engineering services, 
inspection or technical support in the administration of the design-
build contract. All design-build solicitations should address the 
following situations as appropriate:
    (1) Consultants and/or sub-consultants who assist the owner in the 
preparation of a RFP document will not be allowed to participate as an 
offeror or join a team submitting a proposal in response to the RFP. 
However, a contracting agency may determine there is not an 
organizational conflict of interest for a consultant or sub-consultant 
where:
    (i) The role of the consultant or sub-consultant was limited to 
provision of preliminary design, reports, or similar ``low-level'' 
documents that will be incorporated into the RFP, and did not include 
assistance in development of instructions to offerors or evaluation 
criteria, or
    (ii) Where all documents and reports delivered to the agency by the 
consultant or sub-consultant are made available to all offerors.
    (2) All solicitations for design-build contracts, including related 
contracts for inspection, administration or auditing services, must 
include a provision which:
    (i) Directs offerors attention to this subpart;
    (ii) States the nature of the potential conflict as seen by the 
owner;
    (iii) States the nature of the proposed restraint or restrictions 
(and duration) upon future contracting activities, if appropriate;
    (iv) Depending on the nature of the acquisition, states whether or 
not the terms of any proposed clause and the application of this subpart 
to the contract are subject to negotiation; and
    (v) Requires offerors to provide information concerning potential 
organizational conflicts of interest in their proposals. The apparent 
successful offerors must disclose all relevant facts concerning any 
past, present or currently planned interests which may present an 
organizational conflict of interest. Such firms must state how their 
interests, or those of their chief executives, directors, key project 
personnel, or any proposed consultant, contractor or subcontractor may 
result, or could be viewed as, an organizational conflict of interest. 
The information may be in the form of a disclosure statement or a 
certification.
    (3) Based upon a review of the information submitted, the owner 
should make a written determination of whether the offeror's interests 
create an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest and 
identify any actions that must be taken to avoid, neutralize, or 
mitigate such conflict. The owner should award the contract to the 
apparent successful offeror unless an organizational conflict of 
interest is

[[Page 220]]

determined to exist that cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated.
    (b) The organizational conflict of interest provisions in this 
subpart provide minimum standards for STDs to identify, mitigate or 
eliminate apparent or actual organizational conflicts of interest. To 
the extent that State-developed organizational conflict of interest 
standards are more stringent than that contained in this subpart, the 
State standards prevail.
    (c) If the NEPA process has been completed prior to issuing the RFP, 
the contracting agency may allow a consultant or subconsultant who 
prepared the NEPA document to submit a proposal in response to the RFP.
    (d) If the NEPA process has not been completed prior to issuing the 
RFP, the contracting agency may allow a subconsultant to the preparer of 
the NEPA document to participate as an offeror or join a team submitting 
a proposal in response to the RFP only if the contracting agency 
releases such subconsultant from further responsibilities with respect 
to the preparation of the NEPA document.

[67 FR 75926, Dec. 10, 2002, as amended at 72 FR 45337, Aug. 14, 2007]


<R05>
Sec. 636.117  What conflict of interest standards apply to individuals 

who serve as selection team members for the owner?

    State laws and procedures governing improper business practices and 
personal conflicts of interest will apply to the owner's selection team 
members. In the absence of such State provisions, the requirements of 48 
CFR Part 3, Improper Business Practices and Personal Conflicts of 
Interest, will apply to selection team members.


<R05>
Sec. 636.118  Is team switching allowed after contract award?

    Where the offeror's qualifications are a major factor in the 
selection of the successful design-builder, team member switching 
(adding or switching team members) is discouraged after contract award. 
However, the owner may use its discretion in reviewing team changes or 
team enhancement requests on a case-by-case basis. Specific project 
rules related to changes in team members or changes in personnel within 
teams should be explicitly stated by the STD in all project 
solicitations.


<R05>
Sec. 636.119  How does this part apply to a project developed under a public-private partnership?

    (a) In order for a project being developed under a public-private 
agreement to be eligible for Federal-aid funding (including traditional 
Federal-aid funds, direct loans, loan guarantees, lines of credit, or 
some other form of credit assistance), the contracting agency must have 
awarded the contract to the public-private entity through a competitive 
process that complies with applicable State and local laws.
    (b) If a contracting agency wishes to utilize traditional Federal-
aid funds in a project under a public-private agreement, the 
applicability of Federal-aid procurement procedures will depend on the 
nature of the public-private agreement.
    (1) If the public-private agreement establishes price, then all 
subsequent contracts executed by the developer are considered to be 
subcontracts and are not subject to Federal-aid procurement 
requirements.
    (2) If the public-private agreement does not establish price, the 
developer is considered to be an agent of the owner, and the developer 
must follow the appropriate Federal-aid procurement requirements (23 CFR 
part 172 for engineering service contracts, 23 CFR part 635 for 
construction contracts and the requirements of this part for design-
build contracts) for all prime contracts (not subcontracts).
    (c) The STD must ensure such public-private projects comply with all 
non-procurement requirements of 23 U. S. Code, regardless of the form of 
the FHWA funding (traditional Federal-aid funding or credit assistance). 
This includes compliance with all FHWA policies such as environmental 
and right-of-way requirements and compliance with such construction 
contracting requirements as Buy America, Davis-

[[Page 221]]

Bacon minimum wage rate requirements, for federally funded construction 
or design-build contracts under the public-private agreement.

             Subpart B_Selection Procedures, Award Criteria


<R05>
Sec. 636.201  What selection procedures and award criteria may be used?

    You should consider using two-phase selection procedures for all 
design-build projects. However, if you do not believe two-phase 
selection procedures are appropriate for your project (based on the 
criteria in Sec. 636.202), you may use a single phase selection 
procedure or the modified-design-build contracting method. The following 
procedures are available:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                  Criteria for using

------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 636.202  When are two-phase design-build selection procedures appropriate?

    You may consider the following criteria in deciding whether two-
phase selection procedures are appropriate. A negative response may 
indicate that two-phase selection procedures are not appropriate.
    (a) Are three or more offers anticipated?
    (b) Will offerors be expected to perform substantial design work 
before developing price proposals?
    (c) Will offerors incur a substantial expense in preparing 
proposals?
    (d) Have you identified and analyzed other contributing factors, 
including:
    (1) The extent to which you have defined the project requirements?
    (2) The time constraints for delivery of the project?
    (3) The capability and experience of potential contractors?
    (4) Your capability to manage the two-phase selection process?
    (5) Other criteria that you may consider appropriate?


<R05>
Sec. 636.203  What are the elements of two-phase selection procedures for competitive proposals?

    The first phase consists of short listing based on a RFQ. The second 
phase consists of the receipt and evaluation of price and technical 
proposals in response to a RFP.


<R05>
Sec. 636.204  What items may be included in a phase-one solicitation?

    You may consider including the following items in any phase-one 
solicitation:
    (a) The scope of work;
    (b) The phase-one evaluation factors and their relative weights, 
including:
    (1) Technical approach (but not detailed design or technical 
information);
    (2) Technical qualifications, such as--
    (i) Specialized experience and technical competence;
    (ii) Capability to perform (including key personnel); and
    (iii) Past performance of the members of the offeror's team 
(including the architect-engineer and construction members);
    (3) Other appropriate factors (excluding cost or price related 
factors, which are not permitted in phase-one);
    (c) Phase-two evaluation factors; and
    (d) A statement of the maximum number of offerors that will be short 
listed to submit phase-two proposals.


<R05>
Sec. 636.205  Can past performance be used as an evaluation criteria?

    (a) Yes, past performance information is one indicator of an 
offeror's ability to perform the contract successfully. Past performance 
information may be used as an evaluation criteria in either phase-one or 
phase-two solicitations. If you elect to use past performance criteria, 
the currency and relevance of the information, source of the 
information, context of the data,

[[Page 222]]

and general trends in contractor's performance may be considered.
    (b) Describe your approach for evaluating past performance in the 
solicitation, including your policy for evaluating offerors with no 
relevant performance history. You should provide offerors an opportunity 
to identify past or current contracts (including Federal, State, and 
local government and private) for efforts similar to the current 
solicitation.
    (c) If you elect to request past performance information, the 
solicitation should also authorize offerors to provide information on 
problems encountered on the identified contracts and the offeror's 
corrective actions. You may consider this information, as well as 
information obtained from any other sources, when evaluating the 
offeror's past performance. You may use your discretion in determining 
the relevance of similar past performance information.
    (d) The evaluation should take into account past performance 
information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have 
relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or 
critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to 
the current acquisition.


<R05>
Sec. 636.206  How do I evaluate offerors who do not have a record of relevant past performance?

    In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past 
performance or for whom information on past performance is not 
available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on 
past performance.


<R05>
Sec. 636.207  Is there a limit on short listed firms?

    Normally, three to five firms are short listed, however, the maximum 
number specified shall not exceed five unless you determine, for that 
particular solicitation, that a number greater than five is in your 
interest and is consistent with the purposes and objectives of two-phase 
design-build contracting.


<R05>
Sec. 636.208  May I use my existing prequalification procedures with design-build contracts?

    Yes, you may use your existing prequalification procedures for 
either construction or engineering design firms as a supplement to the 
procedures in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 636.209  What items must be included in a phase-two solicitation?

    (a) You must include the requirements for technical proposals and 
price proposals in the phase-two solicitation. All factors and 
significant subfactors that will affect contract award and their 
relative importance must be stated clearly in the solicitation. Use your 
own procedures for the solicitation as long as it complies the 
requirements of this part.
    (b) At your discretion, you may allow proposers to submit alternate 
technical concepts in their proposals as long as these alternate 
concepts do not conflict with criteria agreed upon in the environmental 
decision making process. Alternate technical concept proposals may 
supplement, but not substitute for base proposals that respond to the 
RFP requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 636.210  What requirements apply to projects which use the modified design-build procedure?

    (a) Modified design-build selection procedures (lowest price 
technically acceptable source selection process) may be used for any 
project.
    (b) The solicitation must clearly state the following:
    (1) The identification of evaluation factors and significant 
subfactors that establish the requirements of acceptability.
    (2) That award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated 
price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for 
non-cost factors.
    (c) The contracting agency may forgo a short listing process and 
advertise for the receipt of proposals from all responsible offerors. 
The contract is then awarded to the lowest responsive bidder.
    (d) Tradeoffs are not permitted, however, you may incorporate cost-
plus-time bidding procedures (A+B bidding),

[[Page 223]]

lane rental, or other cost-based provisions in such contracts.
    (e) Proposals are evaluated for acceptability but not ranked using 
the non-cost/price factors.
    (f) Exchanges may occur (see subpart D of this part).


<R05>
Sec. 636.211  When and how should tradeoffs be used?

    (a) At your discretion, you may consider the tradeoff technique when 
it is desirable to award to other than the lowest priced offeror or 
other than the highest technically rated offeror.
    (b) If you use a tradeoff technique, the following apply:
    (1) All evaluation factors and significant subfactors that will 
affect contract award and their relative importance must be clearly 
stated in the solicitation; and
    (2) The solicitation must also state, at a minimum, whether all 
evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are--
    (i) Significantly more important than cost or price; or
    (ii) Approximately equal to cost or price; or
    (iii) Significantly less important than cost or price.

<R05>
Sec. 636.212  To what extent must tradeoff decisions be documented?

    When tradeoffs are performed, the source selection records must 
include the following:
    (a) An assessment of each offeror's ability to accomplish the 
technical requirements; and
    (b) A summary, matrix, or quantitative ranking, along with 
appropriate supporting narrative, of each technical proposal using the 
evaluation factors.


<R04>
                  Subpart C_Proposal Evaluation Factors


<R05>
Sec. 636.301  How should proposal evaluation factors be selected?

    (a) The proposal evaluation factors and significant subfactors 
should be tailored to the acquisition.
    (b) Evaluation factors and significant subfactors should:
    (1) Represent the key areas of importance and emphasis to be 
considered in the source selection decision; and
    (2) Support meaningful comparison and discrimination between and 
among competing proposals.


<R05>
Sec. 636.302  Are there any limitations on the selection and use of proposal evaluation factors?

    (a) The selection of the evaluation factors, significant subfactors 
and their relative importance are within your broad discretion subject 
to the following requirements:
    (1) You must evaluate price in every source selection where 
construction is a significant component of the scope of work. However, 
where the contracting agency elects to release the final RFP and award 
the design-build contract before the conclusion of the NEPA process (see 
Sec. 636.109), then the following requirements apply:
    (i) It is not necessary to evaluate the total contract price;
    (ii) Price must be considered to the extent the contract requires 
the contracting agency to make any payments to the design-builder for 
any work performed prior to the completion of the NEPA process and the 
contracting agency wishes to use Federal-aid highway funds for those 
activities;
    (iii) The evaluation of proposals and award of the contract may be 
based on qualitative considerations;
    (iv) If the contracting agency wishes to use Federal-aid highway 
funds for final design and construction, the subsequent approval of 
final design and construction activities will be contingent upon a 
finding of price reasonableness by the contracting agency;
    (v) The determination of price reasonableness for any design-build 
project funded with Federal-aid highway funds shall be based on at least 
one of the following methods:
    (A) Compliance with the applicable procurement requirements for part 
172, 635, or 636, where the contractor providing the final design or 
construction services, or both, is a person or entity other than the 
design-builder;
    (B) A negotiated price determined on an open-book basis by both the 
design-builder and contracting agency; or

[[Page 224]]

    (C) An independent estimate by the contracting agency based on the 
price of similar work;
    (vi) The contracting agency's finding of price reasonableness is 
subject to FHWA concurrence.
    (2) You must evaluate the quality of the product or service through 
consideration of one or more non-price evaluation factors. These factors 
may include (but are not limited to) such criteria as:
    (i) Compliance with solicitation requirements;
    (ii) Completion schedule (contractual incentives and disincentives 
for early completion may be used where appropriate); or
    (iii) Technical solutions.
    (3) At your discretion, you may evaluate past performance, technical 
experience and management experience (subject to Sec. 636.303(b)).
    (b) All factors and significant subfactors that will affect contract 
award and their relative importance must be stated clearly in the 
solicitation.

[67 FR 75926, Dec. 10, 2002, as amended at 72 FR 45338, Aug. 14, 2007]


<R05>
Sec. 636.303  May pre-qualification standards be used as proposal evaluation criteria in the RFP?

    (a) If you use a prequalification procedure or a two-phase selection 
procedure to develop a short list of qualified offerors, then pre-
qualification criteria should not be included as proposal evaluation 
criteria.
    (b) The proposal evaluation criteria should be limited to the 
quality, quantity, value and timeliness of the product or service being 
proposed. However, there may be circumstances where it is appropriate to 
include prequalification standards as proposal evaluation criteria. Such 
instances include situations where:
    (1) The scope of work involves very specialized technical expertise 
or specialized financial qualifications; or
    (2) Where prequalification procedures or two-phase selection 
procedures are not used (short listing is not performed).


<R05>
Sec. 636.304  What process may be used to rate and score proposals?

    (a) Proposal evaluation is an assessment of the offeror's proposal 
and ability to perform the prospective contract successfully. You must 
evaluate proposals solely on the factors and subfactors specified in the 
solicitation.
    (b) You may conduct evaluations using any rating method or 
combination of methods including color or adjectival ratings, numerical 
weights, and ordinal rankings. The relative strengths, deficiencies, 
significant weaknesses, and risks supporting proposal evaluation must be 
documented in the contract file.


<R05>
Sec. 636.305  Can price information be provided to analysts who are reviewing technical proposals?

    Normally, technical and price proposals are reviewed independently 
by separate evaluation teams. However, there may be occasions where the 
same experts needed to review the technical proposals are also needed in 
the review of the price proposals. This may occur where a limited amount 
of technical expertise is available to review proposals. Price 
information may be provided to such technical experts in accordance with 
your procedures.


<R04>
                           Subpart D_Exchanges


<R05>
Sec. 636.401  What types of information exchange may take place prior to the release of the RFP document?

    Verbal or written information exchanges (such as in the first-phase 
of a two-phase selection procedure) must be consistent with State and/or 
local procurement integrity requirements. See Sec. 636.115(a) for 
additional details.


<R05>
Sec. 636.402  What types of information exchange may take place after the release of the RFP document?

    Certain types of information exchange may be desirable at different 
points after the release of the RFP document. The following table 
summarizes the types of communications that will be discussed in this 
subpart. These communication methods are optional.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 636.403  What information may be exchanged with a clarification?

    (a) You may wish to clarify any aspect of proposals which would 
enhance your understanding of an offeror's proposal. This includes such 
information as an offeror's past performance or information regarding 
adverse past performance to which the offeror has not previously had an 
opportunity to respond. Clarification exchanges are discretionary. They 
do not have to be held with any specific number of offerors and do not 
have to address specific issues.
    (b) You may wish to clarify and revise the RFP document through an 
addenda process in response to questions from potential offerors.


<R05>
Sec. 636.404  Can a competitive range be used to limit competition?

    If the solicitation notifies offerors that the competitive range can 
be limited for purposes of efficiency, you may limit the number of 
proposals to the greatest number that will permit an efficient 
competition. However, you must provide written notice to any offeror 
whose proposal is no longer considered to be included in the competitive 
range. Offerors excluded or otherwise eliminated from the competitive 
range may request a debriefing. Debriefings may be conducted in 
accordance with your procedures as long as you comply with Sec. 
636.514.


<R05>
Sec. 636.405  After developing a short list, can I still establish a competitive range?

    Yes, if you have developed a short list of firms, you may still 
establish a competitive range. The short list is based on qualifications 
criteria. The competitive range is based on the rating of technical and 
price proposals.


<R05>
Sec. 636.406  Are communications allowed prior to establishing the competitive range?

    Yes, prior to establishing the competitive range, you may conduct 
communications to:
    (a) Enhance your understanding of proposals;
    (b) Allow reasonable interpretation of the proposal; or
    (c) Facilitate your evaluation process.


<R05>
Sec. 636.407  Am I limited in holding communications with certain firms?

    Yes, if you establish a competitive range, you must do the 
following:
    (a) Hold communications with offerors whose past performance 
information is the determining factor preventing them from being placed 
within the competitive range;
    (b) Address adverse past performance information to which an offeror 
has not had a prior opportunity to respond; and
    (c) Hold communications only with those offerors whose exclusion 
from, or

[[Page 226]]

inclusion in, the competitive range is uncertain.


<R05>
Sec. 636.408  Can communications be used to cure proposal deficiencies?

    (a) No, communications must not be used to:
    (1) Cure proposal deficiencies or material omissions;
    (2) Materially alter the technical or cost elements of the proposal; 
and/or
    (3) Otherwise revise the proposal.
    (b) Communications may be considered in rating proposals for the 
purpose of establishing the competitive range.


<R05>
Sec. 636.409  Can offerors revise their proposals during communications?

    (a) No, communications shall not provide an opportunity for an 
offeror to revise its proposal, but may address the following:
    (1) Ambiguities in the proposal or other concerns (e.g., perceived 
deficiencies, weaknesses, errors, omissions, or mistakes); and
    (2) Information relating to relevant past performance.
    (b) Communications must address adverse past performance information 
to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to comment.


<R04>
     Subpart E_Discussions, Proposal Revisions and Source Selection


<R05>
Sec. 636.501  What issues may be addressed in discussions?

    In a competitive acquisition, discussions may include bargaining. 
The term bargaining may include: persuasion, alteration of assumptions 
and positions, give-and-take, and may apply to price, schedule, 
technical requirements, type of contract, or other terms of a proposed 
contract.


<R05>
Sec. 636.502  Why should I use discussions?

    You should use discussions to maximize your ability to obtain the 
best value, based on the requirements and the evaluation factors set 
forth in the solicitation.


<R05>
Sec. 636.503  Must I notify offerors of my intent to use/not use discussions?

    Yes, in competitive acquisitions, the solicitation must notify 
offerors of your intent. You should either:
    (a) Notify offerors that discussions may or may not be held 
depending on the quality of the proposals received (except 
clarifications may be used as described in Sec. 636.401). Therefore, 
the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms 
from a cost or price and technical standpoint; or
    (b) Notify offerors of your intent to establish a competitive range 
and hold discussions.


<R05>
Sec. 636.504  If the solicitation indicated my intent was to award contract 

without discussions, but circumstances change, may I still hold discussions?

    Yes, you may still elect to hold discussions when circumstances 
dictate, as long as the rationale for doing so is documented in the 
contract file. Such circumstances might include situations where all 
proposals received have deficiencies, when fair and reasonable prices 
are not offered, or when the cost or price offered is not affordable.


<R05>
Sec. 636.505  Must a contracting agency establish a competitive range 

if it intends to have discussions with offerors?

    Yes, if discussions are held, they must be conducted with all 
offerors in the competitive range. If you wish to hold discussions and 
do not formally establish a competitive range, then you must hold 
discussions with all responsive offerors.


<R05>
Sec. 636.506  What issues must be covered in discussions?

    (a) Discussions should be tailored to each offeror's proposal. 
Discussions must cover significant weaknesses, deficiencies, and other 
aspects of a proposal (such as cost or price, technical approach, past 
performance, and terms and conditions) that could be altered or 
explained to enhance materially the proposal's potential for award. You 
may use your judgment in setting limits for the scope and extent of 
discussions.

[[Page 227]]

    (b) In situations where the solicitation stated that evaluation 
credit would be given for technical solutions exceeding any mandatory 
minimums, you may hold discussions regarding increased performance 
beyond any mandatory minimums, and you may suggest to offerors that have 
exceeded any mandatory minimums (in ways that are not integral to the 
design), that their proposals would be more competitive if the excesses 
were removed and the offered price decreased.


<R05>
Sec. 636.507  What subjects are prohibited in discussions, communications 

and clarifications with offerors?

    You may not engage in conduct that:
    (a) Favors one offeror over another;
    (b) Reveals an offeror's technical solution, including unique 
technology, innovative and unique uses of commercial items, or any 
information that would compromise an offeror's intellectual property to 
another offeror;
    (c) Reveals an offerors price without that offeror's permission;
    (d) Reveals the names of individuals providing reference information 
about an offeror's past performance; or
    (e) Knowingly furnish source selection information which could be in 
violation of State procurement integrity standards.


<R05>
Sec. 636.508  Can price or cost be an issue in discussions?

    You may inform an offeror that its price is considered to be too 
high, or too low, and reveal the results of the analysis supporting that 
conclusion. At your discretion, you may indicate to all offerors your 
estimated cost for the project.


<R05>
Sec. 636.509  Can offerors revise their proposals as a result of discussions?

    (a) Yes, you may request or allow proposal revisions to clarify and 
document understandings reached during discussions. At the conclusion of 
discussions, each offeror shall be given an opportunity to submit a 
final proposal revision.
    (b) You must establish a common cut-off date only for receipt of 
final proposal revisions. Requests for final proposal revisions shall 
advise offerors that the final proposal revisions shall be in writing 
and that the contracting agency intends to make award without obtaining 
further revisions.


<R05>
Sec. 636.510  Can the competitive range be further defined once discussions have begun?

    Yes, you may further narrow the competitive range if an offeror 
originally in the competitive range is no longer considered to be among 
the most highly rated offerors being considered for award. That offeror 
may be eliminated from the competitive range whether or not all material 
aspects of the proposal have been discussed, or whether or not the 
offeror has been afforded an opportunity to submit a proposal revision. 
You must provide an offeror excluded from the competitive range with a 
written determination and notice that proposal revisions will not be 
considered.


<R05>
Sec. 636.511  Can there be more than one round of discussions?

    Yes, but only at the conclusion of discussions will the offerors be 
requested to submit a final proposal revision, also called best and 
final offer (BAFO). Thus, regardless of the length or number of 
discussions, there will be only one request for a revised proposal 
(i.e., only one BAFO).


<R05>
Sec. 636.512  What is the basis for the source selection decision?

    (a) You must base the source selection decision on a comparative 
assessment of proposals against all selection criteria in the 
solicitation. While you may use reports and analyses prepared by others, 
the source selection decision shall represent your independent judgment.
    (b) The source selection decision shall be documented, and the 
documentation shall include the rationale for any business judgments and 
tradeoffs made or relied on, including benefits associated with 
additional costs. Although the rationale for the selection decision must 
be documented, that documentation need not quantify the tradeoffs that 
led to the decision.

[[Page 228]]


<R05>
Sec. 636.513  Are limited negotiations allowed prior to contract execution?

    (a) Yes, after the source selection but prior to contract execution, 
you may conduct limited negotiations with the selected design-builder to 
clarify any remaining issues regarding scope, schedule, financing or any 
other information provided by that offeror. You must comply with the 
provisions of Sec. 636.507 in the exchange of this information.
    (b) Limited negotiations conducted under this section may include 
negotiations necessary to incorporate the ideas and concepts from 
unsuccessful offerors into the contract if a stipend is offered by the 
contracting agency and accepted by the unsuccessful offeror and if the 
requirements of section 636.113 are met.

[67 FR 75926, Dec. 10, 2002, as amended at 73 FR 77502, Dec. 19, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 636.514  How may I provide notifications and debriefings?

    You may provide pre-award or post-award notifications in accordance 
with State approved procedures. If an offeror requests a debriefing, you 
may provide pre-award or post-award debriefings in accordance with State 
approved procedures.

the lot has an equal probability of being chosen.
    Vendor. A supplier of project-produced material that is not the 
contractor.
    Verification sampling and testing. Sampling and testing performed to 
validate the quality of the product.


<R05>
Sec. 637.205  Policy.

    (a) Quality assurance program. Each STD shall develop a quality 
assurance program which will assure that the materials and workmanship 
incorporated into each Federal-aid highway construction project on the 
NHS are in conformity with the requirements of the approved plans and 
specifications, including approved changes. The program must meet the 
criteria in Sec. 637.207 and be approved by the FHWA.
    (b) STD capabilities. The STD shall maintain an adequate, qualified 
staff to administer its quality assurance program. The State shall also 
maintain a central laboratory. The State's central laboratory shall meet 
the requirements in Sec. 637.209(a)(2).
    (c) Independent assurance program. Independent assurance samples and 
tests or other procedures shall be performed by qualified sampling and 
testing personnel employed by the STD or its designated agent.
    (d) Verification sampling and testing. The verification sampling and 
testing are to be performed by qualified testing personnel employed by 
the STD or its designated agent, excluding the contractor and vendor.
    (e) Random samples. All samples used for quality control and 
verification sampling and testing shall be random samples.


<R05>
Sec. 637.207  Quality assurance program.

    (a) Each STD's quality assurance program shall provide for an 
acceptance program and an independent assurance (IA) program consisting 
of the following:
    (1) Acceptance program.
    (i) Each STD's acceptance program shall consist of the following:
    (A) Frequency guide schedules for verification sampling and testing 
which will give general guidance to personnel responsible for the 
program and allow adaptation to specific project conditions and needs.
    (B) Identification of the specific location in the construction or 
production operation at which verification sampling and testing is to be 
accomplished.
    (C) Identification of the specific attributes to be inspected which 
reflect the quality of the finished product.
    (ii) Quality control sampling and testing results may be used as 
part of the acceptance decision provided that:
    (A) The sampling and testing has been performed by qualified 
laboratories and qualified sampling and testing personnel.
    (B) The quality of the material has been validated by the 
verification sampling and testing. The verification testing shall be 
performed on samples that are taken independently of the quality control 
samples.
    (C) The quality control sampling and testing is evaluated by an IA 
program.
    (iii) If the results from the quality control sampling and testing 
are used in the acceptance program, the STD shall establish a dispute 
resolution system. The dispute resolution system shall address the 
resolution of discrepancies occurring between the verification sampling 
and testing and the quality control sampling and testing. The dispute 
resolution system may be administered entirely within the STD.
    (iv) In the case of a design-build project on the National Highway 
System, warranties may be used where appropriate. See 23 CFR 635.413(e) 
for specific requirements.
    (2) The IA program shall evaluate the qualified sampling and testing 
personnel and the testing equipment. The program shall cover sampling 
procedures, testing procedures, and testing equipment. Each IA program 
shall include a schedule of frequency for IA evaluation. The schedule 
may be established based on either a project basis or a system basis. 
The frequency can be based on either a unit of production or on a unit 
of time.
    (i) The testing equipment shall be evaluated by using one or more of 
the following: Calibration checks, split samples, or proficiency 
samples.

[[Page 230]]

    (ii) Testing personnel shall be evaluated by observations and split 
samples or proficiency samples.
    (iii) A prompt comparison and documentation shall be made of test 
results obtained by the tester being evaluated and the IA tester. The 
STD shall develop guidelines including tolerance limits for the 
comparison of test results.
    (iv) If the STD uses the system approach to the IA program, the STD 
shall provide an annual report to the FHWA summarizing the results of 
the IA program.
    (3) The preparation of a materials certification, conforming in 
substance to appendix A of this subpart, shall be submitted to the FHWA 
Division Administrator for each construction project which is subject to 
FHWA construction oversight activities.
    (b) In the case of a design-build project funded under title 23, 
U.S. Code, the STD's quality assurance program should consider the 
specific contractual needs of the design-build project. All provisions 
of paragraph (a) of this section are applicable to design-build 
projects. In addition, the quality assurance program may include the 
following:
    (1) Reliance on a combination of contractual provisions and 
acceptance methods;
    (2) Reliance on quality control sampling and testing as part of the 
acceptance decision, provided that adequate verification of the design-
builder's quality control sampling and testing is performed to ensure 
that the design-builder is providing the quality of materials and 
construction required by the contract documents.
    (3) Contractual provisions which require the operation of the 
completed facility for a specific time period.

    Source: 50 FR 20345, May 15, 1985, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 645.101  Purpose.

    To prescribe the policies, procedures, and reimbursement provisions 
for the adjustment and relocation of utility facilities on Federal-aid 
and direct Federal projects.


<R05>
Sec. 645.103  Applicability.

    (a) The provisions of this regulation apply to reimbursement claimed 
by a State transportation department (STD) for costs incurred under an 
approved and properly executed transportation department (TD)/utility 
agreement and for payment of costs incurred under all Federal Highway 
Administration (FHWA)/utility agreements.
    (b) Procedures on the accommodation of utilities are set forth in 23 
CFR part 645, subpart B, Accommodation of Utilities.
    (c) When the lines or facilities to be relocated or adjusted due to 
highway construction are privately owned, located on the owner's land, 
devoted exclusively to private use and not directly or indirectly 
serving the public, the provisions of the FHWA's right-of-way procedures 
in 23 CFR 710.203, apply. When applicable, under the foregoing 
conditions, the provisions of this regulation may be used as a guide to 
establish a cost-to-cure.
    (d) The FHWA's reimbursement to the STD will be governed by State 
law (or State regulation) or the provisions of this regulation, 
whichever is more restrictive. When State law or regulation differs from 
this regulation, a determination shall be made by the STD subject to the 
concurrence of the FHWA as to which standards will govern, and the 
record documented accordingly, for each relocation encountered.
    (e) For direct Federal projects, all references herein to the STD or 
TD are inapplicable, and it is intended that the FHWA be considered in 
the relative position of the STD or TD.

[50 FR 20345, May 15, 1985, as amended at 64 FR 71289, Dec. 21, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 645.105  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this regulation, the following definitions shall 
apply:
    Authorization--for Federal-aid projects authorization to the STD by 
the FHWA, or for direct Federal projects authorization to the utility by 
the FHWA, to proceed with any phase of a project. The date of 
authorization establishes the date of eligibility for

[[Page 232]]

Federal funds to participate in the costs incurred on that phase of 
work.
    Betterment--any upgrading of the facility being relocated that is 
not attributable to the highway construction and is made solely for the 
benefit of and at the election of the utility.
    Cost of relocation--the entire amount paid by or on behalf of the 
utility properly attributable to the relocation after deducting from 
that amount any increase in value of the new facility, and any salvage 
derived from the old facility.
    Cost of Removal--the amount expended to remove utility property 
including the cost of demolishing, dismantling, removing, transporting, 
or otherwise disposing of utility property and of cleaning up to leave 
the site in a neat and presentable condition.
    Cost of salvage--the amount expended to restore salvaged utility 
property to usable condition after its removal.
    Direct Federal projects--highway projects such as projects under the 
Federal Lands Highways Program which are under the direct administration 
of the FHWA.
    Indirect or overhead costs--those costs which are not readily 
identifiable with one specific task, job, or work order. Such costs may 
include indirect labor, social security taxes, insurance, stores 
expense, and general office expenses. Costs of this nature generally are 
distributed or allocated to the applicable job or work orders, other 
accounts and other functions to which they relate. Distribution and 
allocation is made on a uniform basis which is reasonable, equitable, 
and in accordance with generally accepted cost accounting practices.
    Relocation--the adjustment of utility facilities required by the 
highway project. It includes removing and reinstalling the facility, 
including necessary temporary facilities, acquiring necessary right-of-
way on the new location, moving, rearranging or changing the type of 
existing facilities and taking any necessary safety and protective 
measures. It shall also mean constructing a replacement facility that is 
both functionally equivalent to the existing facility and necessary for 
continuous operation of the utility service, the project economy, or 
sequence of highway construction.
    Salvage value--the amount received from the sale of utility property 
that has been removed or the amount at which the recovered material is 
charged to the utility's accounts, if retained for reuse.
    State transportation department--the transportation department of 
one of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico.
    Transportation department(TD)--that department, commission, board, 
or official of any State or political subdivison thereof, charged by its 
law with the responsibility for highway administration.
    Use and occupancy agreement--the document (written agreement or 
permit) by which the TD approves the use and occupancy of highway right-
of-way by utility facilities or private lines.
    Utility--a privately, publicly, or cooperatively owned line, 
facility or system for producing, transmitting, or distributing 
communications, cable television, power, electricity, light, heat, gas, 
oil, crude products, water, steam, waste, storm water not connected with 
highway drainage, or any other similar commodity, including any fire or 
police signal system or street lighting system, which directly or 
indirectly serves the public. The term utility shall also mean the 
utility company inclusive of any wholly owned or controlled subsidiary.
    Work order system--a procedure for accumulating and recording into 
separate accounts of a utility all costs to the utility in connection 
with any change in its system or plant.

<R05>
Sec. 645.107  Eligibility.

    (a) When requested by the STD, Federal funds may participate, 
subject to the provisions of Sec. 645.103(d) of this part and at the 
pro rata share applicable, in an amount actually paid by an TD for the 
costs of utility relocations. Federal funds may participate in safety 
corrective measures made under the provisions of Sec. 645.107(k) of 
this part. Federal funds may also participate for relocations 
necessitated by the actual construction of highway project made

[[Page 233]]

under one or more of the following conditions when:
    (1) The STD certifies that the utility has the right of occupancy in 
its existing location because it holds the fee, an easement, or other 
real property interest, the damaging or taking of which is compensable 
in eminent domain,
    (2) The utility occupies privately or publicly owned land, including 
public road or street right-of-way, and the STD certifies that the 
payment by the TD is made pursuant to a law authorizing such payment in 
conformance with the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 123, and/or
    (3) The utility occupies publicy owned land, including public road 
and street right-of-way, and is owned by a public agency or political 
subdivision of the State, and is not required by law or agreement to 
move at its own expense, and the STD certifies that the TD has the legal 
authority or obligation to make such payments.
    (b) On projects which the STD has the authority to participate in 
project costs, Federal funds may not participate in payments made by a 
political subdivision for relocation of utility facilities, other than 
those proposed under the provisions of Sec. 645.107(k) of this part, 
when State law prohibits the STD from making payment for relocation of 
utility facilities.
    (c) On projects which the STD does not have the authority to 
participate in project costs, Federal funds may participate in payments 
made by a political subdivision for relocation of utility facilities 
necessitated by the actual construction of a highway project when the 
STD certifies that such payment is based upon the provisions of Sec. 
645.107(a) of this part and does not violate the terms of a use and 
occupancy agreement, or legal contract, between the utility and the TD 
or for utility safety corrective measures under the provisions of Sec. 
645.107(k) of this part.
    (d) Federal funds are not eligible to participate in any costs for 
which the utility contributes or repays the TD, except for utilities 
owned by the political subdivision on projects which qualify under the 
provisions of Sec. 645.107(c) of this part in which case the costs of 
the utility are considered to be costs of the TD.
    (e) The FHWA may deny Federal fund participation in any payments 
made by a TD for the relocation of utility facilities when such payments 
do not constitute a suitable basis for Federal fund participation under 
the provisions of title 23 U.S.C.
    (f) The rights of any public agency or political subdivision of a 
State under contract, franchise, or other instrument or agreement with 
the utility, pertaining to the utility's use and occupancy of publicly 
owned land, including public road and street right-of-way, shall be 
considered the rights of the STD in the absence of State law to the 
contrary.
    (g) In lieu of the individual certifications required by Sec. 
645.107(a) and (c), the STD may file a statement with the FHWA setting 
forth the conditions under which the STD will make payments for the 
relocation of utility facilities. The FHWA may approve Federal fund 
participation in utility relocations proposed by the STD under the 
conditions of the statement when the FHWA has made an affirmative 
finding that such statement and conditions form a suitable basis for 
Federal fund participation under the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 123.
    (h) Federal funds may not participate in the cost of relocations of 
utility facilities made solely for the benefit or convenience of a 
utility, its contractor, or a highway contractor.
    (i) When the advance installation of new utility facilities crossing 
or otherwise occupying the proposed right-of-way of a planned highway 
project is underway, or scheduled to be underway, prior to the time such 
right-of-way is purchased by or under control of the TD, arrangements 
should be made for such facilities to be installed in a manner that will 
meet the requirements of the planned highway project. Federal funds are 
eligible to participate in the additional cost incurred by the utility 
that are attributable to, and in accommodation of, the highway project 
provided such costs are incurred subsequent to authorization of the work 
by the FHWA. Subject to the other provisions of this regulation, Federal 
participation may be approved

[[Page 234]]

under the foregoing circumstances when it is demonstrated that the 
action taken is necessary to protect the public interest and the 
adjustment of the facility is necessary by reason of the actual 
construction of the highway project.
    (j) Federal funds are eligible to participate in the costs of 
preliminary engineering and allied services for utilities, the 
acquisition of replacement right-of-way for utilities, and the physical 
construction work associated with utility relocations. Such costs must 
be incurred by or on behalf of a utility after the date the work is 
included in an approved program and after the FHWA has authorized the 
STD to proceed in accordance with 23 CFR part 630, subpart A, Federal-
Aid Programs Approval and Project Authorization.
    (k) Federal funds may participate in projects solely for the purpose 
of implementing safety corrective measures to reduce the roadside 
hazards of utility facilities to the highway user. Safety corrective 
measures should be developed in accordance with the provisions of 23 CFR 
645.209(k).

(Information collection requirements in paragraph (g) were approved by 
the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2125-0515)

[50 FR 20345, May 15, 1985, as amended at 53 FR 24932, July 1, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 645.109  Preliminary engineering.

    (a) As mutually agreed to by the TD and utility, and subject to the 
provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, preliminary engineering 
activities associated with utility relocation work may be done by:
    (1) The TD's or utility's engineering forces;
    (2) An engineering consultant selected by the TD, after consultation 
with the utility, the contract to be administered by the TD; or,
    (3) An engineering consultant selected by the utility, with the 
approval of the TD, the contract to be administered by the utility.
    (b) When a utility is not adequately staffed to pursue the necessary 
preliminary engineering and related work for the utility relocation, 
Federal funds may participate in the amount paid to engineers, 
architects, and others for required engineering and allied services 
provided such amounts are not based on a percentage of the cost of 
relocation. When Federal participation is requested by the STD in the 
cost of such services, the utility and its consultant shall agree in 
writing as to the services to be provided and the fees and arrangements 
for the services. Federal funds may participate in the cost of such 
services performed under existing written continuing contracts when it 
is demonstrated that such work is performed regularly for the utility in 
its own work and that the costs are reasonable.
    (c) The procedures in 23 CFR part 172, Administration of Engineering 
and Design Related Service Contracts, may be used as a guide for 
reviewing proposed consultant contracts.

[50 FR 20345, May 15, 1985, as amended at 60 FR 34850, July 5, 1995; 65 
FR 70311, Nov. 22, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 645.111  Right-of-way.

    (a) Federal participation may be approved for the cost of 
replacement right-of-way provided:
    (1) The utility has the right of occupancy in its existing location 
beause it holds the fee, an easement, or another real property interest, 
the damaging or taking of which is compensable in eminent domain, or the 
acquisition is made in the interest of project economy or is necessary 
to meet the requirements of the highway project, and
    (2) There will be no charge to the project for that portion of the 
utility's existing right-of-way being transferred to the TD for highway 
purposes.
    (b) The utility shall determine and make a written valuation of the 
replacement right-of-way that it acquires in order to justify amounts 
paid for such right-of-way. This written valuation shall be accomplished 
prior to negotiation for acquisition.
    (c) Acquisition of replacement right-of-way by the TD on behalf of a 
utility or acquisition of nonoperating real property from a utility 
shall be in accordance with the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real 
Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. 4601 et seq.) and 
applicable right-of-way procedures in 23 CFR 710.203.

[[Page 235]]

    (d) When the utility has the right-of-occupancy in its existing 
location because it holds the fee, an easement, or another real property 
interest, and it is not necessary by reason of the highway construction 
to adjust or replace the facilities located thereon, the taking of and 
damage to the utility's real property, including the disposal or removal 
of such facilities, may be considered a right-of-way transaction in 
accordance with provisions of the applicable right-of-way procedures in 
23 CFR 710.203.

[50 FR 20345, May 15, 1985, as amended at 64 FR 71289, Dec. 21, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 645.113  Agreements and authorizations.

    (a) On Federal-aid and direct Federal projects involving utility 
relocations, the utility and the TD shall agree in writing on their 
separate responsibilities for financing and accomplishing the relocation 
work. When Federal participation is requested, the agreement shall 
incorporate this regulation by reference and designate the method to be 
used for performing the work (by contract or force account) and for 
developing relocation costs. The method proposed by the utility for 
developing relocation costs must be acceptable to both the TD and the 
FHWA. The preferred method for the development of relocation costs by a 
utility is on the basis of actual direct and related indirect costs 
accumulated in accordance with a work order accounting procedure 
prescribed by the applicable Federal or State regulatory body.
    (b) When applicable, the written agreement shall specify the terms 
and amounts of any contribution or repayments made or to be made by the 
utility to the TD in connection with payments by the TD to the utility 
under the provisions of Sec. 645.107 of this regulation.
    (c) The agreement shall be supported by plans, specifications when 
required, and itemized cost estimates of the work agreed upon, including 
appropriate credits to the project, and shall be sufficiently 
informative and complete to provide the TD and the FHWA with a clear 
description of the work required.
    (d) When the relocation involves both work to be done at the TD's 
expense and work to be done at the expense of the utility, the written 
agreement shall state the share to be borne by each party.
    (e) In the event there are changes in the scope of work, extra work 
or major changes in the planned work covered by the approved agreement, 
plans, and estimates, Federal participation shall be limited to costs 
covered by a modification of the agreement, a written change, or extra 
work order approved by the TD and the FHWA.
    (f) When proposed utility relocation and adjustment work on a 
project for a specific utility company can be clearly defined and the 
cost can be accurately estimated, the FHWA may approve an agreement 
between the TD and the utility company for a lump-sum payment without 
later confirmation by audit of actual costs.
    (g) Except as otherwise provided by Sec. 645.113(h), authorization 
by the FHWA to the STD to proceed with the physical relocation of a 
utility's facilities may be given after:
    (1) The utility relocation work, or the right-of-way, or physical 
construction phase of the highway construction work is included in an 
approved Statewide transportation improvement program,
    (2) The appropriate environmental evaluation and public hearing 
procedures required by 23 CFR part 771, Environmental Impact and Related 
Procedures, have been satisfied.
    (3) The FHWA has reviewed and approved the plans, estimates, and 
proposed or executed agreements for the utility work and is furnished a 
schedule for accomplishing the work.
    (h) The FHWA may authorize the physical relocation of utility 
facilities before the requirements of Sec. 645.113(g)(2) are satisfied 
when the relocation or adjustment of utility facilities meets the 
requirements of Sec. 645.107(i) of this regulation.
    (i) Whenever the FHWA has authorized right-of-way acquisition under 
the hardship and protective buying provisions of 23 CFR 710.503, the 
FHWA may authorize the physical relocation of utility facilities located 
in whole or in part on such right-of-way.
    (j) When all efforts by the TD and utility fail to bring about 
written

[[Page 236]]

agreement of their separate responsibilities under the provisions of 
this regulation, the STD shall submit its proposal and a full report of 
the circumstances to the FHWA. Conditional authorizations for the 
relocation work to proceed may be given by the FHWA to the STD with the 
understanding that Federal funds will not be paid for work done by the 
utility until the STD proposal has been approved by the FHWA.
    (k) The FHWA will consider for approval any special procedure under 
State law, or appropriate administrative or judicial order, or under 
blanket master agreements with the utilities, that will fully accomplish 
all of the foregoing objectives and accelerate the advancement of the 
construction and completion of projects.

<R05>
Sec. 645.115  Construction.

    (a) Part 635, subpart B, of this title, Force Account Construction 
(justification required for force account work), states that it is cost-
effective for certain utility adjustments to be performed by a utility 
with its own forces and equipment, provided the utility is qualified to 
perform the work in a satisfactory manner. This cost-effectiveness 
finding covers minor work on the utility's existing facilities routinely 
performed by the utility with its own forces. When the utility is not 
adequately staffed and equipped to perform such work with its own forces 
and equipment at a time convenient to and in coordination with the 
associated highway construction, such work may be done by:
    (1) A contract awarded by the TD or utility to the lowest qualified 
bidder based on appropriate solicitation,
    (2) Inclusion as part of the TD's highway construction contract let 
by the TD as agreed to by the utility,
    (3) An existing continuing contract, provided the costs are 
reasonable, or
    (4) A contract for low-cost incidental work, such as tree trimming 
and the like, awarded by the TD or utility without competitive bidding, 
provided the costs are reasonable.
    (b) When it has been determined under part 635, subpart B, that the 
force account method is not the most cost-effective means for 
accomplishing the utility adjustment, such work is to be done under 
competitive bid contracts as described in Sec. 645.115(a) (1) and (2) 
or under an existing continuing contract provided it can be demonstrated 
this is the most cost-effective method.
    (c) Costs for labor, materials, equipment, and other services 
furnished by the utility shall be billed by the utility directly to the 
TD. The special provisions of contracts let by the utility or the TD 
shall be explicit in this respect. The costs of force account work 
performed for the utility by the TD and of contract work performed for 
the utility under a contract let by the TD shall be reported separately 
from the costs of other force account and contract items on the highway 
project.


<R05>
Sec. 645.117  Cost development and reimbursement.

    (a) Developing and recording costs. (1) All utility relocation costs 
shall be recorded by means of work orders in accordance with an approved 
work order system except when another method of developing and recording 
costs, such as lump-sum agreement, has been approved by the TD and the 
FHWA. Except for work done under contracts, the individual and total 
costs properly reported and recorded in the utility's accounts in 
accordance with the approved method for developing such costs, or the 
lump-sum agreement, shall constitute the maximum amount on which Federal 
participation may be based.
    (2) Each utility shall keep its work order system or other approved 
accounting procedure in such a manner as to show the nature of each 
addition to or retirement from a facility, the total costs thereof, and 
the source or sources of cost. Separate work orders may be issued for 
additions and retirements. Retirements, however, may be included with 
the construction work order provided that all items relating to 
retirements shall be kept separately from those relating to 
construction.
    (3) The STD may develop, or work in concert with utility companies 
to develop, other acceptable costing methods, such as unit costs, to 
estimate and

[[Page 237]]

reimburse utility relocation expenditures. Such other methods shall be 
founded in generally accepted industry practices and be reasonably 
supported by recent actual expenditures. Unit costs should be developed 
periodically and supported annually by a maintained data base of 
relocation expenses. Development of any alternate costing method should 
consider the factors listed in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this 
section. Streamlining of the cost development and reimbursement 
procedures is encouraged so long as adequate accountability for Federal 
expenditures is maintained. Concurrence by the FHWA is required for any 
costing method used other than actual cost.
    (b) Direct labor costs. (1) Salaries and wages, at actual or average 
rates, and related expenses paid by the utility to individuals for the 
time worked on the project are reimbursable when supported by adequate 
records. This includes labor associated with preliminary engineering, 
construction engineering, right-of-way, and force account construction.
    (2) Salaries and expenses paid to individuals who are normally part 
of the overhead organization of the utility may be reimbursed for the 
time worked directly on the project when supported by adequate records 
and when the work performed by such individuals is essential to the 
project and could not have been accomplished as economically by 
employees outside the overhead organization.
    (3) Amounts paid to engineers, architects and others for services 
directly related to projects may be reimbursed.
    (c) Labor surcharges. (1) Labor surcharges include worker 
compensation insurance, public liability and property damage insurance, 
and such fringe benefits as the utility has established for the benefit 
of its employees. The cost of labor surcharges will be reimbursed at 
actual cost to the utility, or, at the option of the utility, average 
rates which are representative of actual costs may be used in lieu of 
actual costs if approved by the STD and the FHWA. These average rates 
should be adjusted at least once annually to take into account known 
anticipated changes and correction for any over or under applied costs 
for the preceding period.
    (2) When the utility is a self-insurer, there may be reimbursement 
at experience rates properly developed from actual costs. The rates 
cannot exceed the rates of a regular insurance company for the class of 
employment covered.
    (d) Overhead and indirect construction costs. (1) Overhead and 
indirect construction costs not charged directly to work order or 
construction accounts may be allocated to the relocation provided the 
allocation is made on an equitable basis. All costs included in the 
allocation shall be eligible for Federal reimbursement, reasonable, 
actually incurred by the utility, and consistent with the provisions of 
48 CFR part 31.
    (2) Costs not eligible for Federal reimbursement include, but are 
not limited to, the costs associated with advertising, sales promotion, 
interest on borrowings, the issuance of stock, bad debts, uncollectible 
accounts receivable, contributions, donations, entertainment, fines, 
penalties, lobbying, and research programs.
    (3) The records supporting the entries for overhead and indirect 
construction costs shall show the total amount, rate, and allocation 
basis for each additive, and are subject to audit by representatives of 
the State and Federal Government.
    (e) Material and supply costs. (1) Materials and supplies, if 
available, are to be furnished from company stock except that they may 
be obtained from other sources near the project site when available at a 
lower cost. When not available from company stock, they may be purchased 
either under competitive bids or existing continuing contracts under 
which the lowest available prices are developed. Minor quantities of 
materials and supplies and proprietary products routinely used in the 
utility's operation and essential for the maintenance of system 
compatibility may be excluded from these requirements. The utility shall 
not be required to change its existing standards for materials used in 
permanent changes to its facilities. Costs shall be determined as 
follows:
    (i) Materials and supplies furnished from company stock shall be 
billed at

[[Page 238]]

the current stock prices for such new or used materials at time of 
issue.
    (ii) Materials and supplies not furnished from company stock shall 
be billed at actual costs to the utility delivered to the project site.
    (iii) A reasonable cost for plant inspection and testing may be 
included in the costs of materials and supplies when such expense has 
been incurred. The computation of actual costs of materials and supplies 
shall include the deduction of all offered discounts, rebates, and 
allowances.
    (iv) The cost of rehabilitating rather than replacing existing 
utility facilities to meet the requirements of a project is 
reimbursable, provided this cost does not exceed replacement costs.
    (2) Materials recovered from temporary use and accepted for reuse by 
the utility shall be credited to the project at prices charged to the 
job, less a considertion for loss in service life at 10 percent. 
Materials recovered from the permanent facility of the utility that are 
accepted by the utility for return to stock shall be credited to the 
project at the current stock prices of such used materials. Materials 
recovered and not accepted for reuse by the utility, if determined to 
have a net sale value, shall be sold to the highest bidder by the TD or 
utility following an opportunity for TD inspection and appropriate 
solicitation for bids. If the utility practices a system of periodic 
disposal by sale, credit to the project shall be at the going prices 
supported by records of the utility.
    (3) Federal participation may be approved for the total cost of 
removal when either such removal is required by the highway construction 
or the existing facilities cannot be abandoned in place for aesthetic or 
safety reasons. When the utility facilities can be abandoned in place 
but the utility or highway constructor elects to remove and recover the 
materials, Federal funds shall not participate in removal costs which 
exceed the value of the materials recovered.
    (4) The actual and direct costs of handling and loading materials 
and supplies at company stores or material yards, and of unloading and 
handling recovered materials accepted by the utility at its stores or 
material yards are reimbursable. In lieu of actual costs, average rates 
which are representative of actual costs may be used if approved by the 
STD and the FHWA. These average rates should be adjusted at least once 
annually to take into account known anticipated changes and correction 
for any over or under applied costs for the preceding period. At the 
option of the utility, 5 percent of the amounts billed for the materials 
and supplies issued from company stores and material yards or the value 
of recovered materials will be reimbursed in lieu of actual or average 
costs for handling.
    (f) Equipment costs. The average or actual costs of operation, minor 
maintenance, and depreciation of utility-owned equipment may be 
reimbursed. Reimbursement for utility-owned vehicles may be made at 
average or actual costs. When utility-owned equipment is not available, 
reimbursement will be limited to the amount of rental paid (1) to the 
lowest qualified bidder, (2) under existing continuing contracts at 
reasonable costs, or (3) as an exception by negotiation when paragraph 
(f) (1) and (2) of this section are impractical due to project location 
or schedule.
    (g) Transportation costs. (1) The utility's cost, consistent with 
its overall policy, of necessary employee transportation and subsistence 
directly attributable to the project is reimbursable.
    (2) Reasonable cost for the movement of materials, supplies, and 
equipment to the project and necessary return to storage including the 
associated cost of loading and unloading equipment is reimbursable.
    (h) Credits. (1) Credit to the highway project will be required for 
the cost of any betterments to the facility being replaced or adjusted, 
and for the salvage value of the materials removed.
    (2) Credit to the highway project will be required for the accrued 
depreciation of a utility facility being replaced, such as a building, 
pumping station, filtration plant, power plant, substation, or any other 
similar operational unit. Such accrued depreciation is that amount based 
on the ratio between the period of actual length of

[[Page 239]]

service and total life expectancy applied to the original cost. Credit 
for accrued depreciation shall not be required for a segment of the 
utility's service, distribution, or transmission lines.
    (3) No betterment credit is required for additions or improvements 
which are:
    (i) Required by the highway project,
    (ii) Replacement devices or materials that are of equivalent 
standards although not identical,
    (iii) Replacement of devices or materials no longer regularly 
manufactured with next highest grade or size,
    (iv) Required by law under governmental and appropriate regulatory 
commission code, or
    (v) Required by current design practices regularly followed by the 
company in its own work, and there is a direct benefit to the highway 
project.
    (4) When the facilities, including equipment and operating 
facilities, described in Sec. 645.117(h)(2) are not being replaced, but 
are being rehabilitated and/or moved, as necessitated by the highway 
project, no credit for accrued depreciation is needed.
    (5) In no event will the total of all credits required under the 
provisions of this regulation exceed the total costs of adjustment 
exclusive of the cost of additions or improvements necessitated by the 
highway construction.
    (i) Billings. (1) After the executed TD/utility agreement has been 
approved by the FHWA, the utility may be reimbursed through the STD by 
progress billings for costs incurred. Cost for materials stockpiled at 
the project site or specifically purchased and delivered to the utility 
for use on the project may also be reimbursed on progress billings 
following approval of the executed TD/utility agreement.
    (2) The utility shall provide one final and complete billing of all 
costs incurred, or of the agreed-to lump-sum, within one year following 
completion of the utility relocation work, otherwise previous payments 
to the utility may be considered final, except as agreed to between the 
STD and the utility. Billings received from utilities more than one year 
following completion of the utility relocation work may be paid if the 
STD so desires, and Federal-aid highway funds may participate in these 
payments.
    (3) All utility cost records and accounts relating to the project 
are subject to audit by representatives of the State and Federal 
Government for a period of 3 years from the date final payment has been 
received by the utility.

                  Subpart B_Accommodation of Utilities

    Source: 50 FR 20354, May 15, 1985, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 645.201  Purpose.

    To prescribe policies and procedures for accommodating utility 
facilities and private lines on the right-of-way of Federal-aid or 
direct Federal highway projects.


<R05>
Sec. 645.203  Applicability.

    This subpart applies to:
    (a) New utility installations within the right-of-way of Federal-aid 
or direct Federal highway projects,
    (b) Existing utility facilities which are to be retained, relocated, 
or adjusted within the right-of-way of active projects under development 
or construction when Federal-aid or direct Federal highway funds are 
either being or have been used on the involved highway facility. When 
existing utility installations are to remain in place without 
adjustments on such projects the transportation department and utility 
are to enter into an appropriate agreement as discussed in Sec. 645.213 
of this part,
    (c) Existing utility facilities which are to be adjusted or 
relocated under the provisions of Sec. 645.209(k), and
    (d) Private lines which may be permitted to cross the right-of-way 
of a Federal-aid or direct Federal highway project pursuant to State law 
and regulations and the provisions of this subpart. Longitudinal use of 
such right-of-

[[Page 241]]

way by private lines is to be handled under the provisions of 23 CFR 
1.23(c).


<R05>
Sec. 645.205  Policy.

    (a) Pursuant to the provisions of 23 CFR 1.23, it is in the public 
interest for utility facilities to be accommodated on the right-of-way 
of a Federal-aid or direct Federal highway project when such use and 
occupancy of the highway right-of-way do not adversely affect highway or 
traffic safety, or otherwise impair the highway or its aesthetic 
quality, and do not conflict with the provisions of Federal, State or 
local laws or regulations.
    (b) Since by tradition and practice highway and utility facilities 
frequently coexist within common right-of-way or along the same 
transportation corridors, it is essential in such situations that these 
public service facilities be compatibly designed and operated. In the 
design of new highway facilities consideration should be given to 
utility service needs of the area traversed if such service is to be 
provided from utility facilities on or near the highway. Similarly the 
potential impact on the highway and its users should be considered in 
the design and location of utility facilities on or along highway right-
of-way. Efficient, effective and safe joint highway and utility 
development of transportation corridors is important along high speed 
and high volume roads, such as major arterials and freeways, 
particularly those approaching metropolitan areas where space is 
increasingly limited. Joint highway and utility planning and development 
efforts are encouraged on Federal-aid highway projects.
    (c) The manner is which utilities cross or otherwise occupy the 
right-of-way of a direct Federal or Federal-aid highway project can 
materially affect the highway, its safe operation, aesthetic quality, 
and maintenance. Therefore, it is necessary that such use and occupancy, 
where authorized, be regulated by transportation departments in a manner 
which preserves the operational safety and the functional and aesthetic 
quality of the highway facility. This subpart shall not be construed to 
alter the basic legal authority of utilities to install their facilities 
on public highways pursuant to law or franchise and reasonable 
regulation by transportation departments with respect to location and 
manner of installation.
    (d) When utilities cross or otherwise occupy the right-of-way of a 
direct Federal or Federal-aid highway project on Federal lands, and when 
the right-of-way grant is for highway purposes only, the utility must 
also obtain and comply with the terms of a right-of-way or other 
occupancy permit for the Federal agency having jurisdiction over the 
underlying land.

<R05>
Sec. 645.207  Definitions.

    For the purpose of this regulation, the following definitions shall 
apply:
    Aesthetic quality--those desirable characteristics in the appearance 
of the highway and its environment, such as harmony between or blending 
of natural and manufactured objects in the environment, continuity of 
visual form without distracting interruptions, and simplicity of designs 
which are desirably functional in shape but without clutter.
    Border area--the area between the traveled way and the right-of-way 
line.
    Clear roadside policy--that policy employed by a transportation 
department to provide a clear zone in order to increase safety, improve 
traffic operations, and enhance the aesthetic quality of highways by 
designing, constructing and maintaining highway roadsides as wide, flat, 
and rounded as practical and as free as practical from natural or 
manufactured hazards such as trees, drainage structures, nonyielding 
sign supports, highway lighting supports, and utility poles and other 
ground-mounted structures. The policy should address the removal of 
roadside obstacles which are likely to be associated with accident or 
injury to the highway user, or when such obstacles are essential, the 
policy should provide for appropriate countermeasures to reduce hazards. 
Countermeasures include placing utility facilities at locations which 
protect out-of-

[[Page 242]]

control vehicles, using breakaway features, using impact attenuation 
devices, or shielding. In all cases full consideration shall be given to 
sound engineering principles and economic factors.
    Clear zone--the total roadside border area starting at the edge of 
the traveled way, available for safe use by errant vehicles. This area 
may consist of a shoulder, a recoverable slope, a non-recoverable slope, 
and/or the area at the toe of a non-recoverable slope available for safe 
use by an errant vehicle. The desired width is dependent upon the 
traffic volumes and speeds, and on the roadside geometry. The current 
edition of the AASHTO ``Roadside Design Guide'' should be used as a 
guide for establishing clear zones for various types of highways and 
operating conditions. This publication is available for inspection and 
copying from the FHWA Washington Headquarters and all FHWA Division 
Offices as prescribed in 49 CFR part 7. Copies of current AASHTO 
publications are available for purchase from the American Association of 
State Highway and Transportation Officials, Suite 225, 444 North Capitol 
Street, NW., Washington, D.C. 20001, or electronically at http://
www.aashto.org.
    Direct Federal highway projects--those active or completed highway 
projects such as projects under the Federal Lands Highways Program which 
are under the direct administration of the Federal Highway 
Administration (FHWA)
    Federal-aid highway projects--those active or completed highway 
projects administered by or through a State transportation department 
which involve or have involved the use of Federal-aid highway funds for 
the development, acquisition of right-of-way, construction or 
improvement of the highway or related facilities, including highway 
beautification projects under 23 U.S.C. 319, Landscaping and Scenic 
Enhancement.
    Freeway--a divided arterial highway with full control of access.
Highway--any public way for vehicular travel, including the entire area 
within the right-of-way and related facilities constructed or improved 
in whole or in part with Federal-aid or direct Federal highway funds.
    Transportation department--that department, agency, commission, 
board, or official of any State or political subdivision thereof, 
charged by its law with the responsibility for highway administration.
    Private lines--privately owned facilities which convey or transmit 
the commodities outlined in the definition of utility facility of this 
section, but devoted exclusively to private use.
    Right-of-way--real property, or interests therein, acquired, 
dedicated or reserved for the construction, operation, and maintenance 
of a highway in which Federal-aid or direct Federal highway funds are or 
have been involved in any stage of development. Lands acquired under 23 
U.S.C. 319 shall be considered to be highway right-of-way.
    State transportation department--the transportation department of 
one of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico.
    Use and occupancy agreement--the document (written agreement or 
permit) by which the transportation department approves the use and 
occupancy of highway right-of-way by utility facilities or private 
lines.
    Utility facility--privately, publicly or cooperatively owned line, 
facility, or system for producing, transmitting, or distributing 
communications, cable television, power, electricity, light, heat, gas, 
oil, crude products, water, steam, waste, storm water not connected with 
highway drainage, or any other similar commodity, including any fire or 
police signal system or street lighting system, which directly or 
indirectly serves the public. The term utility shall also mean the 
utility company inclusive of any substantially owned or controlled 
subsidiary. For the purposes of this part, the term includes those 
utility-type facilities which are owned or leased by a government agency 
for its own use, or otherwise dedicated solely to governmental use. The 
term utility includes those facilities used solely by the utility which 
are a part of its operating plant.

<R05>
Sec. 645.209  General requirements.

    (a) Safety. Highway safety and traffic safety are of paramount, but 
not of sole, importance when accommodating utility facilities within 
highway right-of-way. Utilities provide an essential public service to 
the general public. Traditionally, as a matter of sound economic public 
policy and law, utilities have used public road right-of-way for 
transmitting and distributing their services. The lack of sufficient 
right-

[[Page 243]]

of-way width to accommodate utilities outside the desirable clear zone, 
in and of itself, is not a valid reason to preclude utilities from 
occupying the highway right-of-way. However, due to the nature and 
volume of highway traffic, the effect of such joint use on the traveling 
public must be carefully considered by transportation departments before 
approval of utility use of the right-of-way of Federal-aid or direct 
Federal highway projects is given. Adjustments in the operating 
characteristics of the utility or the highway or other special efforts 
may be necessary to increase the compatibility of utility-highway joint 
use. The possibility of this joint use should be a consideration in 
establishing right-of-way requirements for highway projects. In any 
event, the design, location, and manner in which utilities use and 
occupy the right-of-way of Federal-aid or direct Federal highway 
projects must conform to the clear roadside policies for the highway 
involved and otherwise provide for a safe traveling environment as 
required by 23 U.S.C. 109(l)(1).
    (b) New above ground installations. On Federal-aid or direct Federal 
highway projects, new above ground utility installations, where 
permitted, shall be located as far from the traveled way as possible, 
preferably along the right-of-way line. No new above ground utility 
installations are to be allowed within the established clear zone of the 
highway unless a determination has been made by the transportation 
department that placement underground is not technically feasible or is 
unreasonably costly and there are no feasible alternate locations. In 
exceptional situations when it is essential to locate such above ground 
utility facilities within the established clear zone of the highway, 
appropriate countermeasures to reduce hazards shall be used. 
Countermeasures include placing utility facilities at locations which 
protect or minimize exposure to out-of-control vehicles, using breakaway 
features, using impact attenuation devices, using delineation, or 
shielding.
    (c) Installations within freeways. (1) Each State transportation 
department shall submit an accommodation plan in accordance with 
Sec. Sec. 645.211 and 645.215 which addresses how the State 
transportation department will consider applications for longitudinal 
utility installations within the access control lines of a freeway. This 
includes utility installations within interchange areas which must be 
constructed or serviced by direct access from the main lanes or ramps. 
If a State transportation department elects to permit such use, the plan 
must address how the State transportation department will oversee such 
use consistent with this subpart, Title 23 U.S.C., and the safe and 
efficient use of the highways.
    (2) Any accommodation plan shall assure that installations satisfy 
the following criteria:
    (i) The effects utility installations will have on highway and 
traffic safety will be ascertained, since in no case shall any use be 
permitted which would adversely affect safety.
    (ii) The direct and indirect environmental and economic effects of 
any loss of productive agricultural land or any productivity of any 
agricultural land which would result from the disapproval of the use of 
such right-of-way for accommodation of such utility facility will be 
evaluated.
    (iii) These environmental and economic effects together with any 
interference with or impairment of the use of the highway in such right-
of-way which would result from the use of such right-of-way for the 
accommodation of such utility facility will be considered.
    (iv) [Reserved]
    (v) A utility strip will be established along the outer edge of the 
right-of-way by locating a utility access control line between the 
proposed utility installation and the through roadway and ramps. 
Existing fences should be retained and, except along sections of 
freeways having frontage roads, planned fences should be located at the 
freeway right-of-way line. The State or political subdivision is to 
retain control of the utility strip right-of-way including its use by 
utility facilities. Service connections to adjacent properties shall not 
be permitted from within the utility strip.
    (3) Nothing in this part shall be construed as prohibiting a 
transportation department from adopting a more restrictive policy than 
that contained

[[Page 244]]

herein with regard to longitudinal utility installations along freeway 
right-of-way and access for constructing and/or for servicing such 
installations.
    (d) Uniform policies and procedures. For a transportation department 
to fulfill its responsibilities to control utility use of Federal-aid 
highway right-of-way within the State and its political subdivisions, it 
must exercise or cause to be exercised, adequate regulation over such 
use and occupancy through the establishment and enforcement of 
reasonably uniform policies and procedures for utility accommodation.
    (e) Private lines. Because there are circumstances when private 
lines may be allowed to cross or otherwise occupy the right-of-way of 
Federal-aid projects, transportation departments shall establish uniform 
policies for properly controlling such permitted use. When permitted, 
private lines must conform to the provisions of this part and the 
provisions of 23 CFR 1.23(c) for longitudinal installations.
    (f) Direct Federal highway projects. On direct Federal highway 
projects, the FHWA will apply, or cause to be applied, utility and 
private line accommodation policies similar to those required on 
Federal-aid highway projects. When appropriate, agreements will be 
entered into between the FHWA and the transportation department or other 
government agencies to ensure adequate control and regulation of use by 
utilities and private lines of the right-of-way on direct Federal 
highway projects.
    (g) Projects where state lacks authority. On Federal-aid highway 
projects where the State transportation department does not have legal 
authority to regulate highway use by utilities and private lines, the 
State transportation department must enter into formal agreements with 
those local officials who have such authority. The agreements must 
provide for a degree of protection to the highway at least equal to the 
protection provided by the State transportation department's utility 
accommodation policy approved under the provisions of Sec. 645.215(b) 
of this part. The project agreement between the State transportation 
department and the FHWA on all such Federal-aid highway projects shall 
contain a special provision incorporating the formal agreements with the 
responsible local officials.
    (h) Scenic areas. New utility installations, including those needed 
for highway purposes, such as for highway lighting or to serve a weigh 
station, rest area or recreation area, are not permitted on highway 
right-of-way or other lands which are acquired or improved with Federal-
aid or direct Federal highway funds and are located within or adjacent 
to areas of scenic enhancement and natural beauty. Such areas include 
public park and recreational lands, wildlife and waterfowl refuges, 
historic sites as described in 23 U.S.C. 138, scenic strips, overlooks, 
rest areas and landscaped areas. The State transportation department may 
permit exceptions provided the following conditions are met:
    (1) New underground or aerial installations may be permitted only 
when they do not require extensive removal or alteration of trees or 
terrain features visible to the highway user or impair the aesthetic 
quality of the lands being traversed.
    (2) Aerial installations may be permitted only when:
    (i) Other locations are not available or are unusually difficult and 
costly, or are less desirable from the standpoint of aesthetic quality,
    (ii) Placement underground is not technically feasible or is 
unreasonably costly, and
    (iii) The proposed installation will be made at a location, and will 
employ suitable designs and materials, which give the greatest weight to 
the aesthetic qualities of the area being traversed. Suitable designs 
include, but are not limited to, self-supporting armless, single-pole 
construction with vertical configuration of conductors and cable.
    (3) For new utility installations within freeways, the provisions of 
paragraph (c) of this section must also be satisfied.
    (i) Joint use agreements. When the utility has a compensable 
interest in the land occupied by its facilities and such land is to be 
jointly occupied and used for highway and utility purposes, the 
transportation department and

[[Page 245]]

utility shall agree in writing as to the obligations and 
responsibilities of each party. Such joint-use agreements shall 
incorporate the conditions of occupancy for each party, including the 
rights vested in the transportation department and the rights and 
privileges retained by the utility. In any event, the interest to be 
acquired by or vested in the transportation department in any portion of 
the right-of-way of a Federal-aid or direct Federal highway project to 
be vacated, used or occupied by utilities or private lines, shall be 
adequate for the construction, safe operation, and maintenance of the 
highway project.
    (j) Traffic control plan. Whenever a utility installation, 
adjustment or maintenance activity will affect the movement of traffic 
or traffic safety, the utility shall implement a traffic control plan 
and utilize traffic control devices as necessary to ensure the safe and 
expeditious movement of traffic around the work site and the safety of 
the utility work force in accordance with procedures established by the 
transportation department. The traffic control plan and the application 
of traffic control devices shall conform to the standards set forth in 
the current edition of the ``Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices'' 
(MUTCD) and 23 CFR part 630, subpart J. This publication is available 
for inspection and copying from the FHWA Washington Headquarters and all 
FHWA Division Offices as prescribed in 49 CFR part 7.
    (k) Corrective measures. When the transportation department 
determines that existing utility facilities are likely to be associated 
with injury or accident to the highway user, as indicated by accident 
history or safety studies, the transportation department shall initiate 
or cause to be initiated in consultation with the affected utilities, 
corrective measures to provide for a safer traffic environment. The 
corrective measures may include changes to utility or highway facilities 
and should be prioritized to maximum safety benefits in the most cost-
effective manner. The scheduling of utility safety improvements should 
take into consideration planned utility replacement or upgrading 
schedules, accident potential, and the availability of resources. It is 
expected that the requirements of this paragraph will result in an 
orderly and positive process to address the identified utility hazard 
problems in a timely and reasonable manner with due regard to the effect 
of the corrective measures on both the utility consumer and the road 
user. The type of corrective measures are not prescribed. Any requests 
received involving Federal participation in the cost of adjusting or 
relocating utility facilities pursuant to this paragrpah shall be 
subject to the provisions of 23 CFR part 645, subpart A, Utility 
Relocations, Adjustments and Reimbursement, and 23 CFR part 924, Highway 
Safety Improvement Program.
    (l) Wetlands. The installation of privately owned lines or conduits 
on the right-of-way of Federal-aid or direct Federal highway projects 
for the purpose of draining adjacent wetlands onto the highway right-of-
way is considered to be inconsistent with Executive Order 11990, 
Protection of Wetlands, dated May 24, 1977, and shall be prohibited.
    (m) Utility determination. In determining whether a proposed 
installation is a utility or not, the most important consideration is 
how the STD views it under its own State laws and/or regulations.

``A Guide for Accommodating Utilities Within Highway Right-of-Way'' and 
``Roadside Design Guide'' to assist in the evaluation of adequacy of STD 
utility accommodation policies. These publications are available for 
inspection from the FHWA Washington Headquarters and all FHWA Division 
Offices as prescribed in 49 CFR part 7. Copies of current AASHTO 
publications are available for purchase from the American Association of 
State Highway and Transportation Officials, Suite 225, 444 North Capitol 
Street NW., Washington, DC 20001, or electronically at http://
www.aashto.org. At a minimum, such

[[Page 246]]

policies shall make adequate provisions with respect to the following:
    (a) Utilities must be accommodated and maintained in a manner which 
will not impair the highway or adversely affect highway or traffic 
safety. Uniform procedures controlling the manner, nature and extent of 
such utility use shall be established.
    (b) Consideration shall be given to the effect of utility 
installations in regard to safety, aesthetic quality, and the costs or 
difficulty of highway and utility construction and maintenance.
    (c) The State transportation department's standards for regulating 
the use and occupancy of highway right-of-way by utilities must include, 
but are not limited to, the following:
    (1) The horizontal and vertical location requirements and clearances 
for the various types of utilities must be clearly stated. These must be 
adequate to ensure compliance with the clear roadside policies for the 
particular highway involved.
    (2) The applicable provisions of government or industry codes 
required by law or regulation must be set forth or appropriately 
referenced, including highway design standards or other measures which 
the State transportation department deems necessary to provide adequate 
protection to the highway, its safe operation, aesthetic quality, and 
maintenance.
    (3) Specifications for and methods of installation; requirements for 
preservation and restoration of highway facilities, appurtenances, and 
natural features and vegetation on the right-of-way; and limitations on 
the utility's activities within the right-of-way including installation 
within areas set forth by Sec. 645.209(h) of this part should be 
prescribed as necessary to protect highway interests.
    (4) Measures necessary to protect traffic and its safe operation 
during and after installation of facilities, including control-of-access 
restrictions, provisions for rerouting or detouring traffic, traffic 
control measures to be employed, procedures for utility traffic control 
plans, limitations on vehicle parking and materials storage, protection 
of open excavations, and the like must be provided.
    (5) A State transportation department may deny a utility's request 
to occupy highway right-of-way based on State law, regulation, or 
ordinances or the State transportation department's policy. However, in 
any case where the provisions of this part are to be cited as the basis 
for disapproving a utility's request to use and occupy highway right-of-
way, measures must be provided to evaluate the direct and indirect 
environmental and economic effects of any loss of productive 
agricultural land or any impairment of the productivity of any 
agricultural land that would result from the disapproval. The 
environmental and economic effects on productive agricultural land 
together with the possible interference with or impairment of the use of 
the highway and the effect on highway safety must be considered in the 
decision to disapprove any proposal by a utility to use such highway 
right-of-way.
    (d) Compliance with applicable State laws and approved State 
transportation department utility accommodation policies must be 
assured. The responsible State transportation department's file must 
contain evidence of the written arrangements which set forth the terms 
under which utility facilities are to cross or otherwise occupy highway 
right-of-way. All utility installations made on highway right-of-way 
shall be subject to written approval by the State transportation 
department. However, such approval will not be required where so 
provided in the use and occupancy agreement for such matters as utility 
facility maintenance, installation of service connections on highways 
other than freeways, or emergency operations.
    (e) The State transportation department shall set forth in its 
utility accommodation plan detailed procedures, criteria, and standards 
it will use to evaluate and approve individual applications of utilities 
on freeways under the provisions of Sec. 645.209(c) of this part. The 
State transportation department also may develop such procedures, 
criteria and standards by class of utility. In defining utility classes,

[[Page 247]]

consideration may be given to distinguishing utility services by type, 
nature or function and their potential impact on the highway and its 
user.
    (f) The means and authority for enforcing the control of access 
restrictions applicable to utility use of controlled access highway 
facilities should be clearly set forth in the State transportation 
department plan.

Sec. 645.213  Use and occupancy agreements (permits).

    The written arrangements, generally in the form of use and occupancy 
agreements setting forth the terms under which the utility is to cross 
or otherwise occupy the highway right-of-way, must include or 
incorporate by reference:
    (a) The transportation department standards for accommodating 
utilities. Since all of the standards will not be applicable to each 
individual utility installation, the use and occupancy agreement must, 
as a minimum, describe the requirements for location, construction, 
protection of traffic, maintenance, access restriction, and any special 
conditions applicable to each installation.
    (b) A general description of the size, type, nature, and extent of 
the utility facilities being located within the highway right-of-way.
    (c) Adequate drawings or sketches showing the existing and/or 
proposed location of the utility facilities within the highway right-of-
way with respect to the existing and/or planned highway improvements, 
the traveled way, the right-of-way lines and, where applicable, the 
control of access lines and approved access points.
    (d) The extent of liability and responsibilities associated with 
future adjustment of the utilities to accommodate highway improvements.
    (e) The action to be taken in case of noncompliance with the 
transportation department's requirements.
    (f) Other provisions as deemed necessary to comply with laws and 
regulations.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
2125-0522)


<R05>
Sec. 645.215  Approvals.

    (a) Each State transportation department shall submit a statement to 
the FHWA on the authority of utilities to use and occupy the right-of-
way of State highways, the State transportation department's power to 
regulate such use, and the policies the State transportation department 
employs or proposes to employ for accommodating utilities within the 
right-of-way Federal-aid highways under its jurisdiction. Statements 
previously submitted and approved by the FHWA need not be resubmitted 
provided the statement adequately addresses the requirements of this 
part. When revisions are deemed necessary the changes to the previously 
approved statement may be submitted separately to the FHWA for approval. 
The State transportation department shall include similar information on 
the use and occupancy of such highways by private lines where permitted. 
The State shall identify those areas, if any, of Federal-aid highways 
within its borders where the State transportation department is without 
legal authority to regulate use by utilities. The statement shall 
address the nature of the formal agreements with local officials 
required by Sec. 645.209(g) of this part. It is expected that the 
statements required by this part or necessary revisions to previously 
submitted and approved statements will be submitted to FHWA within 1 
year of the effective date of this regulation.
    (b) Upon determination by the FHWA that a State transportation 
department's policies satisfy the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 109, 111, and 
116, and 23 CFR 1.23 and 1.27, and meet the requirements of this 
regulation, the FHWA will approve their use on Federal-aid highway 
projects in that State
    (c) Any changes, additions or deletions the State transportation 
department proposes to the approved policies are subject to FHWA 
approval.

[[Page 248]]

    (d) When a utility files a notice or makes an individual application 
or request to a STD to use or occupy the right-of-way of a Federal-aid 
highway project, the STD is not required to submit the matter to the 
FHWA for prior concurrence, except when the proposed installation is not 
in accordance with this regulation or with the STD's utility 
accommodation policy approved by the FHWA for use on Federal-aid highway 
projects.
    (e) The State transportation department's practices under the 
policies or agreements approved under Sec. 645.215(b) of this part 
shall be periodically reviewed by the FHWA.

<R05>
Sec. 646.101  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to prescribe provisions under which 
Federal funds may be applied to the costs of public liability and 
property damage insurance obtained by contractors (a) for their own 
operations, and (b) on behalf of railroads on or about whose right-of-
way the contractors are required to work in the construction of highway 
projects financed in whole or in part with Federal funds.


<R05>
Sec. 646.103  Application.

    (a) This part applies:
    (1) To a contractors' legal liability for bodily injury to, or death 
of, persons and for injury to, or destruction of, property.
    (2) To the liability which may attach to railroads for bodily injury 
to, or death of, persons and for injury to, or destruction of, property.
    (3) To damage to property owned by or in the care, custody or 
control of the railroads, both as such liability or damage may arise out 
of the contractor's operations, or may result from work performed by 
railroads at or about railroad rights-of-way in connection with projects 
financed in whole or in part with Federal funds.
    (b) Where the highway construction is under the direct supervision 
of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), all references herein to 
the State shall be considered as references to the FHWA.


<R05>
Sec. 646.105  Contractor's public liability and property damage insurance.

    (a) Contractors may be subject to liability with respect to bodily 
injury to or death of persons, and injury to, or destruction of 
property, which may be suffered by persons other than their own 
employees as a result of their operations in connection with 
construction of highway projects located in whole or in part within 
railroad right-of-way and financed in whole or in part with Federal 
funds. Protection to cover such liability of contractors shall be

[[Page 249]]

furnished under regular contractors' public liability and property 
damage insurance policies issued in the names of the contractors. Such 
policies shall be so written as to furnish protection to contractors 
respecting their operations in performing work covered by their 
contract.
    (b) Where a contractor sublets a part of the work on any project to 
a subcontractor, the contractor shall be required to secure insurance 
protection in his own behalf under contractor's public liability and 
property damage insurance policies to cover any liability imposed on him 
by law for damages because of bodily injury to, or death of, persons and 
injury to, or destruction of, property as a result of work undertaken by 
such subcontractors. In addition, the contractor shall provide for and 
on behalf of any such subcontractors protection to cover like liability 
imposed upon the latter as a result of their operations by means of 
separate and individual contractor's public liability and property 
damage policies; or, in the alternative, each subcontractor shall 
provide satisfactory insurance on his own behalf to cover his individual 
operations.
    (c) The contractor shall furnish to the State highway department 
evidence satisfactory to such department and to the FHWA that the 
insurance coverages required herein have been provided. The contractor 
shall also furnish a copy of such evidence to the railroad or railroads 
involved. The insurance specified shall be kept in force until all work 
required to be performed shall have been satisfactorily completed and 
accepted in accordance with the contract under which the construction 
work is undertaken.


<R05>
Sec. 646.107  Railroad protective insurance.

    In connection with highway projects for the elimination of hazards 
of railroad-highway crossings and other highway construction projects 
located in whole or in part within railroad right-of-way, railroad 
protective liability insurance shall be purchased on behalf of the 
railroad by the contractor. The standards for railroad protective 
insurance established by Sec. Sec. 646.109 through 646.111 shall be 
adhered to insofar as the insurance laws of the State will permit.

account of occurrences arising out of the work of the contractor on or 
about the railroad right-of-way, independent of the railroad's general 
supervision or control, except as noted in Sec. 646.109(b) (4).
    (b) Coverage shall include:
    (1) Death of or bodily injury to passengers of the railroad and 
employees of the railroad not covered by State workmen's compensation 
laws;
    (2) Personal property owned by or in the care, custody or control of 
the railroads;
    (3) The contractor, or any of his agents or employees who suffer 
bodily injury or death as the result of acts of the railroad or its 
agents, regardless of the negligence of the railroad;
    (4) Negligence of only the following classes of railroad employees:
    (i) Any supervisory employee of the railroad at the job site;
    (ii) Any employee of the railroad while operating, attached to, or 
engaged on, work trains or other railroad equipment at the job site 
which are assigned exclusively to the contractor; or
    (iii) Any employee of the railroad not within (b)(4) (i) or (ii) who 
is specifically loaned or assigned to the work of the contractor for 
prevention of accidents or protection of property, the cost of whose 
services is borne specifically by the contractor or governmental 
authority.


<R05>
Sec. 646.111  Amount of coverage.

    (a) The maximum dollar amounts of coverage to be reimbursed from 
Federal funds with respect to bodily injury, death and property damage 
is limited to a combined amount of $2 million per occurrence with an 
aggregate of $6 million applying separately to each annual period except 
as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) In cases involving real and demonstrable danger of appreciably 
higher risks, higher dollar amounts of coverage for which premiums will 
be reimbursable from Federal funds shall be

[[Page 250]]

allowed. These larger amounts will depend on circumstances and shall be 
written for the individual project in accordance with standard 
underwriting practices upon approval of the FHWA.

to Federal-aid projects.
    (b) Pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 130(b), and 49 CFR 1.48:
    (1) Projects for grade crossing improvements are deemed to be of no 
ascertainable net benefit to the railroads and there shall be no 
required railroad share of the costs.
    (2) Projects for the reconstruction of existing grade separations 
are deemed to generally be of no ascertainable net benefit to the 
railroad and there shall be no required railroad share of the costs, 
unless the railroad has a specific contractual obligation with the State 
or its political subdivision to share in the costs.
    (3) On projects for the elimination of existing grade crossings at 
which active warning devices are in place or ordered to be installed by 
a State regulatory agency, the railroad share of the project costs shall 
be 5 percent.
    (4) On projects for the elimination of existing grade crossings at 
which active warning devices are not in place and have not been ordered 
installed by a State regulatory agency, or on projects which do not 
eliminate an existing crossing, there shall be no required railroad 
share of the project cost.
    (c) The required railroad share of the cost under Sec. 646.210(b) 
(3) shall be based on the costs for preliminary engineering, right-of-
way and construction within the limits described below:
    (1) Where a grade crossing is eliminated by grade separation, the 
structure and approaches required to transition to a theoretical highway 
profile which would have been constructed if there were no railroad 
present, for the number of lanes on the existing highway and in 
accordance with the current design standards of the State highway 
agency.
    (2) Where another facility, such as a highway or waterway, requiring 
a bridge structure is located within the limits of a grade separation 
project, the estimated cost of a theoretical structure and approaches as 
described in Sec. 646.210(c) (1) to eliminate the railroad-highway 
grade crossing without considering the presence of the waterway or other 
highway.
    (3) Where a grade crossing is eliminated by railroad or highway 
relocation, the actual cost of the relocation project, the estimated 
cost of the relocation project, or the estimated cost of a structure and 
approaches as described in Sec. 646.210(c)(1), whichever is less.
    (d) Railroads may voluntarily contribute a greater share of project 
costs than is required. Also, other parties may voluntarily assume the 
railroad's share.


<R05>
Sec. 646.212  Federal share.

    (a) General. (1) Federal funds are not eligible to participate in 
costs incurred solely for the benefit of the railroad.
    (2) At grade separations Federal funds are eligible to participate 
in costs to provide space for more tracks than are in place when the 
railroad establishes to the satisfaction of the State highway agency and 
FHWA that it has a definite demand and plans for installation of the 
additional tracks within a reasonable time.
    (3) The Federal share of the cost of a grade separation project 
shall be based on the cost to provide horizontal and/or

[[Page 252]]

vertical clearances used by the railroad in its normal practice subject 
to limitations as shown in the appendix or as required by a State 
regulatory agency.
    (b) The Federal share of railroad/highway crossing projects may be:
    (1) Regular pro rata sharing as provided by 23 U.S.C. 120(a) and 
120(b).

railroad for maintenance and operation shall conform to the 
specifications and design standards used by the railroad in its normal 
practice, subject to approval by the State highway agency and FHWA.
    (2) Facilities that are the responsibility of the highway agency for 
maintenance and operation shall conform to the specifications and design 
standards and guides used by the highway agency in its normal practice 
for Federal-aid projects.
    (b) Grade crossing improvements. (1) All traffic control devices 
proposed shall comply with the latest edition of the Manual on Uniform 
Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways supplemented to the 
extent applicable by State standards.
    (2) Pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 109(e), where a railroad-highway grade 
crossing is located within the limits of or near the terminus of a 
Federal-aid highway project for construction of a new highway or 
improvement of the existing roadway, the crossing shall not be opened 
for unrestricted use by traffic or the project accepted by FHWA until 
adequate warning devices for the crossing are installed and functioning 
properly.
    (3)(i) Adequate warning devices, under Sec. 646.214(b) (2) or on 
any project where Federal-aid funds participate in the installation of 
the devices are to include automatic gates with flashing light signals 
when one or more of the following conditions exist:
    (A) Multiple main line railroad tracks.
    (B) Multiple tracks at or in the vicinity of the crossing which may 
be occupied by a train or locomotive so as to obscure the movement of 
another train approaching the crossing.
    (C) High Speed train operation combined with limited sight distance 
at either single or multiple track crossings.
    (D) A combination of high speeds and moderately high volumes of 
highway and railroad traffic.
    (E) Either a high volume of vehicular traffic, high number of train 
movements, substantial numbers of schoolbuses or trucks carrying 
hazardous materials, unusually restricted sight distance, continuing 
accident occurrences, or any combination of these conditions.
    (F) A diagnostic team recommends them.
    (ii) In individual cases where a diagnostic team justifies that 
gates are not appropriate, FHWA may find that the above requirements are 
not applicable.
    (4) For crossings where the requirements of Sec. 646.214(b) (3) are 
not applicable, the type of warning device to be installed, whether the 
determination is made by a State regulatory agency, State highway 
agency, and/or the railroad, is subject to the approval of FHWA.
    (c) Grade crossing elimination. All crossings of railroads and 
highways at grade shall be eliminated where there is full control of 
access on the highway (a freeway) regardless of the volume of railroad 
or highway traffic.

to the provisions of Sec. 646.216(b) (2), preliminary engineering work 
on railroad-highway projects may be accomplished by one of the following 
methods:

[[Page 253]]

    (i) The State or railroad's engineering forces;
    (ii) An engineering consultant selected by the State after 
consultation with the railroad, and with the State administering the 
contract; or
    (iii) An engineering consultant selected by the railroad, with the 
approval of the State and with the railroad administering the contract.
    (2) Where a railroad is not adequately staffed, Federal-aid funds 
may participate in the amounts paid to engineering consultants and 
others for required services, provided such amounts are not based on a 
percentage of the cost of construction, either under contracts for 
individual projects or under existing written continuing contracts where 
such work is regularly performed for the railroad in its own work under 
such contracts at reasonable costs.
    (c) Rights-of-way. (1) Acquisition of right-of-way by a State 
highway agency on behalf of a railroad or acquisition of nonoperating 
real property from a railroad shall be in accordance with the Uniform 
Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 
(42 U.S.C. 4601 et seq.) and applicable FHWA right-of-way procedures in 
23 CFR, chapter I, subchapter H. On projects for the elimination of 
hazards of railroad-highway crossings by the relocation of railroads, 
acquisition or replacement right-of-way by a railroad shall be in 
accordance with 42 U.S.C. 4601 et seq.
    (2) Where buildings and other depreciable structures of the railroad 
(such as signal towers, passenger stations, depots, and other buildings, 
and equipment housings) which are integral to operation of railroad 
traffic are wholly or partly affected by a highway project, the costs of 
work necessary to functionally restore such facilities are eligible for 
participation. However, when replacement of such facilities is 
necessary, credits shall be made to the cost of the project for:
    (i) Accrued depreciation, which is that amount based on the ratio 
between the period of actual length of service and total life expectancy 
applied to the original cost.
    (ii) Additions or improvements which provide higher quality or 
increased service capability of the facility and which are provided 
solely for the benefit of the railroad.
    (iii) Actual salvage value of the material recovered from the 
facility being replaced. Total credits to a project shall not be 
required in excess of the replacement cost of the facility.
    (3) Where Federal funds participate in the cost of replacement 
right-of-way, there will be no charge to the project for the railroad's 
existing right-of-way being transferred to the State highway agency 
except when the value of the right-of-way being taken exceeds the value 
of the replacement right-of-way.
    (d) State-railroad agreements. (1) Where construction of a Federal-
aid project requires use of railroad properties or adjustments to 
railroad facilities, there shall be an agreement in writing between the 
State highway agency and the railroad company.
    (2) The written agreement between the State and the railroad shall, 
as a minimum include the following, where applicable:
    (i) The provisions of this subpart and of 23 CFR part 140, subpart 
I, incorporated by reference.
    (ii) A detailed statement of the work to be performed by each party.
    (iii) Method of payment (either actual cost or lump sum),
    (iv) For projects which are not for the elimination of hazards of 
railroad-highway crossings, the extent to which the railroad is 
obligated to move or adjust its facilities at its own expense,
    (v) The railroad's share of the project cost,
    (vi) An itemized estimate of the cost of the work to be performed by 
the railroad,
    (vii) Method to be used for performing the work, either by railroad 
forces or by contract,
    (viii) Maintenance responsibility,
    (ix) Form, duration, and amounts of any needed insurance,
    (x) Appropriate reference to or identification of plans and 
specifications,
    (xi) Statements defining the conditions under which the railroad 
will provide or require protective services during performance of the 
work, the type of protective services and the method of reimbursement to 
the railroad, and

[[Page 254]]

    (xii) Provisions regarding inspection of any recovered materials.
    (3) On work to be performed by the railroad with its own forces and 
where the State highway agency and railroad agree, subject to approval 
by FHWA, an agreement providing for a lump sum payment in lieu of later 
determination of actual costs may be used for any of the following:
    (i) Installation or improvement of grade crossing warning devices 
and/or grade crossing surfaces, regardless of cost, or
    (ii) Any other eligible work where the estimated cost to the State 
of the proposed railroad work does not exceed $100,000 or
    (iii) Where FHWA finds that the circumstances are such that this 
method of developing costs would be in the best interest of the public.
    (4) Where the lump sum method of payment is used, periodic reviews 
and analyses of the railroad's methods and cost data used to develop 
lump sum estimates will be made.
    (5) Master agreements between a State and a railroad on an areawide 
or statewide basis may be used. These agreements would contain the 
specifications, regulations, and provisions required in conjunction with 
work performed on all projects. Supporting data for each project or 
group of projects must, when combined with the master agreement by 
reference, satisfy the provisions of Sec. 646.216(d)(2).
    (6) Official orders issued by regulatory agencies will be accepted 
in lieu of State-railroad agreements only where, together with 
supplementary written understandings between the State and the railroad, 
they include the items required by Sec. 646.216(d) (2).
    (7) In extraordinary cases where FHWA finds that the circumstances 
are such that requiring such agreement or order would not be in the best 
interest of the public, projects may be approved for construction with 
the aid of Federal funds, provided satisfactory commitments have been 
made with respect to construction, maintenance and the railroad share of 
project costs.
    (e) Authorizations. (1) The costs of preliminary engineering, right-
of-way acquisition, and construction incurred after the date each phase 
of the work is included in an approved statewide transportation 
improvement program and authorized by the FHWA are eligible for Federal-
aid participation. Preliminary engineering and right-of-way acquisition 
costs which are otherwise eligible, but incurred by a railroad prior to 
authorization by the FHWA, although not reimbursable, may be included as 
part of the railroad share of project cost where such a share is 
required.
    (2) Prior to issuance of authorization by FHWA either to advertise 
the physical construction for bids or to proceed with force account 
construction for railroad work or for other construction affected by 
railroad work, the following must be accomplished:
    (i) The plans, specifications and estimates must be approved by 
FHWA.
    (ii) A proposed agreement between the State and railroad must be 
found satisfactory by FHWA. Before Federal funds may be used to 
reimburse the State for railroad costs the executed agreement must be 
approved by FHWA. However, cost for materials stockpiled at the project 
site or specifically purchased and delivered to the company for use on 
the project may be reimbursed on progress billings prior to the approval 
of the executed State-Railroad Agreement in accordance with 23 CFR 
140.922(a) and Sec. 646.218 of this part.
    (iii) Adequate provisions must be made for any needed easements, 
right-of-way, temporary crossings for construction purposes or other 
property interests.
    (iv) The pertinent portions of the State-railroad agreement 
applicable to any protective services required during performance of the 
work must be included in the project specifications and special 
provisions for any construction contract.
    (3) In unusual cases, pending compliance with Sec. 646.216(e) (2) 
(ii), (iii) and (iv), authorization may be given by FHWA to advertise 
for bids for highway construction under conditions where a railroad 
grants a right-of-entry to its property as necessary to prosecute the 
physical construction.
    (f) Construction. (1) Construction may be accomplished by:
    (i) Railroad force account,

[[Page 255]]

    (ii) Contracting with the lowest qualified bidder based on 
appropriate solicitation,
    (iii) Existing continuing contracts at reasonable costs, or
    (iv) Contract without competitive bidding, for minor work, at 
reasonable costs.
    (2) Reimbursement will not be made for any increased costs due to 
changes in plans:
    (i) For the convenience of the contractor, or
    (ii) Not approved by the State and FHWA.
    (3) The State and FHWA shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to 
inspect materials recovered by the railroad prior to disposal by sale or 
scrap. This requirement will be satisfied by the railroad giving written 
notice, or oral notice with prompt written confirmation, to the State of 
the time and place where the materials will be available for inspection. 
The giving of notice is the responsibility of the railroad, and it may 
be held accountable for full value of materials disposed of without 
notice.
    (4) In addition to normal construction costs, the following 
construction costs are eligible for participation with Federal-aid funds 
when approved by the State and FHWA:
    (i) The cost of maintaining temporary facilities of a railroad 
company required by and during the highway construction to the extent 
that such costs exceed the documented normal cost of maintaining the 
permanent facilities.
    (ii) The cost of stage or extended construction involving grade 
corrections and/or slope stabilization for permanent tracks of a 
railroad which are required to be relocated on new grade by the highway 
construction. Stage or extended construction will be approved by FHWA 
only when documentation submitted by the State establishes the proposed 
method of construction to be the only practical method and that the cost 
of the extended construction within the period specified is estimated to 
be less than the cost of any practicable alternate procedure.
    (iii) The cost of restoring the company's service by adustments of 
existing facilities away from the project site, in lieu of and not to 
exceed the cost of replacing, adjusting or relocating facilities at the 
project site.
    (iv) The cost of an addition or improvement to an existing railroad 
facility which is required by the highway construction.

Sec. 646.218  Simplified procedure for accelerating grade crossing improvements.

    (a) The procedure set forth in this section is encouraged for use in 
simplifying and accelerating the processing of single or multiple grade 
crossing improvements.
    (b) Eligible preliminary engineering costs may include those 
incurred in selecting crossings to be improved, determining the type of 
improvement for each crossing, estimating the cost and preparing the 
required agreement.
    (c) The written agreement between a State and a railroad shall 
contain as a minimum:
    (1) Identification of each crossing location.
    (2) Description of improvement and estimate of cost for each 
crossing location.
    (3) Estimated schedule for completion of work at each location.
    (d) Following programming, authorization and approval of the 
agreement under Sec. 646.218(c), FHWA may authorize construction, 
including acquisition of warning device materials, with the condition 
that work at any particular location will not be undertaken until the 
proposed or executed State-railroad agreement under Sec. 646.216(d) (2) 
is found satisfactory by FHWA and the final plans, specifications, and 
estimates are approved and with the condition that only material 
actually incorporated into the project will be eligible for Federal 
participation.

<R05>
Sec. 646.220  Alternate Federal-State procedure.

    (a) On other than Interstate projects, an alternate procedure may be 
used, at the election of the State, for processing certain types of 
railroad-highway work. Under this procedure, the State highway agency 
will act in the relative position of FHWA for reviewing and approving 
projects.
    (b) The scope of the State's approval authority under the alternate 
procedure includes all actions necessary to advance and complete the 
following types of railroad-highway work:
    (1) All types of grade crossing improvements under Sec. 646.206(a) 
(3).
    (2) Minor adjustments to railroad facilities under Sec. 646.206(b).
    (c) The following types of work are to be reviewed and approved in 
the normal manner, as prescribed elsewhere in this subpart.

    (2) Major adjustments to railroad facilities under Sec. 646.206(b).
    (d) Any State wishing to adopt the alternate procedure may file a 
formal application for approval by FHWA. The application must include 
the following:
    (1) The State's written policies and procedures for administering 
and processing Federal-aid railroad-highway work, which make adequate 
provisions with respect to all of the following:
    (i) Compliance with the provisions of title 23 U.S.C., title 23 CFR, 
and other applicable Federal laws and Executive Orders.
    (ii) Compliance with this subpart and 23 CFR part 140, subpart I and 
23 CFR part 172.
    (iii) For grade crossing safety improvements, compliance with the 
requirements of 23 CFR part 924.
    (2) A statement signed by the Chief Administrative Officer of the 
State highway agency certifying that:
    (i) The work will be done in accordance with the applicable 
provisions of the State's policies and procedures submitted under Sec. 
646.220(d)(1), and
    (ii) Reimbursement will be requested in only those costs properly 
attributable to the highway construction and eligible for Federal fund 
participation.
    (e) When FHWA has approved the alternate procedure, it may authorize 
the State to proceed in accordance with the State's certification, 
subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The work has been programmed.

    Sec. Appendix to Subpart B of Part 646--Horizontal and Vertical 
       Clearance Provisions for Overpass and Underpass Structures

    The following implements provisions of 23 CFR 646.212(a)(3).
a. Lateral Geometrics
    A cross section with a horizontal distance of 6.1 meters, measured 
at right angles from the centerline of track at the top of rails, to the 
face of the embankment slope, may be approved. The 6.1-meters distance 
may be increased at individual structure locations as appropriate to 
provide for drainage if justified by a hydraulic analysis or to allow 
adequate room to accommodate special conditions, such as where heavy and 
drifting snow is a problem. The railroad must demonstrate that this is 
its normal practice to address these special conditions in the manner 
proposed. Additionally, this distance may also be increased up to 2.5 
meters as may be necessary for off-track maintenance equipment, provided 
adequate horizontal clearance is not available in adjacent spans and 
where justified by the presence of an existing maintenance road or by 
evidence of future need for such equipment. All piers should be placed 
at least 2.8 meters horizontally from the centerline of the track and 
preferably beyond the drainage ditch. For multiple track facilities, all 
dimensions apply to the centerline of the outside track.
    Any increase above the 6.1-meters horizontal clearance distance must 
be required by specific site conditions and be justified by the railroad 
to the satisfaction of the State highway agency (SHA) and the FHWA.
b. Vertical Clearance

[[Page 257]]

    A vertical clearance of 7.1 meters above the top of rails, which 
includes an allowance for future ballasting of the railroad tracks, may 
be approved. Vertical clearance greater than 7.1 meters may be approved 
when the State regulatory agency having jurisdiction over such matters 
requires a vertical clearance in excess of 7.1 meters or on a site by 
site basis where justified by the railroad to the satisfaction of the 
SHA and the FHWA. A railroad's justification for increased vertical 
clearance should be based on an analysis of engineering, operational 
and/or economic conditions at a specific structure location.
    Federal-aid highway funds are also eligible to participate in the 
cost of providing vertical clearance greater than 7.1 meters where a 
railroad establishes to the satisfaction of a SHA and the FHWA that it 
has a definite formal plan for electrification of its rail system where 
the proposed grade separation project is located. The plan must cover a 
logical independent segment of the rail system and be approved by the 
railroad's corporate headquarters. For 25 kv line, a vertical clearance 
of 7.4 meters may be approved. For 50 kv line, a vertical clearance of 
8.0 meters may be approved.
    A railroad's justification to support its plan for electrification 
shall include maps and plans or drawings showing those lines to be 
electrified; actions taken by its corporate headquarters committing it 
to electrification including a proposed schedule; and actions initiated 
or completed to date implementing its electrification plan such as a 
showing of the amounts of funds and identification of structures, if 
any, where the railroad has expended its own funds to provide added 
clearance for the proposed electrification. If available, the railroad's 
justification should include information on its contemplated treatment 
of existing grade separations along the section of its rail system 
proposed for electrification.
    The cost of reconstructing or modifying any existing railroad-
highway grade separation structures solely to accommodate 
electrification will not be eligible for Federal-aid highway fund 
participation.
c. Railroad Structure Width
    Two and eight tenths meters of structure width outside of the 
centerline of the outside tracks may be approved for a structure 
carrying railroad tracks. Greater structure width may be approved when 
in accordance with standards established and used by the affected 
railroad in its normal practice.
    In order to maintain continuity of off-track equipment roadways at 
structures carrying tracks over limited access highways, consideration 
should be given at the preliminary design stage to the feasibility of 
using public road crossings for this purpose. Where not feasible, an 
additional structure width of 2.5 meters may be approved if designed for 
off-track equipment only.

<R04>
Subpart A_Location and Hydraulic Design of Encroachments on Flood Plains

    Source: 44 FR 67580, Nov. 26, 1979, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 650.101  Purpose.

    To prescribe Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) policies and 
procedures for the location and hydraulic design of highway 
encroachments on flood plains, including direct Federal highway projects 
administered by the FHWA.


<R05>
Sec. 650.103  Policy.

    It is the policy of the FHWA:
    (a) To encourage a broad and unified effort to prevent uneconomic, 
hazardous or incompatible use and development of the Nation's flood 
plains,
    (b) To avoid longitudinal encroachments, where practicable,
    (c) To avoid significant encroachments, where practicable,
    (d) To minimize impacts of highway agency actions which adversely 
affect base flood plains,
    (e) To restore and preserve the natural and beneficial flood-plain 
values that are adversely impacted by highway agency actions,
    (f) To avoid support of incompatible flood-plain development,
    (g) To be consistent with the intent of the Standards and Criteria 
of the National Flood Insurance Program, where appropriate, and
    (h) To incorporate ``A Unified National Program for Floodplain 
Management'' of the Water Resources Council into FHWA procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 650.105  Definitions.

    (a) Action shall mean any highway construction, reconstruction, 
rehabilitation, repair, or improvement undertaken with Federal or 
Federal-aid highway funds or FHWA approval.
    (b) Base flood shall mean the flood or tide having a 1-percent 
chance of being exceeded in any given year.
    (c) Base flood plain shall mean the area subject to flooding by the 
base flood.
    (d) Design Flood shall mean the peak discharge, volume if 
appropriate, stage or wave crest elevation of the flood associated with 
the probability of exceedance selected for the design of a highway 
encroachment. By definition, the highway will not be inundated from the 
stage of the design flood.
    (e) Encroachment shall mean an action within the limits of the base 
flood plain.
    (f) Floodproof shall mean to design and construct individual 
buildings, facilities, and their sites to protect against structural 
failure, to keep water out or to reduce the effects of water entry.
    (g) Freeboard shall mean the vertical clearance of the lowest 
structural member of the bridge superstructure above the water surface 
elevation of the overtopping flood.
    (h) Minimize shall mean to reduce to the smallest practicable amount 
or degree.
    (i) Natural and beneficial flood-plain values shall include but are 
not limited to fish, wildlife, plants, open space, natural beauty, 
scientific study, outdoor recreation, agriculture, aquaculture, 
forestry, natural moderation of floods, water quality maintenance, and 
groundwater recharge.
    (j) Overtopping flood shall mean the flood described by the 
probability of exceedance and water surface elevation at which flow 
occurs over the highway, over the watershed divide, or through

[[Page 259]]

structure(s) provided for emergency relief.
    (k) Practicable shall mean capable of being done within reasonable 
natural, social, or economic constraints.
    (l) Preserve shall mean to avoid modification to the functions of 
the natural flood-plain environment or to maintain it as closely as 
practicable in its natural state.
    (m) Regulatory floodway shall mean the flood-plain area that is 
reserved in an open manner by Federal, State or local requirements, 
i.e., unconfined or unobstructed either horizontally or vertically, to 
provide for the discharge of the base flood so that the cumulative 
increase in water surface elevation is no more than a designated amount 
(not to exceed 1 foot as established by the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency (FEMA) for administering the National Flood Insurance Program).
    (n) Restore shall mean to reestablish a setting or environment in 
which the functions of the natural and beneficial flood-plain values 
adversely impacted by the highway agency action can again operate.
    (o) Risk shall mean the consequences associated with the probability 
of flooding attributable to an encroachment. It shall include the 
potential for property loss and hazard to life during the service life 
of the highway.
    (p) Risk analysis shall mean an economic comparison of design 
alternatives using expected total costs (construction costs plus risk 
costs) to determine the alternative with the least total expected cost 
to the public. It shall include probable flood-related costs during the 
service life of the facility for highway operation, maintenance, and 
repair, for highway-aggravated flood damage to other property, and for 
additional or interrupted highway travel.
    (q) Significant encroachment shall mean a highway encroachment and 
any direct support of likely base flood-plain development that would 
involve one or more of the following construction-or flood-related 
impacts:
    (1) A significant potential for interruption or termination of a 
transportation facility which is needed for emergency vehicles or 
provides a community's only evacuation route.
    (2) A significant risk, or
    (3) A significant adverse impact on natural and beneficial flood-
plain values.
    (r) Support base flood-plain development shall mean to encourage, 
allow, serve, or otherwise facilitate additional base flood-plain 
development. Direct support results from an encroachment, while indirect 
support results from an action out of the base flood plain.


<R05>
Sec. 650.107  Applicability.

    (a) The provisions of this regulation shall apply to all 
encroachments and to all actions which affect base flood plains, except 
for repairs made with emergency funds (23 CFR part 668) during or 
immediately following a disaster.
    (b) The provisions of this regulation shall not apply to or alter 
approvals or authorizations which were given by FHWA pursuant to 
regulations or directives in effect before the effective date of this 
regulation.


<R05>
Sec. 650.109  Public involvement.

    Procedures which have been established to meet the public 
involvement requirements of 23 CFR part 771 shall be used to provide 
opportunity for early public review and comment on alternatives which 
contain encroachments.

[53 FR 11065, Apr. 5, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 650.111  Location hydraulic studies.

    (a) National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) maps or information 
developed by the highway agency, if NFIP maps are not available, shall 
be used to determine whether a highway location alternative will include 
an encroachment.

Sec. 650.115  Design standards.

    (a) The design selected for an encroachment shall be supported by 
analyses of design alternatives with consideration given to capital 
costs and risks, and to other economic, engineering, social and 
environmental concerns.
    (1) Consideration of capital costs and risks shall include, as 
appropriate, a risk analysis or assessment which includes:
    (i) The overtopping flood or the base flood, whichever is greater, 
or
    (ii) The greatest flood which must flow through the highway drainage 
structure(s), where overtopping is not practicable. The greatest flood 
used in the analysis is subject to state-of-the-art capability to 
estimate the exceedance probability.
    (2) The design flood for encroachments by through lanes of 
Interstate highways shall not be less than the flood with a 2-percent 
chance of being exceeded in any given year. No minimum design flood is 
specified for Interstate highway ramps and frontage roads or for other 
highways.
    (3) Freeboard shall be provided, where practicable, to protect 
bridge structures from debris- and scour-related failure.
    (4) The effect of existing flood control channels, levees, and 
reservoirs shall be considered in estimating the peak discharge and 
stage for all floods considered in the design.
    (5) The design of encroachments shall be consistent with standards 
established by the FEMA, State, and local governmental agencies for the 
administration of the National Flood Insurance Program for:
    (i) All direct Federal highway actions, unless the standards are 
demonstrably inappropriate, and
    (ii) Federal-aid highway actions where a regulatory floodway has 
been designated or where studies are underway to establish a regulatory 
floodway.
    (b) Rest area buildings and related water supply and waste treatment 
facilities shall be located outside the base flood plain, where 
practicable. Rest area buildings which are located on the base flood 
plain shall be floodproofed against damage from the base flood.

[[Page 261]]

    (c) Where highway fills are to be used as dams to permanently 
impound water more than 50 acre-feet (6.17x10\4\ cubic metres) in volume 
or 25 feet (7.6 metres) deep, the hydrologic, hydraulic, and structural 
design of the fill and appurtenant spillways shall have the approval of 
the State or Federal agency responsible for the safety of dams or like 
structures within the State, prior to authorization by the Division 
Administrator to advertise for bids for construction.


<R05>
Sec. 650.117  Content of design studies.

    (a) The detail of studies shall be commensurate with the risk 
associated with the encroachment and with other economic, engineering, 
social or environmental concerns.
    (b) Studies by highway agencies shall contain:
    (1) The hydrologic and hydraulic data and design computations,
    (2) The analysis required by Sec. 650.115(a), and
    (3) For proposed direct Federal highway actions, the reasons, when 
applicable, why FEMA criteria (44 CFR 60.3, formerly 24 CFR 1910.3) are 
demonstrably inappropriate.
    (c) For encroachment locations, project plans shall show:
    (1) The magnitude, approximate probability of exceedance and, at 
appropriate locations, the water surface elevations associated with the 
overtopping flood or the flood of Sec. 650.115(a)(1)(ii), and
    (2) The magnitude and water surface elevation of the base flood, if 
larger than the overtopping flood.

<R05>
Sec. 650.203  Policy.

    It is the policy of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) that 
all highways funded in whole or in part under title 23, United States 
Code, shall be located, designed, constructed and operated according to 
standards that will minimize erosion and sediment damage to the highway 
and adjacent properties and abate pollution of surface and ground water 
resources. Guidance for the development of standards used to minimize 
erosion and sediment damage is referenced in Sec. 650.211 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 650.205  Definitions.

    Erosion control measures and practices are actions that are taken to 
inhibit the dislodging and transporting of soil particles by water or 
wind, including actions that limit the area of exposed soil and minimize 
the time the soil is exposed.
    Permanent erosion and sediment control measures and practices are 
installations and design features of a construction project which remain 
in place and in service after completion of the project.
    Pollutants are substances, including sediment, which cause 
deterioration of water quality when added to surface or ground waters in 
sufficient quantity.
    Sediment control measures and practices are actions taken to control 
the deposition of sediments resulting from surface runoff.
    Temporary erosion and sediment control measures and practices are 
actions taken on an interim basis during construction to minimize the 
disturbance, transportation, and unwanted deposition of sediment.


<R05>
Sec. 650.207  Plans, specifications and estimates.

    (a) Emphasis shall be placed on erosion control in the preparation 
of plans, specifications and estimates.
    (b) All reasonable steps shall be taken to insure that highway 
project designs for the control of erosion and sedimentation and the 
protection of water quality comply with applicable standards and 
regulations of other agencies.

damage and special inspections enter the SI&A data into the State or 
Federal agency inventory within 90 days of the date of inspection for 
State or Federal agency bridges and within 180 days of the date of 
inspection for all other bridges.
    (c) For existing bridge modifications that alter previously recorded 
data and for new bridges, enter the SI&A data into the State or Federal 
agency inventory within 90 days after the completion of the work for 
State or Federal agency bridges and within 180 days after the completion 
of the work for all other bridges.
    (d) For changes in load restriction or closure status, enter the 
SI&A data into the State or Federal agency inventory within 90 days 
after the change in status of the structure for State or Federal agency 
bridges and within 180 days after the change in status of the structure

     Subpart D_Highway Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program

    Source: 44 FR 15665, Mar. 15, 1979, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 650.401  Purpose.

    The purpose of this regulation is to prescribe policies and outline 
procedures for administering the Highway Bridge Replacement and 
Rehabilitation Program in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 144.

[[Page 268]]


<R05>
Sec. 650.403  Definition of terms.

    As used in this regulation:
    (a) Bridge. A structure, including supports, erected over a 
depression or an obstruction, such as water, a highway, or a railway, 
having a track or passageway for carrying traffic or other moving loads, 
and having an opening measured along the center of the roadway of more 
than 20 feet between undercopings of abutments or spring lines of 
arches, or extreme ends of the openings for multiple boxes; it may 
include multiple pipes where the clear distance between openings is less 
than half of the smaller contiguous opening.
    (b) Sufficiency rating. The numerical rating of a bridge based on 
its structural adequacy and safety, essentiality for public use, and its 
serviceability and functional obsolescence.
    (c) Rehabilitation. The major work required to restore the 
structural integrity of a bridge as well as work necessary to correct 
major safety defects.


<R05>
Sec. 650.405  Eligible projects.

    (a) General. Deficient highway bridges on all public roads may be 
eligible for replacement or rehabilitation.
    (b) Types of projects which are eligible. The following types of 
work are eligible for participation in the Highway Bridge Replacement 
and Rehabilitation Program (HBRRP), hereinafter known as the bridge 
program.
    (1) Replacement. Total replacement of a structurally deficient or 
functionally obsolete bridge with a new facility constructed in the same 
general traffic corridor. A nominal amount of approach work, sufficient 
to connect the new facility to the existing roadway or to return the 
gradeline to an attainable touchdown point in accordance with good 
design practice is also eligible. The replacement structure must meet 
the current geometric, construction and structural standards required 
for the types and volume of projected traffic on the facility over its 
design life.
    (2) Rehabilitation. The project requirements necessary to perform 
the major work required to restore the structural integrity of a bridge 
as well as work necessary to correct major safety defects are eligible 
except as noted under ineligible work. Bridges to be rehabilitated both 
on or off the F-A System shall, as a minimum, conform with the 
provisions of 23 CFR part 625, Design Standards for Federal-aid 
Highways, for the class of highway on which the bridge is a part.
    (c) Ineligible work. Except as otherwise prescribed by the 
Administrator, the costs of long approach fills, causeways, connecting 
roadways, interchanges, ramps, and other extensive earth structures, 
when constructed beyond the attainable touchdown point, are not eligible 
under the bridge program.


<R05>
Sec. 650.407  Application for bridge replacement or rehabilitation.

    (a) Agencies participate in the bridge program by conducting bridge 
inspections and submitting Structure Inventory and Appraisal (SI&A) 
sheet inspection data. Federal and local governments supply SI&A sheet 
data to the State agency for review and processing. The State is 
responsible for submitting the six computer card format or tapes 
containing all public road SI&A sheet bridge information through the 
Division Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for 
processing. These requirements are prescribed in 23 CFR 650.309 and 
650.311, the National Bridge Inspection Standards.
    (b) Inventory data may be submitted as available and shall be 
submitted at such additional times as the FHWA may request.
    (c) Inventory data on bridges that have been strengthened or 
repaired to eliminate deficiencies, or those that have been replaced or 
rehabilitated using bridge replacement and/or other funds, must be 
revised in the inventory through data submission.
    (d) The Secretary may, at the request of a State, inventory bridges, 
on and off the Federal-aid system, for historic significance.

[44 FR 15665, Mar. 15, 1979, as amended at 44 FR 72112, Dec. 13, 1979]


<R05>
Sec. 650.409  Evaluation of bridge inventory.

    (a) Sufficiency rating of bridges. Upon receipt and evaluation of 
the bridge inventory, a sufficiency rating will be assigned to each 
bridge by the Secretary

[[Page 269]]

in accordance with the approved AASHTO \1\ sufficiency rating formula. 
The sufficiency rating will be used as a basis for establishing 
eligibility and priority for replacement or rehabilitation of bridges; 
in general the lower the rating, the higher the priority.

    \1\ American Association of State Highway and Transporation 
Officials, Suite 225, 444 North Capitol Street, NW, Washington, DC 
20001.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Selection of bridges for inclusion in State program. After 
evaluation of the inventory and assignment of sufficiency ratings, the 
Secretary will provide the State with a selection list of bridges within 
the State that are eligible for the bridge program. From that list or 
from previously furnished selection lists, the State may select bridge 
projects.


<R05>
Sec. 650.411  Procedures for bridge replacement and rehabilitation projects.

    (a) Consideration shall be given to projects which will remove from 
service highway bridges most in danger of failure.
    (b) Submission and approval of projects. (1) Bridge replacement or 
rehabilitation projects shall be submitted by the State to the Secretary 
in accordance with 23 CFR part 630, subpart A Federal-Aid Programs, 
Approval and Authorization.
    (2) Funds apportioned to a State shall be made available throughout 
each State on a fair and equitable basis.
    (c)(1) Each approved project will be designed, constructed, and 
inspected for acceptance in the same manner as other projects on the 
system on which the project is located. It shall be the responsibility 
of the State agency to properly maintain, or cause to be properly 
maintained, any project constructed under this bridge program. The State 
highway agency shall enter into a formal agreement for maintenance with 
appropriate local government officials in cases where an eligible 
project is located within and is under the legal authority of such a 
local government.
    (2) Whenever a deficient bridge is replaced or its deficiency 
alleviated by a new bridge under the bridge program, the deficient 
bridge shall either be dismantled or demolished or its use limited to 
the type and volume of traffic the structure can safely service over its 
remaining life. For example, if the only deficiency of the existing 
structure is inadequate roadway width and the combination of the new and 
existing structure can be made to meet current standards for the volume 
of traffic the facility will carry over its design life, the existing 
bridge may remain in place and be incorporated into the system.

[44 FR 15665, Mar. 15, 1979, as amended at 44 FR 72112, Dec. 13, 1979]


<R05>
Sec. 650.413  Funding.

    (a) Funds authorized for carrying out the Highway Bridge Replacement 
and Rehabilitation Program are available for obligation at the beginning 
of the fiscal year for which authorized and remain available for 
expenditure for the same period as funds apportioned for projects on the 
Federal-aid primary system.
    (b) The Federal share payable on account of any project carried out 
under 23 U.S.C. 144 shall be 80 percent of the eligible cost.
    (c) Not less than 15 percent nor more than 35 percent of the 
apportioned funds shall be expended for projects located on public 
roads, other than those on a Federal-aid system. The Secretary after 
consultation with State and local officials may, with respect to a 
State, reduce the requirement for expenditure for bridges not on a 
Federal-aid system when he determines that such State has inadequate 
needs to justify such expenditure.


<R05>
Sec. 650.415  Reports.

    The Secretary must report annually to the Congress on projects 
approved and current inventories together with recommendations for 
further improvements.

         Subpart G_Discretionary Bridge Candidate Rating Factor

    Source: 48 FR 52296, Nov. 17, 1983, unless otherwise noted.

[[Page 270]]


<R05>
Sec. 650.701  Purpose.

    The purpose of this regulation is to describe a rating factor used 
as part of a selection process of allocation of discretionary bridge 
funds made available to the Secretary of Transportation under 23 U.S.C. 
144.


<R05>
Sec. 650.703  Eligible projects.

    (a) Deficient highway bridges on Federal-aid highway system roads 
may be eligible for allocation of discretionary bridge funds to the same 
extent as they are for bridge funds apportioned under 23 U.S.C. 144, 
provided that the total project cost for a discretionary bridge 
candidate is at least $10 million or twice the amont of 23 U.S.C. 144 
funds apportioned to the State during the fiscal year for which funding 
for the candidate bridge is requested.
    (b) After November 14, 2002 only candidate bridges not previously 
selected with a computed rating factor of 100 or less and ready to begin 
construction in the fiscal year in which funds are available for 
obligation will be eligible for consideration.
    (c) Projects from States that have transferred Highway Bridge 
Replacement and Rehabilitation funds to other funding categories will 
not be eligible for funding the following fiscal year.

[48 FR 52296, Nov. 17, 1983, as amended at 67 FR 63542, Oct. 15, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 650.705  Application for discretionary bridge funds.

    Each year through its field offices, the FHWA will issue an annual 
call for discretionary bridge candidate submittals including updates of 
previously submitted but not selected projects. Each State is 
responsible for submitting such data as required for candidate bridges. 
Data requested will include structure number, funds needed by fiscal 
year, total project cost, current average daily truck traffic and a 
narrative describing the existing bridge, the proposed new or 
rehabilitated bridge and other relevant factors which the State believes 
may warrant special consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 650.707  Rating factor.

    (a) The following formula is to be used in the selection process for 
ranking discretionary bridge candidates.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR15OC02.010


The lower the rating factor, the higher the priority for selection and 
funding.
    (b) The terms in the rating factor are defined as follows:
    (1) SR is Sufficiency Rating computed as illustrated in appendix A 
of the Recording and Coding Guide for the Structure Inventory and 
Appraisal of the Nation's Bridges, USDOT/FHWA (latest edition); (If SR 
is less than 1.0, use SR=1.0);
    (2) ADT is Average Daily Traffic in thousands taking the most 
current value from the national bridge inventory data;
    (3) ADTT is Average Daily Truck Traffic in thousands (Pick up trucks 
and light delivery trucks not included). For load posted bridges, the 
ADTT furnished should be that which would use the bridge if traffic were 
not restricted. The ADTT should be the annual average volume, not peak 
or seasonal;
    (4) N is National Highway System Status. N=1 if not on the National 
Highway System. N=1.5 if bridge carries a National Highway System road;
    (5) The last term of the rating factor expression includes the 
State's unobligated balance of funds received under 23 U.S.C. 144 as of 
June 30 preceding the date of calculation, and the total funds received 
under 23 U.S.C. 144 for the last four fiscal years ending with the most 
recent fiscal year of the FHWA's annual call for discretionary bridge 
candidate submittals; (if unobligated HBRRP balance is less than $10 
million, use zero balance);
    (6) TPC is Total Project Cost in millions of dollars;

[[Page 271]]

    (7) HBRRP is Highway Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program;
    (8) ADT' is ADT plus ADTT.
    (c) In order to balance the relative importance of candidate bridges 
with very low (less than one) sufficiency ratings and very low ADT's 
against candidate bridges with high ADT's, the minimum sufficiency 
rating used will be 1.0. If the computed sufficiency rating for a 
candidate bridge is less than 1.0, use 1.0 in the rating factor formula.
    (d) If the unobligated balance of HBRRP funds for the State is less 
than $10 million, the HBRRP modifier is 1.0. This will limit the effect 
of the modifier on those States with small apportionments or those who 
may be accumulating funds to finance a major bridge.

[48 FR 52296, Nov. 17, 1983; 48 FR 53407, Nov. 28, 1983, as amended at 
67 FR 63542, Oct. 15, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 650.709  Special considerations.

    (a) The selection process for new discretionary bridge projects will 
be based upon the rating factor priority ranking. However, although not 
specifically included in the rating factor formula, special 
consideration will be given to bridges that are closed to all traffic or 
that have a load restriction of less than 10 tons. Consideration will 
also be given to bridges with other unique situations, and to bridge 
candidates in States that have not previously been allocated 
discretionary bridge funds. In addition, consideration will be given to 
candidates that receive additional funds or contributions from local, 
State, county, or private sources, but not from Federal sources which 
reduce the total Federal cost or Federal share of the project. These 
funds or contributions may be used to reduce the total project cost for 
use in the rating factor formula.
    (b) The need to administer the program from a balanced national 
perspective requires that the special cases set forth in paragraph (a) 
of this section and other unique situations be considered in the 
discretionary bridge candidate evaluation process.
    (c) Priority consideration will be given to the continuation and 
completion of projects previously begun with discretionary bridge funds 
which will be ready to begin construction in the fiscal year in which 
funds are available for obligation.

              Subpart H_Navigational Clearances for Bridges

    Source: 52 FR 28139, July 28, 1987, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 650.801  Purpose.

    The purpose of this regulation is to establish policy and to set 
forth coordination procedures for Federal-aid highway bridges which 
require navigational clearances.


<R05>
Sec. 650.803  Policy.

    It is the policy of FHWA:
    (a) To provide clearances which meet the reasonable needs of 
navigation and provide for cost-effective highway operations,
    (b) To provide fixed bridges wherever practicable, and
    (c) To consider appropriate pier protection and vehicular protective 
and warning systems on bridges subject to ship collisions.


<R05>
Sec. 650.805  Bridges not requiring a USCG permit.

    (a) The FHWA has the responsibility under 23 U.S.C. 144(h) to 
determine that a USCG permit is not required for bridge construction. 
This determination shall be made at an early stage of project 
development so that any necessary coordination can be accomplished 
during environmental processing.
    (b) A USCG permit shall not be required if the FHWA determines that 
the proposed construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, or 
replacement of the federally aided or assisted bridge is over waters (1) 
which are not used or are not susceptible to use in their natural 
condition or by reasonable improvement as a means to transport 
interstate or foreign commerce and (2) which are (i) not tidal, or (ii) 
if tidal, used only by recreational boating, fishing, and other small 
vessels less than 21 feet in length.

[[Page 272]]

    (c) The highway agency (HA) shall assess the need for a USCG permit 
or navigation lights or signals for proposed bridges. The HA shall 
consult the appropriate District Offices of the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers if the susceptibility to improvement for navigation of the 
water of concern is unknown and shall consult the USCG if the types of 
vessels using the waterway are unknown.
    (d) For bridge crossings of waterways with navigational traffic 
where the HA believes that a USCG permit may not be required, the HA 
shall provide supporting information early in the environmental analysis 
stage of project development to enable the FHWA to make a determination 
that a USCG permit is not required and that proposed navigational 
clearances are reasonable.
    (e) Since construction in waters exempt from a USCG permit may be 
subject to other USCG authorizations, such as approval of navigation 
lights and signals and timely notice to local mariners of waterway 
changes, the USCG should be notified whenever the proposed action may 
substantially affect local navigation.


<R05>
Sec. 650.807  Bridges requiring a USCG permit.

    (a) The USCG has the responsibility (1) to determine whether a USCG 
permit is required for the improvement or construction of a bridge over 
navigable waters except for the exemption exercised by FHWA in Sec. 
650.805 and (2) to approve the bridge location, alignment and 
appropriate navigational clearances in all bridge permit applications.
    (b) A USCG permit shall be required when a bridge crosses waters 
which are: (1) tidal and used by recreational boating, fishing, and 
other small vessels 21 feet or greater in length or (2) used or 
susceptible to use in their natural condition or by reasonable 
improvement as a means to transport interstate or foreign commerce. If 
it is determined that a USCG permit is required, the project shall be 
processed in accordance with the following procedures.
    (c) The HA shall initiate coordination with the USCG at an early 
stage of project development and provide opportunity for the USCG to be 
involved throughout the environmental review process in accordance with 
23 CFR part 771. The FHWA and Coast Guard have developed internal 
guidelines which set forth coordination procedures that both agencies 
have found useful in streamlining and expediting the permit approval 
process. These guidelines include (1) USCG/FHWA Procedures for Handling 
Projects which Require a USCG Permit \1\ and (2) the USCG/FHWA 
Memorandum of Understanding on Coordinating The Preparation and 
Processing of Environmental Projects. \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ This document is an internal directive in the USCG Bridge 
Administration Manual, Enclosure 1a, COMDT INST M16590.5, change 2 dated 
Dec. 1, 1983. It is available for inspection and copying from the U.S. 
Coast Guard or the Federal Highway Administration as prescribed in 49

inspection and copying as prescribed in 49 CFR part 7, appendix D.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) The HA shall accomplish sufficient preliminary design and 
consultation during the environmental phase of project development to 
investigate bridge concepts, including the feasibility of any proposed 
movable bridges, the horizontal and vertical clearances that may be 
required, and other location considerations which may affect navigation. 
At least one fixed bridge alternative shall be included with any 
proposal for a movable bridge to provide a comparative analysis of 
engineering, social, economic and environmental benefit and impacts.
    (e) The HA shall consider hydraulic, safety, environmental and 
navigational needs along with highway costs when designing a proposed 
navigable waterway crossing.
    (f) For bridges where the risk of ship collision is significant, 
HA's shall consider, in addition to USCG requirements, the need for pier 
protection and warning systems as outlined in FHWA Technical Advisory 
5140.19, Pier Protection and Warning Systems for Bridges Subject to Ship 
Collisions, dated February 11, 1983.
    (g) Special navigational clearances shall normally not be provided 
for accommodation of floating construction

[[Page 273]]

equipment of any type that is not required for navigation channel 
maintenance. If the navigational clearances are influenced by the needs 
of such equipment, the USCG should be consulted to determine the 
appropriate clearances to be provided.
    (h) For projects which require FHWA approval of plans, 
specifications and estimates, preliminary bridge plans shall be approved 
at the appropriate level by FHWA for structural concepts, hydraulics, 
and navigational clearances prior to submission of the permit 
application.
    (i) If the HA bid plans contain alternative designs for the same 
configuration (fixed or movable), the permit application shall be 
prepared in sufficient detail so that all alternatives can be evaluated 
by the USCG. If appropriate, the USCG will issue a permit for all 
alternatives. Within 30 days after award of the construction contract, 
the USCG shall be notified by the HA of the alternate which was 
selected. The USCG procedure for evaluating permit applications which 
contain alternates is presented in its Bridge Administration Manual 
(COMDT INST M16590.5). \3\ The FHWA policy on alternates, Alternate 
Design for Bridges; Policy Statement, was published at 48 FR 21409 on

<R05>
Sec. 650.809  Movable span bridges.

    A fixed bridge shall be selected wherever practicable. If there are 
social, economic, environmental or engineering reasons which favor the 
selection of a movable bridge, a cost benefit analysis to support the 
need for the movable bridge shall he prepared as a part of the 
preliminary plans.

<R05>
Sec. 652.5  Policy.

    The safe accommodation of pedestrians and bicyclists should be given 
full consideration during the development of Federal-aid highway 
projects, and during the construction of such projects. The special 
needs for the elderly and the handicapped shall be considered in all 
Federal-aid projects that include pedestrian facilities. Where current 
or anticipated pedestrian and/or bicycle traffic presents a potential 
conflict with motor vehicle traffic, every effort shall be made to 
minimize the detrimental effects on all highway users who share the 
facility. On highways without full control of access where a bridge deck 
is being replaced or rehabilitated, and where bicycles are permitted to 
operate at each end, the bridge shall be reconstructed so that bicycles 
can be safely accommodated when it can be done at a reasonable cost. 
Consultation with local groups of organized bicyclists is to be 
encouraged in the development of bicycle projects.


<R05>
Sec. 652.7  Eligibility.

    (a) Independent bicycle projects, incidental bicycle projects, and 
nonconstruction bicycle projects must be principally for transportation 
rather than recreational use and must meet the project conditions for 
authorization where applicable.

<R05>
Sec. 652.9  Federal participation.

    (a) Independent walkway projects, independent bicycle projects and 
nonconstruction bicycle projects shall be financed with 100 percent 
Federal-aid primary, secondary or urban highway funds, provided the 
total amount obligated for all such projects in any one

[[Page 275]]

State in any fiscal year does not exceed $4.5 million of Federal-aid 
funds or a lesser amount apportioned by the Federal Highway 
Administrator to avoid exceeding the annual $45 million cost limitation 
on these projects for all States in a fiscal year. The Federal Highway 
Administrator may, upon application, waive this limitation for a State 
for any fiscal year. This limitation also applies to projects funded 
under Sec. 652.9(d). This limitation does not apply to projects of the 
type described in Sec. 652.9(c). The FHWA Offices of Direct Federal 
Programs and Engineering will coordinate projects of the type described 
in Sec. 652.9(d) to ensure that the annual cost limitations will not be 
exceeded.
    (b) Specific eligibility requirements for Federal-aid participation 
in independent and nonconstruction projects are:
    (1) An independent walkway project must be constructed on highway 
right-of-way or easement, or right-of-way acquired for this purpose. 
Independent walkway projects may be constructed separately or in 
conjunction with a Federal-aid highway construction project. Where an 
independent walkway project is located away from the Federal-aid highway 
right-of-way, it must serve pedestrians who would normally desire to use 
the Federal-aid route.
    (2) An independent bicycle project may include the acquisition of 
land needed for the facility, or such projects may be constructed on 
existing highway right-of-way or easement acquired for this purpose. 
Independent bicycle projects may include construction of bicycle lanes, 
paths, shelters, bicycle parking facilities and other roadway and bridge 
work necessary to accommodate bicyclists.
    (3) Nonconstruction bicycle projects must be related to the safe use 
of bicycles for transportation, and may include safety educational 
material and route maps for safe bicycle transportation purposes. 
Nonconstruction bicycle projects shall not include salaries for 
administration, law enforcement, maintenance and similar items required 
to operate transportation networks and programs, but may include cost of 
staff or consultants for development of specific nonconstruction 
projects.
    (c) Bicycle and pedestrian accommodations may also be constructed as 
incidental features of highway construction projects. These incidental 
features may be financed with the same type of Federal-aid funds, 
including funds of the type described in Sec. 652.9(d) (except 
Interstate construction funds) and at the same Federal share payable as 
a basic highway project. These accommodations are not subject to the 
funding limitations for independent walkway, independent bicycle and 
nonconstruction bicycle projects. In the case of the Interstate 
construction projects, Federal-aid Interstate construction funds may 
only be used to replace existing facilities that would be interrupted by 
construction of the project, or to mitigate specific environmental 
impacts. Interstate 4R funds provided by 23 U.S.C. 104(b)(5)(B) may be 
used only for incidental features. As incidental features, these 
accommodations must be part of a highway improvement and must be located 
within the right-of-way of the highway, including land acquired under 23 
U.S.C. 319 (Scenic Enhancement Program).
    (d) Funds authorized for Federal lands highways (forest highways, 
public lands highways, park roads, parkways, and Indian reservation 
roads which are public roads), forest development roads and trails 
(i.e., roads or trails under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service), 
and public lands development roads and trails (i.e., roads or trails 
which the Secretary of the Interior determines are of primary importance 
for the development, protection, administration, and utilization of 
public lands and resources under his/her control), may be used for 
independent bicycle routes and independent walkway projects. These funds 
may not be used for nonconstruction bicycle projects.


<R05>
Sec. 652.11  Planning.

    Federally aided bicycle and pedestrian projects implemented within 
urbanized areas must be included in the transportation improvement 
program/annual (or biennial) element unless excluded by agreement 
between the State

[[Page 276]]

and the metropolitan planning organization.


<R05>
Sec. 652.13  Design and construction criteria.

    (a) The American Association of State Highway and Transportation 
Officials' ``Guide for Development of New Bicycle Facilities, 1981'' 
(AASHTO Guide) or equivalent guides developed in cooperation with State 
or local officials and acceptable to the division office of the FHWA, 
shall be used as standards for the construction and design of bicycle 
routes. Copies of the AASHTO Guide may be obtained from the American 
Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, 444 North 
Capitol Street, NW., Suite 225, Washington, DC 20001.
    (b) Curb cuts and other provisions as may be appropriate for the 
handicapped are required on all Federal and Federal-aid projects 
involving the provision of curbs or sidewalks at all pedestrian 
crosswalks.

<R05>
Sec. 655.602  Definitions.

    The terms used herein are defined in accordance with definitions and 
usages contained in the MUTCD and 23 U.S.C. 101(a).


<R05>
Sec. 655.603  Standards.

    (a) National MUTCD. The MUTCD approved by the Federal Highway 
Administrator is the national standard for all traffic control devices 
installed on any street, highway, or bicycle trail open to public travel 
in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 109(d) and 402(a). For the purpose of MUTCD 
applicability, open to public travel includes toll roads and roads 
within shopping centers, airports, sports arenas, and other similar 
business and/or recreation facilities that are privately owned but where 
the public is allowed to travel without access restrictions. Except for 
gated toll roads, roads within private gated properties where access is 
restricted at all times are not included in this definition. Parking 
areas, driving aisles within parking areas, and private highway-rail 
grade crossings are also not included in this definition.
    (b) State or other Federal MUTCD. (1) Where State or other Federal 
agency MUTCDs or supplements are required, they shall be in substantial 
conformance with the National MUTCD. Substantial conformance means that 
the State MUTCD or supplement shall conform as a minimum to the standard 
statements included in the National MUTCD. The FHWA Division 
Administrators and Associate Administrator for the Federal Lands Highway 
Program may grant exceptions in cases where a State MUTCD or supplement 
cannot conform to standard statements in the National MUTCD because of 
the requirements of a specific State law that was in effect prior to the 
effective date of this final rule, provided that the Division 
Administrator or Associate Administrator determines based on information 
available and documentation received from the State that the non-
conformance does not create a safety concern. The guidance statements 
contained in the National MUTCD shall also be in the State Manual or 
supplement unless the reason for not including it is satisfactorily 
explained based on engineering judgment, specific conflicting State law, 
or a documented engineering study. The FHWA Division Administrators 
shall approve the State MUTCDs and supplements that are in substantial 
conformance with the National MUTCD. The FHWA AssociateAdministrator of 
the Federal Lands Highway Program shall approve other Federal land 
management agencies MUTCDs and supplements that are in substantial 
conformance with the National MUTCD. The FHWA Division Administrators 
and the FHWA Associate Administrators for the Federal Lands Highway 
Program have the flexibility to determine on a case-by-case basis the 
degree of variation allowed.
    (2) States and other Federal agencies are encouraged to adopt the 
National MUTCD in its entirety as their official Manual on Uniform 
Traffic Control Devices.
    (3) States and other Federal agencies shall adopt changes issued by 
the FHWA to the National MUTCD within two years from the effective date 
of the final rule. For those States that automatically adopt the MUTCD 
immediately upon the effective date of the latest edition or revision of 
the MUTCD, the FHWA Division Administrators have the flexibility to 
allow

[[Page 278]]

these States to install certain devices from existing inventory or 
previously approved construction plans that comply with the previous 
MUTCD during the two-year adoption period.
    (c) Color specifications. Color determinations and specifications of 
sign and pavement marking materials shall conform to requirements of the 
FHWA Color Tolerance Charts. \1\ An alternate method of determining the 
color of retroreflective sign material is provided in the appendix.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Available for inspection from the Office of Traffic Operations, 
Federal Highway Administration, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, 
DC.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) Compliance--(1) Existing highways. Each State, in cooperation 
with its political subdivisions, and Federal agency shall have a program 
as required by 23 U.S.C. 402(a), which shall include provisions for the 
systematic upgrading of substandard traffic control devices and for the 
installation of needed devices to achieve conformity with the MUTCD. The 
FHWA may establish target dates of achieving compliance with changes to 
specific devices in the MUTCD.
    (2) New or reconstructed highways. Federal-aid projects for the 
construction, reconstruction, resurfacing, restoration, or 
rehabilitation of streets and highways shall not be opened to the public 
for unrestricted use until all appropriate traffic control devices, 
either temporary or permanent, are installed and functioning properly. 
Both temporary and permanent devices shall conform to the MUTCD.
    (3) Construction area activities. All traffic control devices 
installed in construction areas using Federal-aid funds shall conform to 
the MUTCD. Traffic control plans for handling traffic and pedestrians in 
construction zones and for protection of workers shall conform to the 
requirements of 23 CFR part 630, subpart J, Traffic Safety in Highway 
and Street Work Zones.

[48 FR 46776, Oct. 14, 1983, as amended at 51 FR 16834, May 7, 1986; 68 
FR 14139, Mar. 24, 2003; 71 FR 75115, Dec. 14, 2006; 74 FR 28442, June 
16, 2009; 74 FR 66861, Dec. 16, 2009]


<R05>
Sec. 655.604  Achieving basic uniformity.

    (a) Programs. Programs for the orderly and systematic upgrading of 
existing traffic control devices or the installation of needed traffic 
control devices on or off the Federal-aid system should be based on 
inventories made in accordance with the Highway Safety Program Guideline 
21, ``Roadway Safety.'' These inventories provide the information 
necessary for programming traffic control device upgrading projects.
    (b) Inventory. An inventory of all traffic control devices is 
recommended in the Highway Safety Program Guideline 21, ``Roadway 
Safety.'' Highway planning and research funds and highway related safety 
grant program funds may be used in statewide or systemwide studies or 
inventories. Also, metropolitan planning (PL) funds may be used in 
urbanized areas provided the activity is included in an approved unified 
work program.

[48 FR 46776, Oct. 14, 1983, as amended at 71 FR 75115, Dec. 14, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 655.605  Project procedures.

    (a) Federal-aid highways. Federal-aid projects involving the 
installation of traffic control devices shall follow procedures as 
established in 23 CFR part 630, subpart A, Federal-Aid Programs Approval 
and Project Authorization. Simplified and timesaving procedures are to 
be used to the extent permitted by existing policy.
    (b) Off-system highways. Certain federally funded programs are 
available for installation of traffic control devices on streets and 
highways that are not on the Federal-aid system. The procedures used in 
these programs may vary from project to project but, essentially, the 
guidelines set forth herein should be used.


<R05>
Sec. 655.606  Higher cost materials.

    The use of signing, pavement marking, and signal materials (or 
equipment) having distinctive performance characteristics, but costing 
more than other materials (or equipment) commonly used may be approved 
by the FHWA Division Administrator when the specific use proposed is 
considered to be in the public interest.

[[Page 279]]


<R05>
Sec. 655.607  Funding.

    (a) Federal-aid highways. (1) Funds apportioned or allocated under 
23 U.S.C. 104(b) are eligible to participate in projects to install 
traffic control devices in accordance with the MUTCD on newly 
constructed, reconstructed, resurfaced, restored, or rehabilitated 
highways, or on existing highways when this work is classified as 
construction in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 101(a). Federal-aid highway 
funds for eligible pavement markings and traffic control signalization 
may amount to 100 percent of the construction cost. Federal-aid highway 
funds apportioned or allocated under other sections of 23 U.S.C. are 
eligible for participation in improvements conforming to the MUTCD in 
accordance with the provisions of applicable program regulations and 
directives.
    (2) Traffic control devices are eligible, in keeping with paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, provided that the work is classified as 
construction in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 101(a) and the State or local 
agency has a policy acceptable to the FHWA Division Administrator for 
selecting traffic control devices material or equipment based on items 
such as cost, traffic volumes, safety, and expected service life. The 
State's policy should provide for cost-effective selection of materials 
which will provide for substantial service life taking into account 
expected and necessary routine maintenance. For these purposes, 
effectiveness would normally be measured in terms of durability, service 
life and/or performance of the material. Specific projects including 
material or equipment selection shall be developed in accordance with 
this policy. Proposed work may be approved on a project-by-project basis 
when the work is (i) clearly warranted, (ii) on a Federal-aid system, 
(iii) clearly identified by site, (iv) substantial in nature, and (v) of 
sufficient magnitude at any given location to warrant Federal-aid 
participation as a construction item.
    (3) The method of accomplishing the work will be in accordance with 
23 CFR part 635, subpart A, Contract Procedures.
    (b) Off-system highways. Certain Federal-aid highway funds are 
eligible to participate in traffic control device improvement projects 
on off-system highways. In addition, Federal-aid highway funds 
apportioned or allocated in 23 U.S.C. are eligible for the installation 
of traffic control devices on any public road not on the Federal-aid 
system when the installation is directly related to a traffic 
improvement project on a Federal-aid system route.

Sec. Appendix to Subpart F of Part 655--Alternate Method of Determining 
    
    the Color of Retroreflective Sign Materials and Pavement Marking 
                                Materials

    1. Although the FHWA Color Tolerance Charts depreciate the use of 
spectrophotometers or accurate tristimulus colorimeters for measuring 
the daytime color of retroreflective materials, recent testing has 
determined that 0/45 or 45/0 spectroradiometers and tristimulus 
colorimeters have proved that the measurements can be considered 
reliable and may be used.
    2. The daytime color of non-fluorescent retroreflective materials 
may be measured in accordance with ASTM Test Method E1349, ``Standard 
Test Method for Reflectance Factor and Color by Spectrophotometry Using 
Bidirectional Geometry'' or ASTM Test Method E 1347 (Replaces E97), 
``Standard Test Method for Color and Color-Difference Measurement by 
Tristimulus (Filter) Colorimetry.'' The latter test method specified 
bidirectional geometry for the measurement of retroreflective materials. 
The geometric conditions to be used in both test methods are 0/45 or 45/
0 circumferential illumination or viewing. Uniplanar geometry is not 
recommended for material types IV or higher (designated microprismatic). 
The CIE standard illuminant used in computing the colorimetric 
coordinates shall be D<INF>65</INF> and the 2 Degree Standard CIE 
observer shall be used.
    3. For fluorescent retroreflective materials ASTM E991 may be used 
to determine the chromaticity provided that the D<INF>65</INF> 
illumination meets the requirements of E 991. This practice, however, 
allows only the total luminous factor to be measured. The fluorescent 
luminous factor must be determined using bispectral fluorescent 
colorimetry. Commercial instruments are available which allow such 
determination. Some testing laboratories are also equipped to perform 
these measurements.
    4. For nighttime measurements CIE Standard Illuminant A shall be 
used in computing the colorimetric coordinates and the 2 Degree Standard 
CIE Observer shall be used.

[[Page 280]]

    5. Average performance sheeting is identified as Types I and II 
sheeting and high performance sheeting is identified as Type III. Super-
high intensity sheeting is identified as Types V, VI, and VII in ASTM D 
4956.
    6. The following nine tables depict the 1931 CIE Chromaticity 
Diagram x and y coordinates for the corner points defining the 
recommended color boxes in the diagram and the daytime luminance factors 
for those colors. Lines drawn between these corner points specify the 
limits of the chromaticity allowed in the 1931 Chromaticity Diagram. 
Color coordinates of samples that lie within these lines are acceptable. 
For blue and green colors the spectrum locus is the defining limit 
between the corner points located on the spectrum locus:

    Authority: 23 U.S.C. 146 and 315; sec. 126 of the Surface

CFR 1.48(b).

<R05>
Sec. 656.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this regulation is to prescribe policies and general 
procedures for administering a program of ridesharing projects using 
Federal-aid primary, secondary, and urban system funds.

[[Page 283]]


<R05>
Sec. 656.3  Policy.

    Section 126(d) of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1978 
declares that special effort should be made to promote commuter modes of 
transportation which conserve energy, reduce pollution, and reduce 
traffic congestion.


<R05>
Sec. 656.5  Eligibility.

    (a) Projects which promote ridesharing programs need not be located 
on but must serve a Federal-aid system to be eligible for Federal-aid 
primary, secondary, or urban system funds depending on the system 
served. The Federal share payable will be in accordance with the 
provisions of 23 U.S.C. 120. Except for paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section, for all purposes of this regulation the term carpool includes 
vanpool.
    (b) Projects shall not be approved under this regulation if they 
will have an adverse effect on any mass transportation system.
    (c) The following types of projects and work are considered eligible 
under this program:
    (1) Systems, whether manual or computerized, for locating potential 
participants in carpools and informing them of the oppportunities for 
participation. Eligible costs for such systems may include costs of use 
or rental of computer hardware, costs of software, and installation 
costs (including both labor and other related items).
    (2) Specialized procedures to provide carpooling opportunities to 
elderly or handicapped persons.
    (3) The costs of acquiring vanpool vehicles and actual financial 
losses that occur when the operation of any vanpool is aborted before 
the scheduled termination date for the reason, concurred in by the 
State, that its continuation is no longer productive. The cost of 
acquiring a vanpool vehicle is eligible under the following conditions:
    (i) The vanpool vehicle is a four-wheeled vehicle manufactured for 
use on public highways for transportation of 7-15 passengers (no 
passenger cars which do not meet the 7-15 criteria and no buses); and
    (ii) Provision is made for repayment of the acquisition cost to the 
project within the passenger-service life of the vehicle. Repayment may 
be accomplished through the charging of a reasonable user fee based on 
an estimated number of riders per vehicle and the cost of reasonable 
vehicle depreciation, operation, and maintenance. Repayment is not 
required under the following conditions:
    (A) When vehicles are purchased as demonstrator vans for use as a 
marketing device. Vehicles procured for this purpose should be used to 
promote the vanpool concept among employees, employers, and other groups 
by allowing potential riders and sponsors to examine commuter vans; or
    (B) When vehicles are purchased for use on a trial commuting basis 
to enable people to experience vanpooling first hand. The trial period 
must be limited to a maximum of 2 months. That part of the user fee 
normally collected to cover the capital or ownership cost of the van 
would be eligible for reimbursement as a promotional cost during the 
limited trial period. As with established vanpool service, all vehicle 
operating costs must be borne by the user(s) during the trial period.
    (4) Work necessary to designate existing highway lanes as 
preferential carpool lanes or bus and carpool lanes. Eligible work may 
include preliminary engineering to determine traffic flow and design 
criteria, signing, pavement markings, traffic control devices, and minor 
physical modifications to permit the use of designated lanes as 
preferential carpool lanes or bus and carpool lanes. Such improvements 
on any public road may be approved if such projects facilitate more 
efficient use of any Federal-aid highway. Eligible costs may also 
include costs of initial inspection or monitoring of use, including 
special equipment, to ensure that the high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes 
designation is effective and that the project is fully developed and 
operating properly. While no fixed time limit is being arbitrarily 
prescribed for the inspection and monitoring period, it is intended that 
this activity be conducted as soon as possible to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the project and does not extend indefinitely nor become 
a part of routine facility operations.

[[Page 284]]

    (5) Signing of and modifications to existing facilities to provide 
preferential parking for carpools inside or outside the central business 
district. Eligible costs may include trail blazers, on-site signs 
designating highway interchange areas or other existing publicly or 
privately owned facilities as preferential parking for carpool 
participants, and initial or renewal costs for leasing parking space or 
acquisition or easements or restrictions, as, for example, at shopping 
centers and public or private parking facilities. The lease or 
acquisition cost may be computed on the demonstrated reduction in the 
overall number of vehicles using the designated portion of a commercial 
facility, but not on a reduction of the per-vehicle user charge for 
parking.
    (6) Construction of carpool parking facilities outside the central 
business district. Eligible costs may include acquisition of land and 
normal construction activities, including installation of lighting and 
fencing, trail blazers, on-site signing, and passenger shelters. Such 
facilities need not be located in conjunction with any existing or 
planned mass transportation service, but should be designed so that the 
facility could accommodate mass transportation in the event such service 
may be developed. Except for the requirement of the availability of 
mass/public transportation facilities, fringe parking construction under 
this section shall be subject to the provisions of 23 CFR part 810.106.
    (7) Reasonable public information and promotion expenses, including 
personnel costs, incurred in connection with any of the other eligible 
items mentioned herein.


<R05>
Sec. 656.7  Determination of an exception.

    (a) The FHWA has determined under provisions of 23 U.S.C. 146(b) 
that an exceptional situation exists in regard to the funding of 
carpools so as to allow the State to contribute as its share of the non-
Federal match essential project-related work and services performed by 
local agencies and private organizations when approved and authorized in 
accordance with regular Federal-aid procedures. The cost of such work 
must be properly valued, supportable and verifiable in order for 
inclusion as an eligible project cost. Examples of such contributed work 
and services include: public service announcements, computer services, 
and project-related staff time for administration by employees of public 
and private organizations.
    (b) This determination is based on: (1) The nature of carpool 
projects to provide a variety of services to the public; (2) the fact 
that carpool projects are labor intensive and require professional and 
specialized technical skills; (3) the extensive use of joint public and 
private endeavors; and (4) the fact that project costs involve the 
acquisition of capital equipment as opposed to construction of fixed 
items.
    (c) This exception is limited to carpool projects and therefore is 
not applicable to other Federal-aid projects. The exception does not 
affect or replace the standard Federal-aid funding procedures or real 
property acquisition procedures and requirements, part 712, The 
Acquisition Function.

Sec. 657.3  Definitions.

    Unless otherwise specified in this part, the definitions in 23 
U.S.C. 101(a) are applicable to this part. As used in this part:
    Enforcing or Enforcement means all actions by the State to obtain 
compliance with size and weight requirements by all vehicles operating 
on the Interstate System and those roads which, prior to October 1, 
1991, were designated as part of the Federal-aid Primary, Federal-aid 
Secondary, or Federal-aid Urban Systems.
    Urbanized area means an area with a population of 50,000 or more.

[72 FR 7747, Feb. 20, 2007]


<R05>
Sec. 657.5  Policy.

    Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) policy is that each State 
enforce vehicle size and weight laws to assure that violations are 
discouraged and that vehicles traversing the highway system do not 
exceed the limits specified by law. These size and weight limits are 
based upon design specifications and safety considerations, and 
enforcement shall be developed and maintained both to prevent premature 
deterioration of the highway pavement and structures and to provide a 
safe driving environment.


<R05>
Sec. 657.7  Objective.

    The objective of this regulation is the development and operation by 
each State of an enforcement process which identifies vehicles of 
excessive size and weight and provides a systematic approach to 
eliminate violations and thus improve conditions.


<R05>
Sec. 657.9  Formulation of a plan for enforcement.

    (a) Each State shall develop a plan for the maintenance of an 
effective enforcement process. The plan shall describe the procedures, 
resources, and facilities which the State intends to devote to the 
enforcement of its vehicle size and weight laws. Each State plan must be 
accepted by the FHWA and will then serve as a basis by which the annual 
certification of enforcement will be judged for adequacy.
    (b) The plan shall discuss the following subjects:
    (1) Facilities and resources. (i) No program shall be approved which 
does not utilize a combination of at least two of the following listed 
devices to deter evasion of size and weight measurement in sufficient 
quantity to cover the FA system: fixed platform scales; portable wheel 
weigher scales; semiportable or ramp scales; WIM equipment.
    (ii) Staff assigned to the program, identified by specific agency. 
Where more than one State agency has weight enforcement responsibility, 
the lead agency should be indicated.
    (2) Practices and procedures. (i) Proposed plan of operation, 
including geographical coverage and hours of operation in general terms.
    (ii) Policy and practices with respect to overweight violators, 
including off-loading requirements for divisible loads. In those States 
in which off-loading is mandatory by law, an administrative variance 
from the legal requirement shall be fully explained. In those States in 
which off-loading is permissive administrative guidelines shall be 
included.
    (iii) Policy and practices with respect to penalties, including 
those for repeated violations. Administrative directives, booklets or 
other written criteria shall be made part of the plan submission.
    (iv) Policy and practices with respect to special permits for 
overweight. Administrative directives, booklets or other written 
criteria shall be made part of the plan submission.
    (3) Updating. Modification and/or additions to the plan based on 
experience and new developments in the enforcement program. It is 
recognized that the plan is not static and that changes may be required 
to meet changing needs.

[[Page 286]]


<R05>
Sec. 657.11  Evaluation of operations.

    (a) The State shall submit its enforcement plan or annual update to 
the FHWA Division Office by July 1 of each year. However, if a State's 
legislative or budgetary cycle is not consonant with that date, the FHWA 
and the State may jointly select an alternate date. In any event, a 
State must have an approved plan in effect by October 1 of each year. 
Failure of a State to submit or update a plan will result in the State 
being unable to certify in accordance with Sec. 657.13 for the period 
to be covered by the plan.
    (b) The FHWA shall review the State's operation under the accepted 
plan on a continuing basis and shall prepare an evaluation report 
annually. The State will be advised of the results of the evaluation and 
of any needed changes in the plan itself or in its implementation. 
Copies of the evaluation reports and subsequent modifications resulting 
from the evaluation shall be forwarded to the FHWA's Office of 
Operations.

Sec. 657.13  Certification requirement.

    Each State shall certify to the Federal Highway Administrator, 
before January 1 of each year, that it is enforcing all State laws 
respecting maximum vehicle size and weight permitted on what, prior to 
October 1, 1991, were the Federal-aid Primary, Secondary, and Urban 
Systems, including the Interstate System, in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 
127. The States must also certify that they are enforcing and complying 
with the ISTEA freeze on the use of LCV's and other multi-unit vehicles. 
The certification shall be supported by information on activities and 
results achieved during the preceding 12-month period ending on 
September 30 of each year.

[59 FR 30418, June 13, 1994]

<R05>
Sec. 657.19  Effect of failure to certify or to enforce State laws adequately.

    If a State fails to certify as required by this regulation or if the 
Secretary determines that a State is not adequately enforcing all State 
laws respecting maximum vehicle sizes and weights on the Interstate 
System and those routes which, prior to October 1, 1991, were designated 
as part of the Federal-aid primary, Federal-aid secondary or Federal-aid 
urban systems, notwithstanding the State's certification, the Federal-
aid funds for the National Highway System apportioned to the State for 
the next fiscal year shall be reduced by an amount equal to 10 percent 
of the amount which would otherwise be apportioned to the State under 23 
U.S.C. 104, and/or by the amount required pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 127.

[72 FR 7747, Feb. 20, 2007]


<R05>
Sec. 657.21  Procedure for reduction of funds.

    (a) If it appears to the Federal Highway Administrator that a State 
has not submitted a certification conforming to the requirements of this 
regulation, or that the State is not adequately enforcing State laws 
respecting maximum vehicle size and weight, including laws applicable to 
vehicles using the Interstate System with weights or widths in excess of 
those provided under 23 U.S.C. 127, the Federal Highway Administrator 
shall make in writing a proposed determination of nonconformity, and 
shall notify the Governor of the State of the proposed determination by 
certified mail. The notice shall state the reasons for the proposed 
determination and inform the State that it may, within 30 days from the 
date of the notice, request a hearing to show cause why it should not be 
found in nonconformity. If the State informs the Administrator before 
the end of this 30-day period that it wishes to attempt to resolve the 
matter informally, the Administrator may extend the time for requesting 
a hearing. In the event of a request for informal resolution, the State 
and the Administrator (or designee) shall promptly schedule a meeting to 
resolve the matter.
    (b) In all instances where the State proceeds on the basis of 
informal resolution, a transcript of the conference will be made and 
furnished to the State by the FHWA.
    (1) The State may offer any information which it considers helpful 
to a resolution of the matter, and the scope of review at the conference 
will include,

[[Page 288]]

but not be limited to, legislative actions, including those proposed to 
remedy deficiencies, budgetary considerations, judicial actions, and 
proposals for specific actions which will be implemented to bring the 
State into compliance.
    (2) The information produced at the conference may constitute an 
explanation and offer of settlement and the Administrator will make a 
determination on the basis of the certification, record of the 
conference, and other information submitted by the State. The 
Administrator's final decision together with a copy of the transcript of 
the conference will be furnished to the State.
    (3) If the Administrator does not accept an offer of settlement made 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the State retains the 
right to request a hearing on the record pursuant to paragraph (d) of 
this section, except in the case of a violation of section 127.
    (c) If the State does not request a hearing in a timely fashion as 
provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the Federal Highway 
Administrator shall forward the proposed determination of nonconformity 
to the Secretary. Upon approval of the proposed determination by the 
Secretary, the fund reduction specified by Sec. 657.19 shall be 
effected.
    (d) If the State requests a hearing, the Secretary shall 
expeditiously convene a hearing on the record, which shall be conducted 
according to the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 
U.S.C. 555 et seq. Based on the record of the proceeding, the Secretary 
shall determine whether the State is in nonconformity with this 
regulation. If the Secretary determines that the State is in 
nonconformity, the fund reduction specified by section 567.19 shall be 
effected.
    (e) The Secretary may reserve 10 percent of a State's apportionment 
of funds under 23 U.S.C. 104 pending a final administrative 
determination under this regulation to prevent the apportionment to the 
State of funds which would be affected by a determination of 
nonconformity.
    (f) Funds withheld pursuant to a final administrative determination 
under this regulation shall be reapportioned to all other eligible 
States one year from the date of this determination, unless before this 
time the Secretary determines, on the basis of information submitted by 
the State and the FHWA, that the State has come into conformity with 
this regulation. If the Secretary determines that the State has come 
into conformity, the withheld funds shall be released to the State.
    (g) The reapportionment of funds under paragraph (e) of this section 
shall be stayed during the pendency of any judicial review of the 
Secretary's final administrative determination of nonconformity.

    4. Provision for annual review and update of vehicle size and weight

                              E. Evaluation

    The evaluation of an existing plan, in comparison to goals for 
strengthening the enforcement program, is a difficult task, especially 
since there is very limited experience nationwide.
    The FHWA plans to approach this objective through a continued 
cooperative effort with State and other enforcement agencies by 
gathering useful information and experience on elements of enforcement 
practices that produce positive results.
    It is not considered practicable at this time to establish objective 
minimums, such as the number of vehicles to be weighed by each State, as 
a requirement for satisfactory compliance. However, the States will want 
to know as many specifics as possible about what measuring tools will be 
used to evaluate their annual certifications for adequacy.
    The above discussion goes to the heart of the question concerning 
numerical criteria. The assumption that a certain number of weighings 
will provide a maximum or even satisfactory deterrent is not 
supportable. The enforcement of vehicle size and weight laws requires 
that vehicles be weighed but it does not logically follow that the more 
vehicles weighed, the more effective the enforcement program, especially 
if the vehicles are weighed at a limited number of fixed locations. A 
``numbers game'' does not necessarily provide a deterrent to deliberate 
overloading. Consistent, vigorous enforcement activities, the certainty 
of apprehension and of penalty, the adequacy of the penalty, even the 
publicity given these factors, may be greater deterrents than the number 
of weighings alone.
    In recognizing that all States are unique in character, there are 
some similarities between certain States and useful perspectives may be 
obtained by relating their program elements. Some comparative factors 
are:
    1. Truck registration (excluding pickups and panels)
    2. Population
    3. Average Daily Traffic (ADT) for trucks on FA highways
    4. To total mileage of Federal-aid highways
    5. Geographic location of the State
    6. Annual truck miles traveled in State
    7. Number of truck terminals (over 6 doors)
    8. Vehicle miles of intrastate truck traffic
    Quantities relating to the above items can become factors that in 
the aggregate are descriptive of a State's characteristics and can 
identify States that are similar from a trucking operation viewpoint. 
This is especially applicable for States within the same area.
    After States with similar truck traffic operations have been 
identified in a regional area, another important variable must be 
considered: the type of weighing equipment that has been or is proposed 
for predominant use in the States. When data become available on the 
number of trucks weighed by each type of scale (fixed, portable, semi-
portable, etc.) some indicators will be developed to relate one State's 
effort to those of other States. The measures of activity that are a 
part of each certification submitted will provide a basis for the 
development of more precise numerical criteria by which an enforcement 
plan and its activities can be judged for adequacy.
    Previous certifications have provided information from which the 
following gross scale capabilities have been derived.

                      Potential Weighing Capacities

    1. Permanent scales 60 veh/hr.
    2. Weigh-in-motion scales 100 veh/hr.
    3. Semi-portable scales 25 veh/hr.
    4. Portable scales 3 veh/hr.
    To meet the mandates of Federal and other laws regarding truck size 
and weight enforcement, the FHWA desires to become a resource for all 
States in achieving a successful exchange of useful information. Some 
States are more advanced in their enforcement activities. Some have 
special experience with portable, semi-portable, fixed, or weighing-in-
motion devices. Others have operated permanent scales in combination 
with concentrated safety inspection programs. The FHWA is interested in 
information on individual State experiences in these specialized areas 
as part of initial plan submissions. If such information has recently 
been furnished to the Washington Headquarters, an appropriate cross 
reference should be included on the submission.
    It is the policy of the FHWA to avoid red tape, and information 
volunteered by the States will be of assistance in meeting many needs. 
The ultimate goal in developing information through the evaluation 
process is to assemble criteria for a model enforcement program.

    (1) As used in this part, nondivisible means any load or vehicle 
exceeding applicable length or weight limits which, if separated into 
smaller loads or vehicles, would:
    (i) Compromise the intended use of the vehicle, i.e., make it unable 
to perform the function for which it was intended;
    (ii) Destroy the value of the load or vehicle, i.e., make it 
unusable for its intended purpose; or
    (iii) Require more than 8 workhours to dismantle using appropriate 
equipment. The applicant for a nondivisible load permit has the burden 
of proof as to the number of workhours required to dismantle the load.
    (2) A State may treat as nondivisible loads or vehicles: emergency 
response vehicles, including those loaded with salt, sand, chemicals or 
a combination thereof, with or without a plow or blade attached in

characterized by an elevated passenger deck located over a baggage 
compartment, and typically operating on the Interstate System or roads 
previously designated as making up the Federal-aid Primary System.

[[Page 292]]

    Saddlemount combination. A saddlemount combination is a combination 
of vehicles in which a truck or truck tractor tows one or more trucks or 
truck tractors, each connected by a saddle to the frame or fifth wheel 
of the vehicle in front of it. The saddle is a mechanism that connects 
the front axle of the towed vehicle to the frame or fifth wheel of the 
vehicle in front and functions like a fifth wheel kingpin connection. 
When two vehicles are towed in this manner the combination is called a 
double saddlemount combination. When three vehicles are towed in this 
manner, the combination is called a triple saddlemount combination.
    Single axle weight. The total weight transmitted to the road by all 
wheels whose centers may be included between two parallel transverse 
vertical planes 40 inches apart, extending across the full width of the 
vehicle. The Federal single axle weight limit on the Interstate System 
is 20,000 pounds.
    Special mobile equipment. Every self-propelled vehicle not designed 
or used primarily for the transportation of persons or property and 
incidentally operated or moved over the highways, including military 
equipment, farm equipment, implements of husbandry, road construction or 
maintenance machinery, and emergency apparatus which includes fire and 
police emergency equipment. This list is partial and not exclusive of 
such other vehicles as may fall within the general terms of this 
definition.
    Stinger-steered combination. A truck tractor semitrailer wherein the 
fifth wheel is located on a drop frame located behind and below the 
rear-most axle of the power unit.
    Tandem axle weight. The total weight transmitted to the road by two 
or more consecutive axles whose centers may be included between parallel 
transverse vertical planes spaced more than 40 inches and not more than 
96 inches apart, extending across the full width of the vehicle. The 
Federal tandem axle weight limit on the Interstate System is 34,000 
pounds.
    Terminal. The term terminal as used in this regulation means, at a 
minimum, any location where:
    Freight either originates, terminates, or is handled in the 
transportation process; or
    Commercial motor carriers maintain operating facilities.
    Tractor or Truck tractor. The noncargo carrying power unit that 
operates in combination with a semitrailer or trailer, except that a 
truck tractor and semitrailer engaged in the transportation of 
automobiles may transport motor vehicles on part of the power unit, and 
a truck tractor equipped with a dromedary unit operating in combination 
with a semitrailer transporting Class 1 explosives and/or any munitions 
related security material as specified by the U.S. Department of Defense 
in compliance with 49 CFR 177.835 may use the dromedary unit to carry a 
portion of the cargo.
    Truck-tractor semitrailer-semitrailer. In a truck-tractor 
semitrailer-semitrailer combination vehicle, the two trailing units are 
connected with a ``B-train'' assembly. The B-train assembly is a rigid 
frame extension attached to the rear frame of a first semitrailer which 
allows for a fifth wheel connection point for the second semitrailer. 
This combination has one less articulation point than the conventional 
``A dolly'' connected truck-tractor semitrailer-trailer combination.
    Truck-trailer boat transporter. A boat transporter combination 
consisting of a straight truck towing a trailer using typically a ball 
and socket connection. The trailer axle(s) is located substantially at 
the trailer center of gravity (rather than the rear of the trailer) but 
so as to maintain a downward force on the trailer tongue.
    Width exclusive devices. Devices excluded from the measurement of 
vehicle width. Such devices shall not be designed or used to carry 
cargo.

Sec. 658.9  National Network criteria.

    (a) The National Network listed in the appendix to this part is 
available for use by commerical motor vehicles of the dimensions and 
configurations described in Sec. Sec. 658.13 and 658.15.
    (b) For those States with detailed lists of individual routes in the 
appendix, the routes have been designated on the basis of their general 
adherence to the following criteria.
    (1) The route is a geometrically typical component of the Federal-
Aid Primary System, serving to link principal cities and densely 
developed portions of the States.
    (2) The route is a high volume route utilized extensively by large 
vehicles for interstate commerce.
    (3) The route does not have any restrictions precluding use by 
conventional combination vehicles.
    (4) The route has adequate geometrics to support safe operations, 
considering sight distance, severity and length of grades, pavement 
width, horizontal curvature, shoulder width, bridge clearances and load 
limits, traffic volumes and vehicle mix, and intersection geometry.
    (5) The route consists of lanes designed to be a width of 12 feet or 
more or is otherwise consistent with highway safety.
    (6) The route does not have any unusual characteristics causing 
current or anticipated safety problems.
    (c) For those States where State law provides that STAA authorized 
vehicles may use all or most of the Federal-Aid Primary system, the 
National Network is no more restrictive than such law. The appendix 
contains a narrative summary of the National Network in those States.

Sec. 658.11  Additions, deletions, exceptions, and restrictions.

    To ensure that the National Network remains substantially intact, 
FHWA retains the authority to rule upon all requested additions to and 
deletions from the National Network as well as requests for the 
imposition of certain restrictions. FHWA approval or disapproval will 
constitute the final decision of the U.S. Department of Transportation.
    (a) Additions. (1) Requests for additions to the National Network, 
including justification, shall have the endorsement of the Governor or 
the Governor's authorized representative, and be submitted in writing to 
the appropriate FHWA Division Office. Proposals for addition of routes 
to the National Network shall be accompanied by an analysis of 
suitability based on the criteria in Sec. 658.9.
    (2) Proposals for additions that meet the criteria of Sec. 658.9 
and have the endorsement of the Governor or the Governor's authorized 
representative will be published in the Federal Register for public 
comment as a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), and if found 
acceptable, as a final rule.
    (b) Deletions--Federal-aid primary--other than interstate. Changed 
conditions or additional information may require the deletion of a 
designated route or a portion thereof. The deletion of any route or 
route segment shall require FHWA approval. Requests for deletion of 
routes from the National Network, including the reason(s) for the 
deletion, shall be submitted in writing to the appropriate FHWA Division 
Office. These requests shall be assessed on the basis of the criteria of 
Sec. 658.9. FHWA proposed deletions will be published in the Federal 
Register as a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM).
    (c) Requests for deletion--Federal-aid primary--other than 
interstate. Requests for deletion should include the following 
information, where appropriate:
    (1) Did the route segment prior to designation carry combination 
vehicles or 102-inch buses?
    (2) Were truck restrictions in effect on the segment on January 6, 
1983? If so, what types of restrictions?

[[Page 294]]

    (3) What is the safety record of the segment, including current or 
anticipated safety problems? Specifically, is the route experiencing 
above normal accident rates and/or accident severities? Does analysis of 
the accident problem indicate that the addition of larger trucks have 
aggravated existing accident problems?
    (4) What are the geometric, structural or traffic operations 
features that might preclude safe, efficient operation? Specifically 
describe lane widths, sight distance, severity and length of grades, 
horizontal curvature, shoulder width, narrow bridges, bridge clearances 
and load limits, traffic volumes and vehicle mix, intersection 
geometrics and vulnerability of roadside hardware.
    (5) Is there a reasonable alternate route available?
    (6) Are there operational restrictions that might be implemented in 
lieu of deletion?
    (d) Deletions and use restrictions--Federal-aid interstate. (1) The 
deletion of, or imposition of use restrictions on, any specific segment 
of the Interstate Highway System on the National Network, except as 
otherwise provided in this part, must be approved by the FHWA. Such 
action will be initiated on the FHWA's own initiative or on the request 
of the Governor or the Governor's authorized representative of the State 
in which the Interstate segment is located. Requests from the Governor 
or the Governor's authorized representative shall be submitted along 
with justification for the deletion or restriction, in writing, to the 
appropriate FHWA Division Office for transmittal to Washington 
Headquarters.
    (2) The justification accompanying a request shall be based on the 
following:
    (i) Analysis of evidence of safety problems supporting the deletion 
or restriction as identified in Sec. 658.11(c).
    (ii) Analysis of the impact on interstate commerce.
    (iii) Analysis and recommendation of any alternative routes that can 
safely accommodate commercial motor vehicles of the dimensions and 
configurations described in Sec. Sec. 658.13 and 658.15 and serve the 
area in which such segment is located.
    (iv) Evidence of consultation with the local governments in which 
the segment is located as well as the Governor or the Governor's 
authorized representative of any adjacent State that might be directly 
affected by such a deletion or restriction.
    (3) Actions to ban all commercial vehicles on portions of the 
Interstate System not excepted under Sec. 658.11(f) are considered 
deletions subject to the requirements of subsection (d) of this section.
    (4) Reasonable restrictions on the use of Interstate routes on the 
National Network by STAA-authorized vehicles related to specific travel 
lanes of multi-lane facilities, construction zones, adverse weather 
conditions or structural or clearance deficiencies are not subject to 
the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.
    (5) Proposed deletions or restrictions will be published in the 
Federal Register as an NPRM, except in the case of an emergency deletion 
as prescribed in Sec. 658.11(e). The FHWA will consider the factors set 
out in paragraph (d)(2) of this section and the comments of interested 
parties. Any approval of deletion or restriction will be published as a 
final rule. A deletion of or restriction on a segment for reasons 
ascribable to dimensions of commercial motor vehicles described in 
either Sec. 658.13 or Sec. 658.15 shall result in a deletion or 
restriction for the purposes of both Sec. Sec. 658.13 and 658.15.
    (e) Emergency deletions. FHWA has the authority to delete any route 
from the National Network, on an emergency basis, for safety 
considerations. Emergency deletions are not considered final, and will 
be published in the Federal Register for notice and comment.
    (f) Exceptions. Those portions of the Interstate System which were 
open to traffic and on which all commercial motor vehicles were banned 
on January 6, 1983, are not included in the National Network.
    (g) Restrictions--Federal-aid primary--other than interstate. (1) 
Reasonable restrictions on the use of non-Interstate Federal-aid Primary 
routes on the National Network by STAA-authorized vehicles may be 
imposed during certain

[[Page 295]]

peak hours of travel or on specific travel lanes of multi-lane 
facilities. Restrictions related to construction zones, seasonal 
operation, adverse weather conditions or structural or clearance 
deficiencies may be imposed.
    (2) All restrictions on the use of the National Network based on 
hours of use by vehicles authorized by the STAA require prior FHWA 
approval. Requests for such restrictions on the National Network shall 
be submitted in writing to the appropriate FHWA Division Office. 
Approval of requests for restrictions will be contingent on the ability 
to justify significant negative impact on safety, the environment and/or 
operational efficiency.

had an overall length not exceeding 65 feet.
    (c) State maximum length limits for semitrailers operating in a 
truck tractor-semitrailer combination and semitrailers and trailers 
operating in a truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer combination are subject 
to the following:
    (1) No State shall prohibit the use of trailers or semitrailers of 
such dimensions as those that were in actual and lawful use in such 
State on December 1, 1982, as set out in appendix B of this part.
    (2) If on December 1, 1982, State length limitations on a 
semitrailer were described in terms of the distance from the kingpin to 
rearmost axle, or end of semitrailer, the operation of any semitrailer 
that complies with that limitation must be allowed.
    (d) No State shall impose a limit of less than 45 feet on the length 
of any bus on the NN.
    (e) Specialized equipment--(1) Automobile transporters. (i) 
Automobile transporters are considered to be specialized equipment. As 
provided in Sec. 658.5, automobile transporters may carry vehicles on 
the power unit behind the cab and on an over-cab rack. No State shall 
impose an overall length limitation of less than 65 feet on traditional 
automobile transporters (5th wheel located on tractor frame over rear 
axle(s)), including ``low boys,'' or less than 75 feet on stinger-
steered automobile transporters. Paragraph (c) requires the States to 
allow operation of vehicles with the dimensions that were legal in the 
State on December 1, 1982.
    (ii) All length provisions regarding automobile transporters are 
exclusive of front and rear cargo overhang. No State shall impose a 
front overhang limitation of less than 3 feet or a rear overhang 
limitation of less than 4 feet. Extendable ramps or ``flippers'' on 
automobile transporters that are used to achieve the allowable 3-foot 
front and 4-foot rear cargo overhangs are excluded from the measurement 
of vehicle length, but must be retracted when not supporting vehicles.
    (iii) Drive-away saddlemount vehicle transporter combinations are 
considered to be specialized equipment. No

[[Page 296]]

State shall impose an overall length limit of less or more than 97 feet 
on such combinations. This provision applies to drive-away saddlemount 
combinations with up to three saddlemounted vehicles. Such combinations 
may include one fullmount. Saddlemount combinations must also comply 
with the applicable motor carrier safety regulations at 49 CFR parts 
390-399.
    (2) Boat transporters. (i) Boat transporters are considered to be 
specialized equipment. As provided for automobile transporters in Sec. 
658.5, boat transporters may carry boats on the power unit so long as

exceeded. No State shall impose an overall length limitation of less 
than 65 feet on traditional boat transporters (fifth wheel located on 
tractor frame over rear axle(s), including ``low boys,'' or less than 75 
feet on stinger-steered boat transporters. In addition, no State shall 
impose an overall length limitation of less than 65 feet on truck-
trailer boat transporters. Paragraph (c) of this section requires the 
States to allow operation of vehicles with the dimensions that were 
legal in the State on December 1, 1982.
    (ii) All length provisions regarding boat transporters are exclusive 
of front and rear overhang. Further, no State shall impose a front 
overhang limitation of less than three (3) feet nor a rearmost overhang 
limitation of less than four (4) feet.
    (3) Truck-tractor semitrailer-semitrailer. (i) Truck-tractor 
semitrailer-semitrailer combination vehicles are considered to be 
specialized equipment. No State shall impose a length limitation of less 
than 28 feet on any semitrailer or 28\1/2\ feet if the semitrailer was 
in legal operation on December 1, 1982, operating in a truck-tractor 
semitrailer-semitrailer combination. No State shall impose an overall 
length limitation on a truck-tractor semitrailer-semitrailer combination 
when each semitrailer length is 28 feet, or 28\1/2\ feet if 
grandfathered.
    (ii) The B-train assembly is excluded from the measurement of 
trailer length when used between the first and second trailer of a 
truck-tractor semitrailer-semitrailer combination vehicle. However, when 
there is no semitrailer mounted to the B-train assembly, it will be 
included in the length measurement of the semitrailer, the length 
limitation in this case being 48 feet, or longer if grandfathered.
    (4) Maxi-cube vehicle. No State shall impose a length limit on a 
maxi-cube vehicle, as defined in Sec. 658.5 of this part, of less than 
34 feet on either cargo box, excluding drawbar or hitching device; 60 
feet on the distance from the front of the first to the rear of the 
second cargo box, including the space between the cargo boxes; or 65 
feet on the overall length of the combination, including the space 
between the cargo boxes. The measurement for compliance with the 60- and 
65-foot distance shall include the actual distance between cargo boxes, 
measured along the centerline of the drawbar or hitching device. For 
maxi-cubes with an adjustable length drawbar or hitching device, the 60- 
and 65-foot distances shall be measured with a drawbar spacing of not 
more than 27 inches. The drawbar may be temporarily extended beyond that 
distance to maneuver or load the vehicle.
    (5) Beverage semitrailer. (i) A beverage semitrailer is specialized 
equipment if it has an upper coupler plate that extends beyond the front 
of the semitrailer, but not beyond its swing radius, as measured from 
the center line of the kingpin to a front corner of the semitrailer, 
which cannot be used for carrying cargo other than the structure of the 
semitrailer, and with the center line of the kingpin not more than 28 
feet from the rear of the semitrailer (exclusive of rear-mounted devices 
not measured in determining semitrailer length). No State shall impose 
an overall length limit on such vehicles when operating in a truck 
tractor-beverage semitrailer or truck tractor-beverage semitrailer-
beverage trailer combination on the NN.
    (ii) The beverage trailer referred to in paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this 
section means a beverage semitrailer and converter dolly. Converter 
dolly has the same meaning as in 49 CFR 393.5.
    (iii) Truck tractor-beverage semitrailer combinations shall have the 
same access to points of loading and unloading as 28-foot semitrailers

[[Page 297]]

    (6) Munitions carriers using dromedary equipment. A truck tractor 
equipped with a dromedary unit operating in combination with a 
semitrailer is considered to be specialized equipment, providing the 
combination is transporting Class 1 explosives and/or any munitions 
related security material as specified by the U.S. Department of Defense 
in compliance with 49 CFR 177.835. No State shall impose an overall 
length limitation of less than 75 feet on the combination while in 
operation.
    (f) A truck tractor containing a dromedary box, deck, or plate in 
legal operation on December 1, 1982, shall be permitted to continue to 
operate, notwithstanding its cargo carrying capacity, throughout its 
useful life. Proof of such legal operation on December 1, 1982, shall 
rest upon the operator of the equipment.
    (g) No State shall impose a limitation of less than 46 feet on the 
distance from the kingpin to the center of the rear axle on trailers or 
semitrailers used exclusively or primarily to transport vehicles in 
connection with motorsports competition events.
    (h) Truck-tractors, pulling 2 trailers or semitrailers, used to 
transport custom harvester equipment during harvest months within the 
State of Nebraska may not exceed 81 feet 6 inches.

    (ii) That do not extend more than 3 inches beyond each side or the 
rear of the vehicle, or
    (iii) That do not extend more than 24 inches beyond the rear of the 
vehicle and are needed for loading or unloading, or
    (vi) Listed in appendix D to this part;
    (3) Resilient bumpers that do not extend more than 6 inches beyond 
the front or rear of the vehicle;
    (4) Aerodynamic devices that extend a maximum of 5 feet beyond the 
rear of the vehicle, provided such devices have neither the strength, 
rigidity nor mass to damage a vehicle, or injure a passenger in a 
vehicle, that strikes a trailer so equipped from the rear, and provided 
also that they do not obscure tail lamps, turn signals, marker lamps, 
identification lamps, or any other required safety devices, such as 
hazardous materials placards or conspicuity markings; and
    (5) A fixed step up to 3 inches deep at the front of an existing 
automobile transporter until April 29, 2005. It will be the 
responsibility of the operator of the unit to prove that the step 
existed prior to April 29, 2002. Such proof can be in the form of a work 
order for

[[Page 298]]

equipment modification, a receipt for purchase and installation of the 
piece, or any similar type of documentation. However, after April 29, 
2005, the step shall no longer be excluded from a vehicle's length.
    (c) Each exclusion allowance is specific and may not be combined 
with other excluded devices.
    (d) Measurements are to be made from a point on one side or end of a

Sec. 658.17  Weight.

    (a) The provisions of the section are applicable to the National 
System of Interstate and Defense Highways and reasonable access thereto.
    (b) The maximum gross vehicle weight shall be 80,000 pounds except 
where lower gross vehicle weight is dictated by the bridge formula.
    (c) The maximum gross weight upon any one axle, including any one 
axle of a group of axles, or a vehicle is 20,000 pounds.
    (d) The maximum gross weight on tandem axles is 34,000 pounds.
    (e) No vehicle or combination of vehicles shall be moved or operated 
on any Interstate highway when the gross weight on two or more 
consecutive axles exceeds the limitations prescribed by the following 
formula, referred to as the Bridge Gross Weight Formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC14OC91.012


except that two consecutive sets of tandem axles may carry a gross load 
of 34,000 pounds each if the overall distance between the first and last 
axle is 36 feet or more. In no case shall the total gross weight of a 
vehicle exceed 80,000 pounds.
    (f) Except as provided herein, States may not enforce on the 
Interstate System vehicle weight limits of less than 20,000 pounds on a 
single axle, 34,000 pounds on a tandem axle, or the weights derived from 
the Bridge Formula, up to a maximum of 80,000 pounds, including all 
enforcement tolerances. States may not limit tire loads to less than 500 
pounds per inch of tire or tread width, except that such limits may not 
be applied to tires on the steering axle. States may not limit steering 
axle weights to less than 20,000 pounds or the axle rating established 
by the manufacturer, whichever is lower.
    (g) The weights in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section 
shall be inclusive of all tolerances, enforcement or otherwise, with the 
exception of a scale allowance factor when using portable scales (wheel-
load weighers). The current accuracy of such scales is generally within 
2 or 3 percent of actual weight, but in no case shall an allowance in 
excess of 5 percent be applied. Penalty or fine schedules which impose 
no fine up to a specified threshold, i.e., 1,000 pounds, will be 
considered as tolerance provisions not authorized by 23 U.S.C. 127.
    (h) States may issue special permits without regard to the axle, 
gross, or Federal Bridge Formula requirements for nondivisible vehicles 
or loads.
    (i) The provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section 
shall not apply to single-, or tandem-axle weights, or gross weights 
legally authorized under State law on July 1, 1956. The group of axles 
requirement established in this section shall not apply to vehicles 
legally grandfathered under State groups of axles tables or formulas on 
January 4, 1975. Grandfathered weight limits are vested on the date 
specified by Congress and remain available to a State even if it chooses 
to adopt a lower weight limit for a time.
    (j) The provisions of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section 
shall not apply to the operation on Interstate Route 68 in Allegany and 
Garrett Counties, Maryland, of any specialized vehicle equipped with a 
steering axle and a tridem axle and used for hauling coal, logs, and 
pulpwood if such vehicle is of a type of vehicle as was operating in 
such counties on U.S. Routes 40 or 48 for such purposes on August 1, 
1991.
    (k) Any over-the-road bus, or any vehicle which is regularly and 
exclusively used as an intrastate public agency transit passenger bus, 
is excluded from the axle weight limits in

[[Page 299]]

paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section until October 1, 2009. Any 
State that has enforced, in the period beginning October 6, 1992, and 
ending November 30, 2005, a single axle weight limitation of 20,000 
pounds or greater but less than 24,000 pounds may not enforce a single 
axle weight limit on these vehicles of less than 24,000 lbs.
    (m) The provisions of paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section 
shall not apply to the operation, on I-99 between Bedford and Bald 
Eagle, Pennsylvania, of any vehicle that could legally operate on this 
highway section before December 29, 1995.
    (n) Any vehicle subject to this subpart that utilizes an auxiliary 
power or idle reduction technology unit in order to promote reduction of 
fuel use and emissions because of engine idling, may be allowed up to an 
additional 400 lbs. total in gross, axle, tandem, or bridge formula 
weight limits.
    (1) To be eligible for this exception, the operator of the vehicle 
must be able to prove:
    (i) By written certification, the weight of the APU; and
    (ii) By demonstration or certification, that the idle reduction 
technology is fully functional at all times.
    (2) Certification of the weight of the APU must be available to law 
enforcement officers if the vehicle is found in violation of applicable 
weight laws. The additional weight allowed cannot exceed 400 lbs. or the 
weight certified, whichever is less.

Sec. 658.19  Reasonable access.

    (a) No State may enact or enforce any law denying reasonable access 
to vehicles with dimensions authorized by the STAA between the NN and 
terminals and facilities for food, fuel, repairs, and rest. In addition, 
no State may enact or enforce any law denying reasonable access between 
the NN and points of loading and unloading to household goods carriers, 
motor carriers of passengers, and any truck tractor-semitrailer 
combination in which the semitrailer has a length not to exceed 28 feet 
(28.5 feet where allowed pursuant to Sec. 658.13(b)(5) of this part) 
and which generally operates as part of a vehicle combination described 
in Sec. Sec. 658.13(b)(5) and 658.15(a) of this part.
    (b) All States shall make available to commercial motor vehicle 
operators information regarding their reasonable access provisions to 
and from the National Network.
    (c) Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing any 
State or local government from imposing any reasonable restriction, 
based on safety considerations, on access to points of loading and 
unloading by any truck tractor-semitrailer combination in which the 
semitrailer has a length not to exceed 28\1/2\ feet and which generally 
operates as part of a vehicle combination described in Sec. Sec. 
658.13(b)(5) and 658.15(a).
    (d) No State may enact or enforce any law denying access within 1 
road-mile from the National Network using the most reasonable and 
practicable route available except for specific safety reasons on 
individual routes.
    (e) Approval of access for specific vehicles on any individual route 
applies to all vehicles of the same type regardless of ownership. 
Distinctions between vehicle types shall be based only on significant, 
substantial differences in their operating characteristics.
    (f) Blanket restrictions on 102-inch wide vehicles may not be 
imposed.
    (g) Vehicle dimension limits shall not be more restrictive than 
Federal requirements.
    (h) States shall ensure compliance with the requirements of this 
section for roads under the jurisdiction of local units of government.
    (i)(1) Except in those States in which State law authorizes the 
operation of STAA-dimensioned vehicles on all public roads and highways, 
all States shall have an access review process that provides for the 
review of requests for access from the National Network.
    (2) State access review processes shall provide for:
    (i) One or more of the following:
    (A) An analysis of the proposed access routes using observations or 
other data obtained from the operation of test vehicles over the routes;

[[Page 300]]

    (B) An analysis of the proposed access routes by application of 
vehicle templates to plans of the routes;
    (C) A general provision for allowing access, without requiring a 
request, for commercial motor vehicles with semitrailers with a kingpin 
distance of 41 feet or less (measured from the kingpin to the center of 
the rear axle, if single, or the center of a group of rear axles). State 
safety analyses may be conducted on individual routes if warranted; and
    (ii) All of the following:
    (A) The denial of access to terminals and services only on the basis 
of safety and engineering analysis of the access route.
    (B) The automatic approval of an access request if not acted upon 
within 90 days of receipt by the State. This provision shall become 
effective no later than 12 months following the effective date of this 
rule unless an extension is requested by the State and approved by FHWA.
    (C) The denial of access for any 102-inch wide vehicles only on the 
basis of the characteristics of specific routes, in particular 
significant deficiencies in lane width.
    (j)(1) Each State shall submit its access provisions to FHWA for 
approval within 6 months after June 1, 1990. In those States in which 
State law authorizes the operation of STAA-dimensioned vehicles on all 
public roads and highways, no submission or approval under this 
paragraph is required. If, in the future, such a State changes its 
authorizing legislation and restricts the operation of STAA-dimensioned 
vehicles, then compliance with these provisions will be necessary.
    (2) The FHWA will review the access provisions as submitted by each 
State subject to the provisions in paragraph (j)(1) and approve those 
that are in compliance with the requirements of this section. The FHWA 
may, at a State's request, approve State provisions that differ from the 
requirements of this section if FHWA determines that they provide 
reasonable access for STAA-dimensioned vehicles and do not impose an 
unreasonable burden on motor freight carriers, shippers and receivers 
and service facility operators.
    (3) Any State that does not have FHWA approved access provisions in 
effect within 1 year after June 1, 1990 shall follow the requirements 
and the criteria set forth in this section and section 658.5 and 658.19 
for determining access for STAA-dimensioned vehicles to terminals and 
services. The FHWA may approve a State's request for a time extension if 
it is received by FHWA at least 1 month before the end of the 1 year 
period.

Sec. 658.21  Identification of National Network.

    (a) To identify the National Network, a State may sign the routes or 
provide maps of lists of highways describing the National Network.
    (b) Exceptional local conditions on the National Network shall be 
signed. All signs shall conform to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control 
Devices. Exceptional conditions shall include but not be limited to:
    (1) Operational restrictions designed to maximize the efficiency of 
the total traffic flow, such as time of day prohibitions, or lane use 
controls.
    (2) Geometric and structural restrictions, such as vertical 
clearances, posted weight limits on bridges, or restrictions caused by 
construction operations.
    (3) Detours from urban Interstate routes to bypass of 
circumferential routes for commercial motor vehicles not destined for 
the urban area to be bypassed.


<R05>
Sec. 658.23  LCV freeze; cargo-carrying unit freeze.

    (a)(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section and except for 
tow trucks with vehicles in tow, a State may allow the operation of 
LCV's on the Interstate System only as listed in appendix C to this 
part.
    (2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a State may not 
allow the operation on the NN of any CMV combination with two or more 
cargo-carrying units (not including the truck tractor) whose cargo-
carrying units exceed:

[[Page 301]]

    (i) The maximum combination trailer, semitrailer, or other type of 
length limitation authorized by State law or regulation of that State on 
or before June 1, 1991; or
    (ii) The length of the cargo-carrying units of those CMV 
combinations, by specific configuration, in actual, lawful operation on 
a regular or periodic basis (including continuing seasonal operation) in 
that State on or before June 1, 1991, as listed in appendix C to this 
part.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the following 
CMV combinations with two or more cargo-carrying units may operate on 
the NN.
    (1) Truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer and truck tractor-semitrailer-
semitrailer combinations with a maximum length of the individual cargo 
units of 28.5 feet or less.
    (2) Vehicles described in Sec. 658.13(e) and (g).
    (3) Truck-trailer and truck-semitrailer combinations with an overall 
length of 65 feet or less.
    (4) Maxi-cubes.
    (5) Tow trucks with vehicles in tow.
    (c) For specific safety purposes and road construction, a State may 
make minor adjustments of a temporary and emergency nature to route 
designation and vehicle operating restrictions applicable to 
combinations subject to 23 U.S.C. 127(d) and 49 U.S.C. 31112 and in 
effect on June 1, 1991 (July 6, 1991, for Alaska). Minor adjustments 
which last 30 days or less may be made without notifying the FHWA. Minor 
adjustments which exceed 30 days require approval of the FHWA. When such 
adjustments are needed, a State must submit to the FHWA, by the end of 
the 30th day, a written description of the emergency, the date on which 
it began, and the date on which it is expected to conclude. If the 
adjustment involves alternate route designations, the State shall 
describe the new route on which vehicles otherwise subject to the freeze 
imposed by 23 U.S.C. 127(d) and 49 U.S.C. 31112 are allowed to operate. 
To the extent possible, the geometric and pavement design 
characteristics of the alternate route should be equivalent to those of 
the highway section which is temporarily unavailable. If the adjustment 
involves vehicle operating restrictions, the State shall list the 
restrictions that have been removed or modified. If the adjustment is 
approved, the FHWA will publish the notice of adjustment, with an 
expiration date, in the Federal Register. Requests for extension of time 
beyond the originally established conclusion date shall be subject to 
the same approval and publications process as the original request. If 
upon consultation with the FHWA a decision is reached that minor 
adjustments made by a State are not legitimately attributable to road or 
bridge construction or safety, the FHWA will inform the State, and the 
original conditions of the freeze must be reimposed immediately. Failure 
to do so may subject the State to a penalty pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 141.
    (d) A State may issue a permit authorizing a CMV to transport an 
overlength nondivisible load on two or more cargo-carrying units on the 
NN without regard to the restrictions in Sec. 658.23(a)(2).
    (e) States further restricting or prohibiting the operation of 
vehicles subject to 23 U.S.C. 127(d) and 49 U.S.C. 31112 after June 1, 
1991, shall notify the FHWA within 30 days after the restriction is 
effective. The FHWA will publish the restriction in the Federal Register 
as an amendment to appendix C to this part. Failure to provide such 
notification may subject the State to a penalty pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 
141.
    (f) The Federal Highway Administrator, on his or her own motion or 
upon a request by any person (including a State), shall review the 
information set forth in appendix C to this part. If the Administrator 
determines there is cause to believe that a mistake was made in the 
accuracy of the information contained in appendix C to this part, the 
Administrator shall commence a proceeding to determine whether the 
information published should be corrected. If the Administrator 
determines that there is a mistake in the accuracy of the information 
contained in appendix C to this part, the Administrator shall publish

[[Page 302]]

in the Federal Register the appropriate corrections to reflect that 
determination.

Sec. Appendix C to Part 658--Trucks Over 80,000 Pounds on the Interstate 
       System and Trucks Over STAA Lengths on the National Network

    This appendix contains the weight and size provisions that were in 
effect on or before June 1, 1991 (July 6, 1991 for Alaska), for vehicles 
covered by 23 U.S.C. 127(d) (LCV's) and 49 U.S.C. app. 2311(j) 
(commercial motor vehicles (CMV's) with 2 or more cargo-carrying units). 
Weights and dimensions are ``frozen'' at the values shown here, which 
were in effect on June 1, 1991 (Alaska, July 6, 1991). All vehicles are 
listed by configuration type.

[[Page 316]]

           Trucks Over 80,000 Pounds on the Interstate System

    In the State-by-State descriptions, CMV combinations which can also 
be LCV's are identified with the letters ``LCV'' following the type of 
combination vehicle. The maximum allowable gross vehicle weight is given 
in this appendix (in thousands of pounds indicated by a ``K''), as well 
as information summarizing the operational conditions, routes, and legal 
citations. The term ``Interstate System'' as used herein refers to the 
Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways.

            Trucks Over STAA Lengths on the National Network

    Listed for each State by combination type is either:
    1. The maximum cargo-carrying length (shown in feet); or
    2. A notation that such vehicle is not allowed (indicated by a 
``NO'').
    CMV's are categorized as follows:
    1. A CMV combination consisting of a truck tractor and two trailing 
units.
    2. A CMV combination consisting of a truck tractor and three 
trailing units.
    3. CMV combinations with two or more cargo-carrying units not 
included in descriptions 1 or 2.
    In the following table the left number is the maximum cargo-carrying 
length measured in feet from the front of the first cargo unit to the 
rear of the last cargo unit. This distance is not to include length 
exclusive devices which have been approved by the Secretary or by any 
State. Devices excluded from length determination shall only include 
items whose function is related to the safe and efficient operation of 
the semitrailer or trailer. No device excluded from length determination 
shall be designed or used for carrying cargo. The right number is the 
maximum gross weight in thousands of pounds that the type of vehicle can 
carry when operating as an LCV on the Interstate System. For every State 
where there is a length or weight number in the table that follows, 
additional information is provided.

(1)--State submission includes multiple vehicles in this category--see
  individual State listings.
(2)--No maximum weight is established as this vehicle combination is not
  considered an ``LCV'' per the ISTEA definition. Florida's combination
  is not allowed to operate on the Interstate System, and the
  combinations for Hawaii, Mississippi, and Nebraska are not allowed to
  exceed 80,000 pounds.
(3)--No maximum cargo-carrying length is established for this
  combination. Because State law limits each trailing unit to not more
  than 28.5 feet in length, this combination is allowed to operate on
  all NN routes under the authority of the STAA of 1982, regardless of
  actual cargo-carrying length. The maximum weight listed is New
  Mexico's maximum allowable gross weight on the Interstate System under
  the grandfather authority of 23 U.S.C. 127.
(4)--These dimensions do not apply to the same combinations. The 110-
  foot length is limited to vehicles entering from Oklahoma, also
  limited to 90K gross weight. The 120K gross weight is limited to
  vehicles entering from Kansas, also limited to a cargo carrying length
  of 109 feet.

    The following abbreviation convention is used throughout the

or 3 for two or three trailing units. For example, the phrase ``Arizona 
truck tractor and 2 trailing units'', would be noted as ``AZ-TT2''; the 
phrase ``Indiana truck tractor and 3 trailing units'' would be noted as 
``IN-TT3'', etc.

                              STATE: ALASKA

             COMBINATION: Truck tractor and 2 trailing units

               LENGTH OF THE CARGO-CARRYING UNITS: 95 feet

                         OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS:

    WEIGHT: The combination must be in compliance with State laws and 
regulations. There are no highways in the State subject to Interstate

maximum weight is not applicable.
    DRIVER: The driver must have a commercial driver's license with the 
appropriate endorsement.
    VEHICLE: Combinations with an overall length greater than 75 feet, 
measured bumper to bumper, must display an ``OVERSIZE<greek-i><greek-i> 
warning sign on the front and rear. In combinations where one cargo-
carrying unit is more than 5,000 pounds heavier than the other, the 
heavier unit shall be placed immediately behind the power unit. Weather 
restrictions are imposed when hazardous conditions exist, as determined 
by the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities 
(DOT&PF) and the Alaska Department of Public Safety, Division of State 
Troopers. Time of day travel is not restricted.
    PERMIT: None required.
    ACCESS: Alaska allows reasonable access not to exceed 5 miles to 
reach or return from terminals and facilities for food, fuel, or rest. 
The most direct route must be used. The Commissioner of the Alaska 
DOT&PF may allow access to specific routes if it can be shown that 
travel frequency, necessity, and route accommodation are required.

the facility;
    (3) The access route(s) between the designated Interstate System and 
the facility must be approved in advance by the public entity (Colorado 
DOT, municipality, or county) having jurisdiction for the roadway(s) 
that make up the route(s). Where the State of Colorado has jurisdiction 
over the access route(s), it will consider the following safety, 
engineering, and other criteria in determining whether to approve the 
route(s):
    (a) Safety of the motoring public;
    (b) Geometrics of the street and roadway;
    (c) Traffic volumes and patterns;
    (d) Protection of State highways, roadways, and structures;
    (e) Zoning and general characteristics of the route(s) to be 
encountered; and
    (f) Other relevant criteria warranted by special circumstances of 
the proposed route(s).
    Local entities, counties, and municipalities having jurisdiction 
over route(s), should consider similar criteria in determining whether 
to approve the proposed ingress and egress route(s); and
    (4) A permit holder shall access only the facility or location 
authorized by the permit. If the permit authorizes more than one 
facility or location, then on any single trip by an LVC from the 
designated Interstate System the permit holder may access only one 
facility or location before returning to the designated Interstate 
System.

              LENGTH OF THE CARGO-CARRYING UNITS: 109 feet

             MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE GROSS WEIGHT: 120,000 pounds

    OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS: The operations of triple trailing unit 
combinations are governed by two sets of criteria: (1) The Turnpike and 
Turnpike access rules, and (2) the SVC rules which apply off of the 
Turnpike except in the case of vehicles operating under Turnpike access 
authority. The Turnpike and Turnpike access rules allow a maximum 
combination vehicle length of 119 feet overall. The SVC rules require 
``Triples'' to have trailers of no more than 28.5 feet maximum length or 
a cargo-carrying length of approximately 95 feet.
    The Turnpike and Turnpike access rules have no time-of-day travel 
restrictions or other special requirements.
    The SVC rules have several operational conditions. SVC's cannot 
operate on holidays or during holiday weekends. SVC's cannot be 
dispatched or operated during adverse weather conditions. SVC's must 
travel in the right lane, except for passing, and the following distance 
is 100 feet for every 10 miles per hour. SVC permits can include any 
restrictions deemed necessary, including specific routes and hours, 
days, and/or seasons of operation. Rules and regulations can be 
promulgated regarding driver qualifications, vehicle equipment, and 
operational standards.
    WEIGHT: All triple trailing unit combinations must comply with the 
Federal Bridge Formula with maximum axle weights of 20,000 pounds on a 
single axle and 34,000 pounds on a tandem axle. The maximum

[[Page 326]]

gross weight is 120,000 pounds on the Turnpike and Turnpike access 
routes, but the SVC's have a maximum weight of 110,000 pounds.
    DRIVER: A commercial driver's license with the appropriate 
endorsement is required under both Turnpike and SVC rules. In addition, 
for SVC operation drivers must have completed SVC driver training and a 
company road test. Drivers must also have 2 years of experience driving 
tractor-semitrailers and 1 year driving doubles.
    VEHICLE: Vehicle requirements apply to the SVC program only. All 
axles, except steering axles, must have dual wheels, and all vehicles 
must be able to achieve and maintain a speed of 40 miles per hour on all 
grades. Antispray mud flaps shall be attached to the rear of each axle 
except the steering axle. Mud flaps shall have a surface designed to 
absorb and deflect excess moisture to the road surface. Drop and lift 
axles are prohibited. Vehicles may have a minimum of six and a maximum 
of nine axles. The heaviest trailers are to be placed forward. Hazardous 
cargo is prohibited. Convex mirrors are required on both sides of the 
cab. Equipment must comply with the requirements of 49 CFR 390-399.
    Any SVC shall be stable at all times during normal braking and 
normal operation. When traveling on a level, smooth paved surface, an 
SVC shall follow the towing vehicle without shifting or swerving beyond 
the restraints of the lane of travel.
    PERMIT: Same as the KS-TT2 combination on the Turnpike and Turnpike 
access routes. A fee per company plus a permit fee for each power unit 
is required for the SVC program, and the SVC permits are valid for 1 
year. SVC's operated pursuant to regulation 36-1-33 under an annual 
permit shall be covered by insurance.
    ACCESS: Turnpike access routes include all routes between the 
Turnpike and a motor freight terminal located within a 10-mile radius of 
each toll booth, except at the northeastern end of the Turnpike where a 
20-mile radius is allowed. SVC access routes include all routes between 
the Interstate and a motor freight terminal located within 5 miles of 
the Interstate at Goodland.

                          STATE: MASSACHUSETTS

          COMBINATION: Truck tractor and 2 trailing units--LCV

                LENGTH OF CARGO-CARRYING UNITS: 104 feet

             MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE GROSS WEIGHT: 127,400 pounds

                         OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS:

    WEIGHT: Any combination of vehicles may not exceed a maximum gross 
weight of 127,400 pounds. The maximum gross weight of the tractor and 
first semitrailer shall not exceed 71,000 pounds. The maximum gross 
weight of each unit of dolly and semitrailer shall not exceed 56,400 
pounds. The maximum gross weight for the tractor and first semitrailer 
is governed by the formula 35,000 pounds plus 1,000 pounds per foot 
between the center of the foremost axle and the center of the rearmost 
axle of the semitrailer. The maximum gross weight on any one axle is 
22,400 pounds, and on any tandem axle it is 36,000 pounds. Axles less 
than 46 inches between centers are considered to be one axle.
    DRIVER: The driver must have a commercial driver's license with the 
appropriate endorsement and must be registered with the Massachusetts 
Turnpike Authority (MTA). Registration shall include all specified 
driving records, safety records, physical examinations, and minimum of 5 
years of driving experience with tractor trailers.
    VEHICLE:
    (1) Brake Regulation. The brakes on any vehicle, dolly converter, or 
combination of vehicles used in tandem-trailer operations as a minimum 
shall comply with Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations in 49 CFR 
part 393. In addition, any vehicle, dolly converter or combination of 
vehicles used in tandem-trailer operations shall meet the requirements 
of the provisions of the Massachusetts Motor Vehicle Law. Tandem-trailer 
combinations certified on or after June 1, 1968, shall be equipped with 
suitable devices to accelerate application and release of the brakes of 
the towed vehicle.
    (2) Axles. A tractor used to haul a tandem trailer combination with 
a gross weight of more than 110,000 pounds shall be equipped with tandem 
rear axles, each of which shall be engaged to bear its full share of the 
load on the roadway surface.
    (3) Tandem Assembly. When the gross weight of the trailers vary by 
more than 20 percent, they shall be coupled with the

[[Page 327]]

heaviest trailer attached to the tractor. Coupling devices and towing 
devices shall comply with the Federal regulations as stated in 49 CFR 
part 393. When the distance between the rear of the one semitrailer and 
the front of the following semitrailer is 10 feet or more, the dolly 
shall be equipped with a device, or the trailers shall be connected 
along the sides with suitable material, which will indicate to other 
Turnpike users that the trailers are connected and are in effect one 
unit. The MTA shall approve the devices or connections to be used on the 
semitrailers that would indicate it is one unit. Coupling devices shall 
be so designed, constructed, and installed, and the vehicles in a tandem 
trailer combination shall be so designed and constructed to ensure that 
when traveling on a level, smooth paved surface they will follow in the 
path of the towing vehicle without shifting or swerving over 3 inches to 
each side of the path of the towing vehicle when it is moving in a 
straight line. A tandem trailer unit may pass another vehicle traveling 
in the same direction only if the speed differential will allow the 
tandem trailer unit to complete the maneuver and return to the normal 
driving lane within a distance of 1 mile.
    Each truck tractor shall be equipped with at least one spare fuse or 
other overload protective device, if the devices are not of a reset 
type, for each kind and size used. The vehicle is to carry at least one 
set of tire chains for at least one driving wheel on each side between 
October 15 and May 1 of each year. Each truck tractor shall carry a fire 
extinguisher which shall have an aggregate rating of 20 BC.
    PERMIT: A permittee must demonstrate to the MTA that it has 
insurance coverage of the type and amounts required by Turnpike 
regulation. Both the tractor manufacturer and the permittee shall 
certify to the MTA, prior to the approval of a tractor, that it is 
capable of hauling the maximum permissible gross load to be transported 
by the permittee at a speed not less than 20 miles per hour on all 
portions of the turnpike system. The MTA may revoke or temporarily 
suspend any permit at will and the instructions of the MTA or 
Massachusetts State Police shall be complied with immediately.
    ACCESS: Makeup and breakup areas. Tandem trailer units shall not 
leave the Turnpike right-of-way and shall be assembled and disassembled 
only in designated areas.

              LENGTH OF THE CARGO-CARRYING UNITS: 102 feet

             MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE GROSS WEIGHT: 143,000 pounds

                         OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS:

    WEIGHT: The following information pertains to tandem trailer 
combinations with either trailer more than 28.5 feet long but not more 
than 48 feet long. A nine-axle combination vehicle may not exceed a 
total maximum gross weight of 143,000 pounds. An eight-axle combination 
vehicle may not exceed a total maximum gross weight of 138,400 pounds. 
The maximum gross weight that may be carried upon any combination of 
units is limited by the maximum gross weight that can be carried upon 
the axles as follows. For a nine-axle combination: Drive axles--36,000 
pounds, axles four/five--36,000 pounds, axles six/seven--27,000 pounds, 
and axles eight/nine--36,000 pounds. A minimum 12-foot axle spacing 
between the fifth and sixth axles is also required on the nine-axle LCV. 
For an eight-axle combination: Drive axles--36,000 pounds, axles four/
five--36,000 pounds, sixth axle--22,400 pounds, and axles seven/eight--
36,000 pounds. The eight-axle LCV has no minimum axle-spacing 
requirements. For gross weights in excess of 138,400 pounds the 
combination must include a tandem-axle dolly to meet the nine-axle 
requirements. Maximum permissible gross weight for B-train combination 
is 127,000 pounds.
    When the gross weight of the two trailers in a tandem combination 
vary more than 20 percent, the heaviest of the two must be placed in the 
lead position.
    For tandem trailer combinations in which neither trailing unit 
exceeds 28.5 feet in length the following maximum allowable weights 
apply: for a single axle--28,000 pounds (except that steering axles may 
not exceed 22,400 pounds), for a tandem axle--42,500 pounds, for a tri-
axle--52,500 pounds. The gross weight may not exceed 100,000 pounds or 
the manufacturers gross weight rating, whichever is lower.
    DRIVER: For operation on highways under the jurisdiction of the New 
York State Thruway Authority (NYSTA), except for the full length of I-84 
and that portion of I-287 from Thruway exit 8 to I-95, the driver must 
have a commercial driver's license with the appropriate endorsement, and 
hold a Tandem Trailer Driver's Permit issued by the NYSTA. In order to 
obtain an NYSTA driver's permit, an applicant must (1) hold a valid 
commercial driver's license with multiple-trailer endorsement; (2) be 
over 26 years old, in good health, and have at least 5 years of provable 
experience driving tractor-trailer combinations; and (3) meet all other 
application requirements with regard to driving history established by 
the NYSTA. Qualified drivers receive a Tandem Trailer Driver's Permit 
for Tandem Vehicle Operation which is valid only for the operation of 
the certified equipment owned by the company to which the permit is 
issued.
    For operation on highways under the jurisdiction of the New York 
State DOT, cities not wholly included in one county, the full length of 
I-84 and that portion of I-287 from Thruway exit 8 to I-95, the driver 
must have a commercial driver's license with the appropriate 
endorsement.
    VEHICLE: All vehicles must meet the requirements of applicable 
Federal and State statutes, rules, and regulations. Vehicles operating 
on highways under the jurisdiction of the NYSTA, except for the full 
length of I-84 and that portion of I-287 from Thruway exit 8 to I-95, 
must also meet the following additional requirements. The tractor 
manufacturer and the permittee shall certify to the NYSTA prior to the 
approval of the tractor that it is capable of hauling the maximum 
permissible gross load at a speed of

[[Page 335]]

not less than 20 miles per hour on all portions of the thruway system.
    The brakes on any vehicle, dolly converter, or combination of 
vehicles shall comply with 49 CFR part 393 and, in addition, any vehicle 
or dolly converter shall meet the provisions of the New York State 
Traffic Law.
    Tandem trailer operations shall be equipped, at a minimum, with 
emergency equipment as required by 49 CFR part 393, subpart H, as 
amended, tire chains from October 15 to May 1 of each year, a fire 
extinguisher with an aggregate rating of 20BC, and each trailer with 
specific lamps and reflectors.
    All tractors certified by the NYSTA for use with tandem trailers 
will be assigned an identification number by the NYSTA which must be 
placed on the vehicle. The number must be at least 3 inches in height 
and visible to a person standing at ground level opposite the driver's 
position in the cab.
    Axle Type. Tractors to be used for hauling 110,000 pounds or more 
shall be equipped with tandem rear axles, both with driving power. 
Tractors to be used for hauling 110,000 pounds or less may have a single 
drive axle. Tandem combinations using single wheel tires commonly 
referred to as ``Super Singles'' are required to use triple-axle 
tractors, dual-axle trailers, and dual-axle dollies.
    Dollies. Every converter dolly certified on and after June 1, 1968, 
used to convert a semitrailer to a full trailer may have either single 
or tandem axles at the option of the permittee. Single-axle dollies may 
not utilize low profile tires. Combination vehicles with a gross weight 
in excess of 138,400 pounds must have a tandem-axle dolly to meet the 
nine-axle requirement. If the distance between two semitrailers is 10 
feet or more, the dolly shall be equipped with a device or the trailers 
connected along the sides with suitable material to indicate they are in 
effect one unit. The devices or connection shall be approved by the 
NYSTA prior to use on a tandem trailer combination. The NYSTA tandem-
trailer provisions require that converter dollies shall be coupled with 
one or more safety chains or cables to the frame or an extension of the 
frame of the motor vehicle by which it is towed. Each dolly converter 
must also be equipped with mud flaps. Tandem combinations using a 
sliding fifth wheel attached to the lead trailer, known as a ``B-Train'' 
combination, will require a separate Thruway Engineer Service approval 
prior to the initial tandem run. Special provisions regarding B-Trains 
will be reviewed at the time of the application or request for use on 
the Thruway.
    PERMIT: For operation on highways under the jurisdiction of the New 
York State DOT, cities not wholly included in one county, or the 
following highway sections under NYSTA jurisdiction; the full length of 
I-84 and that portion of I-287 from Thruway exit 8 to I-95, a permit to 
exceed the weight limits set forth in section 385(15) of the New York 
State Vehicle and Traffic Law must be obtained from the State DOT, city 
involved, or the NYSTA. A fee is charged for the permit.
    For operation on highways under the jurisdiction of the NYSTA, 
except for the full length of I-84 and that portion of I-287 from 
Thruway exit 8 to I-95, companies must file an application for a Tandem 
Trailer Permit with the NYSTA. Permits are issued to such companies upon 
meeting qualifications, including insurance, for tandem combinations 
over 65 feet in length. No permit fee is charged; however, Thruway tolls 
are charged for each use of the Thruway, and the equipment must be 
certified by the NYSTA annually. The annual re-certification of 
equipment is handled by: New York State Thruway Authority, Manager of 
Traffic Safety Services, P.O. Box 189, Albany, New York 12201-0189
    Transportation of hazardous materials is subject to special

pounds. Axles spaced 40 inches or less apart are considered one axle. 
Axles spaced 8 feet or more apart are considered as individual axles. 
The gross weight of two individual axles may be restricted by the weight 
formula. Spacing between axles shall be measured from axle center to 
axle center.
    Axles spaced over 40 inches but less than 8 feet apart shall not 
carry a gross weight in excess of 17,000 pounds per axle. The gross 
weight of three or more axles in a grouping is determined by the 
measurement between the extreme axle centers. During the spring breakup 
season or on otherwise posted highways, reductions in the above axle 
weights may be specified.
    The weight in pounds on any one wheel shall not exceed one-half the 
allowable axle weight. Dual tires are considered one wheel.
    The weight per inch of tire width shall not exceed 550 pounds. The 
width of tire shall be the manufacturer's rating.

weights of the trailers vary by more than 20 percent, they shall be 
coupled according to their gross weights with the heavier trailer 
forward. A minimum distance of 500 feet shall be maintained between 
double units and/or triple units except when overtaking and passing 
another vehicle. A double shall remain in the right-hand, outside lane 
except when passing or when emergency or work-zone conditions exist. 
When, in the opinion of the OTC, the weather conditions are such that 
operation of a double is inadvisable, the OTC will notify the permittee 
that travel is prohibited for a certain period of time.
    Class A and B explosives; Class A poisons; and Class 1, 2, and 3 
radioactive material cannot be transported in double trailer 
combinations. Other hazardous materials may be transported in one 
trailer of a double. The hazardous materials should be placed in the 
front trailer unless doing so will result in the second trailer weighing 
more than the first trailer.
    ACCESS: Tandem trailer units shall not leave the Turnpike right-of-
way and shall be assembled and disassembled only in designated areas 
located at Exits 4, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, and 16.

    Distance measured to nearest foot; when exactly one-half foot, take 
next larger number.
    DRIVER: The driver must have a commercial driver's license with the 
appropriate endorsement.
    VEHICLE: For a combination which includes a truck tractor and two 
trailing units, the lead trailing unit (semitrailer) may be up to 40 
feet long. The second trailing unit may be up to 35 feet long. However, 
the primary control is the total cargo-carrying distance which has a 
maximum length of 68 feet. Any towed vehicles in a combination must be 
equipped with safety chains or cables to prevent the towbar from 
dropping to the ground in the event the coupling fails. The chains or 
cables must have sufficient strength to control the towed vehicle in the 
event the coupling device fails and must be attached with no more slack 
than necessary to permit proper turning. However, this requirement does 
not apply to a fifth-wheel coupling if the upper and lower halves of the 
fifth wheel must be manually released before they can be separated.
    PERMIT: A permit is required for operation if the gross combination 
weight exceeds 80,000 pounds. A fee is charged. Permitted movements must 
have the lighter trailing unit placed to the rear, and use splash and 
spray devices when operating in rainy weather. Movement is not allowed 
when road surfaces are hazardous due to ice or snow, or when other 
atmospheric conditions make travel unsafe.
    ACCESS: As allowed by the Oregon DOT.
    ROUTES: All NN routes.
    LEGAL CITATIONS: ORS 810.010, ORS 810.030 through 810.060, and ORS 
818.010 through 818.235.

          COMBINATION: Truck tractor and 3 trailing units--LCV

               LENGTH OF THE CARGO-CARRYING UNITS: 96 feet

             MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE GROSS WEIGHT: 105,500 pounds

                         OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS:

    WEIGHT, DRIVER, PERMIT, and ACCESS: Same as the OR-TT2 combination.
    VEHICLE: Trailing units must be of equal length. The overall length 
of the combination is limited to 105 feet. Any towed vehicles in a 
combination must be equipped with safety chains or cables to prevent the 
towbar from dropping to the ground in the event the coupling fails. The 
chains or cables must have sufficient strength to control the towed 
vehicle in the event the coupling device fails and must be attached with 
no more slack than necessary to permit proper turning. However, this 
requirement does not apply to a fifth-wheel coupling if the upper and 
lower halves of the fifth wheel must be manually released before they 
can be separated.
    ROUTES: The following NN routes are also open to truck tractor and 
three trailing unit combinations.

    LEGAL CITATIONS: Same as the OR-TT2 combination.

                              STATE: OREGON

                       COMBINATION: Truck-trailer

           LENGTH OF CARGO-CARRYING UNITS: 70 feet, 5 inches.

WEIGHT: This combination must operate in compliance with State laws and 
 regulations. Because it is not an LCV, it is not subject to the ISTEA 
                 freeze as it applies to maximum weight.

DRIVER, ACCESS, ROUTES, AND LEGAL CITATIONS: Same as OR-TT2 combination.

    VEHICLE: The truck or trailer may be up to 40 feet long not to 
exceed 75 feet overall. The truck may have a built-in hoist to load 
cargo. Any towed vehicle in a combination must be equipped with safety 
chains or cables to prevent the towbar from dropping to the ground in 
the event the coupling fails. The chains or cables must have sufficient 
strength to control the towed vehicle in the event the coupling device 
fails and must be attached with no more slack than necessary to permit 
proper turning. However, this requirement does not apply to a fifth-
wheel coupling if the upper and lower halves of the fifth wheel must be 
manually released before they can be separated.

                 PERMIT: No overlength permit required.

                           STATE: SOUTH DAKOTA

          COMBINATION: Truck tractor and 2 trailing units--LCV

                LENGTH OF CARGO-CARRYING UNITS: 100 feet

             MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE GROSS WEIGHT: 129,000 pounds

                         OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS:

    WEIGHT: For all combinations, the maximum gross weight on two or 
more consecutive axles is limited by the Federal Bridge Formula but 
cannot exceed 129,000 pounds. The weight on single axles or tandem axles 
spaced 40 inches or less apart may not exceed 20,000 pounds. Tandem 
axles spaced more than 40 inches but 96 inches or less may not exceed 
34,000 pounds. Two consecutive sets of tandem axles may carry a gross 
load of 34,000 pounds each, provided the overall distance between the 
first and last axles of the tandems is 36 feet or more. The weight on 
the steering axle may not exceed 600 pounds per inch of tire width.
    For combinations with a cargo-carrying length greater than 81.5 feet 
the following additional regulations also apply. The weight on all axles 
(other than the steering axle) may not exceed 500 pounds per inch of 
tire width. Lift axles and belly axles are not considered load-carrying 
axles and will not

[[Page 344]]

count when determining allowable vehicle weight.
    DRIVER: The driver must have a commercial driver's license with the 
appropriate endorsement.
    VEHICLE: For all combinations, a semitrailer or trailer may neither 
be longer than nor weigh 3,000 pounds more than the trailer located 
immediately in front of it. Towbars longer than 19 feet must be flagged 
during daylight hours and lighted at night.
    For combinations with a cargo-carrying length of 81.5 feet or less, 
neither trailer may exceed 45 feet, including load overhang. Vehicles 
may be 12 feet wide when hauling baled feed during daylight hours.
    For combinations with a cargo-carrying length over 81.5 feet long, 
neither trailer may exceed 48 feet, including load overhang. Loading the 
rear of the trailer heavier than the front is not allowed. All axles 
except the steering axle require dual tires. Axles spaced 8 feet or less 
apart must weigh within 500 pounds of each other. The trailer hitch 
offset may not exceed 6 feet. The maximum effective rear trailer 
overhang may not exceed 35 percent of the trailer's wheelbase. The power 
unit must have sufficient power to maintain 40 miles per hour. A ``LONG 
LOAD'' sign measuring 18 inches high by 7 feet long with black on yellow 
lettering 10 inches high is required on the rear. Offtracking is limited 
to 8.75 feet for a turning radius of 161 feet.

Offtracking Formula = 161 - [161\2\ - (L<INF>1</INF>\2\ + 
L<INF>2</INF>\2\ + L<INF>3</INF>\2\ + L<INF>4</INF>\2\ + 
L<INF>5</INF>\2\ + L<INF>6</INF>\2\ + L<INF>7</INF>\2\ + 
L<INF>8</INF>\2\)]\1/2\

    Note: L<INF>1</INF> through L<INF>8</INF> are measurements between 
points of articulation or vehicle pivot points. Squared dimensions to 
stinger steer points of articulation are negative. For two trailing unit 
combinations where at least one trailer is 45 feet long or longer, all 
the dimensions used to calculate offtracking must be written in the 
``Permit Restriction'' area of the permit along with the offtracking 
value derived from the calculation.
    PERMIT: For combinations with a cargo-carrying length of 81.5 feet 
or less, a single-trip permit is required for movement on the Interstate 
System if the gross vehicle weight exceeds 80,000 pounds. An annual or 
single-trip permit is required for hauling baled feed over 102 inches 
wide.
    For combinations with a cargo-carrying length greater than 81.5 
feet, a single-trip permit is required for all movements. Operations 
must be discontinued when roads are slippery due to moisture, visibility 
must be good, and wind conditions must not cause trailer whip or sway.
    For all combinations, a fee is charged for any permit.
    ACCESS: For combinations with a cargo-carrying length of 81.5 feet 
or less, access is Statewide off the NN unless restricted by the South 
Dakota DOT.
    For combinations with a cargo-carrying length greater than 81.5 
feet, access to operating routes must be approved by the South Dakota 
DOT.
    ROUTES: Combinations with a cargo-carrying length of 81.5 feet or 
less may use all NN routes. Combinations with a cargo-carrying length 
over 81.5 feet, are restricted to the Interstate System and:

    Oversize signs are required on vehicles in excess of 75 feet in 
length on two-lane highways.
    A heavy-duty fifth wheel is required. All fifth wheels must be clean 
and lubricated with a light-duty grease prior to each trip. The fifth 
wheel must be located in a position which provides adequate stability. 
Pick-up plates must be of equal strength to the fifth wheel. The kingpin 
must be of a solid type and permanently fastened. Screw-out or folding-
type kingpins are prohibited.
    All hitch connections must be of a no-slack type, preferably a 
power-actuated ram. Air-actuated hitches which are isolated from the 
primary air transmission system are recommended.
    The drawbar length should be the practical minimum consistent with 
the clearances required between trailers for turning and backing 
maneuvers.
    Axles must be those designed for the width of the body.
    All braking systems must comply with State and Federal requirements. 
In addition, fast air transmission and release valves must be provided 
on all semitrailer and converter-dolly axles. A brake force limiting 
valve, sometimes called a ``slippery road'' valve, may be provided on 
the steering axle. Anti-sail type mud flaps are recommended.
    The use of single tires on any combination vehicle requiring an 
overweight or oversize permit shall not be allowed on single axles. A 
single axle is defined as one having more than 8 feet between it and the 
nearest axle or group of axles on the vehicle.
    When traveling on a level, smooth paved surface, the trailing units 
must follow in the path of the towing vehicle without shifting or 
swerving more than 3 inches to either side when the towing vehicle is 
moving in a

[[Page 346]]

straight line. Each combination shall maintain a minimum distance of 500 
feet from another commercial vehicle traveling in the same direction on 
the same highway. Loads shall be securely fastened to the transporter 
with material and devices of sufficient strength to prevent the load 
from becoming loose, detached, dangerously displaced, or in any manner a 
hazard to other highway users. The components of the load shall be 
reinforced or bound securely in advance of travel to prevent debris from 
being blown off the unit and endangering the safety of the traveling 
public. Any debris from the special permit vehicle deposited on the 
highway shall be removed by the permittee.
    Bodily injury and property damage insurance is required before a 
special Transportation Permit will be issued.
    In the event any claim arises against the State of Utah, Utah 
Department of Transportation, Utah Highway Patrol, or their employees 
from the operation granted under the permit, the permittee shall agree 
to indemnify and hold harmless each of them from such claim.
    PERMIT: Permits must be purchased. The Utah DOT Motor Carrier Safety 
Division will, on submission of an LCV permit request, assign an 
investigator to perform an audit on the carrier, which must have an 
established safety program that is in compliance with the Federal Motor 
Carrier Safety Regulations (49 CFR parts 387-399), the Federal Hazardous 
Materials Regulations (49 CFR parts 171-178), and a ``Satisfactory'' 
safety rating. The request must show a travel plan for the operation of 
the vehicles. Permits are subject to Highway Patrol supervision and 
permitted vehicles may be subject to temporary delays or removed from 
the highways when necessary during hazardous road, weather, or traffic 
conditions. The permit will be cancelled without refund if violated. 
Expiration dates cannot be extended except for reasons beyond the 
control of the permittee, including adverse weather. Permits are void if 
defaced, modified, or obliterated. Lost or destroyed permits cannot be 
duplicated and are not transferable.
    ACCESS: Routes approved by the Utah DOT plus local delivery 
destination travel on two-lane roads.
    ROUTES: For combinations with a cargo-carrying length of 85 feet or 
less, all NN routes. Combinations with a cargo-carrying length over 85 
feet are restricted to the following NN routes:

Sec. Appendix D to Part 658--Devices That Are Excluded From Measurement 
          of the Length or Width of a Commercial Motor Vehicle

    The following devices are excluded from measurement of the length or 
width of a commercial motor vehicle, as long as they do not carry 
property and do not exceed the dimensional limitations included in Sec. 
658.16. This list is not exhaustive.
    1. All devices at the front of a semitrailer or trailer including, 
but not limited to, the following:
    (a) A device at the front of a trailer chassis to secure containers 
and prevent movement in transit;
    (b) A front coupler device on a semitrailer or trailer used in road 
and rail intermodal operations;
    (c) Aerodynamic devices, air deflector;
    (d) Air compressor;
    (e) Certificate holder (manifest box);
    (f) Door vent hardware;
    (g) Electrical connector;
    (h) Gladhand;
    (i) Handhold;
    (j) Hazardous materials placards and holders;
    (k) Heater;
    (l) Ladder;
    (m) Non-load carrying tie-down devices on automobile transporters;
    (n) Pickup plate lip;
    (o) Pump offline on tank trailer;
    (p) Refrigeration unit;
    (q) Removable bulkhead;

[[Page 349]]

    (r) Removable stakes;
    (s) Stabilizing jack (anti-nosedive device);
    (t) Stake pockets;
    (u) Step;
    (v) Tarp basket;
    (w) Tire carrier; and
    (x) Uppercoupler.
    2. Devices excluded from length measurement at the rear of a 
semitrailer or trailer including, but not limited to, the following:
    (a) Handhold;
    (b) Hazardous materials placards and holders;
    (c) Ladder;
    (d) Pintle hook;
    (e) Removable stakes;
    (f) Splash and spray suppression device;
    (g) Stake pockets; and
    (h) Step.
    3. Devices excluded from width determination, not to exceed 3 inches 
from the side of the vehicle including, but not limited to, the 
following:
    (a) Corner caps;
    (b) Hazardous materials placards and holders;
    (c) Lift pads for trailer on flatcar (piggyback) operation;
    (d) Rain gutters;
    (e) Rear and side door hinges and their protective hardware;
    (f) Side marker lamps;
    (g) Structural reinforcement for side doors or intermodal operation 
(limited to 1 inch from the side within the 3 inch maximum extension);
    (h) Tarping systems for open-top trailers;
    (i) Movable devices to enclose the cargo area of flatbed 
semitrailers or trailers, usually called tarping systems, where no 
component part of the system extends more than 3 inches from the sides 
or back of the vehicle when the vehicle is in operation. This exclusion 
applies to all component parts of tarping systems, including the 
transverse structure at the front of the vehicle to which the sliding 
walls and roof of the tarp mechanism are attached, provided the 
structure is not also intended or designed to comply with 49 CFR 
393.106, which requires a headerboard strong enough to prevent cargo 
from penetrating or crushing the cab; the transverse structure may be up 
to 108 inches wide if properly centered so that neither side extends 
more than 3 inches beyond the structural edge of the vehicle. Also 
excluded from measurement are side rails running the length of the 
vehicle and rear doors, provided the only function of the latter, like 
that of the transverse structure at the front of the vehicle, is to seal 
the cargo area and anchor the sliding walls and roof. On the other hand, 
a headerboard designed to comply with 49 CFR 393.106 is load bearing and 
thus limited to 102 inches in width. However, the ``wings'' designed to 
close the gap between such a headerboard and the movable walls and roof 
of a tarping system are width exclusive, provided they are add-on pieces 
designed to bear only the load of the tarping system itself and are not 
integral parts of the load-bearing headerboard structure;
    (j) Tie-down assembly on platform trailers;
    (k) Wall variation from true flat; and
    (l) Weevil pins and sockets on low-bed trailers.

the development of programs under Sec. 660.109 of this part. The FHWA 
will provide appropriate pavement management results for FHs which are 
not Federal-aid highways.
    (c) The FHWA, in consultation with the FS, the SHA, and other 
cooperators where appropriate, will designate FHs.
    (1) The SHA and the FS will nominate forest roads for FH 
designation.
    (2) The SHA will represent the interests of all cooperators. All 
other agencies shall send their proposals for FHs to the SHA.

                     Subpart E_Defense Access Roads

    Authority: 23 U.S.C. 210, 315; 49 CFR 1.48(b).

    Source: 49 FR 21924, May 24, 1984, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 660.501  Purpose.

    The purpose of this regulation is to prescribe policies and 
procedures governing evaluations of defense access road needs, and 
administration of projects financed under the defense access roads and 
other defense related special highway programs.


<R05>
Sec. 660.503  Objectives.

    The defense access roads program provides a means by which the 
Federal Government may pay its fair share of the cost of:
    (a) Highway improvements needed for adequate highway service to 
defense and defense related installations;
    (b) New highways to replace those which must be closed to permit 
establishment or expansion of defense installations;
    (c) Repair of damage to highways caused by major military maneuvers;
    (d) Repair of damages due to the activities of contractors engaged 
in the construction of missile sites; and
    (e) Missile routes to ensure their continued ability to support the 
missile transporter-erector (TE) vehicle.


<R05>
Sec. 660.505  Scope.

    This regulation focuses on procedures as they apply to the defense 
access roads and other special highway programs of the Department of 
Defense (DOD).


<R05>
Sec. 660.507  Definitions.

    (a) Defense installation. A military reservation or installation, or 
defense related industry or source of raw materials.
    (b) Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC). The military 
transportation agency with responsibilities assigned by the Secretary of 
Defense for maintaining liaison with the Federal Highway Administration 
(FHWA) and other agencies for the integration of defense needs into the 
Nation's highway program.
    (c) Certification. The statement to the Secretary of Transportation 
by the Secretary of Defense (or such other official as the President may 
designate) that certain roads are important to the national defense.
    (d) Access road. An existing or proposed public highway which is 
needed to provide essential highway transportation services to a defense 
installation. (This definition may include public highways through 
military installations only when right-of-way for such roads is 
dedicated to public use and the roads are maintained by civil 
authority.)
    (e) Replacement road. A public road constructed to replace one 
closed by establishment of a new, or the expansion of an old, defense 
installation.
    (f) Maneuver area road. A public road in an area delineated by 
official orders for field maneuvers or exercises of military forces.
    (g) Transporter-erector route. A public road specifically designated 
for use by the TE vehicle for access to missile sites.


<R05>
Sec. 660.509  General principles.

    (a) State and local highway agencies are expected to assume the same 
responsibility for developing and maintaining adequate highways to 
permanent defense installations as they do for highways serving private 
industrial establishments or any other permanent traffic generators. The 
Federal Government expects that highway improvements in the vicinity of 
defense installations will receive due priority consideration and 
treatment as State and local agencies develop their programs of 
improvement. The FHWA will provide assistance, as requested by MTMC,

[[Page 354]]

to ascertain State program plans for improvements to roads serving as 
access to defense installations. Roads which serve permanent defense 
installations and which qualify under established critieria as Federal-
aid routes should be included in the appropriate Federal-aid system.
    (b) It is recognized that problems may arise in connection with the 
establishment, expansion, or operation of defense installations which 
create an unanticipated impact upon the long-range requirements for the 
development of highways in the vicinity. These problems can be resolved 
equitably only by Federal assistance from other than normal Federal-aid 
highway programs for part or all of the cost of highway improvements 
necessary for the functioning of the installation.


<R05>
Sec. 660.511  Eligibility.

    (a) The MTMC has the responsibility for determining the eligibility 
of proposed improvements for financing with defense access roads funds. 
The evaluation report will be furnished to MTMC for its use in making 
the determination of eligibility and certification of importance to the 
national defense. The criteria upon which MTMC will base its 
determination of eligibility are included in the Federal-Aid Highway 
Program Manual, Volume 6, Chapter 9, Section 5, Attachment 2. \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ This document is available for inspection and copying from the 
FHWA headquarters and field offices as prescribed by 49 CFR part 7, 
appendix D.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) If the project is determined to be eligible for financing either 
in whole or in part with defense access road funds, MTMC will certify 
the project as important to the national defense and will authorize 
expenditure of defense access road funds. The Commander, MTMC, is the 
only representative of the DOD officially authorized to make the 
certification required by section 210, title 23, U.S.C., in behalf of 
the Secretary of Defense.


<R05>
Sec. 660.513  Standards.

    (a) Access roads to permanent defense installations and all 
replacement roads shall be designed to conform to the same standards as 
the agency having jurisdiction is currently using for other comparable 
highways under similar conditions in the area. In general, where the 
agency having jurisdiction does not have established standards, the 
design shall conform to American Association of State Highway and 
Transportation Officials (AASHTO) standards. Should local agencies 
desire higher standards than are currently being used for other 
comparable highways under similar conditions in the area, they shall 
finance the increases in cost.
    (b) Access roads to temporary military establishments or for service 
to workers temporarily engaged in construction of defense installations 
should be designed to the minimum standards necessary to provide service 
for a limited period without intolerable congestion and hazard. As a 
guide, widening to more than two lanes generally will not be undertaken 
to accommodate anticipated one-way, peak-hour traffic of less than 1,200 
vehicles per hour and resurfacing or strengthening of existing pavements 
will be held to the minimum type having the structural integrity to 
carry traffic for the short period of anticipated use.


<R05>
Sec. 660.515  Project administration.

    (a) Determination of the agency best able to accomplish the 
location, design, and construction of the projects covered by this 
regulation will be made by the FHWA Division Administrator after 
consultation with the State and/or local highway agency within whose 
jurisdiction the highway lies. When an agency other than the State or 
local highway agency is selected to administer the project, the Division 
Administrator will be responsible during the life of the project for any 
necessary coordination between the selected agency and the State or 
local highway agency.
    (b) Defense access road projects under the supervision of a State or 
local highway agency, whether on or off the Federal-aid system, shall be 
administered in accordance with Federal-aid procedures, as modified 
specifically herein or as limited by the delegations of authority to 
Regional and Division Administrators, unless approval of other 
procedures has been obtained

[[Page 355]]

from Washington Headquarters Office of Direct Federal Programs (HDF-1).
    (c) The Division Administrator shall have a firm commitment from the 
State or local highway agency, within whose jurisdiction the access road 
lies, that it will accept the responsibility for maintenance of the 
completed facility before authorization of acquisition of right-of-way 
or construction of a project.
    (d) When defense access road funds are available for a pro-rata 
portion of the total project cost, the remaining portion of the project 
may be funded as a Federal-aid project if on a Federal-aid route. 
Defense access road funds shall not be substituted for the State's 
matching share of the Federal-aid portion of a project.


<R05>
Sec. 660.517  Maneuver area roads.

    (a) Claims by a highway agency for costs incurred to restore, to 
their former condition, roads damaged by maneuvers involving a military 
force at least equal in strength to a ground division or an air wing 
will be paid from funds appropriated for the maneuver and transferred to 
FHWA by the DOD agency. Defense access road funds may be used to 
reimburse the highway authority pending transfer of funds by the DOD 
agency.
    (b) Costs incurred by State or local highway authorities while 
conducting a pre- or post-condition survey may be included in the claim 
to DOD for direct settlement or in the damage repair project as 
appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 660.519  Missile installations and facilities.

    Should damage occur to public highways as a result of construction 
activities, the contractor would normally be held responsible for 
restoring the damages. However, should the contractor deny 
responsibility on the basis of contract terms, restoration is provided 
for under 23 U.S.C. 210(h).
    (a) Restoration under the contract. (1) The highway agency having 
jurisdiction over the road shall take appropriate actions, such as load 
and speed restrictions, to protect the highway. When extensive damage is 
anticipated and the contractor under the terms of the contract is 
responsible, it may be necessary to require a performance bond to assure 
restoration.
    (2) If the contractor does not properly maintain the roads when 
requested in writing, the highway agency having jurisdiction over the 
road shall perform extraordinary maintenance as necessary to keep the 
roads serviceable and maintain adequate supporting records of the work 
performed. Claims shall be presented to the contractor for this 
extraordinary maintenance and any other work required to restore the 
roads. If the contractor denies responsibility on the basis of the 
contract terms, the claim with the required supporting documentation 
shall be presented to the contracting officer for disposition and 
arrangement for reimbursement.
    (b) Restoration under 23 U.S.C. 210(h). (1) To implement 23 U.S.C. 
210(h), DOD must make the determination that a contractor for a missile 
installation or facility did not include in the bid the cost of 
repairing damage caused to public highways by the operation of the 
contractor's vehicles and equipment. The FHWA must then make the 
determination that the State highway agency is, or has been, unable to 
prevent such damage by restrictions upon the use of the highways without 
interference with, or delay in, the completion of the contract. If these 
determinations are made, the Division Administrator will be authorized 
by the Washington Headquarters to reimburse the highway agency for the 
cost of the work necessary to keep the roads in a serviceable condition.
    (2) Upon receipt of a damage claim, division office representatives 
accompanied by representatives of the agencies that made the original 
condition survey will inspect the roads on which damage is claimed. The 
Division Administrator shall then prepare an estimate of the cost of 
restoring the roads to original condition as well as any documented cost 
for extraordinary maintenance for which reimbursement has not been 
received. No allowance for upgrading the roads shall be included.

    Functionally obsolete (FO) is the state in which the deck geometry, 
load carrying capacity (comparison of the original design load to the 
State legal load), clearance, or approach roadway alignment no longer 
meets the usual criteria for the system of which it is an integral part.
    Indian Reservation Road (IRR) means a public road that is located 
within or provides access to an Indian reservation or Indian trust land 
or restricted Indian land that is not subject to fee title alienation 
without the approval of the Federal government, or Indian and Alaska

maintained by a public authority and open to public travel.
    Structurally deficient (SD) means a bridge becomes structurally 
deficient when it reaches the set threshold of one of the six criteria 
from the FHWA NBI.
    Structure Inventory and Appraisal (SI&A) Sheet means the graphic 
representation of the data recorded and stored for each NBI record in 
accordance with the Recording and Coding Guide for the Structure 
Inventory and Appraisal of the Nation's Bridges (Report No. FHWA-PD-96-
001).
    Sufficiency rating (SR) means the numerical rating of a bridge based 
on its structural adequacy and safety, essentiality for public use, and

<R05>
Sec. 661.7  What is the IRRBP?

    The IRRBP, as established under 23 U.S.C. 202(d)(4), is a nationwide 
priority program for improving structurally deficient and functionally 
obsolete IRR bridges.


<R05>
Sec. 661.9  What is the total funding available for the IRRBP?

    The statute authorizes $14 million to be appropriated from the 
Highway Trust Fund in Fiscal Years 2005 through 2009.


<R05>
Sec. 661.11  When do IRRBP funds become available?

    IRRBP funds are authorized at the start of each fiscal year but are 
subject to Office of Management and Budget apportionment before they 
become available to FHWA for further distribution.

[[Page 358]]


<R05>
Sec. 661.13  How long are these funds available?

    IRRBP funds for each fiscal year are available for obligation for 
the year authorized plus three years (a total of four years).


<R05>
Sec. 661.15  What are the eligible activities for IRRBP funds?

    (a) IRRBP funds can be used to carry out PE, construction, and CE 
activities of projects to replace, rehabilitate, seismically retrofit, 
paint, apply calcium magnesium acetate, sodium acetate/formate or other 
environmentally acceptable, minimally corrosive anti-icing and deicing 
compositions, or install scour countermeasures for structurally 
deficient or functionally obsolete IRR bridges, including multiple pipe 
culverts.
    (b) If a bridge is replaced under the IRRBP, IRRBP funds can be also 
used for the demolition of the old bridge.


<R05>
Sec. 661.17  What are the criteria for bridge eligibility?

    (a) Bridge eligibility requires the following:
    (1) Have an opening of 20 feet or more;
    (2) Be located on an IRR that is included in the IRR Inventory;
    (3) Be structurally deficient or functionally obsolete, and
    (4) Be recorded in the NBI maintained by the FHWA.
    (b) Bridges that were constructed, rehabilitated or replaced in the 
last 10 years, will be eligible only for seismic retrofit or 
installation of scour countermeasures.


<R05>
Sec. 661.19  When is a bridge eligible for replacement?

    To be eligible for replacement, the bridge must be considered 
structurally deficient or functionally obsolete and must be in 
accordance with 23 CFR part 650.409(a) for bridge replacement. After an 
existing bridge is replaced under the IRRBP, it must be taken completely 
out of service and removed from the inventory. If the original bridge is 
considered historic, it must still be removed from the inventory, 
however the Tribe is allowed to request an exemption from the BIA 
Division of Transportation (BIADOT) to allow the bridge to remain in 
place.


<R05>
Sec. 661.21  When is a bridge eligible for rehabilitation?

    To be eligible for rehabilitation, the bridge must be considered 
structurally deficient or functionally obsolete and must be in 
accordance with 23 CFR part 650.409(a) for bridge rehabilitation. A 
bridge eligible for rehabilitation may be replaced if the life cycle 
cost analysis is conducted which shows the cost for bridge 
rehabilitation exceeds the replacement cost.


<R05>
Sec. 661.23  How will a bridge project be programmed for funding once eligibility has been determined?

    (a) All projects will be programmed for funding after a completed 
application package is received and accepted by the FHWA. At that time, 
the project will be acknowledged as either BIA and Tribally owned, or 
non-BIA owned and placed in either a PE or a construction queue.
    (b) All projects will be ranked and prioritized based on the 
following criteria:
    (1) Bridge sufficiency rating (SR);
    (2) Bridge status with structurally deficient (SD) having precedence 
over functionally obsolete (FO);
    (3) Bridges on school bus routes;
    (4) Detour length;
    (5) Average daily traffic; and
    (6) Truck average daily traffic.
    (c) Queues will carryover from fiscal year to fiscal year as made 
necessary by the amount of annual funding made available.


<R05>
Sec. 661.25  What does a complete application package for 

PE consist of and how does the project receive funding?

    (a) A complete application package for PE consists of the following: 
the certification checklist, IRRBP transportation improvement program 
(TIP), project scope of work, detailed cost for PE, and SI&A sheet.
    (b) For non-BIA IRR bridges, the application package must also 
include a tribal resolution supporting the project and identification of 
the required minimum 20 percent local funding match.

[[Page 359]]

    (c) The IRRBP projects for PE will be placed in queue and determined 
as eligible for funding after receipt by FHWA of a complete application 
package. Incomplete application packages will be disapproved and 
returned for revision and resubmission along with a notation providing 
the reason for disapproval.
    (d) Funding for the approved eligible projects on the queues will be 
made available to the Tribes, under an FHWA/Tribal agreement, or the 
Secretary of the Interior upon availability of program funding at FHWA.


<R05>
Sec. 661.27  What does a complete application package 

for construction consist of and how does the project receive funding?

    (a) A complete application package for construction consists of the 
following: a copy of the approved PS&E, the certification checklist, 
SI&A sheet, and IRRBP TIP. For non-BIA IRR bridges, the application 
package must also include a copy of a letter from the bridge's owner 
approving the project and its PS&E, a tribal resolution supporting the 
project, and identification of the required minimum 20 percent local 
funding match. All environmental and archeological clearances and 
complete grants of public rights-of-way must be acquired prior to 
submittal of the construction application package.
    (b) The IRRBP projects for construction will be placed in queue and 
determined as eligible for funding after receipt by FHWA of a complete 
application package. Incomplete application packages will be disapproved 
and returned for revision and resubmission along with a notation 
providing the reason for disapproval.
    (c) Funding for the approved eligible projects on the queues will be 
made available to the Tribes, under an FHWA/Tribal agreement, or the 
Secretary of the Interior upon availability of program funding at FHWA.


<R05>
Sec. 661.29  How does ownership impact project selection?

    Since the Federal government has both a trust responsibility and 
owns the BIA bridges on Indian reservations, primary consideration will 
be given to eligible projects on BIA and Tribally owned IRR bridges. A 
smaller percentage of available funds will be set aside for non-BIA IRR 
bridges, since States and counties have access to Federal-aid and other 
funding to design, replace and rehabilitate their bridges and that 23 
U.S.C. 204(c) requires that IRR funds be supplemental to and not in lieu 
of other funds apportioned to the State. The program policy will be to 
maximize the number of IRR bridges participating in the IRRBP in a given 
fiscal year regardless of ownership.


<R05>
Sec. 661.31  Do IRRBP projects have to be listed on an approved IRR TIP?

    Yes. All IRRBP projects must be listed on an approved IRR TIP. The 
approved IRR TIP will be forwarded by FHWA to the respective State for 
inclusion into its State TIP.


<R05>
Sec. 661.33  What percentage of IRRBP funding is available for PE and construction?

    Up to 15 percent of the funding made available in any fiscal year 
will be eligible for PE. The remaining funding in any fiscal year will 
be available for construction.


<R05>
Sec. 661.35  What percentage of IRRBP funding is available for

use on BIA and Tribally owned IRR bridges, and non-BIA owned IRR bridges?

    (a) Up to 80 percent of the available funding made available for PE 
and construction in any fiscal year will be eligible for use on BIA and 
Tribally owned IRR bridges. The remaining funding in any fiscal year 
will be made available for PE and construction for use on non-BIA owned 
IRR bridges.
    (b) At various times during the fiscal year, FHWA will review the 
projects awaiting funding and may shift funds between BIA and Tribally 
owned, and non-BIA owned bridge projects so as to maximize the number of 
projects funded and the overall effectiveness of the program.


<R05>
Sec. 661.37  What are the funding limitations on individual IRRBP projects?

    The following funding provisions apply in administration of the 
IRRBP:
    (a) An IRRBP eligible BIA and Tribally owned IRR bridge is eligible 
for 100

[[Page 360]]

percent IRRBP funding, with a $150,000 maximum limit for PE.
    (b) An IRRBP eligible non-BIA owned IRR bridge is eligible for up to 
80 percent IRRBP funding, with a $150,000 maximum limit for PE and 
$1,000,000 maximum limit for construction. The minimum 20 percent local 
match will need to be identified in the application package. IRR Program 
construction funds received by a Tribe may be used as the local match.
    (c) Requests for additional funds above the referenced thresholds 
may be submitted along with proper justification to FHWA for 
consideration. The request will be considered on a case-by-case basis. 
There is no guarantee for the approval of the request for additional 
funds.


<R05>
Sec. 661.39  How are project cost overruns funded?

    (a) A request for additional IRRBP funds for cost overruns on a 
specific bridge project must be submitted to BIADOT and FHWA for 
approval. The written submission must include a justification, an 
explanation as to why the overrun occurred, and the amount of additional 
funding required with supporting cost data. If approved by FHWA, the 
request will be placed at the top of the appropriate queue (with a 
contract modification request having a higher priority than a request 
for additional funds for a project award) and funding may be provided if 
available.
    (b) Project cost overruns may also be funded out of the Tribe's 
regular IRR Program construction funding.


<R05>
Sec. 661.41  After a bridge project has been completed 

(either PE or construction) what happens with the excess or surplus funding?

    Since the funding is project specific, once a bridge design or 
construction project has been completed under this program, any excess 
or surplus funding is returned to FHWA for use on additional approved 
deficient IRRBP projects.


<R05>
Sec. 661.43  Can other sources of funds be used to finance a queued project in advance of receipt of IRRBP funds?

    Yes. A Tribe can use other sources of funds, including IRR Program 
construction funds, on a project that has been approved for funding and 
placed on the queue and then be reimbursed when IRRBP funds become 
available. If IRR Program construction funds are used for this purpose, 
the funds must be identified on an FHWA approved IRR TIP prior to their 
expenditure.


<R05>
Sec. 661.45  What happens when IRRBP funds cannot be obligated by the end of the fiscal year?

    IRRBP funds provided to a project that cannot be obligated by the 
end of the fiscal year are to be returned to FHWA during August 
redistribution. The returned funds will be re-allocated to the BIA the 
following fiscal year after receipt and acceptance at FHWA from BIA of a 
formal request for the funds, which includes a justification for the 
amounts requested and the reason for the failure of the prior year 
obligation.


<R05>
Sec. 661.47  Can bridge maintenance be performed with IRRBP funds?

    No. Bridge maintenance repairs, e.g., guard rail repair, deck 
repairs, repair of traffic control devices, striping, cleaning scuppers, 
deck sweeping, snow and debris removal, etc., are not eligible uses of 
IRRBP funding. The Department of the Interior annual allocation for 
maintenance and IRR Program construction funds are eligible funding 
sources for bridge maintenance.


<R05>
Sec. 661.49  Can IRRBP funds be spent on Interstate, State Highway, and Toll Road IRR bridges?

    Yes. Interstate, State Highway, and Toll Road IRR bridges are 
eligible for funding as described in Sec. 661.37(b).


<R05>
Sec. 661.51  Can IRRBP funds be used for the approach roadway to a bridge?

    (a) Yes, costs associated with approach roadway work, as defined in 
Sec. 661.5 are eligible.
    (b) Long approach fills, causeways, connecting roadways, 
interchanges, ramps, and other extensive earth structures, when 
constructed beyond an attainable touchdown point, are not eligible uses 
of IRRBP funds.

[[Page 361]]


<R05>
Sec. 661.53  What standards should be used for bridge design?

    (a) Replacement--A replacement structure must meet the current 
geometric, construction and structural standards required for the types 
and volumes of projected traffic on the facility over its design life 
consistent with 25 CFR part 170, Subpart D, Appendix B and 23 CFR part 
625.
    (b) Rehabilitation--Bridges to be rehabilitated, as a minimum, 
should conform to the standards of 23 CFR part 625, Design Standards for 
Federal-aid Highways, for the class of highway on which the bridge is a 
part.


<R05>
Sec. 661.55  How are BIA and Tribal owned IRR bridges inspected?

    BIA and Tribally owned IRR bridges are inspected in accordance with 
25 CFR part 170.504-170.507.


<R05>
Sec. 661.57  How is a list of deficient bridges to be generated?

    (a) In consultation with the BIA, a list of deficient BIA IRR 
bridges will be developed each fiscal year by the FHWA based on the 
annual April update of the NBI. The NBI is based on data from the 
inspection of all bridges. Likewise, a list of non-BIA IRR bridges will 
be obtained from the NBI. These lists would form the basis for 
identifying bridges that would be considered potentially eligible for 
participation in the IRRBP. Two separate master bridge lists (one each 
for BIA and non-BIA IRR bridges) will be developed and will include, at 
a minimum, the following:
    (1) Sufficiency rating (SR);
    (2) Status (structurally deficient or functionally obsolete);
    (3) Average daily traffic (NBI item 29);
    (4) Detour length (NBI item 19); and
    (5) Truck average daily traffic (NBI item 109).
    (b) These lists would be provided by the FHWA to the BIADOT for 
publication and notification of affected BIA regional offices, Indian 
Tribal governments (ITGs), and State and local governments.
    (c) BIA regional offices, in consultation with ITGs, are encouraged 
to prioritize the design for bridges that are structurally deficient 
over bridges that are simply functionally obsolete, since the former is 
more critical structurally than the latter. Bridges that have higher 
average daily traffic (ADT) should be considered before those that have 
lower ADT. Detour length should also be a factor in selection and 
submittal of bridges, with those having a higher detour length being of 
greater concern. Lastly, bridges with higher truck ADT should take 
precedence over those which have lower truck ADT. Other items of note 
should be whether school buses use the bridge and the types of trucks 
that may cross the bridge and the loads imposed.


<R05>
Sec. 661.59  What should be done with a deficient BIA owned IRR 

bridge if the Indian Tribe does not support the project?

    The BIA should notify the Tribe and encourage the Tribe to develop 
and submit an application package to FHWA for the rehabilitation or 
replacement of the bridge. For safety of the motoring public, if the 
Tribe decides not to pursue the bridge project, the BIA shall work with 
the Tribe to either reduce the bridge's load rating or close the bridge, 
and remove it from the IRR inventory in accordance with 25 CFR part 170 
(170.813).

    Source: 52 FR 21948, June 10, 1987, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 668.101  Purpose.

    To establish policy and provide program guidance for the 
administration of emergency funds for the repair or reconstruction of 
Federal-aid highways, which are found to have suffered serious damage by 
natural diasters over a wide area or serious damage from catastrophic 
failures. Guidance for application by Federal agencies for 
reconstruction of Federal roads that are not part of the Federal-aid 
highways is contained in 23 CFR part 668, subpart B.

[52 FR 21948, June 10, 1987, as amended at 61 FR 67212, Dec. 20, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 668.103  Definitions.

    In addition to others contained in 23 U.S.C. 101(a), the following 
definitions shall apply as used in this regulation:
    Applicant. The State highway agency is the applicant for Federal 
assistance under 23 U.S.C. 125 for State highways and local roads and 
streets which are a part of the Federal-aid highways.
    Betterments. Added protective features, such as rebuilding of 
roadways at a higher elevation or the lengthening of bridges, or changes 
which modify the function or character of a highway facility from what 
existed prior to the disaster or catastrophic failure, such as 
additional lanes or added access control.
    Catastrophic failure. The sudden failure of a major element or 
segment of the highway system due to an external cause. The failure must 
not be primarily attributable to gradual and progressive deterioration 
or lack of proper maintenance. The closure of a facility because of 
imminent danger of collapse is not in itself a sudden failure.
    Emergency repairs. Those repairs including temporary traffic 
operations undertaken during or immediately following the disaster 
occurrence for the purpose of:
    (1) Minimizing the extent of the damage,
    (2) Protecting remaining facilities, or
    (3) Restoring essential traffic.
    External cause. An outside force or phenomenon which is separate 
from the damaged element and not primarily the result of existing 
conditions.
    Heavy maintenance. Work usually done by highway agencies in 
repairing damage normally expected from seasonal and occasionally 
unusual natural conditions or occurrences. It includes work at a site 
required as a direct result of a disaster which can reasonably be 
accommodated by a State or local road authority's maintenance, emergency 
or contingency program.
    Natural disaster. A sudden and unusual natural occurrence, including 
but not limited to intense rainfall, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, 
tidal waves, landslides, volcanoes or earthquakes which cause serious 
damage.
    Proclamation. A declaration of emergency by the Governor of the 
affected State.
    Serious damage. Heavy, major or unusual damage to a highway which 
severely impairs the safety or usefulness of the highway or results in 
road closure. Serious damage must be beyond the scope of heavy 
maintenance.
    State. Any one of the United States, the District of Columbia, 
Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa or Commonwealth 
of the Northern Mariana Islands.

[52 FR 21948, June 10, 1987, as amended at 61 FR 67212, Dec. 20, 1996; 
65 FR 25444, May 2, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 668.105  Policy.

    (a) The Emergency Relief (ER) program is intended to aid States in 
repairing road facilities which have suffered widespread serious damage 
resulting from a natural disaster over a wide area or serious damage 
from a catastrophic failure.
    (b) ER funds are not intended to supplant other funds for correction 
of preexisting, nondisaster related deficiencies.

[[Page 363]]

    (c) The expenditure of ER funds for emergency repair shall be in 
such a manner so as to reduce, to the greatest extent feasible, the cost 
of permanent restoration work.
    (d) The approval to use available ER funds to repair or restore 
highways damaged by a natural disaster shall be based on the combination 
of the extraordinary character of the natural disturbance and the wide 
area of impact as well as the seriousness of the damage. Storms of 
unusual intensity occurring over a small area may not meet the above 
conditions.
    (e) ER funds shall not duplicate assistance under another Federal 
program or compensation from insurance or any other source. Partial 
compensation for a loss by other sources will not preclude emergency 
fund assistance for the part of such loss not compensated otherwise. Any 
compensation for damages or insurance proceeds including interest 
recovered by the State or political subdivision or by a toll authority 
for repair of the highway facility must be used upon receipt to reduce 
ER fund liability on the project.
    (f) Prompt and diligent efforts shall be made by the State to 
recover repair costs from the legally responsible parties to reduce the 
project costs particularly where catastrophic damages are caused by 
ships, barge tows, highway vehicles, or vehicles with illegal loads or 
where damage is increased by improperly controlled objects or events.
    (g) The processing of ER requests shall be given prompt attention 
and shall be given priority over non-emergency work.
    (h) ER projects shall be promptly constructed. Any project that has 
not advanced to the construction obligation stage by the end of the 
second fiscal year following the disaster occurrence will not be 
advanced unless suitable justification to warrant retention is furnished 
to the FHWA.
    (i) Permanent repair and reconstruction work, not accomplished as 
emergency repairs, shall be done by the contract method unless the State 
Highway agency adequately demonstrates that some other method is more 
cost effective as described in 23 CFR 635.204. Emergency repair work may 
be accomplished by the contract, negotiated contract or highway agency 
force account methods as determined by the Highway agency as best suited 
to protect the public health and safety.
    (j) ER program funding is only to be used to repair highways which 
have been seriously damaged and is not intended to fund heavy 
maintenance or routine emergency repair activities which should normally 
be funded as contingency items in the State and local road programs. An 
application for ER funds in the range of $700,000 or less must be 
accompanied by a showing as to why the damage repair involved is 
considered to be beyond the scope of heavy maintenance or routine 
emergency repair. As a general rule, widespread nominal road damages in 
this range would not be considered to be of a significant nature 
justifying approval by the FHWA Division Administrator for ER funding.

[52 FR 21948, June 10, 1987, as amended at 61 FR 67212, Dec. 20, 1996; 
65 FR 25444, May 2, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 668.107  Federal share payable.

    (a) The Federal share payable on account of any repair or 
reconstruction provided for by funds made available under 23 U.S.C. 125 
of this title on account of any project on a Federal-aid highway system, 
including the Interstate System, shall not exceed the Federal share 
payable on a project on such system as provided in 23 U.S.C. 120; except 
that the Federal share payable for eligible emergency repairs to 
minimize damage, protect facilities, or restore essential traffic 
accomplished within 180 days after the actual occurrence of the natural 
disaster or catastrophic failure may amount to 100 percent of the costs 
thereof.
    (b) Total obligations of ER funds in any State, excluding the Virgin 
Islands, Guam, American Samoa or Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana 
Islands, for all projects (including projects on both the Federal-aid 
systems and those on Federal roads under 23 CFR part 668, subpart B), 
resulting from a single natural disaster or a single catastrophic 
failure, shall not exceed $100 million per disaster or catastrophic 
failure. The total obligations for ER projects in any fiscal year in the 
Virgin Islands, Guam, American

[[Page 364]]

Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands shall not 
exceed $20 million.

[52 FR 21948, June 10, 1987, as amended at 52 FR 32540, Aug. 28, 1987; 
61 FR 67212, Dec. 20, 1996; 65 FR 25444, May 2, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 668.109  Eligibility.

    (a) The eligibility of all work is contingent upon approval by the 
FHWA Division Administrator of an application for ER and inclusion of 
the work in an approved program of projects.
    (1) Prior FHWA approval or authorization is not required for 
emergency repairs and preliminary engineering (PE).
    (2) Permanent repairs or restoration must have prior FHWA program 
approval and authorization, unless done as part of the emergency 
repairs.
    (b) ER funds may participate in:
    (1) Repair to or reconstruction of seriously damaged highway 
elements as necessary to restore the facility to pre-disaster 
conditions, including necessary clearance of debris and other deposits 
in drainage courses within the right-of way (ROW);
    (2) Restoration of stream channels outside the highway ROW when:
    (i) The public highway agency has responsibility for the maintenance 
and proper operation of the stream channel section, and
    (ii) The work is necessary for satisfactory operation of the highway 
system involved;
    (3) Actual PE and construction engineering costs on approved 
projects;
    (4) Emergency repairs;
    (5) Temporary operations, including emergency traffic services such 
as flagging traffic through inundated sections of highways, undertaken 
by the applicant during or immediately following the disaster;
    (6) Betterments, only where clearly economically justified to 
prevent future recurring damage. Economic justification must weigh the 
cost of betterment against the risk of eligible recurring damage and the 
cost of future repair;
    (7) Temporary work to maintain essential traffic, such as raising 
roadway grade during a period of flooding by placing fill and temporary 
surface material;
    (8) Raising the grades of critical Federal-aid highways faced with 
long-term loss of use due to basin flooding as defined by an 
unprecedented rise in basin water level both in magnitude and time 
frame. Such grade raises are not considered to be a betterment for the 
purpose of 23 CFR 668.109(b)(6); and
    (9) Repair of toll facilities when the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 129 
are met. If a toll facility does not have an executed toll agreement 
with the FHWA at the time of the disaster, a toll agreement may be 
executed after the disaster to qualify for that disaster.
    (c) ER funds may not participate in:
    (1) Heavy maintenance such as repair of minor damages consisting 
primarily of eroded shoulders, filled ditches and culverts, pavement 
settlement, mud and debris deposits off the traveled way, slope 
sloughing, slides, and slip-outs in cut or fill slopes. In order to 
simplify the inspection and estimating process, heavy maintenance may be 
defined using dollar guidelines developed by the States and Divisions 
with Regional concurrence;
    (2) Repair of surface damage caused by traffic whether or not the 
damage was aggravated by saturated subgrade or inundation, except ER 
funds may participate in:
    (i) Repair of surface damage to any public road caused by traffic 
making repairs to Federal-aid highways.
    (ii) Repair of surface damage to designated detours (which may lie 
on both Federal-aid and non-Federal-aid routes) caused by traffic that 
has been detoured from a damaged Federal-aid highway; and
    (iii) Repair of surface damage to Federal-aid highways caused by 
vehicles responding to a disaster; provided the surface damage has 
occurred during the first 60 days after a disaster occurrence, unless 
otherwise approved by the FHWA Division Administrator.
    (3) Repair of damage not directly related to, and isolated away 
from, the pattern of the disaster;
    (4) Routine maintenance of detour routes, not related to the 
increased traffic volumes, such as mowing, maintaining drainage, 
pavement signing, snow plowing, etc.;
    (5) Replacement of damaged or lost material not incorporated into 
the

[[Page 365]]

highway such as stockpiled materials or items awaiting installation;
    (6) Repair or reconstruction of facilities affected by long-term, 
pre-existing conditions or predictable developing situations, such as, 
gradual, long-term rises in water levels in basins or slow moving 
slides, except for raising grades as noted in Sec. 668.109(b)(8);
    (7) Permanent repair or replacement of deficient bridges scheduled 
for replacement with other funds. A project is considered scheduled if 
the construction phase is included in the FHWA approved Statewide 
Transportation Improvement Program (STIP);
    (8) Other normal maintenance and operation functions on the highway 
system including snow and ice removal; and
    (9) Reimbursing loss of toll revenue.
    (d) Replacement of a highway facility at its existing location is 
appropriate when it is not technically and economically feasible to 
repair or restore a seriously damaged element to its predisaster 
condition and is limited in ER reimbursement to the cost of a new 
facility to current design standards of comparable capacity and 
character to the destroyed facility. With respect to a bridge, a 
comparable facility is one which meets current geometric and 
construction standards for the type and volume of traffic it will carry 
during its design life. Where it is neither practical nor feasible to 
replace a damaged highway facility in kind at its existing location, an 
alternative selected through the National Environmental Policy Act 
(NEPA) process, if of comparable function and character to the destroyed 
facility, is eligible for ER reimbursement.
    (e) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(6) of this 
section, the total cost of a project eligible for ER funding may not 
exceed the cost of repair or reconstruction of a comparable facility. ER 
funds may participate to the extent of eligible repair costs when 
proposed projects contain unjustified betterments or other work not 
eligible for ER funds.

<R05>
Sec. 668.111  Application procedures.

    (a) Notification. As soon as possible after the disaster, the 
applicant shall notify the FHWA Division Administrator of its intent to 
apply for ER funds.
    (b) Damage survey. As soon as practical after occurrence, the State 
will make a preliminary field survey, working cooperatively with the 
FHWA Division Administrator and other governmental agencies with 
jurisdiction over eligible highways. The preliminary field survey should 
be coordinated with the Federal Emergency Management Agency work, if 
applicable, to eliminate duplication of effort. The purpose of this 
survey is to determine the general nature and extent of damage to 
eligible highways.
    (1) A damage survey summary report is to be prepared by the State. 
The purpose of the damage survey summary report is to provide a factual 
basis for the FHWA Division Administrator's finding that serious damage 
to Federal-aid highways has been caused by a natural disaster over a 
wide area or a catastrophe. The damage survey summary report should 
include by political subdivision or other generally recognized 
administrative or geographic boundaries, a description of the types and 
extent of damage to highways and a preliminary estimate of cost of 
restoration or reconstruction for damaged Federal-aid highways in each 
jurisdiction. Pictures showing the kinds and extent of damage and sketch 
maps detailing the damaged areas should be included, as appropriate, in 
the damage survey summary report.
    (2) Unless very unusual circumstances prevail, the damage survey 
summary report should be prepared within 6 weeks following the 
applicant's notification.
    (3) For large disasters where extensive damage to Federal-aid 
highways is readily evident, the FHWA Division Administrator may approve 
an application under Sec. 668.111(d) prior to submission of the damage 
survey summary report. In these cases, an abbreviated

[[Page 366]]

damage survey summary report, summarizing eligible repair costs by 
jurisdiction, is to be prepared and submitted to the FHWA Division 
Administrator after the damage inspections have been completed.
    (c) Application. Before funds can be made available, an application 
for ER must be made to, and approved by the FHWA Division Administrator. 
The application shall include:
    (1) A copy of the Governor's proclamation, request for a 
Presidential declaration, or a Presidential declaration; and
    (2) A copy of the damage survey summary report, as appropriate.
    (d) Approval of application. The FHWA Division Administrator's 
approval of the application constitutes the finding of eligibility under 
23 U.S.C. 125 and shall constitute approval of the application.

[65 FR 25444, May 2, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 668.113  Program and project procedures.

    (a) Immediately after approval of an application, the FHWA Division 
Administrator will notify the applicant to proceed with preparation of a 
program which defines the work needed to restore or replace the damaged 
facilities. It should be submitted to the FHWA Division Administrator 
within 3 months of receipt of this notification. The FHWA field office 
will assist the applicant and other affected agencies in preparation of 
the program. This work may involve joint site inspections to view damage 
and reach tentative agreement on type of permanent corrective work to be 
undertaken. Program data should be kept to a minimum, but should be 
sufficient to identify the approved disaster or catastrophe and to 
permit a determination of the eligibility and propriety of proposed 
work. If the damage survey summary report is determined by the FHWA 
Division Administrator to be of sufficient detail to meet these 
criteria, additional program support data need not be submitted.
    (b) Project procedures. (1) Projects for permanent repairs shall be 
processed in accordance with regular Federal-aid procedures. In those 
cases where a regular Federal-aid project in a State similar to the ER 
project would be handled under the project oversight exceptions found in 
title 23, United States Code, the ER project can be handled in a similar 
fashion subject to the following two conditions:
    (i) Any betterment to be incorporated into the project and for which 
ER funding is requested must receive prior FHWA approval; and
    (ii) The FHWA reserves the right to conduct final inspections on all 
ER projects. The FHWA Division Administrator has the discretion to 
undertake final inspections on ER projects as deemed appropriate.
    (2) Simplified procedures, including abbreviated plans should be 
used where appropriate.
    (3) Emergency repair meets the criteria for categorical exclusions 
pursuant to 23 CFR 771.117 and normally does not require any further 
NEPA approvals.

       Subpart B_Procedures for Federal Agencies for Federal Roads


<R05>
Sec. 668.201  Purpose.

    To establish policy, procedures, and program guidance for the 
administration of emergency relief to Federal agencies for the repair or 
reconstruction of Federal roads which are found to have suffered serious 
damage by a natural disaster over a wide area or by catastrophic 
failure.

[43 FR 59485, Dec. 21, 1978]


<R05>
Sec. 668.203  Definitions.

    (a) Applicant. Any Federal agency which submits an application for 
emergency relief and which has authority to repair or reconstruct 
Federal roads.
    (b) Betterments. Added protective features, such as, the relocation 
or rebuilding of roadways at a higher elevation or the extension, 
replacement or raising of bridges, and added facilities not existing 
prior to the natural disaster or catastrophic failure such as additional 
lanes, upgraded surfacing, or structures.
    (c) Catastrophic failure. The sudden failure of a major element or 
segment

[[Page 367]]

of a Federal road which is not primarily attributable to gradual and 
progressive deterioration or lack of proper maintenance. The closure of 
a facility because of imminent danger of collapse is not in itself a 
sudden failure.
    (d) Emergency repairs. Those repairs, including necessary 
preliminary engineering (PE), construction engineering (CE), and 
temporary traffic operations, undertaken during or immediately after a 
natural disaster or catastrophic failure (1) to restore essential 
travel, (2) to protect remaining facilities, or (3) to minimize the 
extent of damage.
    (e) Federal roads. Forest highways, forest development roads and 
trails, park roads and trails, parkways, public lands highways, public 
lands development roads and trails, and Indian reservation roads as 
defined under 23 U.S.C. 101(a).
    (f) Finding. A letter or other official correspondence issued by the 
Direct Federal Division Engineer (DFDE) to a Federal agency giving 
notification that pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 125, Federal roads have 
(Affirmative Finding) or have not (Negative Finding) been found to have 
suffered serious damage as the result of (1) a natural disaster over a 
wide area, or (2) a catastrophic failure.
    (g) Natural disaster. An unusual natural occurrence such as a flood, 
hurricane, severe storm, tidal wave, earthquake, or landslide which 
causes serious damage.
    (h) Permanent work. Repair or reconstruction to pre-disaster or 
other allowed geometric and construction standards and related PE and 
CE.
    (i) Direct Federal Division Engineer. Director of one of the Direct 
Federal field offices located in Vancouver, WA; Denver, CO; and 
Arlington, VA.

[43 FR 59485, Dec. 21, 1978, as amended at 47 FR 10529, Mar. 11, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 668.205  Policy.

    (a) This emergency relief program is intended to pay the unusually 
heavy expenses in the repair and reconstruction of Federal roads 
resulting from damage caused by natural disasters over a wide area or 
catastrophic failures.
    (b) Emergency relief work shall be given prompt attention and 
priority over non-emergency work.
    (c) Permanent work shall be done by contract awarded by competitive 
bidding through formal advertising, where feasible.
    (d) It is in the public interest to perform emergency repairs 
immediately and prior approval or authorization from the DFDE is not 
required. Emergency repairs may be performed by the method of 
contracting (advertised contract, negotiated contract, or force account) 
which the applicant or the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) (where 
FHWA performs the work) determines to be most suited for this work.
    (e) Emergency relief projects shall be promptly constructed. 
Projects not under construction by the end of the second fiscal year 
following the year in which the disaster occurred will be reevaluated by 
the DFDE and will be withdrawn from the approved program of projects 
unless suitable justification is provided by the applicant to warrant 
retention.
    (f) The Finding for natural disasters will be based on both the 
extraordinary character of the natural disturbance and the wide area of 
impact. Storms of unusual intensity occurring over a small area do not 
meet these conditions.
    (g) Diligent efforts shall be made to recover repair costs from the 
legally responsible parties to reduce the project costs where highway 
damages are caused by ships, barge tows, highway vehicles, vehicles with 
illegal loads, and similar improperly controlled objects or events.
    (h) Emergency funds shall not duplicate assistance under another 
Federal program or compensation from insurance or any other source. 
Where other funding compensates for only part of an eligible cost, 
emergency relief funding can be used to pay the remaining costs.

[43 FR 59485, Dec. 21, 1978, as amended at 47 FR 10529, Mar. 11, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 668.207  Federal share payable from emergency fund.

    The Federal share payable under this program is 100 percent of the 
cost.

[43 FR 59485, Dec. 21, 1978]

[[Page 368]]


<R05>
Sec. 668.209  Eligibility of work.

    (a) Permanent work must have prior program approval in accordance 
with paragraph (a) of Sec. 668.215 unless such work is performed as 
emergency repairs.
    (b) Emergency repairs, including permanent work performed incidental 
to emergency repairs, and all PE may begin immediately and do not need 
prior program approval. Reimbursement shall be contingent upon the work 
ultimately being approved in accordance with the requirements of 
paragraph (a) of Sec. 668.215.
    (c) To qualify for emergency relief, the damaged or destroyed road 
or trail shall be designated as a Federal road.
    (d) Replacement highway facilities are appropriate when it is not 
practical and economically feasible to repair or restore a damaged 
element to its preexisting condition. Emergency relief is limited to the 
cost of a new facility constructed to current design standards of 
comparable capacity and character to the destroyed facility. With 
respect to a bridge, a comparable facility is one which meets current 
geometric and construction standards for the type and volume of traffic 
it will carry during its design life.
    (e) Emergency relief funds may participate to the extent of eligible 
repair costs when proposed projects contain betterments or other work 
not eligible for emergency funds.
    (f) Work may include:
    (1) Repair to, or reconstruction of, seriously damaged highway 
elements for a distance which would be within normal highway right-of-
way limits, including necessary clearance of debris and other deposits 
in drainage courses, where such work would not be classed as heavy 
maintenance.
    (2) Restoration of stream channels when the work is necessary for 
the satisfactory operation of the Federal road. The applicant must have 
responsibility and authority for maintenance and proper operation of 
stream channels restored.
    (3) Betterments where clearly economically justified to prevent 
future recurring damage. Economic justification acceptable to the DFDE 
must weigh the cost of such betterments against the risk of eligible 
recurring damage and the cost of future repair.
    (4) Actual PE and CE costs on approved projects.
    (5) Emergency repairs.

[43 FR 59485, Dec. 21, 1978, as amended at 47 FR 10529, Mar. 11, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 668.211  Notification, damage assessment, and finding.

    (a) Notification. During or as soon as possible after a natural 
disaster or catastrophic failure, each applicant will notify the DFDE of 
its tentative intent to apply for emergency relief and request that a 
Finding be made.
    (b) Acknowledgment. The DFDE will promptly acknowledge the 
notification and briefly describe subsequent damage assessment, Finding, 
and application procedures.
    (c) Field report. The applicant shall cooperate with the DFDE to 
promptly make a field survey of overall damage and in the preparation of 
a field report.
    (d) Finding. Using the field report and other information deemed 
appropriate, the DFDE will promptly issue a Finding and if an 
Affirmative Finding is made, establish the date after which repair or 
reconstruction will be considered for emergency relief, and note the 
dates of the extraordinary natural occurrence or catastrophic event 
responsible for the damage or destruction.
    (e) Detailed site inspections. (1) If an Affirmative Finding is 
made, the applicant shall cooperate with the DFDE to make a detailed 
inspection of each damage site.
    (2) If it appears certain an Affirmative Finding will be made, the 
DFDE may elect to make these site inspections at the time damage is 
initially assessed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.
    (f) The applicant shall make available to FHWA personnel conducting 
damage survey and estimate work maps depicting designated Federal roads 
in the affected area.

Sec. 668.213  Application procedures.

    (a) Based on the detailed site inspections and damage estimates 
prepared pursuant to paragraph (e) of Sec. 668.211,

[[Page 369]]

the applicant will submit an application in the form of a letter to the 
DFDE which shall include a list of projects for which emergency relief 
is requested. The application shall be submitted within 3 months after 
an Affirmative Finding.
    (b) The list of projects shall include emergency repairs, PE, and 
permanent work, and provide for each project a location, length, project 
number, type of damage, description of work with a separate breakdown 
for betterments including a justification for those intended for 
emergency relief funding, proposed method of construction, estimated

Sec. 668.215  Programming and project procedures.

    (a) The DFDE will advise the applicant in writing which projects in 
the application, or in any subsequent submittals pursuant to paragraph 
(c) of Sec. 668.213 are approved including any approval conditions. 
Approved projects shall constitute the approved program of projects 
(program).
    (b) Plans, specifications, and estimates (PS&E) shall be developed 
based on work identified in the approved program.
    (c) The DFDE will approve PS&E's, concur in the award of contracts 
or the rejection of bids, determine that construction by the force 
account method is in the public interest, and accept completed work in 
accordance with interagency procedures established by the DFDE.
    (d) The applicant shall notify the DFDE in writing of the semi-
annual status and completion of each emergency relief project 
constructed by applicant forces.

under this regulation shall be reapportioned to all other eligible 
states pursuant to the formulas of 23 U.S.C. 104(b)(4) and the 
apportionment factors in effect at the time of the original 
apportionments, unless the Secretary determines, on the basis of 
information submitted by the state, that the state has come into 
conformity with this regulation prior to the final determination. If the 
Secretary determines that the state has come into conformity, the 
withheld funds shall be released to the state subject to the 
availability of such funds under 23 U.S.C. 118(b).

<R05>
Sec. 710.201  State responsibilities.

    (a) Organization. Each STD shall be adequately staffed, equipped, 
and organized to discharge its real property-related responsibilities.
    (b) Program oversight. The STD shall have overall responsibility for 
the acquisition, management, and disposal of real property on Federal-
aid projects. This responsibility shall include assuring that 
acquisitions and disposals by a State agency are made in compliance with 
legal requirements of State and Federal laws and regulations.
    (c) Right-of-way (ROW) operations manual. Each STD which receives 
funding from the highway trust fund shall maintain a manual describing 
its right-of-way organization, policies, and procedures. The manual 
shall describe functions and procedures for all phases of the real 
estate program, including appraisal and appraisal review, negotiation 
and eminent domain, property management, and relocation assistance. The 
manual shall also specify procedures to prevent conflict of interest and 
avoid fraud, waste, and abuse. The manual shall be in sufficient detail 
and depth to guide State employees and others involved in acquiring and 
managing real property. The State manuals should be developed and 
updated, as a minimum, to meet the following schedule:
    (1) The STD shall prepare and submit for approval by FHWA an up-to-
date Right-of-Way Operations Manual by no later than January 1, 2001.
    (2) Every five years thereafter, the chief administrative officer of 
the STD shall certify to the FHWA that the current ROW operations manual 
conforms to existing practices and contains necessary procedures to 
ensure compliance with Federal and State real estate law and regulation.
    (3) The STD shall update the manual periodically to reflect changes 
in operations and submit the updated materials for approval by the FHWA.
    (d) Compliance responsibility. The STD is responsible for complying 
with current FHWA requirements whether or not its manual reflects those 
requirements.
    (e) Adequacy of real property interest. The real property interest 
acquired for all Federal-aid projects funded pursuant to title 23 of the 
United States Code shall be adequate for the construction, operation, 
and maintenance of the resulting facility and for the protection of both 
the facility and the traveling public.
    (f) Recordkeeping. The acquiring agency shall maintain adequate 
records of its acquisition and property management activities.
    (1) Acquisition records, including records related to owner or 
tenant displacements, and property inventories of improvements acquired 
shall be in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with this part 
and 49 CFR part 24. These records shall be retained at least 3 years 
from either:
    (i) The date the State receives Federal reimbursement of the final 
payment made to each owner of a property and to each person displaced 
from a property, or
    (ii) The date a credit toward the Federal share of a project is 
approved based on early acquisition activities of the State.
    (2) Property management records shall include inventories of real 
property considered excess to project needs, all authorized uses of 
airspace, and other leases or agreements for use of real property 
managed by the STD.
    (g) Procurement. Contracting for all activities required in support 
of State right-of-way programs through use of private consultants and 
other services shall conform to 49 CFR 18.36.
    (h) Use of other public land acquisition organizations or private 
consultants. The STD may enter into written agreements with other State, 
county, municipal, or local public land acquisition organizations or 
with private consultants to carry out its authorities under paragraph 
(b) of this section. Such organizations, firms, or individuals must 
comply with the policies and practices of the STD. The STD shall monitor 
any such real property acquisition activities to assure compliance with 
State and Federal law and requirements and is responsible for informing 
such organizations of all such requirements and for imposing sanctions 
in cases of material non-compliance.

[[Page 375]]

    (i) Approval actions. Except for the Interstate system, the STD and 
the FHWA will agree on the scope of property related oversight and 
approval actions that the FHWA will be responsible for under this part. 
The content of the most recent oversight agreement shall be reflected in 
the State right-of-way operations manual. The oversight agreement, and 
thus the manual, will indicate for which non-Interstate Federal-aid 
project submission of materials for review and approval are required.
    (j) Approval of just compensation. The amount determined to be just 
compensation shall be approved by a responsible official of the 
acquiring agency.
    (k) Description of acquisition process. The STD shall provide 
persons affected by projects or acquisitions advanced under title 23 of 
the United States Code with a written description of its real property 
acquisition process under State law and of the owner's rights, 
privileges, and obligations. The description shall be written in clear, 
non-technical language and, where appropriate, be available in a 
language other than English.

<R04>
                      Subpart C_Project Development


<R05>
Sec. 710.301  General.

    The project development process typically follows a sequence of 
actions and approvals in order to qualify for funding. The key steps in 
this process are provided in this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 710.303  Planning.

    State and local governments conduct metropolitan and statewide 
planning to develop coordinated, financially constrained system plans to 
meet transportation needs for local and statewide systems, under FHWA's 
planning regulations contained in 23 CFR part 450. In addition, air 
quality non-attainment areas must meet the requirements of the U.S. EPA 
Transportation conformity regulations (40 CFR parts 51 and 93). Projects 
must be included in an approved State Transportation Improvement Program 
(STIP) in order to be eligible for Federal-aid funding.


<R05>
Sec. 710.305  Environmental analysis.

    The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process, as described 
in FHWA's NEPA regulations in 23 CFR part 771, normally must be 
conducted and concluded with a record of decision (ROD) or equivalent 
before Federal funds can be placed under agreement for acquisition of 
right-of-way. Where

[[Page 377]]

applicable, a State also must complete Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et 
seq.) project level conformity analysis. In areas in which the Clean Air 
Act conformity determination has lapsed, acquiring agencies must 
coordinate with Federal Highway Administration for special instructions 
prior to initiating new projects or continuing activity on existing 
projects. At the time of processing an environmental document, a State 
may request reimbursement of costs incurred for early acquisition, 
provided conditions prescribed in 23 U.S.C. 108(c) and 23 CFR 710.501, 
are satisfied.


<R05>
Sec. 710.307  Project agreement.

    As a condition of Federal-aid, the STD shall obtain FHWA 
authorization in writing or electronically before proceeding with any 
real property acquisitions, including hardship acquisition and 
protective buying (see 23 CFR 710.503). The STD must prepare a project 
agreement in accordance with 23 CFR part 630, subpart C. The agreement 
shall be based on an acceptable estimate for the cost of acquisition. On 
projects where the initial project agreement was executed after June 9, 
1998, a State may request credit toward the non-Federal share, for early 
acquisitions, donations, or other contributions applied to the project 
provided conditions in 23 U.S.C. 323 and 23 CFR 710.501, are satisfied.


<R05>
Sec. 710.309  Acquisition.

    The process of acquiring real property includes appraisal, appraisal 
review, establishing just compensation, negotiations, administrative and 
legal settlements, and condemnation. The State shall conduct acquisition 
and related relocation activities in accordance with 49 CFR part 24.


<R05>
Sec. 710.311  Construction advertising.

    The State must manage real property acquired for a project until it 
is required for construction. Clearance of improvements can be scheduled 
during the acquisition phase of the project using sale/removal 
agreements, separate demolition contracts, or be included as a work item 
in the construction contract. On Interstate projects, prior to 
advertising for construction, the State shall develop ROW availability 
statements and certifications related to project acquisitions as 
required by 23 CFR 635.309. For non-Interstate projects, the oversight 
agreement must specify responsibility for the review and approval of the 
ROW availability statements and certifications. Generally, for non-NHS 
projects, the State has full responsibility for determining that right-
of-way is available for construction.


<R05>
Sec. 710.313  Design-build projects.

    (a) In the case of a design-build project, right-of-way must be 
acquired and cleared in accordance with the Uniform Relocation 
Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as 
amended, and STD right-of-way procedures. The STD shall submit a right-
of-way certification in accordance with 23 CFR 635.309(p) when 
requesting FHWA's authorization. If the right-of-way services are 
included in the Request for Proposal document, the STD shall ensure that 
right-of-way is available prior to the start of physical construction on 
individual properties.
    (b) The decision to advance a right-of-way segment to the 
construction stage shall not impair the safety or in anyway be coercive 
in the context of 49 CFR 24.102(h) with respect to unacquired or 
occupied properties on the same or adjacent segments of project right-
of-way.
    (c) Certain right-of-way acquisition and clearance services may be 
incorporated into the design-build contract if allowed under State law. 
The contract may include language that provides that construction will 
not commence until all property is acquired and relocations have been 
completed; or, the construction could be phased or segmented to allow 
right-of-way activities to be completed on individual properties or a 
group of properties, thereby allowing certification in a manner 
satisfactory to the STD for each phase or segment.
    (d) If the STD elects to include right-of-way services in the 
design-build contract, the following provisions must be addressed in the 
request for proposals document:

[[Page 378]]

    (1)(i) The design-builder must submit written acquisition and 
relocation procedures to the STD for approval prior to commencing right-
of-way activities. These procedures should contain a prioritized 
appraisal, acquisition, and relocation strategy as well as check points 
for STD approval, such as approval of just compensation, replacement 
housing payment calculations, replacement housing payment and moving 
cost claims, appraisals, administrative and stipulated settlements that 
exceed determined thresholds based on a risk management analysis, etc. 
STD's which have an FHWA approved procedures manual, in accordance with 
23 CFR 710.201(c), may comply with this section by requiring the design-
builder to execute a certification in its proposal that it has received 
the approved right-of-way manual and will comply with the procedures.
    (ii) The written relocation plan must provide reasonable time frames 
for the orderly relocation of residents and businesses on the project as 
provided at 49 CFR 24.205. It should be understood that these time 
frames will be based on best estimates of the time it will take to 
acquire the right-of-way and relocate families in accordance with 
certain legal requirements and time frames which may not be violated. 
Accordingly, the time frames estimated for right-of-way acquisition will 
not be compressed in the event other necessary actions preceding right-
of-way acquisition miss their assigned due dates.
    (2)(i) The design-builder must establish a project tracking system 
and quality control system. This system must show the appraisal, 
acquisition and relocation status of all parcels.
    (ii) The quality control system may be administered by an 
independent consultant with the necessary expertise in appraisal, 
acquisition and relocation policies and procedures, who can make 
periodic reviews and reports to the design-builder and the STD.
    (3) The STD may consider the establishment of a hold off zone around 
all occupied properties to ensure compliance with right-of-way 
procedures prior to starting construction activities in affected areas. 
The limits of this zone should be established by the STD prior to the 
design-builder entering on the property. There should be no construction 
related activity within the hold off zone until the property is vacated. 
The design-builder must have written notification of vacancy from the 
right-of-way quality control consultant or STD prior to entering the 
hold off zone.
    (4) Adequate access shall be provided to all occupied properties to 
insure emergency and personal vehicle access.
    (5) Utility service must be available to all occupied properties at 
all times prior to and until relocation is completed.
    (6) Open burning should not occur within 305 meters (1,000 feet) of 
an occupied dwelling.
    (7) The STD will provide a right-of-way project manager who will 
serve as the first point of contact for all right-of-way issues.
    (e) If the STD elects to perform all right-of-way services relating 
to the design-build contract, the provisions in Sec. 710.311 will 
apply. The STD will notify potential offerors of the status of all 
right-of-way issues in the request for proposal document.

<R04>
                   Subpart D_Real Property Management


<R05>
Sec. 710.401  General.

    This subpart describes the acquiring agency's responsibilities to 
control the use of real property required for a project in which Federal 
funds participated in any phase of the project. Prior to allowing any 
change in access control or other use or occupancy of acquired property 
along the Interstate, the STD shall secure an approval from the FHWA for 
such change or use. The STD shall specify in the State's ROW operations 
manual, procedures for the rental, leasing, maintenance, and disposal of 
real property acquired with title 23 of the United States Code funds. 
The State shall assure that local agencies follow the State's approved 
procedures, or the local agencies own procedures if approved for use by 
the STD.

[[Page 379]]


<R05>
Sec. 710.403  Management.

    (a) The STD must assure that all real property within the boundaries 
of a federally-aided facility is devoted exclusively to the purposes of 
that facility and is preserved free of all other public or private 
alternative uses, unless such alternative uses are permitted by Federal 
regulation or the FHWA. An alternative use must be consistent with the 
continued operation, maintenance, and safety of the facility, and such 
use shall not result in the exposure of the facility's users or others 
to hazards.
    (b) The STD shall specify procedures in the State manual for 
determining when a real property interest is no longer needed. These 
procedures must provide for coordination among relevant STD 
organizational units, including maintenance, safety, design, planning, 
right-of-way, environment, access management, and traffic operations.
    (c) The STD shall evaluate the environmental effects of disposal and 
leasing actions requiring FHWA approval as provided in 23 CFR part 771.
    (d) Acquiring agencies shall charge current fair market value or 
rent for the use or disposal of real property interests, including 
access control, if those real property interests were obtained with 
title 23 of the United States Code funding, except as provided in 
paragraphs (d) (1) through (5) of this section. Since property no longer 
needed for a project was acquired with public funding, the principle 
guiding disposal would normally be to sell the property at fair market 
value and use the funds for transportation purposes. The term fair 
market value as used for acquisition and disposal purposes is as defined 
by State statute and/or State court decisions. Exceptions to the general 
requirement for charging fair market value may be approved in the 
following situations:
    (1) With FHWA approval, when the STD clearly shows that an exception 
is in the overall public interest for social, environmental, or economic 
purposes; nonproprietary governmental use; or uses under 23 U.S.C. 
142(f), Public Transportation. The STD manual may include criteria for 
evaluating disposals at less than fair market value. Disposal for public 
purposes may also be at fair market value. The STD shall submit requests 
for such exceptions to the FHWA in writing.
    (2) Use by public utilities in accordance with 23 CFR part 645.
    (3) Use by Railroads in accordance with 23 CFR part 646.
    (4) Use for Bikeways and pedestrian walkways in accordance with 23 
CFR part 652.
    (5) Use for transportation projects eligible for assistance under 
title 23 of the United States Code, provided that a concession 
agreement, as defined in section 710.703, shall not constitute a 
transportation project.
    (e) The Federal share of net income from the sale or lease of excess 
real property shall be used by the STD for activities eligible for 
funding under title 23 of the United States Code. Where project income 
derived from the sale or lease of excess property is used for subsequent 
title 23 projects, use of the income does not create a Federal-aid 
project.
    (f) No FHWA approval is required for disposal of property which is 
located outside of the limits of the right-of-way if Federal funds did 
not participate in the acquisition cost of the property.
    (g) Highway facilities in which Federal funds participated in either 
the right-of-way or construction may be relinquished to another 
governmental agency for continued highway use under the provisions of 23 
CFR 620, subpart B.

<R05>
Sec. 710.405  Air rights on the Interstate.

    (a) The FHWA policies relating to management of airspace on the 
Interstate for non-highway purposes are included in this section. 
Although this section deals specifically with approval actions on the 
Interstate, any use of airspace contemplated by a STD must assure that 
such occupancy, use, or reservation is in the public interest and does 
not impair the highway or interfere with the free and safe flow of 
traffic as provided in 23 CFR 1.23.
    (1) This subpart applies to Interstate facilities which received 
title 23 of the

[[Page 380]]

United States Code assistance in any way.
    (2) This subpart does not apply to the following:
    (i) Non-Interstate highways.
    (ii) Railroads and public utilities which cross or otherwise occupy 
Federal-aid highway right-of-way.
    (iii) Relocations of railroads or utilities for which reimbursement 
is claimed under 23 CFR part 140, subparts E and H.
    (iv) Bikeways and pedestrian walkways as covered in 23 CFR part 652.
    (b) A STD may grant rights for temporary or permanent occupancy or 
use of Interstate system airspace if the STD has acquired sufficient 
legal right, title, and interest in the right-of-way of a federally 
assisted highway to permit the use of certain airspace for non-highway 
purposes; and where such airspace is not required presently or in the 
foreseeable future for the safe and proper operation and maintenance of 
the highway facility. The STD must obtain prior FHWA approval, except 
for paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) An STD may make lands and rights-of-way available without charge 
to a publicly owned mass transit authority for public transit purposes 
whenever the public interest will be served, and where this can be 
accomplished without impairing automotive safety or future highway 
improvements
    (d) An individual, company, organization, or public agency desiring 
to use airspace shall submit a written request to the STD. If the STD 
recommends approval, it shall forward an application together with its 
recommendation and any necessary supplemental information including the 
proposed airspace agreement to the FHWA. The submission shall 
affirmatively provide for adherence to all policy requirements contained 
in this subpart and conform to the provisions in the FHWA's Airspace 
Guidelines at: http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/realestate/index.htm.


<R05>
Sec. 710.407  Leasing.

    (a) Leasing of real property acquired with title 23 of the United 
States Code, funds shall be covered by an agreement between the STD and 
lessee which contains provisions to insure the safety and integrity of 
the federally funded facility. It shall also include provisions 
governing lease revocation, removal of improvements at no cost to the 
FHWA, adequate insurance to hold the State and the FHWA harmless, 
nondiscrimination, access by the STD and the FHWA for inspection, 
maintenance, and reconstruction of the facility.
    (b) Where a proposed use requires changes in the existing 
transportation facility, such changes shall be provided without cost to 
Federal funds unless otherwise specifically agreed to by the STD and the 
FHWA.
    (c) Proposed uses of real property shall conform to the current 
design standards and safety criteria of the Federal Highway 
Administration for the functional classification of the highway facility 
in which the property is located.


<R05>
Sec. 710.409  Disposals.

    (a) Real property interests determined to be excess to 
transportation needs may be sold or conveyed to a public entity or to a 
private party in accordance with Sec. 710.403(d).
    (b) Federal, State, and local agencies shall be afforded the 
opportunity to acquire real property interests considered for disposal 
when such real property interests have potential use for parks, 
conservation, recreation, or related purposes, and when such a transfer 
is allowed by State law. When this potential exists, the STD shall 
notify the appropriate resource agencies of its intentions to dispose of 
the real property interests. The notifications can be accomplished by 
placing the appropriate agencies on the States' disposal notification 
listing.
    (c) Real property interests may be retained by the STD to restore, 
preserve, or improve the scenic beauty and environmental quality 
adjacent to the transportation facility.
    (d) Where the transfer of properties to other agencies at less than 
fair market value for continued public use is clearly justified as in 
the public interest and approved by the FHWA, the deed shall provide for 
reversion of the property for failure to continue public ownership and 
use. Where property is sold at fair market value no reversion clause is 
required. Disposal actions described in 23 CFR 710.403(d)(1) for less

[[Page 381]]

than fair market value require a public interest determination and FHWA 
approval, consistent with that section.

               Subpart E_Property Acquisition Alternatives


<R05>
Sec. 710.501  Early acquisition.

    (a) Real property acquisition. The State may initiate acquisition of 
real property at any time it has the legal authority to do so based on 
program or project considerations. The State may undertake early 
acquisition for corridor preservation, access management, or other 
purposes.
    (b) Eligible costs. Acquisition costs incurred by a State agency 
prior to executing a project agreement with the FHWA are not eligible 
for Federal-aid reimbursement. However, such costs may become eligible 
for use as a credit towards the State's share of a Federal-aid project 
if the following conditions are met:
    (1) The property was lawfully obtained by the State;
    (2) The property was not land described in 23 U.S.C. 138;
    (3) The property was acquired in accordance with the provisions of 
49 CFR part 24;
    (4) The State complied with the requirements of title VI of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d-2000d-4);
    (5) The State determined and the FHWA concurs that the action taken 
did not influence the environmental assessment for the project, 
including:
    (i) The decision on need to construct the project;
    (ii) The consideration of alternatives; and
    (iii) The selection of the design or location; and
    (6) The property will be incorporated into a Federal-aid project.
    (7) The original project agreement covering the project was executed 
on or after June 9, 1998.
    (c) Reimbursement. In addition to meeting all provisions in 
paragraph (b) of this section, the FHWA approval for reimbursement for 
early acquisition costs, including costs associated with displacement of 
owners or tenants, requires the STD to demonstrate that:
    (1) Prior to acquisition, the STD made the certifications and 
determinations required by 23 U.S.C. 108(c)(2)(C) and (D); and
    (2) The STD obtained concurrence from the Environmental Protection 
Agency in the findings made under paragraph (b)(5) of this section 
regarding the NEPA process.


<R05>
Sec. 710.503  Protective buying and hardship acquisition.

    (a) General conditions. Prior to the STD obtaining final 
environmental approval, the STD may request FHWA agreement to provide 
reimbursement for advance acquisition of a particular parcel or a 
limited number of parcels, to prevent imminent development and increased 
costs on the preferred location (Protective Buying), or to alleviate 
hardship to a property owner or owners on the preferred location 
(Hardship Acquisition), provided the following conditions are met:
    (1) The project is included in the currently approved STIP;
    (2) The STD has complied with applicable public involvement 
requirements in 23 CFR parts 450 and 771;
    (3) A determination has been completed for any property subject to 
the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 138; and
    (4) Procedures of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation are 
completed for properties subject to 16 U.S.C. 470(f) (historic 
properties).
    (b) Protective buying. The STD must clearly demonstrate that 
development of the property is imminent and such development would limit 
future transportation choices. A significant increase in cost may be 
considered as an element justifying a protective purchase.
    (c) Hardship acquisitions. The STD must accept and concur in a 
request for a hardship acquisition based on a property owner's written 
submission that:
    (1) Supports the hardship acquisition by providing justification, on 
the basis of health, safety or financial reasons, that remaining in the 
property poses an undue hardship compared to others; and
    (2) Documents an inability to sell the property because of the 
impending

[[Page 382]]

project, at fair market value, within a time period that is typical for 
properties not impacted by the impending project.
    (d) Environmental decisions. Acquisition of property under this 
section shall not influence the environmental assessment of a project, 
including the decision relative to the need to construct the project or 
the selection of a specific location.


<R05>
Sec. 710.505  Real property donations.

    (a) Donations of property being acquired. A non-governmental owner 
whose real property is required for a Federal-aid project may donate the 
property to the STD. Prior to accepting the property, the owner must be 
informed by the agency of his/her right to receive just compensation for 
the property. The owner shall also be informed of his/her right to an 
appraisal of the property by a qualified appraiser, unless the STD 
determines that an appraisal is unnecessary because the valuation 
problem is uncomplicated and the fair market value is estimated at no 
more than $2500, or the State appraisal waiver limit approved by the 
FHWA, whichever is greater. All donations of property received prior to 
the approval of the NEPA document must meet environmental requirements 
as specified in 23 U.S.C. 323(d).
    (b) Credit for donations. Donations of real property may be credited 
to the State's matching share of the project. Credit to the State's 
matching share for donated property shall be based on fair market value 
established on the earlier of the following: either the date on which 
the donation becomes effective, or the date on which equitable title to 
the property vests in the State. The fair market value shall not include 
increases or decreases in value caused by the project. Donations may be 
made at anytime during the development of a project. The STD shall 
develop sufficient documentation to indicate compliance with paragraph 
(a) of this section and to support the amount of credit applied. The 
total credit cannot exceed the State's pro-rata share under the project 
agreement to which it is applied.
    (c) Donations and conveyances in exchange for construction features 
or services. A property owner may donate property in exchange for 
construction features or services. The value of the donation is limited 
to the fair market value of property donated less the cost of the 
construction features or services. If the value of the donated property 
exceeds the cost of the construction features or services, the 
difference may be eligible for a credit to the State's share of project 
costs.


<R05>
Sec. 710.507  State and local contributions.

    (a) General. Real property owned by State and local governments 
incorporated within a federally funded project can be used as a credit 
toward the State matching share of total project cost. A credit cannot 
exceed the State's matching share required by the project agreement.
    (b) Effective date. Credits can be applied to projects where the 
initial project agreement is executed after June 9, 1998.
    (c) Exemptions. Credits are not available for lands acquired with 
any form of Federal financial assistance, or for lands already 
incorporated and used for transportation purposes.
    (d) State contributions. Real property acquired with State funds and 
required for federally-assisted projects may support a credit toward the 
non-Federal share of project costs. The STD must prepare documentation 
supporting all credits including:
    (1) A certification that the acquisition satisfied the conditions in 
23 CFR 710.501(b); and
    (2) Justification of the value of credit applied. Acquisition costs 
incurred by the State to acquire title can be used as justification for 
the value of the real property.
    (e) Credit for local government contributions. A contribution by a 
unit of local government of real property which is offered for credit, 
in connection with a project eligible for assistance under this title, 
shall be credited against the State share of the project at fair market 
value of the real property. Property may also be presented for project 
use with the understanding that no credit for its use is sought. The STD 
shall assure that the acquisition satisfied the conditions in 23 CFR

[[Page 383]]

710.501(b), and that documentation justifies the amount of the credit.


<R05>
Sec. 710.509  Functional replacement of real property in public ownership.

    (a) General. When publicly owned real property, including land and/
or facilities, is to be acquired for a Federal-aid highway project, in 
lieu of paying the fair market value for the real property, the State 
may provide compensation by functionally replacing the publicly owned 
real property with another facility which will provide equivalent 
utility.
    (b) Federal participation. Federal-aid funds may participate in 
functional replacement costs only if:
    (1) Functional replacement is permitted under State law and the STD 
elects to provide it.
    (2) The property in question is in public ownership and use.
    (3) The replacement facility will be in public ownership and will 
continue the public use function of the acquired facility.
    (4) The State has informed the agency owning the property of its 
right to an estimate of just compensation based on an appraisal of fair 
market value and of the option to choose either just compensation or 
functional replacement.
    (5) The FHWA concurs in the STD determination that functional 
replacement is in the public interest.
    (6) The real property is not owned by a utility or railroad.
    (c) Federal land transfers. Use of this section for functional 
replacement of real property in Federal ownership shall be in accordance 
with Federal land transfer provisions in subpart F of this part.
    (d) Limits upon participation. Federal-aid participation in the 
costs of functional replacement are limited to costs which are actually 
incurred in the replacement of the acquired land and/or facility and 
are:
    (1) Costs for facilities which do not represent increases in 
capacity or betterments, except for those necessary to replace 
utilities, to meet legal, regulatory, or similar requirements, or to 
meet reasonable prevailing standards; and
    (2) Costs for land to provide a site for the replacement facility.
    (e) Procedures. When a State determines that payments providing for 
functional replacement of public facilities are allowable under State 
law, the State will incorporate within the State's ROW operating manual 
full procedures covering review and oversight that will be applied to 
such cases.


<R05>
Sec. 710.511  Transportation enhancements.

    (a) General. Section 133(b) (8) of title 23 of the United States 
Code authorizes the expenditure of surface transportation funds for 
transportation enhancement activities (TEA). Transportation enhancement 
activities which involve the acquisition, management, and disposition of 
real property, and the relocation of families, individuals, and 
businesses, are governed by the general requirements of the Federal-aid 
program found in titles 23 and 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR), except as specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
    (b) Requirements. (1) Displacements for TEA are subject to the 
Uniform Act.
    (2) Acquisitions for TEA are subject to the Uniform Act except as 
provided in paragraphs (b)(3), (b)(4), and (b)(5) of this section.
    (3) Entities acquiring real property for TEA who lack the power of 
eminent domain may comply with the Uniform Act by meeting the limited 
requirements under 49 CFR 24.101(a)(2).
    (4) The requirements of the Uniform Act do not apply when real 
property acquired for a TEA was purchased from a third party by a 
qualified conservation organization, and--
    (i) The conservation organization is not acting on behalf of the 
agency receiving TEA or other Federal-aid funds, and
    (ii) There was no Federal approval of property acquisition prior to 
the involvement of the conservation organization. [``Federal approval of 
property acquisition'' means the date of the approval of the 
environmental document or project authorization/agreement, whichever is 
earlier. ``Involvement of the conservation organization'' means

[[Page 384]]

the date the organization makes a legally binding offer to acquire a 
real property interest, including an option to purchase, in the 
property.]
    (5) When a qualified conservation organization acquires real 
property for a project receiving Federal-aid highway funds on behalf of 
an agency with eminent domain authority, the requirements of the Uniform 
Act apply as if the agency had acquired the property itself.
    (6) When, subsequent to Federal approval of property acquisition, a 
qualified conservation organization acquires real property for a project 
receiving Federal-aid highway funds, and there will be no use or 
recourse to the power of eminent domain, the limited requirements of 49 
CFR 24.101(a)(2) apply.
    (c) Property management. Real property acquired with TEA funds shall 
be managed in accordance with the property management requirements 
provided in subpart D of this part. Any use of the property for purposes 
other than that for which the TEA funds were provided must be consistent 
with the continuation of the original use. When the original use of the 
real property is converted by sale or lease to another use inconsistent 
with the original use, the STD shall assure that the fair market value 
or rent is charged and the proceeds reapplied to projects eligible under 
title 23 of the United States Code.


<R05>
Sec. 710.513  Environmental mitigation.

    (a) The acquisition and maintenance of land for wetlands mitigation, 
wetlands banking, natural habitat, or other appropriate environmental 
mitigation is an eligible cost under the Federal-aid program. FHWA 
participation in wetland mitigation sites and other mitigation banks is 
governed by 23 CFR part 777.
    (b) Environmental acquisitions or displacements by both public 
agencies and private parties are covered by the Uniform Act when they 
are the result of a program or project undertaken by a Federal agency or 
one that receives Federal financial assistance. This includes real 
property acquired for a wetland bank, or other environmentally related 
purpose, if it is to be used to mitigate impacts created by a Federal-
aid highway project.


<R04>
                  Subpart F_Federal Assistance Programs


<R05>
Sec. 710.601  Federal land transfer.

    (a) The provisions of this subpart apply to any project undertaken 
with funds for the National Highway System. When the FHWA determines 
that a strong Federal transportation interest exists, these provisions 
may also be applied to highway projects that are eligible for Federal-
aid under Chapters 1 and 2 of title 23, of the United States Code, and 
to highway-related transfers that are requested by a State in 
conjunction with a military base closure under the Defense Base Closure 
and Realignment Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-510, 104 Stat. 1808, as 
amended).
    (b) Sections 107(d) and 317 of title 23, of the United States Code 
provide for the transfer of lands or interests in lands owned by the 
United States to an STD or its nominee for highway purposes.
    (c) The STD may file an application with the FHWA, or can make 
application directly to the land-owning agency if the land-owning agency 
has its own authority for granting interests in land.
    (d) Applications under this section shall include the following 
information:
    (1) The purpose for which the lands are to be used;
    (2) The estate or interest in the land required for the project;
    (3) The Federal-aid project number or other appropriate references;
    (4) The name of the Federal agency exercising jurisdiction over the 
land and identity of the installation or activity in possession of the 
land;
    (5) A map showing the survey of the lands to be acquired;
    (6) A legal description of the lands desired; and
    (7) A statement of compliance with the National Environmental Policy 
Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332, et seq.) and any other applicable Federal 
environmental laws, including the National Historic Preservation Act (16 
U.S.C. 470(f)), and 23 U.S.C. 138.

[[Page 385]]

    (e) If the FHWA concurs in the need for the transfer, the land-
owning agency will be notified and a right-of-entry requested. The land-
owning agency shall have a period of four months in which to designate 
conditions necessary for the adequate protection and utilization of the 
reserve or to certify that the proposed appropriation is contrary to the 
public interest or inconsistent with the purposes for which such land or 
materials have been reserved. The FHWA may extend the four-month reply 
period at the timely request of the land-owning agency for good cause.
    (f) Deeds for conveyance of lands or interests in lands owned by the 
United States shall be prepared by the STD and certified by an attorney 
licensed within the State as being legally sufficient. Such deeds shall 
contain the clauses required by the FHWA and 49 CFR 21.7(a)(2). After 
the STD prepares the deed, it will submit the proposed deed with the 
certification to the FHWA for review and execution.
    (g) Following execution, the STD shall record the deed in the 
appropriate land record office and so advise the FHWA and the concerned 
agency.
    (h) When the need for the interest acquired under this subpart no 
longer exists, the STD must restore the land to the condition which 
existed prior to the transfer and must give notice to the FHWA and to 
the concerned Federal agency that such interest will immediately revert 
to the control of the Federal agency from which it was appropriated or 
to its assigns. Alternative arrangements may be made for the sale or 
reversion or restoration of the lands no longer required as part of a 
memorandum of understanding or separate agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 710.603  Direct Federal acquisition.

    (a) The provisions of this section apply to any land and or 
improvements needed in connection with any project on the Interstate 
System, defense access roads, public lands highways, park roads, 
parkways, Indian reservation roads, and projects performed by the FHWA 
in cooperation with Federal and State agencies. For projects on the 
Interstate System and defense access roads, the provisions of this part 
are applicable only where the State is unable to acquire the required 
right-of-way or is unable to obtain possession with sufficient 
promptness.
    (b) To enable the FHWA to make the necessary finding to proceed with 
the acquisition of the rights-of-way, the STDs written application for 
Federal acquisition shall include:
    (1) Justification for the Federal acquisition of the lands or 
interests in lands;
    (2) The date the FHWA authorized the STD to commence right-of-way 
acquisition, the date of the project agreement and a statement that the 
agreement contains the provisions required by 25 U.S.C. 111;
    (3) The necessity for acquisition of the particular lands under 
request;
    (4) A statement of the specific interests in lands to be acquired, 
including the proposed treatment of control of access;
    (5) The STDs intentions with respect to the acquisition, 
subordination, or exclusion of outstanding interests, such as minerals 
and utility easements, in connection with the proposed acquisition;
    (6) A statement on compliance with the provisions of part 771 of 
this chapter;
    (7) Adequate legal descriptions, plats, appraisals, and title data;
    (8) An outline of the negotiations which have been conducted by the 
STD with landowners;
    (9) An agreement that the STD will pay its pro rata share of costs 
incurred in the acquisition of, or the attempt to acquire rights-of-way; 
and
    (10) A statement that assures compliance with the applicable 
provisions of the Uniform Act. (42 U.S.C. 4601, et seq.)
    (c) If the landowner tenders a right-of-entry or other right of 
possession document required by State law any time before the FHWA makes 
a determination that the STD is unable to acquire the rights-of-way with 
sufficient promptness, the STD is legally obligated to accept such 
tender and the FHWA may not proceed with Federal acquisition.
    (d) If the STD obtains title to a parcel prior to the filing of the 
Declaration of Taking, it shall notify the

[[Page 386]]

FHWA and immediately furnish the appropriate U.S. Attorney with a 
disclaimer together with a request that the action against the landowner 
be dismissed (ex parte) from the proceeding and the estimated just 
compensation deposited into the registry of the court for the affected 
parcel be withdrawn after the appropriate motions are approved by the 
court.
    (e) When the United States obtains a court order granting possession 
of the real property, the FHWA shall authorize the STD to take over 
supervision of the property. The authorization shall include, but need 
not be limited to, the following:
    (1) The right to take possession of unoccupied properties;
    (2) The right to give 90 days notice to owners to vacate occupied 
properties and the right to take possession of such properties when 
vacated;
    (3) The right to permit continued occupancy of a property until it 
is required for construction and, in those instances where such 
occupancy is to be for a substantial period of time, the right to enter 
into rental agreements, as appropriate, to protect the public interest;
    (4) The right to request assistance from the U.S. Attorney in 
obtaining physical possession where an owner declines to comply with the 
court order of possession;
    (5) The right to clear improvements and other obstructions;
    (6) Instructions that the U.S. Attorney be notified prior to actual 
clearing, so as to afford him an opportunity to view the lands and 
improvements, to obtain appropriate photographs, and to secure 
appraisals in connection with the preparation of the case for trial;
    (7) The requirement for appropriate credits to the United States for 
any net salvage or net rentals obtained by the State, as in the case of 
right-of-way acquired by the State for Federal-aid projects; and
    (8) Instructions that the authority granted to the STD is not 
intended to preclude the U.S. Attorney from taking action, before the 
STD has made arrangements for removal, to reach a settlement with the 
former owner which would include provision for removal.
    (f) If the Federal Government initiates condemnation proceedings 
against the owner of real property in a Federal court and the final 
judgment is that the Federal agency cannot acquire the real property by 
condemnation, or the proceeding is abandoned, the court is required by 
law to award such a sum to the owner of the real property that in the 
opinion of the court provides reimbursement for the owner's reasonable 
costs, disbursements, and expenses, including reasonable attorney, 
appraisal, and engineering fees, actually incurred because of the 
condemnation proceedings.
    (g) As soon as practicable after the date of payment of the purchase 
price or the date of deposit in court of funds to satisfy the award of 
the compensation in a Federal condemnation, the FHWA shall reimburse the 
owner to the extent deemed fair and reasonable, the following costs:
    (1) Recording fees, transfer taxes, and similar expenses incidental 
to conveying such real property to the United States;
    (2) Penalty costs for prepayment of any preexisting recorded 
mortgage entered into in good faith encumbering such real property; and
    (3) The pro rata portion of real property taxes paid which are 
allocable to a period subsequent to the date of vesting title in the 
United States or the effective date of possession, whichever is the 
earlier.
    (h) The lands or interests in lands, acquired under this section, 
will be conveyed to the State or the appropriate political subdivision 
thereof, upon agreement by the STD, or said subdivision to:
    (1) Maintain control of access where applicable;
    (2) Accept title thereto;
    (3) Maintain the project constructed thereon;
    (4) Abide by any conditions which may set forth in the deed; and
    (5) Notify the FHWA at the appropriate time that all the conditions 
have been performed by the State.
    (i) The deed from the United States to the State, or to the 
appropriate political subdivision thereof, shall include the conditions 
required by 49 CFR part 21. The deed shall be recorded

[[Page 387]]

by the grantee in the appropriate land record office, and the FHWA shall 
be advised of the recording date.

                     Subpart G_Concession Agreements

    Authority: 23 U.S.C. 156 and 315; 23 CFR 1.32; 49 CFR 1.48.

    Source: 73 FR 77503, Dec. 19, 2008, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 710.701  Purpose.

    The purpose of this subpart is to prescribe the standards that 
ensure fair market value is received by a highway agency under 
concession agreements involving federally funded highways.


<R05>
Sec. 710.703  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart:
    (a) Best value means the proposal offering the most overall public 
benefits as determined through an evaluation of the amount of the 
concession payment and other appropriate considerations. Such other 
appropriate considerations may include, but are not limited to, 
qualifications and experience of the concessionaire, expected quality of 
services to be provided, the history or track record of the 
concessionaire in providing the services, timelines for the delivery of 
services, performance standards, complexity of the services to be 
rendered, and revenue sharing. Such appropriate considerations may also 
include, but are not limited to, policy considerations that are 
important, but not quantifiable, such as retaining the ability to amend 
the concession agreement if conditions change, having a desired level of 
oversight over the facility, ensuring a certain level of maintenance and 
operations for the facility, considerations relative to the structure 
and amount of the toll rates, economic development impacts and 
considerations, or social and environmental benefits and impacts.
    (b) Concession agreement means an agreement between a highway agency 
and a concessionaire under which the concessionaire is given the right 
to operate and collect revenues or fees for the use of a federally 
funded highway in return for compensation to be paid to the highway 
agency. A concession agreement may include, but not be limited to, 
obligations concerning the development, design, construction, 
maintenance, operation, level of service, and/or capital improvements to 
a facility over the term of the agreement. Concession agreement shall 
not include agreements between government entities, even when 
compensation is paid, where the primary purpose of the transaction is 
not commercial in nature but for the purpose of determining governmental 
ownership, control, jurisdiction, or responsibilities with respect to 
the operation of a federally funded highway. The highway agency's 
determination as to whether an agreement between government entities 
constitutes a concession agreement shall be controlling.
    (c) Concessionaire means any private or public entity that enters 
into a concession agreement with a highway agency.
    (d) Fair market value means the price at which a highway agency and 
concessionaire are ready and willing to enter into a concession 
agreement for a federally funded highway on, or as if in, the open 
market for a reasonable period of time and in an arm's length 
transaction to any willing, knowledgeable, and able buyer. For purposes 
of this subpart, a concession agreement based on best value shall be 
deemed fair market value.
    (e) Federally funded highway means any highway (including highways, 
bridges, and tunnels) acquired with Federal assistance made available 
from the Highway Trust Fund (other than the Mass Transit Account). A 
highway shall be deemed to be acquired with Federal assistance if 
Federal assistance participated in either the purchase of any real 
property, or in any capital expenditures in any fixtures located on real 
property, within the right-of-way, including the highway and any 
structures located upon the property.
    (f) Highway agency means any State transportation department or 
other public authority with jurisdiction over a federally funded 
highway.

[[Page 388]]


<R05>
Sec. 710.705  Applicability.

    This subpart applies to all concession agreements involving 
federally funded highways that are executed after January 18, 2009.


<R05>
Sec. 710.707  Fair market value.

    A highway agency shall receive fair market value for any concession 
agreement involving a federally funded highway.


<R05>
Sec. 710.709  Determination of fair market value.

    (a) Fair market value may be determined either on a best value 
basis, highest net present value of the payments to be received over the 
life of the agreement, or highest bid received, as may be specified by 
the highway agency in the request for proposals or other relevant 
solicitation. If best value is used, the highway agency should identify, 
in the relevant solicitation, the criteria to be used as well as the 
weight afforded to the criteria.
    (b) In order to be considered fair market value, the terms of the 
concession agreement must be both legally binding and enforceable.
    (c) Any concession agreement awarded pursuant to a competitive 
process with more than one bidder shall be deemed to be fair market 
value. Any concession agreement awarded pursuant to a competitive 
process with only one bidder shall be presumed to be fair market value. 
Such presumption may be overcome only if the highway agency determines 
the proposal to not be fair market value based on the highway agency's 
estimates. Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to require a 
highway agency to accept any proposal, even if the proposal is deemed 
fair market value. For purposes of this subsection, a competitive 
process shall afford all interested proposers an equal opportunity to 
submit a proposal for the concession agreement and shall comply with 
applicable State and local law.
    (d) If a concession agreement is not awarded pursuant to a 
competitive process, the highway agency must receive fair market value, 
as determined by the highway agency in accordance with State law, so 
long as an independent third party assessment is conducted and made 
publicly available.
    (e) Nothing in this subpart is intended to waive the requirements of 
part 172, part 635, and part 636 whenever any Federal-aid (including 
TIFIA assistance) is to be used for a project under the concession 
agreement.

85-381, 72 Stat. 95, hereinafter called the act, the Congress declared 
that:
    (1) To promote the safety, convenience, and enjoyment of public 
travel and the free flow of interstate commerce and to protect the 
public investment in the National System of Interstate and Defense 
Highways, hereinafter called the Interstate System, it is in the public 
interest to encourage and assist the States to control the use of and to 
improve areas adjacent to such system by controlling the erection and 
maintenance of outdoor advertising signs, displays, and devices adjacent 
to that system.
    (2) It is a national policy that the erection and maintenance of 
outdoor advertising signs, displays, or devices within 660 feet of the 
edge of the right-of-way and visible from the main-traveled way of all 
portions of the Interstate System constructed upon any part of right-of-
way, the entire width of which is acquired subsequent to July 1, 1956, 
should be regulated, consistent with national standards to be prepared 
and promulgated by the Secretary of Transportation.
    (b) The standards in this part are hereby promulgated as provided in 
the act.

vested in the public for right-of-way purposes under applicable Federal 
or State law.
    (b) Centerline of the highway means a line equidistant from the 
edges of the median separating the main-traveled ways of a divided 
Interstate Highway, or the centerline of the main-traveled way of a

which:
    (1) Is constructed upon any part of right-of-way, the entire width 
of which is acquired for right-of-way subsequent to July 1, 1956 (a 
portion shall be deemed so constructed if, within such portion, no line

 Subpart D_Outdoor Advertising (Acquisition of Rights of Sign and Sign 
                              Site Owners)

    Authority: 23 U.S.C. 131 and 315; 23 CFR 1.32 and 1.48(b).

    Source: 39 FR 27436, July 29, 1974, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 750.301  Purpose.

    To prescribe the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) policies 
relating to Federal participation in the costs of acquiring the property 
interests necessary for removal of nonconforming advertising signs, 
displays and devices on the Federal-aid Primary and Interstate Systems, 
including toll sections on such systems, regardless of whether Federal 
funds participated in the construction thereof. This regulation should 
not be construed to authorize any additional rights in eminent domain 
not already existing under State law or under 23 U.S.C. 131(g).


<R05>
Sec. 750.302  Policy.

    (a) Just compensation shall be paid for the rights and interests of 
the sign and site owner in those outdoor advertising signs, displays, or 
devices which are lawfully existing under State law, in conformance with 
the terms of 23 U.S.C. 131.
    (b)(1) Federal reimbursement will be made on the basis of 75 percent 
of the acquisition, removal and incidental costs legally incurred or 
obligated by the State.
    (2) Federal funds will participate in 100 percent of the costs of 
removal of those signs which were removed prior to January 4, 1975, by 
relocation, pursuant to the provisions of 23 CFR Sec. 750.305(a)(2), 
and which are required to be removed as a result of the amendments made 
to 23 U.S.C. 131 by the Federal-Aid Highway Amendments of 1974, Pub. L. 
93-643, section 109, January 4, 1975. Such signs must have been 
relocated to a legal site, must have been legally maintained since the 
relocation, and must not have been substantially changed, as defined by 
the State maintenance standards, issued pursuant to 23 CFR 750.707(b).

[[Page 397]]

    (c) Title III of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property 
Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. 4651, et seq.) applies 
except where complete conformity would defeat the purposes set forth in 
42 U.S.C. 4651, would impede the expeditious implementation of the sign 
removal program or would increase administrative costs out of proportion 
to the cost of the interests being acquired or extinguished.
    (d) Projects for the removal of outdoor advertising signs including 
hardship acquisitions should be programed and authorized in accordance 
with normal program procedures for right-of-way projects.

<R05>
Sec. 750.303  Definitions.

    (a) Sign. An outdoor sign, light, display, device, figure, painting, 
drawing, message, placard, poster, billboard or other thing which is 
designed, intended of the advertising or informative contents of which 
is visible from any place on the main-traveled way of the Interstate or 
Primary Systems, whether the same be permanent or portable installation.
    (b) Lease (license, permit, agreement, contract or easement). An 
agreement, oral or in writing, by which possession or use of land or 
interests therein is given by the owner or other person to another 
person for a specified purpose.
    (c) Leasehold value. The leasehold value is the present worth of the 
difference between the contractual rent and the current market rent at 
the time of the appraisal.
    (d) Illegal sign. One which was erected and/or maintained in 
violation of State law.
    (e) Nonconforming sign. One which was lawfully erected, but which 
does not comply with the provisions of State law or State regulations 
passed at a later date or which later fails to comply with State law or 
State regulations due to changed conditions. Illegally erected or 
maintained signs are not nonconforming signs.
    (f) 1966 inventory. The record of the survey of advertising signs 
and junkyards compiled by the State highway department.
    (g) Abandoned sign. One in which no one has an interest, or as 
defined by State law.


<R05>
Sec. 750.304  State policies and procedures.

    The State's written policies and operating procedures for 
implementing its sign removal program under State law and complying with 
23 U.S.C. 131 and its proposed time schedule for sign removal and 
procedure for reporting its accomplishments shall be submitted to the 
FHWA for approval within 90 days of the date of this regulation. This 
statement should be supported by the State's regulations implementing 
its program. Revisions to the State's policies and procedures shall be 
submitted to the FHWA for approval. The statement should contain 
provisions for the review of its policies and procedure to meet changing 
conditions, adoption of improved procedures, and for internal review to 
assure compliance. The statement shall include as a minimum the 
following:
    (a) Project priorities. The following order of priorities is 
recommended.
    (1) Illegal and abandoned signs.
    (2) Hardship situations.
    (3) Nominal value signs.
    (4) Signs in areas which have been designated as scenic under 
authority of State law.
    (5) Product advertising on:
    (i) Rural interstate highway.
    (ii) Rural primary highway.
    (iii) Urban areas.
    (6) Nontourist-oriented directional advertising.
    (7) Tourist-oriented directional advertising.
    (b) Programing. (1) A sign removal project may consist of any group 
of proposed sign removals. The signs may be those belonging to one 
company or those located along a single route, all of the signs in a 
single county or other locality, hardship situations, individually or 
grouped, such as those involving vandalized signs, or all of a sign 
owner's signs in a given State or area, or any similar grouping.
    (2) A project for sign removal on other than a Federal-aid primary 
route basis e.g., a countywide project or a project involving only signs 
owned by one company, should be identified as

[[Page 398]]

CAF-000B( ), continuing the numbering sequence which began with the sign 
inventory project in 1966.
    (3) Where it would not interfere with the State's operations, the 
State should program sign removal projects to minimize disruption of 
business.
    (c) Valuation and review methods--(1) Schedules--formulas. 
Schedules, formulas or other methods to simplify valuation of signs and 
sites are recommended for the purpose of minimizing administrative and 
legal expenses necessarily involved in determining just compensation by 
individual appraisals and litigation. They do not purport to be a basis 
for the determination of just compensation under eminent domain.
    (2) Appraisals. Where appropriate, the State may use its approved 
appraisal report forms including those for abbreviated or short form 
appraisals. Where a sign or site owner does not accept the amount 
computed under an approved schedule, formula, or other simplified 
method, an appraisal shall be utilized.
    (3) Leaseholds. When outdoor advertising signs and sign sites 
involve a leasehold value, the State's procedures should provide for 
determining value in the same manner as any other real estate leasehold 
that has value to the lessee.
    (4) Severance damages. The State has the responsibility of 
justifying the recognition of severance damages pursuant to 23 CFR 
710.304(h), and the law of the State before Federal participation will 
be allowed. Generally, Federal participation will not be allowed in the 
payment of severance damages to remaining signs, or other property of a 
sign company alleged to be due to the taking of certain of the company's 
signs. Unity of use of the separate properties, as required by 
applicable principles of eminent domain law, must be shown to exist 
before participation in severance damages will be allowed. Moreover, the 
value of the remaining signs or other real property must be diminished 
by virtue of the taking of such signs. Payments for severance damages to 
economic plants or loss of business profits are not compensable. 
Severance damage cases must be submitted to the FHWA for prior 
concurrence, together with complete legal and appraisal justification 
for payment of these damages. To assist the FHWA in its evaluation, the 
following data will accompany any submission regarding severance:
    (i) One copy of each appraisal in which this was analyzed. One copy 
of the State's review appraiser analysis and determination of market 
value.
    (ii) A plan or map showing the location of each sign.
    (iii) An opinion by the State highway department's chief legal 
officer that severance is appropriate in accordance with State law 
together with a legal opinion that, in the instant case, the damages 
constitute severance as opposed to consequential damage as a matter of 
law. The opinion shall include a determination, and the basis therefor, 
that the specific taking of some of an outdoor advertiser's signs 
constitutes a distinct economic unit, and that unity of use of the 
separate properties in conformity with applicable principles of eminent 
domain law had been satisfactorily established. A legal memorandum must 
be furnished citing and discussing cases and other authorities 
supporting the State's position.
    (5) Review of value estimates. All estimates of value shall be 
reviewed by a person other than the one who made the estimate. Appraisal 
reports shall be reviewed and approved prior to initiation of 
negotiations. All other estimates shall be reviewed before the agreement 
becomes final.
    (d) Nominal value plan. (1) This plan may provide for the removal 
costs of eligible nominal value signs and for payments up to $250 for 
each nonconforming sign, and up to $100 for each nonconforming sign 
site.
    (2) The State's procedures may provide for negotiations for sign 
sites and sign removals to be accomplished simultaneously without prior 
review.
    (3) Releases or agreements executed by the sign and/or site owner 
should include the identification of the sign, statement of ownership, 
price to be paid, interest acquired, and removal rights.
    (4) It is not expected that salvage value will be a consideration in 
most acquisitions; however, the State's procedures may provide that the 
sign may

[[Page 399]]

be turned over to the sign owner, site owner, contractor, or individual 
as all or a part of the consideration for its removal, without any 
project credits.
    (5) Programing and authorizations will be in accord with Sec. 
750.308 of this regulation. A detailed estimate of value of each 
individual sign is not necessary. The project may be programed and 
authorized as one project.
    (e) Sign removal. The State's procedural statement should include 
provision for:
    (1) Owner retention.
    (2) Salvage value.
    (3) State removal.

50 FR 34093, Aug. 23, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 750.305  Federal participation.

    (a) Federal funds may participate in:
    (1) Payments made to a sign owner for his right, title and interest 
in a sign, and where applicable, his leasehold value in a sign site, and 
to a site owner for his right and interest in a site, which is his right 
to erect and maintain the existing nonconforming sign on such site.
    (2) The cost of relocating a sign to the extent of the cost to 
acquire the sign, less salvage value if any.
    (3) A duplicate payment for the site owner's interest of $2,500 or 
less because of a bona fide error in ownership, provided the State has 
followed its title search procedures as set forth in its policy and 
procedure submission.
    (4) The cost of removal of signs, partially completed sign 
structures, supporting poles, abandoned signs and those which are 
illegal under State law within the controlled areas, provided such costs 
are incurred in accordance with State law. Removal may be by State 
personnel on a force account basis or by contract. Documentation for 
Federal participation in such removal projects should be in accord with 
the State's normal force account and contractual reimbursement 
procedures. The State should maintain a record of the number of signs 
removed. These data should be retained in project records and reported 
on the periodic report required under Sec. 750.308 of this regulation.
    (5) Signs materially damaged by vandals. Federal funds shall be 
limited to the Federal pro-rata share of the fair market value of the 
sign immediately before the vandalism occurred minus the estimated cost 
of repairing and reerecting the sign. If the State chooses, it may use 
its FHWA approved nominal value plan procedure to acquire these signs.
    (6) The cost of acquiring and removing completed sign structures 
which have been blank or painted out beyond the period of time 
established by the State for normal maintenance and change of message, 
provided the sign owner can establish that his nonconforming use was not 
abandoned or discontinued, and provided such costs are incurred in 
accordance with State law, or regulation. The evidence considered by the 
State as acceptable for establishing or showing that the nonconforming 
use has not been abandoned or voluntarily discontinued shall be set 
forth in the State's policy and procedures.
    (7) In the event a sign was omitted in the 1966 inventory, and the 
State supports a determination that the sign was in existence prior to 
October 22, 1965, the costs are eligible for Federal participation.
    (b) Federal funds may not participate in:
    (1) Cost of title certificates, title insurance, title opinion or 
similar evidence or proof of title in connection with the acquisition of 
a landowner's right to erect and maintain a sign or signs when the 
amount of payment to the landowner for his interest is $2,500 or less, 
unless required by State law. However, Federal funds may participate in 
the costs of securing some lesser evidence or proof of title such as 
searches and investigations by State highway department personnel to the 
extent necessary to determine ownership, affidavit of ownership by the 
owner, bill of sale, etc. The State's procedure for determining evidence 
of title should be set forth in the State's policy and procedure 
submission.
    (2) Payments to a sign owner where the sign was erected without 
permission of the property owner unless the sign owner can establish his 
legal right

[[Page 400]]

to erect and maintain the sign. However, such signs may be removed by 
State personnel on a force account basis or by contract with Federal 
participation except where the sign owner reimburses the State for 
removal.
    (3) Acquisition costs paid for abandoned or illegal signs, potential 
sign sites, or signs which were built during a period of time which 
makes them ineligible for compensation under 23 U.S.C. 131, or for 
rights in sites on which signs have been abandoned or illegally erected 
by a sign owner.
    (4) The acquisition cost of supporting poles or partially completed 
sign structures in nonconforming areas which do not have advertising or 
informative content thereon unless the owner can show to the State's 
satisfaction he has not abandoned the structure. When the State has 
determined the sign structure has not been abandoned, Federal funds will 
participate in the acquisition of the structure, provided the cost are 
incurred in accordance with State law.


<R05>
Sec. 750.306  Documentation for Federal participation.

    The following information concerning each sign must be available in 
the State's files to be eligible for Federal participation.
    (a) Payment to sign owner. (1) A photograph of the sign in place. 
Exceptions may be made in cases where in one transaction the State has 
acquired a number of a company's nominal value signs similar in size, 
condition and shape. In such cases, only a sample of representative 
photographs need be provided to document the type and condition of the 
signs.
    (2) Evidence showing the sign was nonconforming as of the date of 
taking.
    (3) Value documentation and proof of obligation of funds.
    (4) Satisfactory indication of ownership of the sign and compensable 
interest therein (e.g., lease or other agreement with the property 
owner, or an affidavit, certification, or other such evidence of 
ownership).
    (5) Evidence that the sign falls within one of the three categories 
shown in Sec. 750.302 of this regulation. The specific category should 
be identified.
    (6) Evidence that the right, title, or interest pertaining to the 
sign has passed to the State, or that the sign has been removed.
    (b) Payment to the site owner. (1) Evidence that an agreement has 
been reached between the State and owner.
    (2) Value documentation and proof of obligation of funds.
    (3) Satisfactory indication of ownership or compensable interest.
    (c) In those cases where Federal funds participate in 100 percent of 
the cost of removal, the State file shall contain the records of the 
relocation made prior to January 4, 1975.

may, if it desires, seek an exemption from the acquisition requirements 
of 23

[[Page 401]]

U.S.C. 131 for signs giving directional information about goods and 
services in the interest of the traveling public in defined areas which 
would suffer substantial economic hardship if such signs were removed. 
This exemption may be granted pursuant to the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 
131(o).


<R05>
Sec. 750.502  Applicability.

    The provisions of this subpart apply to signs adjacent to the 
Interstate and primary systems which are required to be controlled under

<R05>
Sec. 750.503  Exemptions.

    (a) The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) may approve a State's 
request to exempt certain nonconforming signs, displays, and devices 
(hereinafter called signs) within a defined area from being acquired 
under the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 131 upon a showing that removal would 
work a substantial economic hardship throughout that area. A defined 
area is an area with clearly established geographical boundaries defined 
by the State which the State can evaluate as an economic entity. Neither 
the States nor FHWA shall rely on individual claims of economic 
hardship. Exempted signs must:
    (1) Have been lawfully erected prior to May 5, 1976, and must 
continue to be lawfully maintained.
    (2) Continue to provide the directional information to goods and 
services offered at the same enterprise in the defined area in the 
interest of the traveling public that was provided on May 5, 1976. 
Repair and maintenance of these signs shall conform with the State's 
approved maintenance standards as required by subpart G of this part.
    (b) To obtain the exemption permitted by 23 U.S.C. 131(o), the State 
shall establish:
    (1) Its requirements for the directional content of signs to qualify 
the signs as directional signs to goods and services in the defined 
area.
    (2) A method of economic analysis clearly showing that the removal 
of signs would work a substantial economic hardship throughout the 
defined area.
    (c) In support of its request for exemption, the State shall submit 
to the FHWA:
    (1) Its requirements and method (see Sec. 750.503(b)).
    (2) The limits of the defined area(s) requested for exemption, a 
listing of signs to be exempted, their location, and the name of the 
enterprise advertised on May 5, 1976.
    (3) The application of the requirements and method to the defined 
areas, demonstrating that the signs provide directional information to 
goods and services of interest to the traveling public in the defined 
area, and that removal would work a substantial economic hardship in the 
defined area(s).
    (4) A statement that signs in the defined area(s) not meeting the 
exemption requirements will be removed in accordance with State law.
    (5) A statement that the defined area will be reviewed and evaluated 
at least every three (3) years to determine if an exemption is still 
warranted.
    (d) The FHWA, upon receipt of a State's request for exemption, shall 
prior to approval:
    (1) Review the State's requirements and methods for compliance with 
the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 131 and this subpart.
    (2) Review the State's request and the proposed exempted area for 
compliance with State requirements and methods.
    (e) Nothing herein shall prohibit the State from acquiring signs in 
the defined area at the request of the sign owner.
    (f) Nothing herein shall prohibit the State from imposing or 
maintaining stricter requirements.

<R05>
Sec. 750.701  Purpose.

    This subpart prescribes the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) 
policies and requirements relating to the effective control of outdoor 
advertising under 23 U.S.C. 131. The purpose of these policies and 
requirements is to assure that there is effective State control of 
outdoor advertising in areas adjacent to Interstate and Federal-aid 
primary highways. Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to prevent 
a State from establishing more stringent outdoor advertising control 
requirements along Interstate and Primary Systems than provided herein.


<R05>
Sec. 750.702  Applicability.

    The provisions of this subpart are applicable to all areas adjacent 
to the Federal-aid Interstate and Primary Systems, including toll 
sections thereof, except that within urban areas, these provisions apply 
only within 660 feet of the nearest edge of the right-of-way. These 
provisions apply regardless of whether Federal funds participated in the 
costs of such highways. The provisions of this subpart do not apply to 
the Federal-aid Secondary or Urban Highway System.


<R05>
Sec. 750.703  Definitions.

    The terms as used in this subpart are defined as follows:
    (a) Commercial and industrial zones are those districts established 
by the zoning authorities as being most appropriate for commerce, 
industry, or trade, regardless of how labeled. They are commonly 
categorized as commercial, industrial, business, manufacturing, highway 
service or highway business (when these latter are intended for highway-
oriented business), retail, trade, warehouse, and similar 
classifications.
    (b) Erect means to construct, build, raise, assemble, place, affix, 
attach, create, paint, draw, or in any other way bring into being or 
establish.
    (c) Federal-aid Primary Highway means any highway on the system 
designated pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 103(b).
    (d) Interstate Highway means any highway on the system defined in 
and designated, pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 103(e).
    (e) Illegal sign means one which was erected or maintained in 
violation of State law or local law or ordinance.
    (f) Lease means an agreement, license, permit, or easement, oral or 
in writing, by which possession or use of land or interests therein is 
given for a specified purpose, and which is a valid contract under the 
laws of a State.
    (g) Maintain means to allow to exist.
    (h) Main-traveled way means the traveled way of a highway on which 
through traffic is carried. In the case of a divided highway, the 
traveled way of each of the separate roadways for traffic in opposite 
directions is a main-traveled way. It does not include such facilities 
as frontage roads, turning roadways, or parking areas.
    (i) Sign, display or device, hereinafter referred to as ``sign,'' 
means an outdoor advertising sign, light, display, device, figure, 
painting, drawing, message, placard, poster, billboard, or other thing 
which is designed, intended, or used to advertise or inform, any part of 
the advertising or informative contents of which is visible from any 
place on the main-traveled way of the Interstate or Primary Systems, 
whether the same be permanent or portable installation.
    (j) State law means a State constitutional provision or statute, or 
an ordinance, rule or regulation, enacted or adopted by a State.
    (k) Unzoned area means an area where there is no zoning in effect. 
It does not include areas which have a rural zoning classification or 
land uses established by zoning variances or special exceptions.
    (l) Unzoned commercial or industrial areas are unzoned areas 
actually used for commercial or industrial purposes as defined in the 
agreements made between the Secretary, U.S. Department of Transportation 
(Secretary), and each State pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 131(d).
    (m) Urban area is as defined in 23 U.S.C. 101(a).
    (n) Visible means capable of being seen, wehter or not readable, 
without visual aid by a person of normal visual acuity.

Sec. 750.704  Statutory requirements.

    (a) 23 U.S.C. 131 provides that signs adjacent to the Interstate and 
Federal-

[[Page 403]]

aid Primary Systems which are visible from the main-traveled way and 
within 660 feet of the nearest edge of the right-of-way, and those 
additional signs beyond 660 feet outside of urban areas which are 
visible from the main-traveled way and erected with the purpose of their 
message being read from such main-traveled way, shall be limited to the 
following:
    (1) Directional and official signs and notice which shall conform to 
national standards promulgated by the Secretary in subpart B, part 750, 
chapter I, 23 CFR, National Standards for Directional and Official 
Signs;
    (2) Signs advertising the sale or lease of property upon which they 
are located;
    (3) Signs advertising activities conducted on the property on which 
they are located;
    (4) Signs within 660 feet of the nearest edge of the right-of-way 
within areas adjacent to the Interstate and Federal-aid Primary Systems 
which are zoned industrial or commercial under the authority of State 
law;
    (5) Signs within 660 feet of the nearest edge of the right-of-way 
within areas adjacent to the Interstate and Federal-aid Primary Systems 
which are unzoned commercial or industrial areas, which areas are 
determined by agreement between the State and the Secretary; and
    (6) Signs lawfully in existence on October 22, 1965, which are 
determined to be landmark signs.
    (b) 23 U.S.C. 131(d) provides that signs in Sec. 750.704(a) (4) and 
(5) must comply with size, lighting, and spacing requirements, to be 
determined by agreement between the State and the Secretary.
    (c) 23 U.S.C. 131 does not permit signs to be located within zoned 
or unzoned commercial or industrial areas beyond 660 feet of the right-
of-way adjacent to the Interstate or Federal-aid Primary System, outside 
of urban areas.
    (d) 23 U.S.C. 131 provides that signs not permitted under Sec. 
750.704 of this regulation must be removed by the State.


<R05>
Sec. 750.705  Effective control.

    In order to provide effective control of outdoor advertising, the 
State must:
    (a) Prohibit the erection of new signs other than those which fall 
under Sec. 750.704(a)(1) through (6);
    (b) Assure that signs erected under Sec. 750.704(a)(4) and (5) 
comply, at a minimum, with size, lighting, and spacing criteria 
contained in the agreement between the Secretary and the State;
    (c) Assure that signs erected under Sec. 750.704(a)(1) comply with 
the national standards contained in subpart B, part 750, chapter I, 23 
CFR;
    (d) Remove illegal signs expeditiously;
    (e) Remove nonconforming signs with just compensation within the 
time period set by 23 U.S.C. 131 (subpart D, part 750, chapter I, 23 
CFR, sets forth policies for the acquisition and compensation for such 
signs);
    (f) Assure that signs erected under Sec. 750.704(a)(6) comply with 
Sec. 750.710, Landmark Signs, if landmark signs are allowed;
    (g) Establish criteria for determining which signs have been erected 
with the purpose of their message being read from the main-traveled way 
of an Interstate or primary highway, except where State law makes such 
criteria unnecessary. Where a sign is erected with the purpose of its 
message being read from two or more highways, one or more of which is a 
controlled highway, the more stringent of applicable control 
requirements will apply;
    (h) Develop laws, regulations, and procedures to accomplish the 
requirements of this subpart;
    (i) Establish enforcement procedures sufficient to discover 
illegally erected or maintained signs shortly after such occurrence and 
cause their prompt removal; and
    (j) Submit regulations and enforcement procedures to FHWA for 
approval.

<R05>
Sec. 750.706  Sign control in zoned and unzoned commercial and industrial areas.

    The following requirements apply to signs located in zoned and 
unzoned commercial and industrial areas within 660 feet of the nearest 
edge of the right-of-way adjacent to the Interstate and Federal-aid 
primary highways.

[[Page 404]]

    (a) The State by law or regulation shall, in conformity with its 
agreement with the Secretary, set criteria for size, lighting, and 
spacing of outdoor advertising signs located in commercial or industrial 
zoned or unzoned areas, as defined in the agreement, adjacent to 
Interstate and Federal-aid primary highways. If the agreement between 
the Secretary and the State includes a grandfather clause, the criteria 
for size, lighting, and spacing will govern only those signs erected 
subsequent to the date specified in the agreement. The States may adopt 
more restrictive criteria than are presently contained in agreements 
with the Secretary.
    (b) Agreement criteria which permit multiple sign structures to be 
considered as one sign for spacing purposes must limit multiple sign 
structures to signs which are physically contiguous, or connected by the 
same structure or cross-bracing, or located not more than 15 feet apart 
at their nearest point in the case of back-to-back or ``V'' type signs.
    (c) Where the agreement and State law permits control by local 
zoning authorities, these controls may govern in lieu of the size, 
lighting, and spacing controls set forth in the agreement, subject to 
the following:
    (1) The local zoning authority's controls must include the 
regulation of size, of lighting and of spacing of outdoor advertising 
signs, in all commercial and industrial zones.
    (2) The regulations established by local zoning authority may be 
either more restrictive or less restrictive than the criteria contained 
in the agreement, unless State law or regulations require equivalent or 
more restrictive local controls.
    (3) If the zoning authority has been delegated, extraterritorial, 
jurisdiction under State law, and exercises control of outdoor 
advertising in commercial and industrial zones within this 
extraterritorial jurisdiction, control by the zoning authority may be 
accepted in lieu of agreement controls in such areas.
    (4) The State shall notify the FHWA in writing of those zoning 
jurisdictions wherein local control applies. It will not be necessary to 
furnish a copy of the zoning ordinance. The State shall periodically 
assure itself that the size, lighting, and spacing control provisions of 
zoning ordinances accepted under this section are actually being 
enforced by the local authorities.
    (5) Nothing contained herein shall relieve the State of the 
responsibility of limiting signs within controlled areas to commercial 
and industrial zones.


<R05>
Sec. 750.707  Nonconforming signs.

    (a) General. The provisions of Sec. 750.707 apply to nonconforming 
signs which must be removed under State laws and regulations 
implementing 23 U.S.C. 131. These provisions also apply to nonconforming 
signs located in commercial and industrial areas within 660 feet of the 
nearest edge of the right-of-way which come under the so-called 
grandfather clause contained in State-Federal agreements. These 
provisions do not apply to conforming signs regardless of when or where 
they are erected.
    (b) Nonconforming signs. A nonconforming sign is a sign which was 
lawfully erected but does not comply with the provisions of State law or 
State regulations passed at a later date or later fails to comply with 
State law or State regulations due to changed conditions. Changed 
conditions include, for example, signs lawfully in existence in 
commercial areas which at a later date become noncommercial, or signs 
lawfully erected on a secondary highway later classified as a primary 
highway.
    (c) Grandfather clause. At the option of the State, the agreement 
may contain a grandfather clause under which criteria relative to size, 
lighting, and spacing of signs in zoned and unzoned commercial and 
industrial areas within 660 feet of the nearest edge of the right-of-way 
apply only to new signs to be erected after the date specified in the 
agreement. Any sign lawfully in existence in a commercial or industrial 
area on such date may remain even though it may not comply with the 
size, lighting, or spacing criteria. This clause only allows an 
individual sign at its particular location for the duration of its 
normal life subject to customary maintenance. Preexisting signs covered 
by a grandfather clause, which do not comply with the agreement criteria

[[Page 405]]

have the status of nonconforming signs.
    (d) Maintenance and continuance. In order to maintain and continue a 
nonconforming sign, the following conditions apply:
    (1) The sign must have been actually in existence at the time the 
applicable State law or regulations became effective as distinguished 
from a contemplated use such as a lease or agreement with the property 
owner. There are two exceptions to actual existence as follows:
    (i) Where a permit or similar specific State governmental action was 
granted for the construction of a sign prior to the effective date of 
the State law or regulations and the sign owner acted in good faith and 
expended sums in reliance thereon. This exception shall not apply in 
instances where large numbers of permits were applied for and issued to 
a single sign owner, obviously in anticipation of the passage of a State 
control law.
    (ii) Where the State outdoor advertising control law or the Federal-
State agreement provides that signs in commercial and industrial areas 
may be erected within six (6) months after the effective date of the law 
or agreement provided a lease dated prior to such effective date was 
filed with the State and recorded within thirty (30) days following such 
effective date.
    (2) There must be existing property rights in the sign affected by 
the State law or regulations. For example, paper signs nailed to trees, 
abandoned signs and the like are not protected.
    (3) The sign may be sold, leased, or otherwise transferred without 
affecting its status, but its location may not be changed. A 
nonconforming sign removed as a result of a right-of-way taking or for 
any other reason may be relocated to a conforming area but cannot be 
reestablished at a new location as a nonconforming use.
    (4) The sign must have been lawful on the effective date of the 
State law or regulations, and must continue to be lawfully maintained.
    (5) The sign must remain substantially the same as it was on the 
effective date of the State law or regulations. Reasonable repair and 
maintenance of the sign, including a change of advertising message, is 
not a change which would terminate nonconforming rights. Each State 
shall develop its own criteria to determine when customary maintenance 
ceases and a substantial change has occurred which would terminate 
nonconforming rights.
    (6) The sign may continue as long as it is not destroyed, abandoned, 
or discontinued. If permitted by State law and reerected in kind, 
exception may be made for signs destroyed due to vandalism and other 
criminal or tortious acts.
    (i) Each state shall develop criteria to define destruction, 
abandonment and discontinuance. These criteria may provide that a sign 
which for a designated period of time has obsolete advertising matter or 
is without advertising matter or is in need of substantial repair may 
constitute abandonment or discontinuance. Similarly, a sign damaged in 
excess of a certain percentage of its replacement cost may be considered 
destroyed.
    (ii) Where an existing nonconforming sign ceases to display 
advertising matter, a reasonable period of time to replace advertising 
content must be established by each State. Where new content is not put 
on a structure within the established period, the use of the structure 
as a nonconforming outdoor advertising sign is terminated and shall 
constitute an abandonment or discontinuance. Where a State establishes a 
period of more than one (1) year as a reasonable period for change of 
message, it shall justify that period as a customary enforcement 
practice within the State. This established period may be waived for an 
involuntary discontinuance such as the closing of a highway for repair 
in front of the sign.
    (e) Just compensation. The States are required to pay just 
compensation for the removal of nonconforming lawfully existing signs in 
accordance with the terms of 23 U.S.C. 131 and the provisions of subpart 
D, part 750, chapter I, 23 CFR. The conditions which establish a right 
to maintain a nonconforming sign and therefore the right to compensation 
must pertain at the time it is acquired or removed.

[[Page 406]]


<R05>
Sec. 750.708  Acceptance of state zoning.

    (a) 23 U.S.C. 131(d) provide that signs ``may be erected and 
maintained within 660 feet of the nearest edge of the right-of-way 
within areas . . . which are zoned industrial or commercial under 
authority of State law.'' Section 131(d) further provides, ``The States 
shall have full authority under their own zoning laws to zone areas for 
commercial or industrial purposes, and the actions of the States in this 
regard will be accepted for the purposes of this Act.''
    (b) State and local zoning actions must be taken pursuant to the 
State's zoning enabling statute or constitutional authority and in 
accordance therewith. Action which is not a part of comprehensive zoning 
and is created primarily to permit outdoor advertising structures, is 
not recognized as zoning for outdoor advertising control purposes.
    (c) Where a unit of government has not zoned in accordance with 
statutory authority or is not authorized to zone, the definition of an 
unzoned commercial or industrial area in the State-Federal agreement 
will apply within that political subdivision or area.
    (d) A zone in which limited commercial or industrial activities are 
permitted as an incident to other primary land uses is not considered to 
be a commercial or industrial zone for outdoor advertising control 
purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 750.709  On-property or on-premise advertising.

    (a) A sign which consists solely of the name of the establishment or 
which identifies the establishment's principal or accessory products or 
services offered on the property is an on-property sign.
    (b) When a sign consists principally of brand name or trade name 
advertising and the product or service advertised is only incidental to 
the principal activity, or if it brings rental income to the property 
owner, it shall be considered the business of outdoor advertising and 
not an on-property sign.
    (c) A sale or lease sign which also advertises any product or 
service not conducted upon and unrelated to the business or selling or 
leasing the land on which the sign is located is not an on-property 
sign.
    (d) Signs are exempt from control under 23 U.S.C. 131 if they solely 
advertise the sale or lease of property on which they are located or 
advertise activities conducted on the property on which they are 
located. These signs are subject to regulation (subpart A, part 750, 
chapter I, 23 CFR) in those States which have executed a bonus 
agreement, 23 U.S.C. 131(j). State laws or regulations shall contain 
criteria for determining exemptions. These criteria may include:
    (1) A property test for determining whether a sign is located on the 
same property as the activity or property advertised; and
    (2) A purpose test for determining whether a sign has as its sole 
purpose the identification of the activity located on the property or 
its products or services, or the sale or lease of the property on which 
the sign is located.
    (3) The criteria must be sufficiently specific to curb attempts to 
improperly qualify outdoor advertising as ``on-property'' signs, such as 
signs on narrow strips of land contiguous to the advertised activity 
when the purpose is clearly to circumvent 23 U.S.C. 131.


<R05>
Sec. 750.710  Landmark signs.

    (a) 23 U.S.C. 131(c) permits the existence of signs lawfully in 
existence on October 22, 1965, determined by the State, subject to the 
approval of the Secretary, to be landmark signs, including signs on farm 
structures or natural surfaces, of historic or artistic significance, 
the preservation of which is consistent with the purpose of 23 U.S.C. 
131.
    (b) States electing to permit landmark signs under 23 U.S.C. 131(c) 
shall submit a one-time list to the Federal Highway Administration for 
approval. The list should identify each sign as being in the original 
1966 inventory. In the event a sign was omitted in the 1966 inventory, 
the State may submit other evidence to support a determination that the 
sign was in existence on October 22, 1965.
    (c) Reasonable maintenance, repair, and restoration of a landmark 
sign is permitted. Substantial change in size,

[[Page 407]]

lighting, or message content will terminate its exempt status.


<R05>
Sec. 750.711  Structures which have never displayed advertising material.

    Structures, including poles, which have never displayed advertising 
or informative content are subject to control or removal when 
advertising content visible from the main-traveled way is added or 
affixed. When this is done, an ``outdoor advertising sign'' has then 
been erected which must comply with the State law in effect on that 
date.


<R05>
Sec. 750.712  Reclassification of signs.

    Any sign lawfully erected after the effective date of a State 
outdoor advertising control law which is reclassified from legal-
conforming to nonconforming and subject to removal under revised State 
statutes or regulations and policy pursuant to this regulation is 
eligible for Federal participation in just compensation payments and 
other eligible costs.


<R05>
Sec. 750.713  Bonus provisions.

    23 U.S.C. 131(j) specifically provides that any State which had 
entered into a bonus agreement before June 30, 1965, will be entitled to 
remain eligible to receive bonus payments provided it continues to carry 
out its bonus agreement. Bonus States are not exempt from the other 
provisions of 23 U.S.C. 131. If a State elects to comply with both 
programs, it must extend controls to the Primary System, and continue to 
carry out its bonus agreement along the Interstate System except where 
23 U.S.C. 131, as amended, imposes more stringent requirements.

Sec. 751.1  Purpose.

    Pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 136, this part prescribes Federal Highway 
Administration [FHWA] policies and procedures relating to the exercise 
of effective control by the States of junkyards in areas adjacent to the 
Interstate and Federal-aid primary systems. Nothing in this part shall 
be construed to prevent a State from establishing more stringent 
junkyard control requirements than provided herein.

[40 FR 12260, Mar. 18, 1975]


<R05>
Sec. 751.3  Applicability.

    The provisions of this part are applicable to all areas within 1,000 
feet of the nearest edge of the right-of-way and visible from the main 
traveled way of all Federal-aid Primary and Interstate Systems 
regardless of whether Federal funds participated in the construction 
thereof, including toll sections of such highways. This part does not 
apply to the Urban System.


<R05>
Sec. 751.5  Policy.

    In carrying out the purposes of this part:
    (a) Emphasis should be placed on encouraging recycling of scrap and 
junk where practicable, in accordance with the National Environmental 
Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, et seq.);
    (b) Every effort should be made to screen nonconforming junkyards 
which are to continue as ongoing businesses; and
    (c) Nonconforming junkyards should be relocated only as a last 
resort.


<R05>
Sec. 751.7  Definitions.

    For purposes of this part, the following definitions shall apply:
    (a) Junkyard. (1) A Junkyard is an establishment or place of 
business which is maintained, operated or used for storing, keeping, 
buying, or selling

[[Page 408]]

junk, or for the maintenance or operation of an automobile graveyard. 
This definition includes scrap metal processors, auto-wrecking yards, 
salvage yards, scrap yards, autorecycling yards, used auto parts yards 
and temporary storage of automobile bodies and parts awaiting disposal 
as a normal part of a business operation when the business will 
continually have like materials located on the premises. The definition 
includes garbage dumps and sanitary landfills. The definition does not 
include litter, trash, and other debris scattered along or upon the 
highway, or temporary operations and outdoor storage of limited 
duration.
    (2) An Automobile Graveyard is an establishment or place of business 
which is maintained, used, or operated for storing, keeping, buying, or 
selling wrecked, scrapped, ruined, or dismantled motor vehicles or motor 
vehicle parts. Ten or more such vehicles will constitute an automobile 
graveyard.
    (3) An Illegal Junkyard is one which was established or is 
maintained in violation of State law.
    (4) A Nonconforming Junkyard is one which was lawfully established, 
but which does not comply with the provisions of State law or State 
regulations passed at a later date or which later fails to comply with 
State regulations due to changed conditions. Illegally established 
junkyards are not nonconforming junkyards.
    (b) Junk. Old or scrap metal, rope, rags, batteries, paper, trash, 
rubber, debris, waste, or junked, dismantled, or wrecked automobiles, or 
parts thereof.
    (c) Main traveled way. The traveled way of a highway on which 
through traffic is carried. In the case of a divided highway, the 
traveled way of each of the separated roadways for traffic in opposite 
directions is a main traveled way. It does not include such facilities 
as frontage roads, turning roadways, or parking areas.
    (d) Industrial zones. Those districts established by zoning 
authorities as being most appropriate for industry or manufacturing. A 
zone which simply permits certain industrial activities as an incident 
to the primary land use designation is not considered to be an 
industrial zone. The provisions of part 750, subpart G of this chapter 
relative to Outdoor Advertising Control shall apply insofar as 
industrial zones are concerned.
    (e) Unzoned industrial areas. An area where there is no zoning in 
effect and which is used primarily for industrial purposes as determined 
by the State and approved by the FHWA. An unzoned area cannot include 
areas which may have a rural zoning classification or land uses 
established by zoning variances or special exceptions.

[40 FR 8551, Feb. 28, 1975, as amended at 41 FR 9321, Mar. 4, 1976]


<R05>
Sec. 751.9  Effective control.

    (a) In order to provide effective control of junkyards located 
within 1,000 feet of Interstate and Federal-aid primary highways, the 
State must:
    (1) Require such junkyards located outside of zoned and unzoned 
industrial areas to be screened or located so as not to be visible from 
the main traveled way, or be removed from sight.
    (2) Require the screening or removal of nonconforming junkyards 
within a reasonable time, but no later than 5 years after the date the 
junkyard becomes nonconforming unless Federal funds are not available in 
adequate amounts to participate in the cost of such screening or removal 
as provided in 23 U.S.C. 136(j).
    (3) Prohibit the establishment of new junkyards unless they comply 
with the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (4) Expeditiously require junkyards which are illegally established 
or maintained to conform to the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section.
    (b) Sanitary landfills as described herein need not be screened to 
satisfy requirements of Title 23, U.S.C., but landscaping should be 
required when the fill has been completed and operations have ceased, 
unless the landfill area is to be used for immediate development 
purposes. A sanitary landfill, for the purposes of this part, is a 
method of disposing of refuse on land without creating a nuisance or 
hazards to public health or safety by utilizing the principles of 
engineering to confine the refuse to the smallest practical area, to 
reduce it to the smallest practical volume, and to cover it with a layer 
of

[[Page 409]]

earth at the conclusion of each day's operation or at such more frequent 
intervals as may be necessary.
    (c) The State shall have laws, rules, and procedures sufficient to 
provide effective control, to discover illegally established or 
maintained junkyards shortly after such occurrence, and to cause the 
compliance or removal of same promptly in accordance with State legal 
procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 751.11  Nonconforming junkyards.

    Subject to the provisions of Sec. 751.9 of this part, the following 
requirements for the maintenance and continuance of a nonconforming 
junkyard apply:
    (a) The junkyard must have been actually in existence at the time 
the State law or regulations became effective as distinguished from a 
contemplated use, except where a permit or similar specific State 
governmental action was granted for the establishment of a junkyard 
prior to the effective date of the State law or regulations, and the 
junkyard owner acted in good faith and expended sums in reliance 
thereon.
    (b) There must be existing property rights in the junkyard or junk 
affected by the State law or regulation. Abandoned junk and junkyards, 
worthless junk, and the like are not similarly protected.
    (c) If the location of a nonconforming junkyard is changed as a 
result of a right-of-way taking or for any other reason, it ceases to be 
a nonconforming junkyard, and shall be treated as a new junkyard at a 
new location.
    (d) The nonconforming junkyard must have been lawful on the 
effective date of the State law or regulations and must continue to be 
lawfully maintained.
    (e) The nonconforming junkyard may continue as long as it is not 
extended, enlarged, or changed in use. Once a junkyard has been made 
conforming, the placement of junk so that it may be seen above or beyond 
a screen, or otherwise becomes visible, shall be treated the same as the 
establishment of a new junkyard.
    (f) The nonconforming junkyard may continue as long as it is not 
abandoned, destroyed, or voluntarily discontinued. Each State should 
develop criteria to define these terms.


<R05>
Sec. 751.13  Control measures.

    (a) Consistent with the goals of the National Environmental Policy 
Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321), recycling of junk and scrap is to be 
encouraged to the greatest extent practicable in the implementation of 
the junkyard control program. Recycling should be considered in 
conjunction with other control measures. To facilitate recycling, junk 
or scrap should be moved to an automobile wrecker, or a scrap processor, 
or put to some other useful purpose.
    (b) Every effort shall be made to screen where the junkyard is to 
continue as an ongoing business. Screening may be accomplished by use of 
natural objects, landscaping plantings, fences, and other appropriate 
means, including relocating inventory on site to utilize an existing 
natural screen or a screenable portion of the site.
    (c) Where screening is used, it must, upon completion of the 
screening project, effectively screen the junkyard from the main 
traveled way of the highway on a year-round basis, and be compatible 
with the surroundings. Each State shall establish criteria governing the 
location, design, construction, maintenance, and materials used in 
fencing or screening.
    (d) A junkyard should be relocated only when other control measures 
are not feasible. Junkyards should be relocated to a site not visible 
from the highway or to an industrial area, and should not be relocated 
to residential, commercial, or other areas where foreseeable 
environmental problems may develop.
    (e) The State may develop and use other methods of operation to 
carry out the purposes of this directive, subject to prior FHWA 
approval.


<R05>
Sec. 751.15  Just compensation.

    (a) Just compensation shall be paid the owner for the relocation, 
removal, or disposal of junkyards lawfully established under State law, 
which are required to be removed, relocated, or disposed of pursuant to 
23 U.S.C. 136.
    (b) No rights to compensation accrue until a taking or removal has 
occurred. The conditions which establish a right

[[Page 410]]

to maintain and continue a nonconforming junkyard as provided in Sec. 
751.11 must pertain at the time of the taking or removal in order to 
establish a right to just compensation.


<R05>
Sec. 751.17  Federal participation.

    (a) Federal funds may participate in 75 percent of the costs of 
control measures incurred in carrying out the provisions of this part 
including necessary studies for particular projects, and the employment 
of fee landscape architects and other qualified consultants.
    (b) Where State control standards are more stringent than Federal 
control requirements along Interstate and primary highways, the FHWA may 
approve Federal participation in the costs of applying the State 
standards on a statewide basis. Where State standards require control of 
junkyards in zoned or unzoned industrial areas, Federal funds may 
participate only if such action will make an effective contribution to 
the character of the area as a whole and the cost is reasonable, but 
such projects should be deferred until the work in the areas where 
control is required has progressed well toward completion.
    (c) Generally, only costs associated with the acquisition of minimal 
real property interests, such as easements or temporary rights of entry, 
necessary to accomplish the purposes of this part are eligible for 
Federal participation. The State may request, on a case-by-case basis, 
participation in costs of other interests beyond the minimum necessary, 
including fee title.
    (d) Federal funds may participate in costs to correct the 
inadequacies of screening in prior control projects where the inadequacy 
is due to higher screening standards established in this part or due to 
changed conditions.
    (e) Federal funds may participate in the costs of moving junk or 
scrap to a recycling place of business, or in the case of junk with 
little or no recycling potential, to a site for permanent disposal. In 
the latter case, reasonable land rehabilitation costs or fees connected 
with the use of such a disposal site are also eligible. In a case where 
the acquisition of a permanent disposal site by the State would be the 
most economical method of disposal, Federal funds may participate in the 
net cost (cost of acquisition less a credit after disposal) of a site 
obtained for this purpose.
    (f) Federal funds may participate in control measure costs involved 
in any junkyard lawfully established or maintained under State law which 
is reclassified from conforming to nonconforming under revised State 
regulations and policy pursuant to this part.
    (g) Federal funds may participate in the costs of acquisition of a 
dwelling in exceptional cases where such acquisition is found necessary 
and in the public interest, and where acquisition of the dwelling can be 
accomplished without resort to eminent domain.
    (h) Federal funds shall not participate in:
    (1) Costs associated with the control of illegal junkyards except 
for removal by State personnel on a force account basis or by contract, 
or in costs of controlling junkyards established after the effective 
date of the State's compliance law except where a conforming junkyard 
later becomes nonconforming due to changed conditions;
    (2) Any costs associated with the acquisition of any dwelling or its 
related buildings if acquired through eminent domain in connection with 
the junkyard control program;
    (3) Costs of acquisition of interests or rights as a measure for 
prohibition or control of the establishment of future junkyards;
    (4) Costs of maintaining screening devices after they have been 
erected; or
    (5) Costs of screening junk which has been or will be removed as a 
part of a junkyard control project.


<R05>
Sec. 751.19  Documentation for Federal participation.

    The following information concerning each eligible junkyard must be 
available in the States' files to be eligible for Federal participation 
in the costs thereof:
    (a) Satisfactory evidence of ownership of the junk or junkyard or 
both.
    (b) Value or cost documentation (including separate interests if 
applicable) including proof of obligation or payment of funds.
    (c) Evidence that the necessary property interests have passed to 
the State

[[Page 411]]

and that the junk has been screened, relocated, removed or disposed of 
in accordance with the provisions of this part.
    (d) If a dwelling has been acquired by condemnation, evidence that 
the costs involved are not included in the State's claim for 
participation.

<R05>
Sec. 751.21  Relocation assistance.

    Relocation assistance benefits pursuant to 49 CFR part 24 are 
available for:
    (a) The actual reasonable moving expenses of the junk, actual direct 
loss of tangible personal property and actual reasonable expenses in 
searching for a replacement business or, if the eligibility requirements 
are met, a payment in lieu of such expenses.
    (b) Relocation assistance in locating a replacement business.
    (c) Moving costs of personal property from a dwelling and relocation 
assistance in locating a replacement dwelling, provided the acquisition 
of the real property used for the business causes a person to vacate a 
dwelling.
    (d) Replacement housing payments if the acquisition of the dwelling 
is found by FHWA to be necessary for the federally assisted junkyard 
control project.

<R05>
Sec. 751.23  Concurrent junkyard control and right-of-way projects.

    The State is encouraged to coordinate junkyard control and highway 
right-of-way projects. Expenses incurred in furtherance of concurrent 
projects shall be prorated between projects.


<R05>
Sec. 751.25  Programming and authorization.

    (a) Junkyard control projects shall be programmed in accordance with 
the provisions of part 630, subpart A of this chapter. Such projects may 
include one or more junkyards.
    (b) Authorization to proceed with a junkyard control project may be 
given when the State submits a written request to FHWA which includes 
the following:
    (1) The zoning and validation of the legal status of each junkyard 
on the project;
    (2) The control measures proposed for each junkyard including, where 
applicable, information relative to permanent disposal sites to be 
acquired by the State;
    (3) The real property interest to be acquired in order to implement 
the control measures;
    (4) Plans or graphic displays indicating the location of the 
junkyard relative to the highway, the 1,000 foot control lines, property 
ownership boundaries, the general location of the junk or scrap 
material, and any buildings, structures, or improvement involved; and
    (5) Where screening is to be utilized, the type of screening, and 
adequately detailed plans and cross sections, or other adequate graphic 
displays which illustrate the relationship of the motorist, the screen, 
and the material to be screened at critical points of view.

Sec. 752.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to furnish guidelines and prescribe 
policies regarding landscaping and scenic enhancement programs, safety 
rest areas, and scenic overlooks under 23 U.S.C. 319; information 
centers and systems

[[Page 412]]

under 23 U.S.C. 131(i); and vending machines in safety rest areas under 
23 U.S.C. 111.

[48 FR 38610, Aug. 25, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 752.2  Policy.

    (a) Highway esthetics is a most important consideration in the 
Federal-aid highway program. Highways must not only blend with our 
natural social, and cultural environment, but also provide pleasure and 
satisfaction in their use.
    (b) The FHWA will cooperate with State and local agencies and 
organizations to provide opportunities for the display of original works 
of art within the highway rights-of-way.
    (c) The development of the roadside to include landscape 
development, safety rest areas, and the preservation of valuable 
adjacent scenic lands is a necessary component of highway development. 
Planning and development of the roadside should be concurrent with or 
closely follow that of the highway. Further, the development of travel 
information centers and systems is encouraged as an effective method of 
providing necessary information to the traveling public.


<R05>
Sec. 752.3  Definitions.

    (a) Safety rest area. A roadside facility safely removed from the 
traveled way with parking and such facilities for the motorist deemed 
necessary for his rest, relaxation, comfort and information needs. The 
term is synonymous with ``rest and recreation areas.''
    (b) Scenic overlook. A roadside improvement for parking and other 
facilities to provide the motorist with a safe opportunity to stop and 
enjoy a view.
    (c) Information centers. Facilities located at safety rest areas 
which provide information of interest to the traveling public.
    (d) Information systems. Facilities located within the right-of-way 
which provide information of interest to the traveling public. An 
information system is not a sign, display or device otherwise permitted 
under 23 U.S.C. 131 or prohibited by any local, State or Federal law or 
regulation.
    (e) Landscape project. Any action taken as part of a highway 
construction project or as a separate action to enhance the esthetics of 
a highway through the placement of plant materials consistent with a 
landscape design plan. Seeding undertaken for erosion control and 
planting vegetation for screening purposes shall not constitute a 
landscaping project.

[43 FR 19390, May 5, 1978, as amended at 52 FR 34638, Sept. 14, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 752.4  Landscape development.

    (a) Landscape development, which includes landscaping projects and 
other highway planting programs within the right-of-way of all federally 
funded highways or on adjoining scenic lands, shall be in general 
comformity with accepted concepts and principles of highway landscaping 
and environmental design.
    (b) Landscape development should have provisions for plant 
establishment periods of a duration sufficient for expected survival in 
the highway environment. Normal 1-year plant establishment periods may 
be extended to 3-year periods where survival is considered essential to 
their function, such as junkyard screening or urban landscaping 
projects.
    (c) In urban areas new and major reconstructed highways and 
completed Interstate and expressway sections are to be landscaped as 
appropriate for the adjacent existing or planned environment.
    (d) In rural areas new and major reconstructed highways should be 
landscaped as appropriate for the adjacent environment. Planning should 
include the opportunity for natural regeneration of native growth and 
the management of that growth.
    (e) Landscaping projects shall include the planting of native 
wildflower seeds or seedlings or both, unless a waiver is granted as 
provided in Sec. 752.11(b).

[43 FR 19390, May 5, 1978, as amended at 52 FR 34638, Sept. 14, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 752.5  Safety rest areas.

    (a) Safety rest areas should provide facilities reasonably necessary 
for the comfort, convenience, relaxation, and information needs of the 
motorist. Caretakers' quarters may be provided in conjunction with a 
safety rest area

[[Page 413]]

at such locations where accommodations are deemed necessary. All 
facilities within the rest area are to provide full consideration and 
accommodation for the handicapped.
    (b) The State may permit the placement of vending machines in 
existing or new safety rest areas located on the rights-of-way of the 
Interstate system for the purpose of dispensing such food, drink, or 
other articles as the State determines are appropriate and desirable, 
except that the dispensing by any means, of petroleum products or motor 
vehicle replacement parts shall not be allowed. Such vending machines 
shall be operated by the State.
    (c) The State may operate the vending machines directly or may 
contract with a vendor for the installation, operation, and maintenance 
of the vending machines. In permitting the placement of vending machines 
the State shall give priority to vending machines which are operated 
through the State licensing agency designated pursuant to section 
2(a)(5) of the Randolph-Sheppard Act, U.S.C. 107(a)(5).
    (d) Access from the safety rest areas to adjacent publicly owned 
conservation and recreation areas may be permitted if access to these 
areas is only available through the rest area and if these areas or 
their usage does not adversely affect the facilities of the safety rest 
area.
    (e) The scenic quality of the site, its accessibility and 
adaptability, and the availability of utilities are the prime 
considerations in the selection of rest area sites. A statewide safety 
rest area system plan should be maintained. This plan should include 
development priorities to ensure safety rest areas will be constructed 
first at locations most needed by the motorist. Proposals for safety 
rest areas or similar facilities on Federal-aid highways in suburban or 
urban areas shall be special case and must be fully justified before 
being authorized by the FHWA Regional Administrator.
    (f) Facilities within newly constructed safety rest areas should 
meet the forecast needs of the design year. Expansion and modernization 
of older existing rest areas that do not provide adequate service should 
be considered.
    (g) No charge to the public may be made for goods and services at 
safety rest areas except for telephone and articles dispensed by vending 
machines.

[43 FR 19390, May 5, 1978, as amended at 48 FR 38611, Aug. 25, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 752.6  Scenic overlooks.

    Scenic overlooks shall be located and designed as appropriate to the 
site and the scenic view with consideration for safety, access, and 
convenience of the motorist. Scenic overlooks may provide facilities 
equivalent to those provided in safety rest area.


<R05>
Sec. 752.7  Information centers and systems.

    (a) The State may establish at existing or new safety rest areas 
information centers for the purpose of providing specific information to 
the motorist as to services, as to places of interest within the State 
and such other information as the State may consider desirable.
    (b) The State may construct and operate the facilities, may 
construct and lease the operation of information facilities, or may 
lease the construction and operation of information facilities.
    (c) Where the information center or system includes an enclosed 
building, the identification of the operator and all advertising must be 
restricted to the interior of the building. Where a facility is in the 
nature of a bulletin board or partial enclosure, none of the 
advertising, including the trade name, logo, or symbol of the operator 
shall be legible from the main traveled way.
    (d) Subject to FHWA approval, States may establish or permit 
information systems within the right-of-way of federally funded highways 
which provide information of specific interest to the traveling public 
which do not visually intrude upon the main-traveled way of the highway 
in a manner violating 23 U.S.C. 131 and other applicable local, State, 
and Federal laws, rules, and regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 752.8  Privately operated information centers and systems.

    (a) Subject to the FHWA Regional Administrator's approval of the 
lease or agreement, the State may permit privately operated information 
centers

[[Page 414]]

and systems which conform with the standards of this directive.
    (b) There shall be no violation of control of access, and no adverse 
effect on traffic in the main traveled way.
    (c) The agreement between the State and the private operator shall 
provide that:
    (1) The State shall have title to the information center or system 
upon completion of construction or termination of the lease.
    (2) Advertising must be limited to matters relating to and of 
interest to the traveling public.
    (3) Equal access must be provided at reasonable rates to all 
advertisers considered qualified by the State.
    (4) Forty percent or more of all display areas and audible 
communications shall be devoted free of charge to providing information 
to the traveling public and public service announcements.
    (5) No charge to the public may be made for goods or services except 
telephone and articles dispensed by vending machines.
    (6) Nondiscrimination provisions must be included in accordance with 
the State assurance with regard to 42 U.S.C. 2000d--2000d-5 (Civil 
Rights Act of 1964). The private operator may not permit advertising 
from advertisers who do not provide their services without regard to 
race, color, or national origin.
    (7) The center or system shall be adequately maintained and kept 
clean and sanitary.
    (8) The State may promulgate reasonable rules and regulations on the 
conduct of the information center or system in the interests of the 
public.
    (9) The State may terminate the lease or agreement for violation of 
its terms or for other cause.

<R05>
Sec. 752.9  Scenic lands.

    (a) Acquisition of interests in and improvement of strips of land or 
water areas adjacent to Federal-aid highways may be made as necessary 
for restoration, preservation, and enhancement of scenic beauty.
    (b) Scenic strip interests may be acquired in urban or rural areas, 
combined in one or more projects, authorized separately whether or not 
there is or has been a Federal-aid project on the adjoining Federal-aid 
highway.
    (c) Approval of acquisition and development of scenic strips on 
completed Interstate should be conditioned on a showing that the 
acquisition of scenic strips was considered under the Highway 
Beautification Program for that particular section of Interstate.


<R05>
Sec. 752.10  Abandoned vehicles.

    (a) Abandoned motor vehicles may be removed from the right-of-way 
and from private lands adjacent to Federal-aid highways for the 
restoration, preservation, or enhancement of scenic beauty as seen from 
the traveled way of the highway as a landscape or roadside development 
project.
    (b) The State shall obtain permission or sufficient legal authority 
to go on private land to carry out this program. Where feasible, an 
agreement should be made with the owner that he will not in the future 
place junk, or allow junk to be placed, on his land so as to create an 
eyesore to the traveling public. The permission or authority and the 
agreement may be informal.
    (c) The collection of abandoned motor vehicles from within the 
right-of-way must be a development project and not a maintenance 
operation. Once a State completes a development project for the removal 
of abandoned motor vehicles from within the highway right-of-way, it is 
obligated to continue the removal of future abandoned motor vehicles 
from within the development project limits without further 
participation.


<R05>
Sec. 752.11  Federal participation.

    (a) Federal-aid highway funds, but generally excluding Interstate 
construction funds, are available for landscape development; for the 
acquisition and development of safety rest areas, scenic overlooks, and 
scenic lands; for the development of information centers and systems; 
and for the removal of abandoned motor vehicles.
    (b) Federal-aid highway funds may participate in any landscaping 
project undertaken pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section provided 
that at least

[[Page 415]]

one-quarter of one percent of funds expended for such landscaping 
project is used to plant native wildflower seeds or seedlings or both. 
The Administrator may, upon the request of a State highway agency, grant 
a waiver to this requirement provided the State certifies that:
    (1) Native wildflowers or seedlings cannot be grown satisfactorily; 
or
    (2) There is a scarcity of available planting areas; or
    (3) The available planting areas will be used for agricultural 
purposes.
    (c) Subject to the requirement of paragraph (b) of this section, 
Federal-aid highway funds may participate in plant establishment periods 
in or associated with landscape development.
    (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, 
Federal-aid highway funds may participate in the planting of flowering 
materials, including native wildflowers, donated by garden clubs and 
other organizations or individuals.
    (e) The value of donated plant materials shall not count toward the 
one-quarter of one percent minimum expenditure required by paragraph (b) 
of this section.
    (f) Federal-aid funds may not be used for assemblage, printing, or 
distribution of information materials; for temporary or portable 
information facilities; or for installation, operation, or maintenance 
of vending machines.

    (b) Alternative courses of action be evaluated and decisions be made 
in the best overall public interest based upon a balanced consideration 
of the need for safe and efficient transportation; of the social, 
economic, and environmental impacts of the proposed transportation 
improvement; and of national, State, and local environmental protection 
goals.
    (c) Public involvement and a systematic interdisciplinary approach 
be essential parts of the development process for proposed actions.
    (d) Measures necessary to mitigate adverse impacts be incorporated 
into the action. Measures necessary to mitigate adverse impacts are 
eligible for Federal funding when the Administration determines that:
    (1) The impacts for which the mitigation is proposed actually result 
from the Administration action; and
    (2) The proposed mitigation represents a reasonable public 
expenditure after considering the impacts of the action and the benefits 
of the proposed mitigation measures. In making this determination, the 
Administration will consider, among other factors, the extent to which 
the proposed measures would assist in complying with a Federal statute, 
Executive Order, or Administration regulation or policy.
    (e) Costs incurred by the applicant for the preparation of 
environmental documents requested by the Administration be eligible for 
Federal assistance.
    (f) No person, because of handicap, age, race, color, sex, or 
national origin, be excluded from participating in, or denied benefits 
of, or be subject to discrimination under any Administration program or

or FTA in carrying out responsibilities delegated or assigned to the 
State in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 325, 326, or 327, or other applicable 
law.
    (e) Section 4(f). Refers to 49 U.S.C. 303 and 23 U.S.C. 138. \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Section 4(f), which protected certain public lands and all 
historic sites, technically was repealed in 1983 when it was codified, 
without substantive change, as 49 U.S.C. 303. This regulation continues 
to refer to section 4(f) because it would create needless confusion to 
do otherwise; the policies section 4(f) engendered are widely referred 
to as ``section 4(f)'' matters. A provision with the same meaning is 
found at 23 U.S.C. 138 and applies only to FHWA actions.

    (f) Applicant. Any State, local, or federally-recognized Indian 
tribal governmental unit that requests funding approval or other action 
by the Administration and that the Administration works with to conduct 
environmental studies and prepare environmental review documents. When 
another Federal agency, or the Administration itself, is implementing 
the action, then the lead agencies (as defined in this regulation) may 
assume the responsibilities of the applicant in this part. If there is 
no applicant, then the Federal lead agency will assume the 
responsibilities of the applicant in this part.
    (g) Lead agencies. The Administration and any other agency 
designated to serve as a joint lead agency with the Administration under 
23 U.S.C. 139(c)(3) or under the CEQ regulation.
    (h) Participating agency. A Federal, State, local, or federally-
recognized Indian tribal governmental unit that may have an interest in 
the proposed project and has accepted an invitation to be a 
participating agency, or, in the case of a Federal agency, has not 
declined the invitation in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 139(d)(3).
    (i) Project sponsor. The Federal, State, local, or federally-
recognized Indian tribal governmental unit, or other entity, including 
any private or public-private entity that seeks an Administration 
action.

<R05>
Sec. 771.109  Applicability and responsibilities.

    (a)(1) The provisions of this regulation and the CEQ regulation 
apply to actions where the Administration exercises sufficient control 
to condition the permit or project approval. Actions taken by the 
applicant which do not require Federal approvals, such as preparation of 
a regional transportation plan are not subject to this regulation.
    (2) This regulation does not apply to, or alter approvals by the 
Administration made prior to the effective date of this regulation.
    (3) Environmental documents accepted or prepared after the effective 
date of this regulation shall be developed in accordance with this 
regulation.
    (b) It shall be the responsibility of the applicant, in cooperation 
with the Administration to implement those mitigation measures stated as 
commitments in the environmental documents prepared pursuant to this 
regulation. The FHWA will assure that this is accomplished as a part of 
its program management responsibilities that include reviews of designs, 
plans, specifications, and estimates (PS&E), and construction 
inspections. The FTA will assure implementation of committed mitigation 
measures through incorporation by reference in the grant agreement, 
followed by reviews of designs and contruction inspections.
    (c) The following roles and responsibilities apply during the 
environmental review process:
    (1) The lead agencies are responsible for managing the environmental 
review process and the preparation of the appropriate environmental 
review documents.
    (2) Any applicant that is a State or local governmental entity that 
is, or is expected to be, a direct recipient of funds under title 23, 
U.S. Code, or chapter 53 of title 49 U.S. Code, for the action shall 
serve as a joint lead agency with the Administration in accordance with 
23 U.S.C. 139, and may prepare environmental review documents if the 
Administration furnishes guidance and independently evaluates the 
documents.
    (3) The Administration may invite other Federal, State, local, or 
federally-recognized Indian tribal governmental units to serve as joint 
lead agencies in accordance with the CEQ regulation. If the applicant is 
serving as a joint lead agency under 23 U.S.C. 139(c)(3), then the 
Administration and the applicant will decide jointly which other 
agencies to invite to serve as joint lead agencies.
    (4) When the applicant seeks an Administration action other than the 
approval of funds, the role of the applicant will be determined by the 
Administration in accordance with the CEQ regulation and 23 U.S.C. 139.
    (5) Regardless of its role under paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(4) of 
this section, a public agency that has statewide jurisdiction (for 
example, a State highway agency or a State department

[[Page 418]]

of transportation) or a local unit of government acting through a 
statewide agency, that meets the requirements of section 102(2)(D) of 
NEPA, may prepare the EIS and other environmental review documents with 
the Administration furnishing guidance, participating in the 
preparation, and independently evaluating the document. All FHWA 
applicants qualify under this paragraph.
    (6) The role of a project sponsor that is a private institution or 
firm is limited to providing technical studies and commenting on 
environmental review documents.
    (d) When entering into Federal-aid project agreements pursuant to 23 
U.S.C. 106, it shall be the responsibility of the State highway agency 
to ensure that the project is constructed in accordance with and 
incorporates all committed environmental impact mitigation measures 
listed in approved environmental review documents unless the State 
requests and receives written FHWA approval to modify or delete such 
mitigation features.

<R05>
Sec. 771.111  Early coordination, public involvement, and project development.

    (a)(1) Early coordination with appropriate agencies and the public 
aids in determining the type of environmental review documents an action 
requires, the scope of the document, the level of analysis, and related 
environmental requirements. This involves the exchange of information 
from the inception of a proposal for action to preparation of the 
environmental review documents. Applicants intending to apply for funds 
should notify the Administration at the time that a project concept is 
identified. When requested, the Administration will advise the 
applicant, insofar as possible, of the probable class of action and 
related environmental laws and requirements and of the need for specific 
studies and findings which would normally be developed concurrently with 
the environmental review documents.
    (2) The information and results produced by, or in support of, the 
transportation planning process may be incorporated into environmental 
review documents in accordance with 40 CFR 1502.21 and 23 CFR 450.212 or 
450.318.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ On February 14, 2007, FHWA and FTA issued guidance on 
incorporating products of the planning process into NEPA documents as 
Appendix A of 23 CFR part 450. This guidance, titled ``Linking the 
Transportation Planning and NEPA Processes,'' is available on the FHWA 
Web site at http://www.fhwa.dot.gov or in hard copy upon request.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) The Administration will identify the probable class of action as 
soon as sufficient information is available to identify the probable 
impacts of the action.
    (c) When both the FHWA and FTA are involved in the development of a 
project, or when the FHWA or FTA acts as a joint lead agency with 
another Federal agency, a mutually acceptable process will be 
established on a case-by-case basis.
    (d) During the early coordination process, the lead agencies may 
request other agencies having an interest in the action to participate, 
and must invite such agencies if the action is subject to the project 
development procedures in 23 U.S.C. 139.\4\ Agencies with special 
expertise may be invited to become cooperating agencies. Agencies with 
jurisdiction by law must be requested to become cooperating agencies.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ The FHWA and FTA have developed guidance on 23 U.S.C. Section 
139 titled ``SAFETEA-LU Environmental Review Process: Final Guidance,'' 
November 15, 2006, and available at http://www.fhwa.dot.gov or in hard 
copy upon request.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) Other States, and Federal land management entities, that may be 
significantly affected by the action or by any of the alternatives shall 
be notified early and their views solicited by the applicant in 
cooperation with the Administration. The Administration will prepare a 
written evaluation of any significant unresolved issues and furnish it 
to the applicant for incorporation into the environmental assessment 
(EA) or draft EIS.
    (f) In order to ensure meaningful evaluation of alternatives and to 
avoid

[[Page 419]]

commitments to transportation improvements before they are fully 
evaluated, the action evaluated in each EIS or finding of no significant 
impact (FONSI) shall:
    (1) Connect logical termini and be of sufficient length to address 
environmental matters on a broad scope;
    (2) Have independent utility or independent significance, i.e., be 
usable and be a reasonable expenditure even if no additional 
transportation improvements in the area are made; and
    (3) Not restrict consideration of alternatives for other reasonably 
foreseeable transportation improvements.
    (g) For major transportation actions, the tiering of EISs as 
discussed in the CEQ regulation (40 CFR 1502.20) may be appropriate. The 
first tier EIS would focus on broad issues such as general location, 
mode choice, and areawide air quality and land use implications of the 
major alternatives. The second tier would address site-specific details 
on project impacts, costs, and mitigation measures.
    (h) For the Federal-aid highway program:
    (1) Each State must have procedures approved by the FHWA to carry 
out a public involvement/public hearing program pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 
128 and 139 and CEQ regulation.
    (2) State public involvement/public hearing procedures must provide 
for:
    (i) Coordination of public involvement activities and public 
hearings with the entire NEPA process.
    (ii) Early and continuing opportunities during project development 
for the public to be involved in the identification of social, economic, 
and environmental impacts, as well as impacts associated with relocation 
of individuals, groups, or institutions.
    (iii) One or more public hearings or the opportunity for hearing(s) 
to be held by the State highway agency at a convenient time and place 
for any Federal-aid project which requires significant amounts of right-
of-way, substantially changes the layout or functions of connecting 
roadways or of the facility being improved, has a substantial adverse 
impact on abutting property, otherwise has a significant social, 
economic, environmental or other effect, or for which the FHWA 
determines that a public hearing is in the public interest.
    (iv) Reasonable notice to the public of either a public hearing or 
the opportunity for a public hearing. Such notice will indicate the 
availability of explanatory information. The notice shall also provide 
information required to comply with public involvement requirements of 
other laws, Executive orders, and regulations.
    (v) Explanation at the public hearing of the following information, 
as appropriate:
    (A) The project's purpose, need, and consistency with the goals and 
objectives of any local urban planning,
    (B) The project's alternatives, and major design features,
    (C) The social, economic, environmental, and other impacts of the 
project,
    (D) The relocation assistance program and the right-of-way 
acquisition process.
    (E) The State highway agency's procedures for receiving both oral 
and written statements from the public.
    (vi) Submission to the FHWA of a transcript of each public hearing 
and a certification that a required hearing or hearing opportunity was 
offered. The transcript will be accompanied by copies of all written 
statements from the public, both submitted at the public hearing or 
during an announced period after the public hearing.
    (vii) An opportunity for public involvement in defining the purpose 
and need and the range of alternatives, for any action subject to the 
project development procedures in 23 U.S.C. 139.
    (viii) Public notice and an opportunity for public review and 
comment on a Section 4(f) de minimis impact finding, in accordance with 
49 U.S.C. 303(d).\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ The FHWA and FTA have developed guidance on Section 4(f) de 
minimis impact findings titled ``Guidance for Determining De Minimis 
Impacts to Section 4(f) Resources,'' December 13, 2005, which is 
available at http://www.fhwa.dot.gov or in hard copy upon request.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) Based on the reevaluation of project environmental documents 
required by Sec. 771.129, the FHWA and the State highway agency will 
determine whether changes in the project or new

[[Page 420]]

information warrant additional public involvement.
    (4) Approvals or acceptances of public involvement/public hearing 
procedures prior to the publication date of this regulation remain 
valid.
    (i) Applicants for capital assistance in the FTA program achieve 
public participation on proposed projects by holding public hearings and 
seeking input from the public through the scoping process for 
environmental review documents. For projects requiring EISs, an early 
opportunity for public involvement in defining the purpose and need for 
action and the range of alternatives must be provided, and a public 
hearing will be held during the circulation period of the draft EIS. For 
other projects that substantially affect the community or its public 
transportation service, an adequate opportunity for public review and 
comment must be provided, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 5323(b).
    (j) Information on the FTA environmental process may be obtained 
from: Director, Office of Human and Natural Environment, Federal Transit 
Administration, Washington, DC 20590. Information on the FHWA 
environmental process may be obtained from: Director, Office of Project 
Development and Environmental Review, Federal Highway Administration, 
Washington, DC 20590.

<R05>
Sec. 771.113  Timing of Administration activities.

    (a) The lead agencies, in cooperation with the applicant (if not a 
lead agency), will perform the work necessary to complete a finding of 
no significant impact (FONSI) or a record of decision (ROD) and comply 
with other related environmental laws and regulations to the maximum 
extent possible during the NEPA process. This work includes 
environmental studies, related engineering studies, agency coordination 
and public involvement. However, final design activities, property 
acquisition, purchase of construction materials or rolling stock, or 
project construction shall not proceed until the following have been 
completed, except as otherwise provided in law or in paragraph (d) of 
this section:
    (1)(i) The action has been classified as a categorical exclusion 
(CE), or
    (ii) A FONSI has been approved, or
    (iii) A final EIS has been approved and available for the prescribed 
period of time and a record of decision has been signed;
    (2) For actions proposed for FHWA funding, the Administration has 
received and accepted the certifications and any required public hearing 
transcripts required by 23 U.S.C. 128;
    (3) For activities proposed for FHWA funding, the programming 
requirements of 23 CFR part 450, subpart B, and 23 CFR part 630, subpart 
A, have been met.
    (b) Completion of the requirements set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) 
and (2) of this section is considered acceptance of the general project 
location and concepts described in the environmental review documents 
unless otherwise specified by the approving official.
    (c) Letters of Intent issued under the authority of 49 U.S.C. 
5309(g) are used by FTA to indicate an intention to obligate future 
funds for multi-year capital transit projects. Letters of Intent will 
not be issued by FTA until the NEPA process is completed.
    (d) The prohibition in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is limited 
by the following exceptions:
    (1) Exceptions for hardship and protective acquisitions of real 
property are addressed in paragraph (d)(12) of Sec. 771.117.
    (2) Paragraph (d)(13) of Sec. 771.117 contains an exception for the 
acquisition of pre-existing railroad right-of-way for future transit use 
in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 5324(c).
    (3) FHWA regulations at 23 CFR 710.503 establish conditions for FHWA 
approval of Federal-aid highway funding for hardship and protective 
acquisitions.
    (4) FHWA regulations at 23 CFR 710.501 address early acquisition of 
right-of-way by a State prior to the execution of a project agreement 
with the FHWA or completion of NEPA. In paragraphs (b) and (c) of Sec. 
710.501, the regulation establishes conditions governing subsequent 
requests for Federal-

[[Page 421]]

aid credit or reimbursement for the acquisition. Any State-funded early 
acquisition for a Federal-aid highway project where there will not be 
Federal-aid highway credit or reimbursement for the early acquisition is 
subject to the limitations described in the CEQ regulations at 40 CFR 
1506.1 and other applicable Federal requirements.
    (5) A limited exception for rolling stock is provided in 49 U.S.C. 
5309(h)(6).

<R05>
Sec. 771.115  Classes of actions.

    There are three classes of actions which prescribe the level of 
documentation required in the NEPA process.
    (a) Class I (EISs). Actions that significantly affect the 
environment require an EIS (40 CFR 1508.27). The following are examples 
of actions that normally required an EIS:
    (1) A new controlled access freeway.
    (2) A highway project of four or more lanes on a new location.
    (3) New construction or extension of fixed rail transit facilities 
(e.g., rapid rail, light rail, commuter rail, automated guideway 
transit).
    (4) New construction or extension of a separate roadway for buses or 
high occupancy vehicles not located within an existing highway facility.
    (b) Class II (CEs). Actions that do not individually or cumulatively 
have a significant environmental effect are excluded from the 
requirement to prepare an EA or EIS. A specific list of CEs normally not 
requiring NEPA documentation is set forth in Sec. 771.117(c). When 
appropriately documented, additional projects may also qualify as CEs 
pursuant to Sec. 771.117(d).
    (c) Class III (EAs). Actions in which the significance of the 
environmental impact is not clearly estabilished. All actions that are 
not Class I or II are Class III. All actions in this class require the 
preparation of an EA to determine the appropriate environmental document 
required.

[52 FR 32660, Aug. 28, 1987, as amended at 74 FR 12529, Mar. 24, 2009]


<R05>
Sec. 771.117  Categorical exclusions.

    (a) Categorical exclusions (CEs) are actions which meet the 
definition contained in 40 CFR 1508.4, and, based on past experience 
with similar actions, do not involve significant environmental impacts. 
They are actions which: do not induce significant impacts to planned 
growth or land use for the area; do not require the relocation of 
significant numbers of people; do not have a significant impact on any 
natural, cultural, recreational, historic or other resource; do not 
involve significant air, noise, or water quality impacts; do not have 
significant impacts on travel patterns; or do not otherwise, either 
individually or cumulatively, have any significant environmental 
impacts.
    (b) Any action which normally would be classified as a CE but could 
involve unusual circumstances will require the Administration, in 
cooperation with the applicant, to conduct appropriate environmental 
studies to determine if the CE classification is proper. Such unusual 
circumstances include:
    (1) Significant environmental impacts;
    (2) Substantial controversy on environmental grounds;
    (3) Significant impact on properties protected by section 4(f) of 
the DOT Act or section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act; or
    (4) Inconsistencies with any Federal, State, or local law, 
requirement or administrative determination relating to the 
environmental aspects of the action.
    (c) The following actions meet the criteria for CEs in the CEQ 
regulation (section 1508.4) and Sec. 771.117(a) of this regulation and 
normally do not require any further NEPA approvals by the 
Administration:
    (1) Activities which do not involve or lead directly to 
construction, such as planning and research activities; grants for 
training; engineering to define the elements of a proposed action or 
alternatives so that social, economic, and environmental effects can be 
assessed; and Federal-aid system revisions which establish classes of 
highways on the Federal-aid highway system.

[[Page 422]]

    (2) Approval of utility installations along or across a 
transportation facility.
    (3) Construction of bicycle and pedestrian lanes, paths, and 
facilities.
    (4) Activities included in the State's highway safety plan under 23 
U.S.C. 402.
    (5) Transfer of Federal lands pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 107(d) and/or 23 
U.S.C. 317 when the land transfer is in support of an action that is not 
otherwise subject to FHWA review under NEPA.
    (6) The installation of noise barriers or alterations to existing 
publicly owned buildings to provide for noise reduction.
    (7) Landscaping.
    (8) Installation of fencing, signs, pavement markings, small 
passenger shelters, traffic signals, and railroad warning devices where 
no substantial land acquisition or traffic disruption will occur.
    (9) Emergency repairs under 23 U.S.C. 125.
    (10) Acquisition of scenic easements.
    (11) Determination of payback under 23 U.S.C. 156 for property 
previously acquired with Federal-aid participation.
    (12) Improvements to existing rest areas and truck weigh stations.
    (13) Ridesharing activities.
    (14) Bus and rail car rehabilitation.
    (15) Alterations to facilities or vehicles in order to make them 
accessible for elderly and handicapped persons.
    (16) Program administration, technical assistance activities, and 
operating assistance to transit authorities to continue existing service 
or increase service to meet routine changes in demand.
    (17) The purchase of vehicles by the applicant where the use of 
these vehicles can be accommodated by existing facilities or by new 
facilities which themselves are within a CE.
    (18) Track and railbed maintenance and improvements when carried out 
within the existing right-of-way.
    (19) Purchase and installation of operating or maintenance equipment 
to be located within the transit facility and with no significant 
impacts off the site.
    (20) Promulgation of rules, regulations, and directives.
    (21) Deployment of electronics, photonics, communications, or 
information processing used singly or in combination, or as components 
of a fully integrated system, to improve the efficiency or safety of a 
surface transportation system or to enhance security or passenger 
convenience. Examples include, but are not limited to, traffic control 
and detector devices, lane management systems, electronic payment 
equipment, automatic vehicle locaters, automated passenger counters, 
computer-aided dispatching systems, radio communications systems, 
dynamic message signs, and security equipment including surveillance and 
detection cameras on roadways and in transit facilities and on buses.
    (d) Additional actions which meet the criteria for a CE in the CEQ 
regulations (40 CFR 1508.4) and paragraph (a) of this section may be 
designated as CEs only after Administration approval. The applicant 
shall submit documentation which demonstrates that the specific 
conditions or criteria for these CEs are satisfied and that significant 
environmental effects will not result. Examples of such actions include 
but are not limited to:
    (1) Modernization of a highway by resurfacing, restoration, 
rehabilitation, reconstruction, adding shoulders, or adding auxiliary 
lanes (e.g., parking, weaving, turning, climbing).
    (2) Highway safety or traffic operations improvement projects 
including the installation of ramp metering control devices and 
lighting.
    (3) Bridge rehabilitation, reconstruction or replacement or the 
construction of grade separation to replace existing at-grade railroad 
crossings.
    (4) Transportation corridor fringe parking facilities.
    (5) Construction of new truck weigh stations or rest areas.
    (6) Approvals for disposal of excess right-of-way or for joint or 
limited use of right-of-way, where the proposed use does not have 
significant adverse impacts.
    (7) Approvals for changes in access control.
    (8) Construction of new bus storage and maintenance facilities in 
areas used predominantly for industrial or transportation purposes where 
such construction is not inconsistent with

[[Page 423]]

existing zoning and located on or near a street with adequate capacity 
to handle anticipated bus and support vehicle traffic.
    (9) Rehabilitation or reconstruction of existing rail and bus 
buildings and ancillary facilities where only minor amounts of 
additional land are required and there is not a substantial increase in 
the number of users.
    (10) Construction of bus transfer facilities (an open area 
consisting of passenger shelters, boarding areas, kiosks and related 
street improvements) when located in a commercial area or other high 
activity center in which there is adequate street capacity for projected 
bus traffic.
    (11) Construction of rail storage and maintenance facilities in 
areas used predominantly for industrial or transportation purposes where 
such construction is not inconsistent with existing zoning and where 
there is no significant noise impact on the surrounding community.
    (12) Acquisition of land for hardship or protective purposes. 
Hardship and protective buying will be permitted only for a particular 
parcel or a limited number of parcels. These types of land acquisition 
qualify for a CE only where the acquisition will not limit the 
evaluation of alternatives, including shifts in alignment for planned 
construction projects, which may be required in the NEPA process. No 
project development on such land may proceed until the NEPA process has 
been completed.
    (i) Hardship acquisition is early acquisition of property by the 
applicant at the property owner's request to alleviate particular 
hardship to the owner, in contrast to others, because of an inability to 
sell his property. This is justified when the property owner can 
document on the basis of health, safety or financial reasons that 
remaining in the property poses an undue hardship compared to others.
    (ii) Protective acquisition is done to prevent imminent development 
of a parcel which may be needed for a proposed transportation corridor 
or site. Documentation must clearly demonstrate that development of the 
land would preclude future transportation use and that such development 
is imminent. Advance acquisition is not permitted for the sole purpose 
of reducing the cost of property for a proposed project.
    (13) Acquisition of pre-existing railroad right-of-way pursuant to 
49 U.S.C. 5324(c). No project development on the acquired railroad 
right-of-way may proceed until the NEPA process for such project 
development, including the consideration of alternatives, has been 
completed.
    (e) Where a pattern emerges of granting CE status for a particular 
type of action, the Administration will initiate rulemaking proposing to 
add this type of action to the list of categorical exclusions in 
paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, as appropriate.

Sec. 771.119  Environmental assessments.

    (a) An EA shall be prepared by the applicant in consultation with 
the Administration for each action that is not a CE and does not clearly 
require the preparation of an EIS, or where the Administration believes 
an EA would assist in determining the need for an EIS.
    (b) For actions that require an EA, the applicant, in consultation 
with the Administration, shall, at the earliest appropriate time, begin 
consultation with interested agencies and others to advise them of the 
scope of the project and to achieve the following objectives: determine 
which aspects of the proposed action have potential for social, 
economic, or environmental impact; identify alternatives and measures 
which might mitigate adverse environmental impacts; and identify other 
environmental review and consultation requirements which should be 
performed concurrently with the EA. The applicant shall accomplish this 
through an early coordination process (i.e., procedures under Sec. 
771.111) or through a scoping process. Public involvement shall be 
summarized and the results of agency coordination shall be included in 
the EA.
    (c) The EA is subject to Administration approval before it is made 
available to the public as an Administration document.
    (d) The EA need not be circulated for comment but the document must 
be

[[Page 424]]

made available for public inspection at the applicant's office and at 
the appropriate Administration field offices in accordance with 
paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section. Notice of availability of the 
EA, briefly describing the action and its impacts, shall be sent by the 
applicant to the affected units of Federal, State and local government. 
Notice shall also be sent to the State intergovernmental review contacts 
established under Executive Order 12372.
    (e) When a public hearing is held as part of the application for 
Federal funds, the EA shall be available at the public hearing and for a 
minimum of 15 days in advance of the public hearing. The notice of the 
public hearing in local newspapers shall announce the availability of 
the EA and where it may be obtained or reviewed. Comments shall be 
submitted in writing to the applicant or the Administration within 30 
days of the availability of the EA unless the Administration determines, 
for good cause, that a different period is warranted. Public hearing 
requirements are as described in Sec. 771.111.
    (f) When a public hearing is not held, the applicant shall place a 
notice in a newspaper(s) similar to a public hearing notice and at a 
similar stage of development of the action, advising the public of the 
availability of the EA and where information concerning the action may 
be obtained. The notice shall invite comments from all interested 
parties. Comments shall be submitted in writing to the applicant or the 
Administration within 30 days of the publication of the notice unless 
the Administration determines, for good cause, that a different period 
is warranted.
    (g) If no significant impacts are identified, the applicant shall 
furnish the Administration a copy of the revised EA, as appropriate; the 
public hearing transcript, where applicable; copies of any comments 
received and responses thereto; and recommend a FONSI. The EA should 
also document compliance, to the extent possible, with all applicable 
environmental laws and Executive orders, or provide reasonable assurance 
that their requirements can be met.
    (h) When the Administration expects to issue a FONSI for an action 
described in Sec. 771.115(a), copies of the EA shall be made available 
for public review (including the affected units of government) for a 
minimum of 30 days before the Administration makes its final decision 
(See 40 CFR 1501.4(e)(2).) This public availability shall be announced 
by a notice similar to a public hearing notice.
    (i) If, at any point in the EA process, the Administration 
determines that the action is likely to have a significant impact on the 
environment, the preparation of an EIS will be required.
    (j) If the Administration decides to apply 23 U.S.C. 139 to an 
action involving an EA, then the EA shall be prepared in accordance with 
the applicable provisions of that statute.

<R05>
Sec. 771.121  Findings of no significant impact.

    (a) The Administration will review the EA and any public hearing 
comments and other comments received regarding the EA. If the 
Administration agrees with the applicant's recommendations pursuant to 
Sec. 771.119(g), it will make a separate written FONSI incorporating by 
reference the EA and any other appropriate environmental documents.
    (b) After a FONSI has been made by the Administration, a notice of 
availability of the FONSI shall be sent by the applicant to the affected 
units of Federal, State and local government and the document shall be 
available from the applicant and the Administration upon request by the 
public. Notice shall also be sent to the State intergovernmental review 
contacts established under Executive Order 12372.
    (c) If another Federal agency has issued a FONSI on an action which 
includes an element proposed for Administration funding, the 
Administration will evaluate the other agency's FONSI. If the 
Administration determines that this element of the project and its 
environmental impacts have been adequately identified and assessed, and 
concurs in the decision to issue a FONSI, the Administration will issue 
its own FONSI incorporating the other agency's FONSI. If environmental 
issues have not been adequately

[[Page 425]]

identified and assessed, the Administration will require appropriate 
environmental studies.


<R05>
Sec. 771.123  Draft environmental impact statements.

    (a) A draft EIS shall be prepared when the Administration determines 
that the action is likely to cause significant impacts on the 
environment. When the applicant, after consultation with any project 
sponsor that is not the applicant, has notified the Administration in 
accordance with 23 U.S.C. 139(e) and the decision has been made by the 
Administration to prepare an EIS, the Administration will issue a Notice 
of Intent (40 CFR 1508.22) for publication in the Federal Register. 
Applicants are encouraged to announce the intent to prepare an EIS by 
appropriate means at the local level.
    (b) After publication of the Notice of Intent, the lead agencies, in 
cooperation with the applicant (if not a lead agency), will begin a 
scoping process which may take into account any planning work already 
accomplished, in accordance with 23 CFR 450.212 or 450.318. The scoping 
process will be used to identify the purpose and need, the range of 
alternatives and impacts, and the significant issues to be addressed in 
the EIS and to achieve the other objectives of 40 CFR 1501.7. For the 
FHWA, scoping is normally achieved through public and agency involvement 
procedures required by Sec. 771.111. For FTA, scoping is achieved by 
soliciting agency and public responses to the action by letter or by 
holding scoping meetings. If a scoping meeting is to be held, it should 
be announced in the Administration's Notice of Intent and by appropriate 
means at the local level.
    (c) The draft EIS shall be prepared by the lead agencies, in 
cooperation with the applicant (if not a lead agency). The draft EIS 
shall evaluate all reasonable alternatives to the action and discuss the 
reasons why other alternatives, which may have been considered, were 
eliminated from detailed study. The draft EIS shall also summarize the 
studies, reviews, consultations, and coordination required by 
environmental laws or Executive Orders to the extent appropriate at this 
stage in the environmental process.
    (d) Any of the lead agencies may select a consultant to assist in 
the preparation of an EIS in accordance with applicable contracting 
procedures and with 40 CFR 1506.5(c).
    (e) The Administration, when satisfied that the draft EIS complies 
with NEPA requirements, will approve the draft EIS for circulation by 
signing and dating the cover sheet.
    (f) A lead, joint lead, or a cooperating agency shall be responsible 
for printing the EIS. The initial printing of the draft EIS shall be in 
sufficient quantity to meet requirements for copies which can reasonably 
be expected from agencies, organizations, and individuals. Normally, 
copies will be furnished free of charge. However, with Administration 
concurrence, the party requesting the draft EIS may be charged a fee 
which is not more than the actual cost of reproducing the copy or may be 
directed to the nearest location where the statement may be reviewed.
    (g) The draft EIS shall be circulated for comment by the applicant 
on behalf of the Administration. The draft EIS shall be made available 
to the public and transmitted to agencies for comment no later than the 
time the document is filed with the Environmental Protection Agency in 
accordance with 40 CFR 1506.9. The draft EIS shall be transmitted to:
    (1) Public officials, interest groups, and members of the public 
known to have an interest in the proposed action or the draft EIS;
    (2) Federal, State and local government agencies expected to have 
jurisdiction or responsibility over, or interest or expertise in, the 
action. Copies shall be provided directly to appropriate State and local 
agencies, and to the State intergovernmental review contacts established 
under Executive Order 12372; and
    (3) States and Federal land management entities which may be 
significantly affected by the proposed action or any of the 
alternatives. These copies shall be accompanied by a request that such 
State or entity advise the Administration in writing of any disagreement 
with the evaluation of impacts in the statement. The Administration will 
furnish the comments received to

[[Page 426]]

the applicant along with a written assessment of any disagreements for 
incorporation into the final EIS.
    (h) The FTA requires a public hearing during the circulation period 
of all draft EISs. FHWA public hearing requirements are as described in 
Sec. 771.111(h). Whenever a public hearing is held, the draft EIS shall 
be available at the public hearing and for a minimum of 15 days in 
advance of the public hearing. The availability of the draft EIS shall 
be mentioned, and public comments requested, in any public hearing 
notice and at any public hearing presentation. If a public hearing on an 
action proposed for FHWA funding is not held, a notice shall be placed 
in a newspaper similar to a public hearing notice advising where the 
draft EIS is available for review, how copies may be obtained, and where 
the comments should be sent.
    (i) The Federal Register public availability notice (40 CFR 1506.10) 
shall establish a period of not fewer than 45 days nor more than 60 days 
for the return of comments on the draft EIS unless a different period is 
established in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 139(g)(2)(A). The notice and 
the draft EIS transmittal letter shall identify where comments are to be 
sent.
    (j) For major new fixed guideway capital projects proposed for FTA 
funding, FTA may give approval to begin preliminary engineering on the 
principal alternative(s) under consideration after circulation of a 
draft EIS and consideration of comments received. During the course of 
such preliminary engineering, the applicant will refine project costs, 
effectiveness, and impact information with particular attention to 
alternative designs, operations, detailed location decisions and 
appropriate mitigation measures. These studies will be used to prepare 
the final EIS or, where appropriate, a supplemental draft EIS.

<R05>
Sec. 771.125  Final environmental impact statements.

    (a)(1) After circulation of a draft EIS and consideration of 
comments received, a final EIS shall be prepared by the lead agencies, 
in cooperation with the applicant (if not a lead agency). The final EIS 
shall identify the preferred alternative and evaluate all reasonable 
alternatives considered. It shall also discuss substantive comments 
received on the draft EIS and responses thereto, summarize public 
involvement, and describe the mitigation measures that are to be 
incorporated into the proposed action. Mitigation measures presented as 
commitments in the final EIS will be incorporated into the project as 
specified in paragraphs (b) and (d) of Sec. 771.109. The final EIS 
should also document compliance, to the extent possible, with all 
applicable environmental laws and Executive Orders, or provide 
reasonable assurance that their requirements can be met.
    (2) Every reasonable effort shall be made to resolve interagency 
disagreements on actions before processing the final EIS. If significant 
issues remain unresolved, the final EIS shall identify those issues and 
the consultations and other efforts made to resolve them.
    (b) The final EIS will be reviewed for legal sufficiency prior to 
Administration approval.
    (c) The Administration will indicate approval of the EIS for an 
action by signing and dating the cover page. Final EISs prepared for 
actions in the following categories will be submitted to the 
Administration's Headquarters for prior concurrence:
    (1) Any action for which the Administration determines that the 
final EIS should be reviewed at the Headquarters office. This would 
typically occur when the Headquarters office determines that (i) 
additional coordination with other Federal, State or local governmental 
agencies is needed; (ii) the social, economic, or environmental impacts 
of the action may need to be more fully explored; (iii) the impacts of 
the proposed action are unusually great; (iv) major issues remain 
unresolved; or (v) the action involves national policy issues.
    (2) Any action to which a Federal, State or local government agency 
has indicated opposition on environmental grounds (which has not been 
resolved to the written satisfaction of the objecting agency).

[[Page 427]]

    (d) The signature of the FTA approving official on the cover sheet 
also indicates compliance with 49 U.S.C. 5324(b) and fulfillment of the 
grant application requirements of 49 U.S.C. 5323(b).
    (e) Approval of the final EIS is not an Administration action as 
defined in paragraph (c) of Sec. 771.107 and does not commit the 
Administration to approve any future grant request to fund the preferred 
alternative.
    (f) The initial printing of the final EIS shall be in sufficient 
quantity to meet the request for copies which can be reasonably expected 
from agencies, organizations, and individuals. Normally, copies will be 
furnished free of charge. However, with Administration concurrence, the 
party requesting the final EIS may be charged a fee which is not more 
than the actual cost of reproducing the copy or may be directed to the 
nearest location where the statement may be reviewed.
    (g) The final EIS shall be transmitted to any persons, 
organizations, or agencies that made substantive comments on the draft 
EIS or requested a copy, no later than the time the document is filed 
with EPA. In the case of lengthy documents, the agency may provide 
alternative circulation processes in accordance with 40 CFR 1502.19. The 
applicant shall also publish a notice of availability in local 
newspapers and make the final EIS available through the mechanism 
established pursuant to DOT Order 4600.13 which implements Executive 
Order 12372. When filed with EPA, the final EIS shall be available for 
public review at the applicant's offices and at appropriate 
Administration offices. A copy should also be made available for public 
review at institutions such as local government offices, libraries, and 
schools, as appropriate.

FR 12530, Mar. 24, 2009]


<R05>
Sec. 771.127  Record of decision.

    (a) The Administration will complete and sign a ROD no sooner than 
30 days after publication of the final EIS notice in the Federal 
Register or 90 days after publication of a notice for the draft EIS, 
whichever is later. The ROD will present the basis for the decision as 
specified in 40 CFR 1505.2, summarize any mitigation measures that will 
be incorporated in the project and document any required Section 4(f) 
approval in accordance with part 774 of this title. Until any required 
ROD has been signed, no further approvals may be given except for 
administrative activities taken to secure further project funding and 
other activities consistent with 40 CFR 1506.1.
    (b) If the Administration subsequently wishes to approve an 
alternative which was not identified as the preferred alternative but 
was fully evaluated in the final EIS, or proposes to make substantial 
changes to the mitigation measures or findings discussed in the ROD, a 
revised ROD shall be subject to review by those Administration offices 
which reviewed the final EIS under Sec. 771.125(c). To the extent 
practicable the approved revised ROD shall be provided to all persons, 
organizations, and agencies that received a copy of the final EIS 
pursuant to Sec. 771.125(g).

[52 FR 32660, Aug. 28, 1987, as amended at 73 FR 13395, Mar. 12, 2008; 
74 FR 12530, Mar. 24, 2009]


<R05>
Sec. 771.129  Re-evaluations.

    (a) A written evaluation of the draft EIS shall be prepared by the 
applicant in cooperation with the Administration if an acceptable final 
EIS is not submitted to the Administration within three years from the 
date of the draft EIS circulation. The purpose of this evaluation is to 
determine whether or not a supplement to the draft EIS or a new draft 
EIS is needed.
    (b) A written evaluation of the final EIS will be required before 
further approvals may be granted if major steps to advance the action 
(e.g., authority to undertake final design, authority to acquire a 
significant portion of the right-of-way, or approval of the plans, 
specifications and estimates) have not occurred within three years after 
the approval of the final EIS, final EIS supplement, or the last major 
Administration approval or grant.
    (c) After approval of the ROD, FONSI, or CE designation, the 
applicant shall consult with the Administration prior to requesting any 
major

[[Page 428]]

approvals or grants to establish whether or not the approved 
environmental document or CE designation remains valid for the requested 
Administration action. These consultations will be documented when 
determined necessary by the Administration.

FR 12530, Mar. 24, 2009]


<R05>
Sec. 771.130  Supplemental environmental impact statements.

    (a) A draft EIS, final EIS, or supplemental EIS may be supplemented 
at any time. An EIS shall be supplemented whenever the Administration 
determines that:
    (1) Changes to the proposed action would result in significant 
environmental impacts that were not evaluated in the EIS; or
    (2) New information or circumstances relevant to environmental 
concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts would result 
in significant environmental impacts not evaluated in the EIS.
    (b) However, a supplemental EIS will not be necessary where:
    (1) The changes to the proposed action, new information, or new 
circumstances result in a lessening of adverse environmental impacts 
evaluated in the EIS without causing other environmental impacts that 
are significant and were not evaluated in the EIS; or
    (2) The Administration decides to approve an alternative fully 
evaluated in an approved final EIS but not identified as the preferred 
alternative. In such a case, a revised ROD shall be prepared and 
circulated in accordance with Sec. 771.127(b).
    (c) Where the Administration is uncertain of the significance of the 
new impacts, the applicant will develop appropriate environmental 
studies or, if the Administration deems appropriate, an EA to assess the 
impacts of the changes, new information, or new circumstances. If, based 
upon the studies, the Administration determines that a supplemental EIS 
is not necessary, the Administration shall so indicate in the project 
file.
    (d) A supplement is to be developed using the same process and 
format (i.e., draft EIS, final EIS, and ROD) as an original EIS, except 
that scoping is not required.
    (e) A supplemental draft EIS may be necessary for major new fixed 
guideway capital projects proposed for FTA funding if there is a 
substantial change in the level of detail on project impacts during 
project planning and development. The supplement will address site-
specific impacts and refined cost estimates that have been developed 
since the original draft EIS.
    (f) In some cases, a supplemental EIS may be required to address 
issues of limited scope, such as the extent of proposed mitigation or 
the evaluation of location or design variations for a limited portion of 
the overall project. Where this is the case, the preparation of a 
supplemental EIS shall not necessarily:
    (1) Prevent the granting of new approvals;
    (2) Require the withdrawal of previous approvals; or
    (3) Require the suspension of project activities; for any activity 
not directly affected by the supplement. If the changes in question are 
of such magnitude to require a reassessment of the entire action, or 
more than a limited portion of the overall action, the Administration 
shall suspend any activities which would have an adverse environmental 
impact or limit the choice of reasonable alternatives, until the 
supplemental EIS is completed.

<R05>
Sec. 771.131  Emergency action procedures.

    Requests for deviations from the procedures in this regulation 
because of emergency circumstances (40 CFR 1506.11) shall be referred to 
the Administration's headquarters for evaluation and decision after 
consultation with CEQ.


<R05>
Sec. 771.133  Compliance with other requirements.

    The final EIS or FONSI should document compliance with requirements 
of all applicable environmental laws, Executive orders, and other 
related requirements. If full compliance is not possible by the time the 
final EIS or

[[Page 429]]

FONSI is prepared, the final EIS or FONSI should reflect consultation 
with the appropriate agencies and provide reasonable assurance that the 
requirements will be met. Approval of the environmental document 
constitutes adoption of any Administration findings and determinations 
that are contained therein. The Administration's approval of an 
environmental document constitutes its finding of compliance with the 
report requirements of 23 U.S.C. 128.

<R05>
Sec. 771.137  International actions.

    (a) The requirements of this part apply to:
    (1) Administration actions significantly affecting the environment 
of a foreign nation not participating in the action or not otherwise 
involved in the action.
    (2) Administration actions outside the U.S., its territories, and 
possessions which significantly affect natural resources of global 
importance designated for protection by the President or by 
international agreement.
    (b) If communication with a foreign government concerning 
environmental studies or documentation is anticipated, the 
Administration shall coordinate such communication with the Department 
of State through the Office of the Secretary of Transportation.


<R05>
Sec. 771.139  Limitations on actions.

    Notices announcing decisions by the Administration or by other 
Federal agencies on a transportation project may be published in the 
Federal Register indicating that such decisions are final within the 
meaning of 23 U.S.C. 139(l). Claims arising under Federal law seeking 
judicial review of any such decisions are barred unless filed within 180 
days after publication of the notice. This 180-day time period does not 
lengthen any shorter time period for seeking judicial review that 
otherwise is established by the Federal law under which judicial review 
is allowed.\6\ This provision does not create any right of judicial 
review or place any limit on filing a claim that a person has violated 
the terms of a permit, license, or approval.

revised, effective July 13, 2011. For the convenience of the user, the 
revised text is set forth following the text currently in effect.


<R05>
Sec. 772.1  Purpose.

    To provide procedures for noise studies and noise abatement measures 
to help protect the public health and welfare, to supply noise abatement 
criteria, and to establish requirements for information to be given to 
local officials for use in the planning and design of highways approved 
pursuant to title 23 U.S.C.

[[Page 430]]


<R05>
Sec. 772.3  Noise standards.

    The highway traffic noise prediction requirements, noise analyses, 
noise abatement criteria, and requirements for informing local officials 
in this regulation constitute the noise standards mandated by 23 U.S.C. 
109(i). All highway projects which are developed in conformance with 
this regulation shall be deemed to be in conformance with the Federal 
Highway Administration (FHWA) noise standards.


<R05>
Sec. 772.5  Definitions.

    (a) Design year. The future year used to estimate the probable 
traffic volume for which a highway is designed. A time, 10 to 20 years, 
from the start of construction is usually used.
    (b) Existing noise levels. The noise, resulting from the natural and 
mechanical sources and human activity, considered to be usually present 
in a particular area.
    (c) L10. The sound level that is exceeded 10 percent of the time 
(the 90th percentile) for the period under consideration.
    (d) L10(h). The hourly value of L10.
    (e) Leq--the equivalent steady-state sound level which in a stated 
period of time contains the same acoustic energy as the time-varying 
sound level during the same time period.
    (f) Leq(h). The hourly value of Leq.
    (g) Traffic noise impacts. Impacts which occur when the predicted 
traffic noise levels approach or exceed the noise abatement criteria 
(Table 1), or when the predicted traffic noise levels substantially 
exceed the existing noise levels.
    (h) Type I projects. A proposed Federal or Federal-aid highway 
project for the construction of a highway on new location or the 
physical alteration of an existing highway which significantly changes 
either the horizonal or vertical alignment or increases the number of 
through-traffic lanes.
    (i) Type II projects. A proposed Federal or Federal-aid highway 
project for noise abatement on an existing highway.


<R05>
Sec. 772.7  Applicability.

    (a) Type I projects. This regulation applies to all Type I projects 
unless it is specifically indicated that a section applies only to Type 
II projects.
    (b) Type II projects. The development and implementation of Type II 
projects are not mandatory requirements of 23 U.S.C. 109(i) and are, 
therefore, not required by this regulation. When Type II projects are 
proposed for Federal-aid highway participation at the option of the 
highway agency, the provisions of Sec. Sec. 772.9(c), 772.13, and 
772.19 of this regulation shall apply.


<R05>
Sec. 772.9  Analysis of traffic noise impacts and abatement measures.

    (a) The highway agency shall determine and analyze expected traffic 
noise impacts and alternative noise abatement measures to mitigate these 
impacts, giving weight to the benefits and cost of abatement, and to the 
overall social, economic and environmental effects.
    (b) The traffic noise analysis shall include the following for each 
alternative under detailed study:
    (1) Identification of existing activities, developed lands, and 
undeveloped lands for which development is planned, designed and 
programmed, which may be affected by noise from the highway;
    (2) Prediction of traffic noise levels;
    (3) Determination of existing noise levels;
    (4) Determination of traffic noise impacts; and
    (5) Examination and evaluation of alternative noise abatement 
measures for reducing or eliminating the noise impacts.
    (c) Highway agencies proposing to use Federal-aid highway funds for 
Type II projects shall perform a noise analysis of sufficient scope to 
provide information needed to make the determination required by Sec. 
772.13(a) of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 772.11  Noise abatement.

    (a) In determining and abating traffic noise impacts, primary 
consideration is to be given to exterior areas. Abatement will usually 
be necessary only where frequent human use occurs and a lowered noise 
level would be of benefit.
    (b) In those situations where there are no exterior activities to be 
affected

by the traffic noise, or where the exterior activities are far from or 
physically shielded from the roadway in a manner that prevents an impact 
on exterior activities, the interior criterion shall be used as the 
basis of determining noise impacts.
    (c) If a noise impact is identified, the abatement measures listed 
in Sec. 772.13(c) of this chapter must be considered.
    (d) When noise abatement measures are being considered, every 
reasonable effort shall be made to obtain substantial noise reductions.
    (e) Before adoption of a final environmental impact statement or 
finding of no significant impact, the highway agency shall identify:
    (1) Noise abatement measures which are reasonable and feasible and 
which are likely to be incorporated in the project, and
    (2) Noise impacts for which no apparent solution is available.
    (f) The views of the impacted residents will be a major 
consideration in reaching a decision on the reasonableness of abatement 
measures to be provided.
    (g) The plans and specifications will not be approved by FHWA unless 
those noise abatement measures which are reasonable and feasible are 
incorporated into the plans and specifications to reduce or eliminate 
the noise impact on existing activities, developed lands, or undeveloped 
lands for which development is planned, designed, and programmed.


<R05>
Sec. 772.13  Federal participation.

    (a) Federal funds may be used for noise abatement measures where:
    (1) A traffic noise impact has been identified,
    (2) The noise abatement measures will reduce the traffic noise 
impact, and
    (3) The overall noise abatement benefits are determined to outweigh 
the overall adverse social, economic, and environmental effects and the 
costs of the noise abatement measures.
    (b) For Type II projects, noise abatement measures will only be 
approved for projects that were approved before November 28, 1995, or 
are proposed along lands where land development or substantial 
construction predated the existence of any highway. The granting of a 
building permit, filing of a plat plan, or a similar action must have 
occurred prior to right-of-way acquisition or construction approval for 
the original highway. Noise abatement measures will not be approved at 
locations where such measures were previously determined not to be 
reasonable and feasible for a Type I project.
    (c) The noise abatement measures listed below may be incorporated in 
Type I and Type II projects to reduce traffic noise impacts. The costs 
of such measures may be included in Federal-aid participating project 
costs with the Federal share being the same as that for the system on 
which the project is located.
    (1) Traffic management measures (e.g., traffic control devices and 
signing for prohibition of certain vehicle types, time-use restrictions 
for certain vehicle types, modified speed limits, and exclusive lane 
designations).
    (2) Alteration of horizontal and vertical alignments.
    (3) Acquisition of property rights (either in fee or lesser 
interest) for construction of noise barriers.
    (4) Construction of noise barriers (including landscaping for 
aesthetic purposes) whether within or outside the highway right-of-way.
    (5) Acquisition of real property or interests therein (predominantly 
unimproved property) to serve as a buffer zone to preempt development 
which would be adversely impacted by traffic noise. This measure may be 
included in Type I projects only.
    (6) Noise insulation of public use or nonprofit institutional 
structures.
    (d) There may be situations where severe traffic noise impacts exist 
or are expected, and the abatement measures listed above are physically 
infeasible or economically unreasonable. In these instances, noise 
abatement measures other than those listed in paragraph (c) of this 
section may be proposed for Types I and II projects by the highway 
agency and approved by the FHWA on a case-by-case basis when the 
conditions of paragraph (a) of this section have been met.

Sec. 772.19  Construction noise.

    The following general steps are to be performed for all Types I and 
II projects:
    (a) Identify land uses or activities which may be affected by noise 
from construction of the project. The identification is to be performed 
during the project development studies.
    (b) Determine the measures which are needed in the plans and 
specifications to minimize or eliminate adverse construction noise 
impacts to the community. This determination shall include a weighing of 
the benefits achieved and the overall adverse social, economic and 
environmental effects and the costs of the abatement measures.
    (c) Incorporate the needed abatement measures in the plans and 
specifications.

    To provide procedures for noise studies and noise abatement measures 
to help protect the public's health, welfare and livability, to supply 
noise abatement criteria, and to establish requirements for information 
to be given to local officials for use in the planning and design of 
highways approved pursuant to title 23 U.S.C.


<R05>
Sec. 772.3  Noise standards.

    The highway traffic noise prediction requirements, noise analyses, 
noise abatement criteria, and requirements for informing local officials 
in this regulation constitute the noise standards mandated by 23 U.S.C. 
109(1). All highway projects which are developed in conformance with 
this regulation shall be deemed to be in accordance with the FHWA noise 
standards.


<R05>
Sec. 772.5  Definitions.

    Benefited receptor. The recipient of an abatement measure that 
receives a noise reduction at or above the minimum threshold of 5 dB(A), 
but not to exceed the highway agency's reasonableness design goal.
    Common Noise Environment. A group of receptors within the same 
Activity Category in Table 1 that are exposed to similar noise sources 
and levels; traffic volumes, traffic mix, and speed; and topographic 
features. Generally, common noise environments occur between two 
secondary noise sources, such as interchanges, intersections, cross-
roads.
    Date of public knowledge. The date of approval of the Categorical 
Exclusion (CE), the Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI), or the 
Record of Decision (ROD), as defined in 23 CFR part 771.
    Design year. The future year used to estimate the probable traffic 
volume for which a highway is designed.
    Existing noise levels. The worst noise hour resulting from the 
combination of natural and mechanical sources and human activity usually 
present in a particular area.
    Feasibility. The combination of acoustical and engineering factors 
considered in the evaluation of a noise abatement measure.
    Impacted Receptor. The recipient that has a traffic noise impact.

90th percentile) for the period under consideration, with L10(h) being 
the hourly value of L10.
    Leq. The equivalent steady-state sound level which in a stated 
period of time contains the same acoustic energy as the time-varying 
sound level during the same time period, with Leq(h) being the hourly 
value of Leq.
    Multifamily dwelling. A residential structure containing more than 
one residence. Each residence in a multifamily dwelling shall be counted 
as one receptor when determining impacted and benefited receptors.
    Noise barrier. A physical obstruction that is constructed between 
the highway noise source and the noise sensitive receptor(s) that lowers 
the noise level, including stand alone noise walls, noise berms (earth 
or other material), and combination berm/wall systems.
    Noise reduction design goal. The optimum desired dB(A) noise 
reduction determined from calculating the difference between future 
build noise levels with abatement, to future build noise levels without 
abatement. The noise reduction design goal shall be at least 7 dB(A), 
but not more than 10 dB(A).
    Permitted. A definite commitment to develop land with an approved 
specific design of land use activities as evidenced by the issuance of a 
building permit.

year over the existing noise level.
    Traffic noise impacts. Design year build condition noise levels that 
approach or exceed the NAC listed in Table 1 for the future build 
condition; or design year build condition noise levels that create a 
substantial noise increase over existing noise levels.
    Type I project. (1) The construction of a highway on new location; 
or,
    (2) The physical alteration of an existing highway where there is 
either:
    (i) Substantial Horizontal Alteration. A project that halves the 
distance between the traffic noise source and the closest receptor 
between the existing condition to the future build condition; or,
    (ii) Substantial Vertical Alteration. A project that removes 
shielding therefore exposing the line-of-sight between the receptor and 
the traffic noise source. This is done by either altering the vertical 
alignment of the highway or by altering the topography between the 
highway traffic noise source and the receptor; or,
    (3) The addition of a through-traffic lane(s). This includes the 
addition of a through-traffic lane that functions as a HOV lane, High-

    (7) The addition of a new or substantial alteration of a weigh 
station, rest stop, ride-share lot or toll plaza.
    (8) If a project is determined to be a Type I project under this 
definition then the entire project area as defined in the environmental 
document is a Type I project.
    Type II project. A Federal or Federal-aid highway project for noise 
abatement on an existing highway. For a Type II project to be eligible 
for Federal-aid funding, the highway agency must develop and implement a 
Type II program in accordance with section 772.7(e).
    Type III project. A Federal or Federal-aid highway project that does 
not meet the classifications of a Type I or Type II project. Type III 
projects do not require a noise analysis.


<R05>
Sec. 772.7  Applicability.

    (a) This regulation applies to all Federal or Federal-aid Highway 
Projects authorized under title 23, United States Code. Therefore, this 
regulation applies to any highway project or multimodal project that:
    (1) Requires FHWA approval regardless of funding sources, or
    (2) Is funded with Federal-aid highway funds.
    (b) In order to obtain FHWA approval, the highway agency shall 
develop noise policies in conformance with this regulation and shall 
apply these policies uniformly and consistently statewide.
    (c) This regulation applies to all Type I projects unless the 
regulation specifically indicates that a section only applies to Type II 
or Type III projects.
    (d) The development and implementation of Type II projects are not 
mandatory requirements of section 109(i) of title 23, United States 
Code.
    (e) If a highway agency chooses to participate in a Type II program, 
the highway agency shall develop a priority system, based on a variety 
of factors, to rank the projects in the program. This priority system 
shall be submitted to and approved by FHWA before the highway agency is 
allowed to use Federal-aid funds for a project in the program. The 
highway agency shall re-analyze the priority system on a regular 
interval, not to exceed 5 years.
    (f) For a Type III project, a highway agency is not required to 
complete a noise analysis or consider abatement measures.


<R05>
Sec. 772.9  Traffic noise prediction.

    (a) Any analysis required by this subpart must use the FHWA Traffic 
Noise Model (TNM), which is described in ``FHWA Traffic Noise Model'' 
Report No. FHWA-PD-96-010, including Revision No. 1, dated April 14, 
2004, or any other model determined by the FHWA to be consistent with 
the methodology of the FHWA TNM. These publications are incorporated by 
reference in accordance with section 552(a) of title 5, U.S.C. and part 
51 of title 1, CFR, and are on file at the National Archives and Record 
Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this 
material at NARA, call (202) 741-6030 or go to http://www.archives.gov/

available on the FHWA's Traffic Noise Model Web site at the following 
URL: http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/noise/index.htm.
    (b) Average pavement type shall be used in the FHWA TNM for future 
noise level prediction unless a highway agency substantiates the use of 
a different pavement type for approval by the FHWA.
    (c) Noise contour lines may be used for project alternative 
screening or for land use planning to comply with Sec. 772.17 of this 
part,

[[Page 436]]

but shall not be used for determining highway traffic noise impacts.
    (d) In predicting noise levels and assessing noise impacts, traffic 
characteristics that would yield the worst traffic noise impact for the 
design year shall be used.


<R05>
Sec. 772.11  Analysis of traffic noise impacts.

    (a) The highway agency shall determine and analyze expected traffic 
noise impacts.
    (1) For projects on new alignments, determine traffic noise impacts 
by field measurements.
    (2) For projects on existing alignments, predict existing and design 
year traffic noise impacts.
    (b) In determining traffic noise impacts, a highway agency shall 
give primary consideration to exterior areas where frequent human use 
occurs.
    (c) A traffic noise analysis shall be completed for:
    (1) Each alternative under detailed study;
    (2) Each Activity Category of the NAC listed in Table 1 that is 
present in the study area;
    (i) Activity Category A. This activity category includes the 
exterior impact criteria for lands on which serenity and quiet are of 
extraordinary significance and serve an important public need, and where 
the preservation of those qualities is essential for the area to 
continue to serve its intended purpose. Highway agencies shall submit 
justifications to the FHWA on a case-by-case basis for approval of an 
Activity Category A designation.
    (ii) Activity Category B. This activity category includes the 
exterior impact criteria for single-family and multifamily residences.
    (iii) Activity Category C. This activity category includes the 
exterior impact criteria for a variety of land use facilities. Each 
highway agency shall adopt a standard practice for analyzing these land 
use facilities that is consistent and uniformly applied statewide.
    (iv) Activity Category D. This activity category includes the 
interior impact criteria for certain land use facilities listed in 
Activity Category C that may have interior uses. A highway agency shall 
conduct an indoor analysis after a determination is made that exterior 
abatement measures will not be feasible and reasonable. An indoor 
analysis shall only be done after exhausting all outdoor analysis 
options. In situations where no exterior activities are to be affected 
by the traffic noise, or where the exterior activities are far from or 
physically shielded from the roadway in a manner that prevents an impact 
on exterior activities, the highway agency shall use Activity Category D 
as the basis of determining noise impacts. Each highway agency shall 
adopt a standard practice for analyzing these land use facilities that 
is consistent and uniformly applied statewide.
    (v) Activity Category E. This activity category includes the 
exterior impact criteria for developed lands that are less sensitive to 
highway noise. Each highway agency shall adopt a standard practice for 
analyzing these land use facilities that is consistent and uniformly 
applied statewide.
    (vi) Activity Category F. This activity category includes developed 
lands that are not sensitive to highway traffic noise. There is no 
impact criteria for the land use facilities in this activity category 
and no analysis of noise impacts is required.
    (vii) Activity Category G. This activity includes undeveloped lands.
    (A) A highway agency shall determine if undeveloped land is 
permitted for development. The milestone and its associated date for 
acknowledging when undeveloped land is considered permitted shall be the 
date of issuance of a building permit by the local jurisdiction or by 
the appropriate governing entity.
    (B) If undeveloped land is determined to be perrmitted, then the 
highway agency shall assign the land to the appropriate Activity 
Category and analyze it in the same manner as developed lands in that 
Activity Category.
    (C) If undeveloped land is not permitted for development by the date 
of public knowledge, the highway agency shall determine noise levels in 
accordance with 772.17(a) and document the results in the project's 
environmental clearance documents and noise analysis documents. Federal 
participation in noise abatement measures will not be considered for 
lands that are not permitted by the date of public knowledge.
    (d) The analysis of traffic noise impacts shall include:
    (1) Identification of existing activities, developed lands, and 
undeveloped lands, which may be affected by noise from the highway;
    (2) For projects on new or existing alignments, validate predicted 
noise level through comparison between measured and predicted levels;
    (3) Measurement of noise levels. Use an ANSI Type I or Type II 
integrating sound level meter;
    (4) Identification of project limits to determine all traffic noise 
impacts for the design year for the build alternative. For Type II 
projects, traffic noise impacts shall be determined from current year 
conditions;
    (e) Highway agencies shall establish an approach level to be used 
when determining a traffic noise impact. The approach level shall be at 
least 1 dB(A) less than the Noise Abatement Criteria for Activity 
Categories A to E listed in Table 1 to part 772;
    (f) Highway agencies shall define substantial noise increase between 
5 dB(A) to 15

[[Page 437]]

dB(A) over existing noise levels. The substantial noise increase 
criterion is independent of the absolute noise level.
    (g) A highway agency proposing to use Federal-aid highway funds for 
a Type II project shall perform a noise analysis in accordance with 
Sec. 772.11 of this part in order to provide information needed to make 
the determination required by Sec. 772.13(a) of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 772.13  Analysis of noise abatement.

    (a) When traffic noise impacts are identified, noise abatement shall 
be considered and evaluated for feasibility and reasonableness. The 
highway agency shall determine and analyze alternative noise abatement 
measures to abate identified impacts by giving weight to the benefits 
and costs of abatement and the overall social, economic, and 
environmental effects by using feasible and reasonable noise abatement 
measures for decision-making.
    (b) In abating traffic noise impacts, a highway agency shall give 
primary consideration to exterior areas where frequent human use occurs.
    (c) If a noise impact is identified, a highway agency shall consider 
abatement measures. The abatement measures listed in Sec. 772.15(c) of 
this part are eligible for Federal funding.
    (1) At a minimum, the highway agency shall consider noise abatement 
in the form of a noise barrier.
    (2) If a highway agency chooses to use absorptive treatments as a 
functional enhancement, the highway agency shall adopt a standard 
practice for using absorptive treatment that is consistent and uniformly 
applied statewide.
    (d) Examination and evaluation of feasible and reasonable noise 
abatement measures for reducing the traffic noise impacts. Each highway 
agency, with FHWA approval, shall develop feasibility and reasonableness 
factors.
    (1) Feasibility: (i) Achievement of at least a 5 dB(A) highway 
traffic noise reduction at impacted receptors. The highway agency shall 
define, and receive FHWA approval for, the number of receptors that must 
achieve this reduction for the noise abatement measure to be 
acoustically feasible and explain the basis for this determination; and
    (ii) Determination that it is possible to design and construct the 
noise abatement measure. Factors to consider are safety, barrier height, 
topography, drainage, utilities, and maintenance of the abatement 
measure, maintenance access to adjacent properties, and access to 
adjacent properties (i.e. arterial widening projects).
    (2) Reasonableness:--(i) Consideration of the viewpoints of the 
property owners and residents of the benefited receptors. The highway 
agency shall solicit the viewpoints of all of the benefited receptors 
and obtain enough responses to document a decision on either desiring or 
not desiring the noise abatement measure. The highway agency shall 
define, and receive FHWA approval for, the number of receptors that are 
needed to constitute a decision and explain the basis for this 
determination.
    (ii) Cost effectiveness of the highway traffic noise abatement 
measures. Each highway agency shall determine, and receive FHWA approval 
for, the allowable cost of abatement by determining a baseline cost 
reasonableness value. This determination may include the actual 
construction cost of noise abatement, cost per square foot of abatement, 
the maximum square footage of abatement/benefited receptor and either 
the cost/benefited receptor or cost/benefited receptor/dB(A) reduction. 
The highway agency shall re-analyze the allowable cost for abatement on 
a regular interval, not to exceed 5 years. A highway agency has the 
option of justifying, for FHWA approval, different cost allowances for a 
particular geographic area(s) within the State, however, the highway 
agancy must use the same cost reasonableness/construction cost ratio 
statewide.
    (iii) Noise reduction design goals for highway traffic noise 
abatement measures. When noise abatement measure(s) are being 
considered, a highway agency shall achieve a noise reduction design 
goal. The highway agency shall define, and receive FHWA approval for, 
the design goal of at least 7 dB(A) but not more than 10 dB(A), and 
shall define the number of benefited receptors that must achieve this 
design goal and explain the basis for this determination.
    (iv) The reasonableness factors listed in Sec. 772.13(d)(5)(i), 
(ii) and (iii), must collectively be achieved in order for a noise 
abatement measure to be deemed reasonable. Failure to achieve Sec. 
772.13(d)(5)(i), (ii) or (iii), will result in the noise abatement 
measure being deemed not reasonable.
    (v) In addition to the required reasonableness factors listed in 
Sec. 772.13(d)(5)(i), (ii), and (iii), a highway agency has the option 
to also include the following reasonableness factors: Date of 
development, length of time receivers have been exposed to highway 
traffic noise impacts, exposure to higher absolute highway traffic noise 
levels, changes between existing and future build conditions, percentage 
of mixed zoning development, and use of noise compatible planning 
concepts by the local government. No single optional reasonableness 
factor can be used to determine reasonableness.
    (e) Assessment of Benefited Receptors. Each highway agency shall 
define the threshold for the noise reduction which determines a 
benefited receptor as at or above the 5 dB(A), but not to exceed the 
highway agency's reasonableness design goal.
    (f) Abatement measure reporting: Each highway agency shall maintain 
an inventory of all constructed noise abatement measures.

[[Page 438]]

The inventory shall include the following parameters: type of abatement; 
cost (overall cost, unit cost per/sq. ft.); average height; length; 
area; location (State, county, city, route); year of construction; 
average insertion loss/noise reduction as reported by the model in the 
noise analysis; NAC category(s) protected; material(s) used (precast 
concrete, berm, block, cast in place concrete, brick, metal, wood, 
fiberglass, combination, plastic (transparent, opaque, other); features 
(absorptive, reflective, surface texture); foundation (ground mounted, 
on structure); project type (Type I, Type II, and optional project types 
such as State funded, county funded, tollway/turnpike funded, other, 
unknown). The FHWA will collect this information, in accordance with 
OMB's Information Collection requirements.
    (g) Before adoption of a CE, FONSI, or ROD, the highway agency shall 
identify:
    (1) Noise abatement measures which are feasible and reasonable, and 
which are likely to be incorporated in the project; and
    (2) Noise impacts for which no noise abatement measures are feasible 
and reasonable.
    (3) Documentation of highway traffic noise abatement: The 
environmental document shall identify locations where noise impacts are 
predicted to occur, where noise abatement is feasible and reasonable, 
and locations with impacts that have no feasible or reasonable noise 
abatement alternative. For environmental clearance, this analysis shall 
be completed to the extent that design information on the alterative(s) 
under study in the environmental document is available at the time the 
environmental clearance document is completed. A statement of likelihood 
shall be included in the environmental document since feasibility and 
reasonableness determinations may change due to changes in project 
design after approval of the environmental document. The statement of 
likelihood shall include the preliminary location and physical 
description of noise abatement measures determined feasible and 
reasonable in the preliminary analysis. The statement of likelihood 
shall also indicate that final recommendations on the construction of an 
abatement measure(s) is determined during the completion of the 
project's final design and the public involvement processes.
    (h) The FHWA will not approve project plans and specifications 
unless feasible and reasonable noise abatement measures are incorporated 
into the plans and specifications to reduce the noise impact on existing 
activities, developed lands, or undeveloped lands for which development 
is permitted.
    (i) For design-build projects, the preliminary technical noise study 
shall document all considered and proposed noise abatement measures for 
inclusion in the NEPA document. Final design of design-build noise 
abatement measures shall be based on the preliminary noise abatement 
design developed in the technical noise analysis. Noise abatement 
measures shall be considered, developed, and constructed in accordance 
with this standard and in conformance with the provisions of 40 CFR 
1506.5(c) and 23 CFR 636.109.
    (j) Third party funding is not allowed on a Federal or Federal-aid 
Type I or Type II project if the noise abatement measure would require 
the additional funding from the third party to be considered feasible 
and/or reasonable. Third party funding is acceptable on a Federal or 
Federal-aid highway Type I or Type II project to make functional 
enhancements, such as absorptive treatment and access doors or aesthetic 
enhancements, to a noise abatement measure already determined feasible 
and reasonable.
    (k) On a Type I or Type II projects, a highway agency has the option 
to cost average noise abatement among benefited receptors within common 
noise environments if no single common noise environment exceeds two 
times the highway agency's cost reasonableness criteria and collectively 
all common noise environments being averaged do not exceed the highway 
agency's cost reasonableness criteria.


<R05>
Sec. 772.15  Federal participation.

    (a) Type I and Type II projects. Federal funds may be used for noise 
abatement measures when:
    (1) Traffic noise impacts have been identified; and
    (2) Abatement measures have been determined to be feasible and 
reasonable pursuant to Sec. 772.13(d) of this chapter.
    (b) For Type II projects. (1) No funds made available out of the 
Highway Trust Fund may be used to construct Type II noise barriers, as 
defined by this regulation, if such noise barriers were not part of a 
project approved by the FHWA before the November 28, 1995.
    (2) Federal funds are available for Type II noise barriers along 
lands that were developed or were under substantial construction before 
approval of the acquisition of the rights-of-ways for, or construction 
of, the existing highway.
    (3) FHWA will not approve noise abatement measures for locations 
where such measures were previously determined not to be feasible and 
reasonable for a Type I project.
    (c) Noise abatement measures. The following noise abatement measures 
may be considered for incorporation into a Type I or Type II project to 
reduce traffic noise impacts. The costs of such measures may be included 
in Federal-aid participating project costs with the Federal share being 
the same as that for the system on which the project is located.

[[Page 439]]

    (1) Construction of noise barriers, including acquisition of 
property rights, either within or outside the highway right-of-way. 
Landscaping is not a viable noise abatement measure.
    (2) Traffic management measures including, but not limited to, 
traffic control devices and signing for prohibition of certain vehicle 
types, time-use restrictions for certain vehicle types, modified speed 
limits, and exclusive lane designations.
    (3) Alteration of horizontal and vertical alignments.
    (4) Acquisition of real property or interests therein (predominantly 
unimproved property) to serve as a buffer zone to preempt development 
which would be adversely impacted by traffic noise. This measure may be 
included in Type I projects only.
    (5) Noise insulation of Activity Category D land use facilities 
listed in Table 1. Post-installation maintenance and operational costs 
for noise insulation are not eligible for Federal-aid funding.


<R05>
Sec. 772.17  Information for local officials.

    (a) To minimize future traffic noise impacts on currently 
undeveloped lands of Type I projects, a highway agency shall inform 
local officials within whose jurisdiction the highway project is located 
of:
    (1) Noise compatible planning concepts;
    (2) The best estimation of the future design year noise levels at 
various distances from the edge of the nearest travel lane of the 
highway improvement where the future noise levels meet the highway 
agency's definition of ``approach'' for undeveloped lands or properties 
within the project limits. At a minimum, identify the distance to the 
exterior noise abatement criteria in Table 1;
    (3) Non-eligibility for Federal-aid participation for a Type II 
project as described in Sec. 772.15(b).
    (b) If a highway agency chooses to participate in a Type II noise 
program or to use the date of development as one of the factors in 
determining the reasonableness of a Type I noise abatement measure, the 
highway agency shall have a statewide outreach program to inform local 
officials and the public of the items in Sec. 772.17(a)(1) through (3).


<R05>
Sec. 772.19  Construction noise.

    For all Type I and II projects, a highway agency shall:
    (a) Identify land uses or activities that may be affected by noise 
from construction of the project. The identification is to be performed 
during the project development studies.
    (b) Determine the measures that are needed in the plans and 
specifications to minimize or eliminate adverse construction noise 
impacts to the community. This determination shall include a weighing of 
the benefits achieved and the overall adverse social, economic, and 
environmental effects and costs of the abatement measures.
    (c) Incorporate the needed abatement measures in the plans and 
specifications.

Appendix A to Part 773--FHWA Environmental Responsibilities That May Be 
          Assigned Under Section 6005.

    Authority: 23 U.S.C. 315 and 327; 49 CFR 1.48.

    Source: 72 FR 6470, Feb. 12, 2007, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 773.101  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to establish the requirements, as 
directed by 23 U.S.C. 327(b)(2), relating to the information which must 
be contained in an application by a State to participate in the program 
allowing the Secretary to assign, and a State Department of 
Transportation (State DOT) to assume, responsibilities for compliance 
with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321-4347) 
and other Federal environmental laws pertaining to the review or 
approval of a highway project(s).


<R05>
Sec. 773.102  Applicability.

    This part applies to any State DOT eligible under the provisions of 
23 U.S.C. 327 that submits an application for participation in the 
program.


<R05>
Sec. 773.103  Definitions.

    Unless otherwise specified in this part, the definitions in 23 
U.S.C. 101(a) are applicable to this part. As used in this part:
    Classes of highway projects means either a defined group of highway 
projects or all highway projects to which Federal environmental laws 
apply.
    Federal environmental law means any Federal law or Executive Order 
(EO) under which the Secretary of the United States Department of 
Transportation has responsibilities for environmental review, 
consultation, or other action with respect to the review or approval of 
highway projects. A list of the Federal environmental laws for which a 
State DOT may assume the responsibilities of the Secretary under this 
pilot program include, but are not limited to, the list of laws 
contained in Appendix A to this Part. But, under 23 U.S.C. 327(a)(2)(B), 
the Secretary's responsibility for conformity determinations required 
under section 176 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7506) and the 
responsibility imposed on the Secretary under 23 U.S.C. 134 and 135 are 
not included in the program. Also, Federal environmental law includes 
only laws that are inherently environmental and does not include 
responsibilities such as Interstate access approvals (23 U.S.C. 111).
    Highway project means any undertaking to construct (including 
initial construction, reconstruction, replacement, rehabilitation, 
restoration, or other improvements) a highway, bridge, or tunnel, or any 
portion thereof, including environmental mitigation activities, which is 
eligible for assistance under title 23 of the United States Code. A 
highway project may include an undertaking that involves a series of 
contracts or phases, such as a corridor, and also may include anything 
that may be constructed in connection with a highway, bridge, or tunnel. 
However, the term highway project does not include any of the priority 
projects designated under Executive Order 13274; does not include any 
Federal Lands Highway project unless such project is to be designed and 
constructed by the State DOT; and does not include projects that are 
funded under chapter 53 of title 49, United States Code. Nothing in this 
part is intended to limit the consideration of any alternative in 
conducting an environmental analysis under any Federal environmental 
law, even if the particular alternative would provide for a project that 
is excluded under this section and may consider and include that 
alternative within the range of alternatives for a highway project.
    Program means the ``Surface Transportation Project Delivery 
Program'' established under 23 U.S.C. 327, which allows up to five State 
DOTs to assume

[[Page 441]]

all or part of the responsibilities for environmental review, 
consultation, or other action required under any Federal environmental 
law pertaining to the review or approval of one or more highway 
projects.


<R05>
Sec. 773.104  Eligibility.

    (a) Only a State DOT of a State is eligible to participate in the 
program.
    (b) The program is limited to a maximum five State DOTs, including 
the State DOTs of Alaska, California, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas as the 
five participant States. Should any of these five State DOTs choose not 
to apply, have its participation terminated, or withdraw from the pilot 
program, another State DOT may be selected.


<R05>
Sec. 773.105  Statements of interest.

    (a) The State DOTs of Alaska, California, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas 
are given priority for participation in the program.
    (b) Within sixty days of March 14, 2007, the State DOTs of Alaska, 
California, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas shall submit a statement of 
interest to participate in the program. The statement of interest shall 
declare that the State DOT intends to submit an application to 
participate in the pilot program.
    (c) Should any of the State DOTs of Alaska, California, Ohio, 
Oklahoma and Texas fail to submit a statement of interest by May 14, 
2007 or decline participation in the pilot program, such State DOT shall 
no longer be given priority consideration for selection in the program 
and its application will be selected in competition with other State 
DOTs.
    (d) Should any of the State DOTs of Alaska, California, Ohio, 
Oklahoma and Texas submit a statement of interest declaring their intent 
to participate in the program, the State shall actively work to develop 
and submit its application and meet all applicable program criteria 
(including the enactment of necessary State legal authority).


<R05>
Sec. 773.106  Application requirements for participation in the program.

    (a) Each State DOT wishing to participate in the program must submit 
an application to the FHWA.
    (b) Each application submitted to the FHWA must contain the 
following information:
    (1) The highway project(s) or classes of highway projects for which 
the State is requesting to assume FHWA's responsibilities under NEPA. 
The State DOT must specifically identify, in its application, each 
project for which a draft environmental impact statement has been issued 
prior to the submission of its application to the FHWA;
    (2) The specific responsibilities for the environmental review, 
consultation, or other action required under other Federal environmental 
laws, if any, pertaining to the review or approval of a highway project, 
or classes of highway projects, that the State DOT wishes to assume 
under this program. The State DOT must also indicate whether it proposes 
to phase-in the assumption of these responsibilities;
    (3) For each responsibility requested in paragraphs (b)(1) and 
(b)(2) of this section, the State DOT shall submit a description in the 
application detailing how it intends to carry out these 
responsibilities. The description shall include:
    (i) A summary of State procedures currently in place to guide the 
development of documents, analyses and consultations required to fulfill 
the environmental responsibilities requested. The actual procedures 
should be submitted with the application, or if available 
electronically, the Web link must be provided;
    (ii) Any changes that have been or will be made in the management of 
the environmental program to provide the additional staff and training 
necessary for quality control and assurance, appropriate levels of 
analysis, adequate expertise in areas where responsibilities have been 
requested, and expertise in management of the NEPA process;
    (iii) A discussion of how the State DOT will verify legal 
sufficiency for the environmental document it produces; and
    (iv) A discussion of how the State DOT will identify and address 
those projects that would normally require FHWA headquarters prior 
concurrence of the FEIS under 23 CFR 771.125(c).

[[Page 442]]

    (4) A verification of the personnel necessary to carry out the 
authority that may be granted under the program. The verification shall 
contain the following information:
    (i) A description of the staff positions, including management, that 
will be dedicated to providing the additional functions needed to accept 
the delegated responsibilities;
    (ii) A description of any changes to the State DOT's organizational 
structure that are deemed necessary to provide for efficient 
administration of the responsibilities assumed; and
    (iii) A discussion of personnel needs that may be met by the State 
DOTs use of outside consultants, including legal counsel provided by the 
State Attorney General or private counsel;
    (5) A summary of financial resources showing the anticipated 
financial resources available to meet the activities and staffing needs 
identified in (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this part, and a commitment to make 
adequate financial resources available to meet these needs;
    (6) Certification and explanation by State's Attorney General, or 
other State official legally empowered by State law, that the State DOT 
can and will assume the responsibilities of the Secretary for the 
Federal environmental laws and projects requested and that the State DOT 
will consent to exclusive Federal court jurisdiction with respect to the 
responsibilities being assumed. Such consent must be broad enough to 
include future changes in relevant Federal policies and procedures to 
which FHWA would be subject or such consent would be amended to include 
such future changes;
    (7) Certification by the State's Attorney General, or other State 
official legally empowered by State law, that the State has laws that 
are comparable to the Federal Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), 
including laws that allow for any decision regarding the public 
availability of a document under those laws to be reviewed by a court of 
competent jurisdiction; and
    (8) Evidence that the required notice and solicitation of public 
comment by the State DOT relating to participation in the program has 
taken place. Requirements for notice and solicitation of public comments 
are as follows:
    (i) not later than 30 days prior to submitting its application, a 
State must give notice that the State intends to participate in the 
program and solicit public comment by publishing the complete 
application of the State in accordance with the appropriate public 
notice law of the State. If allowed under State law, publishing a notice 
of availability of the application rather than the application itself 
may satisfy the requirements of this subparagraph so long as the 
complete application is made reasonably available to the public for 
inspection and copying, and
    (ii) copies of all comments received shall be submitted with the 
application. The State should summarize the comments received, and note 
changes, if any, that were made in the application in response to public 
comments.
    (c) The application shall be signed by the Governor or the head of 
the State agency having primary jurisdiction over highway matters. The 
application must also identify a point of contact for questions 
regarding the application. Applications may be submitted in electronic 
format.


<R05>
Sec. 773.107  Application approval.

    If a State DOT's application is approved, then the State DOT will be 
invited to enter into a written Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with 
the FHWA, as provided in 23 U.S.C. 327. None of FHWA's responsibilities 
under NEPA or other environmental laws may be assumed by the State DOT 
prior to execution of the MOU.


<R05>
Sec. 773.108  Application amendments.

    (a) After a State DOT submits its application to the FHWA, but prior 
to the execution of a MOU, the State DOT may amend its application at 
any time to request additional highway projects, classes of highway 
projects, or more environmental responsibilities. However, prior to 
making any such amendments, the State DOT must provide notice and 
solicit public comments with respect to the intended amendments. In 
submitting the amendment to the FHWA, the State DOT must provide copies 
of all comments received and note the changes, if any, that were made in 
response to the comments.

[[Page 443]]

    (b) A State DOT may amend its application no earlier than one year 
after a MOU has been executed to request additional highway projects, 
classes of highway projects, or more environmental responsibilities. 
However, prior to making any such amendments, the State DOT must provide 
notice and solicit public comments with respect to the intended 
amendments. In submitting the amendment to the FHWA, the State DOT must 
provide copies of all comments received and note the changes, if any, 
that were made in response to the comments.

<R05>
Sec. 774.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to implement 23 U.S.C. 138 and 49 U.S.C. 
303, which were originally enacted as Section 4(f) of the Department of 
Transportation Act of 1966 and are still commonly referred to as 
``Section 4(f).''


<R05>
Sec. 774.3  Section 4(f) approvals.

    The Administration may not approve the use, as defined in Sec. 
774.17, of Section 4(f) property unless a determination is made under 
paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.
    (a) The Administration determines that:
    (1) There is no feasible and prudent avoidance alternative, as 
defined in Sec. 774.17, to the use of land from the property; and
    (2) The action includes all possible planning, as defined in Sec. 
774.17, to minimize harm to the property resulting from such use; or
    (b) The Administration determines that the use of the property, 
including any measure(s) to minimize harm (such as any avoidance, 
minimization, mitigation, or enhancement measures) committed to by the 
applicant, will have a de minimis impact, as defined in Sec. 774.17, on 
the property.
    (c) If the analysis in paragraph (a)(1) of this section concludes 
that there is no feasible and prudent avoidance alternative, then the 
Administration may approve, from among the remaining alternatives that 
use Section 4(f) property, only the alternative that:
    (1) Causes the least overall harm in light of the statute's 
preservation purpose. The least overall harm is determined by balancing 
the following factors:
    (i) The ability to mitigate adverse impacts to each Section 4(f) 
property (including any measures that result in benefits to the 
property);
    (ii) The relative severity of the remaining harm, after mitigation, 
to the protected activities, attributes, or features that qualify each 
Section 4(f) property for protection;
    (iii) The relative significance of each Section 4(f) property;
    (iv) The views of the official(s) with jurisdiction over each 
Section 4(f) property;
    (v) The degree to which each alternative meets the purpose and need 
for the project;
    (vi) After reasonable mitigation, the magnitude of any adverse 
impacts to resources not protected by Section 4(f); and
    (vii) Substantial differences in costs among the alternatives.
    (2) The alternative selected must include all possible planning, as 
defined in Sec. 774.17, to minimize harm to Section 4(f) property.
    (d) Programmatic Section 4(f) evaluations are a time-saving 
procedural alternative to preparing individual Section 4(f) evaluations 
under paragraph (a) of this section for certain minor uses of Section 
4(f) property. Programmatic Section 4(f) evaluations are developed by 
the Administration based on experience with a specific set of conditions 
that includes project type, degree of use and impact, and evaluation of 
avoidance alternatives. \1\ An approved programmatic Section 4(f) 
evaluation may be relied upon to cover a particular project only if the 
specific conditions in the programmatic evaluation are met
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ FHWA has issued five programmatic Section 4(f) evaluations: (1) 
Final Nationwide Programmatic Section 4(f) Evaluation and Determination 
for Federal-Aid Transportation Projects That Have a Net Benefit to a 
Section 4(f) Property; (2) Nationwide Section 4(f) Evaluations and 
Approvals for Federally-Aided Highway Projects With Minor Involvement 
With Public Parks, Recreation Lands, Wildlife and Waterfowl Refuges, and 
Historic Sites; (3) Final Nationwide Section 4(f) Evaluation and 
Approval for Federally-Aided Highway Projects With Minor Involvements 
With Historic Sites; (4) Historic Bridges; Programmatic Section 4(f) 
Evaluation and Approval; and (5) Section 4(f) Statement and 
Determination for Independent Bikeway or Walkway Construction Projects.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) The determination whether a programmatic Section 4(f) evaluation 
applies to the use of a specific Section 4(f) property shall be 
documented as

[[Page 445]]

specified in the applicable programmatic Section 4(f) evaluation.
    (2) The Administration may develop additional programmatic Section 
4(f) evaluations. Proposed new or revised programmatic Section 4(f) 
evaluations will be coordinated with the Department of Interior, 
Department of Agriculture, and Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, and published in the Federal Register for comment prior to 
being finalized. New or revised programmatic Section 4(f) evaluations 
shall be reviewed for legal sufficiency and approved by the Headquarters 
Office of the Administration.
    (e) The coordination requirements in Sec. 774.5 must be completed 
before the Administration may make Section 4(f) approvals under this 
section. Requirements for the documentation and timing of Section 4(f) 
approvals are located in Sec. Sec. 774.7 and 774.9, respectively.

[73 FR 13395, Mar. 12, 2008, as amended at 73 FR 31610, June 3, 2008]


<R05>
Sec. 774.5  Coordination.

    (a) Prior to making Section 4(f) approvals under Sec. 774.3(a), the 
Section 4(f) evaluation shall be provided for coordination and comment 
to the official(s) with jurisdiction over the Section 4(f) resource and 
to the Department of the Interior, and as appropriate to the Department 
of Agriculture and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The 
Administration shall provide a minimum of 45 days for receipt of 
comments. If comments are not received within 15 days after the comment 
deadline, the Administration may assume a lack of objection and proceed 
with the action.
    (b) Prior to making de minimis impact determinations under Sec. 
774.3(b), the following coordination shall be undertaken:
    (1) For historic properties:
    (i) The consulting parties identified in accordance with 36 CFR part 
800 must be consulted; and
    (ii) The Administration must receive written concurrence from the 
pertinent State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) or Tribal Historic 
Preservation Officer (THPO), and from the Advisory Council on Historic 
Preservation (ACHP) if participating in the consultation process, in a 
finding of ``no adverse effect'' or ``no historic properties affected'' 
in accordance with 36 CFR part 800. The Administration shall inform 
these officials of its intent to make a de minimis impact determination 
based on their concurrence in the finding of ``no adverse effect'' or 
``no historic properties affected.''
    (iii) Public notice and comment, beyond that required by 36 CFR part 
800, is not required.
    (2) For parks, recreation areas, and wildlife and waterfowl refuges:
    (i) Public notice and an opportunity for public review and comment 
concerning the effects on the protected activities, features, or 
attributes of the property must be provided. This requirement can be 
satisfied in conjunction with other public involvement procedures, such 
as a comment period provided on a NEPA document.
    (ii) The Administration shall inform the official(s) with 
jurisdiction of its intent to make a de minimis impact finding. 
Following an opportunity for public review and comment as described in 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the official(s) with jurisdiction 
over the Section 4(f) resource must concur in writing that the project 
will not adversely affect the activities, features, or attributes that 
make the property eligible for Section 4(f) protection. This concurrence 
may be combined with other comments on the project provided by the 
official(s).
    (c) The application of a programmatic Section 4(f) evaluation to the 
use of a specific Section 4(f) property under Sec. 774.3(d)(1) shall be 
coordinated as specified in the applicable programmatic Section 4(f) 
evaluation.
    (d) When Federal encumbrances on Section 4(f) property are 
identified, coordination with the appropriate Federal agency is required 
to ascertain the agency's position on the proposed impact, as well as to 
determine if any other Federal requirements may apply to converting the 
Section 4(f) land to a different function. Any such requirements must be 
satisfied, independent of the Section 4(f) approval.


<R05>
Sec. 774.7  Documentation.

    (a) A Section 4(f) evaluation prepared under Sec. 774.3(a) shall 
include sufficient

[[Page 446]]

supporting documentation to demonstrate why there is no feasible and 
prudent avoidance alternative and shall summarize the results of all 
possible planning to minimize harm to the Section 4(f) property.
    (b) A de minimis impact determination under Sec. 774.3(b) shall 
include sufficient supporting documentation to demonstrate that the 
impacts, after avoidance, minimization, mitigation, or enhancement 
measures are taken into account, are de minimis as defined in Sec. 
774.17; and that the coordination required in Sec. 774.5(b) has been 
completed.
    (c) If there is no feasible and prudent avoidance alternative the 
Administration may approve only the alternative that causes the least 
overall harm in accordance with Sec. 774.3(c). This analysis must be 
documented in the Section 4(f) evaluation.
    (d) The Administration shall review all Section 4(f) approvals under 
Sec. Sec. 774.3(a) and 774.3(c) for legal sufficiency.
    (e) A Section 4(f) approval may involve different levels of detail 
where the Section 4(f) involvement is addressed in a tiered EIS under 
Sec. 771.111(g) of this chapter.
    (1) When the first-tier, broad-scale EIS is prepared, the detailed 
information necessary to complete the Section 4(f) approval may not be 
available at that stage in the development of the action. In such cases, 
the documentation should address the potential impacts that a proposed 
action will have on Section 4(f) property and whether those impacts 
could have a bearing on the decision to be made. A preliminary Section 
4(f) approval may be made at this time as to whether the impacts 
resulting from the use of a Section 4(f) property are de minimis or 
whether there are feasible and prudent avoidance alternatives. This 
preliminary approval shall include all possible planning to minimize 
harm to the extent that the level of detail available at the first-tier 
EIS stage allows. It is recognized that such planning at this stage may 
be limited to ensuring that opportunities to minimize harm at subsequent 
stages in the development process have not been precluded by decisions 
made at the first-tier stage. This preliminary Section 4(f) approval is 
then incorporated into the first-tier EIS.
    (2) The Section 4(f) approval will be finalized in the second-tier 
study. If no new Section 4(f) use, other than a de minimis impact, is 
identified in the second-tier study and if all possible planning to 
minimize harm has occurred, then the second-tier Section 4(f) approval 
may finalize the preliminary approval by reference to the first-tier 
documentation. Re-evaluation of the preliminary Section 4(f) approval is 
only needed to the extent that new or more detailed information 
available at the second-tier stage raises new Section 4(f) concerns not 
already considered.
    (3) The final Section 4(f) approval may be made in the second-tier 
CE, EA, final EIS, ROD or FONSI.
    (f) In accordance with Sec. Sec. 771.105(a) and 771.133 of this 
chapter, the documentation supporting a Section 4(f) approval should be 
included in the EIS, EA, or for a project classified as a CE, in a 
separate document. If the Section 4(f) documentation cannot be included 
in the NEPA document, then it shall be presented in a separate document. 
The Section 4(f) documentation shall be developed by the applicant in 
cooperation with the Administration.


<R05>
Sec. 774.9  Timing.

    (a) The potential use of land from a Section 4(f) property shall be 
evaluated as early as practicable in the development of the action when 
alternatives to the proposed action are under study.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, for actions 
processed with EISs the Administration will make the Section 4(f) 
approval either in the final EIS or in the ROD. Where the Section 4(f) 
approval is documented in the final EIS, the Administration will 
summarize the basis for its Section 4(f) approval in the ROD. Actions 
requiring the use of Section 4(f) property, and proposed to be processed 
with a FONSI or classified as a CE, shall not proceed until notification 
by the Administration of Section 4(f) approval.
    (c) After the CE, FONSI, or ROD has been processed, a separate 
Section 4(f) approval will be required, except as provided in Sec. 
774.13, if:

[[Page 447]]

    (1) A proposed modification of the alignment or design would require 
the use of Section 4(f) property; or
    (2) The Administration determines that Section 4(f) applies to the 
use of a property; or
    (3) A proposed modification of the alignment, design, or measures to 
minimize harm (after the original Section 4(f) approval) would result in 
a substantial increase in the amount of Section 4(f) property used, a 
substantial increase in the adverse impacts to Section 4(f) property, or 
a substantial reduction in the measures to minimize harm.
    (d) A separate Section 4(f) approval required under paragraph (c) of 
this section will not necessarily require the preparation of a new or 
supplemental NEPA document. If a new or supplemental NEPA document is 
also required under Sec. 771.130 of this chapter, then it should 
include the documentation supporting the separate Section 4(f) approval. 
Where a separate Section 4(f) approval is required, any activity not 
directly affected by the separate Section 4(f) approval can proceed 
during the analysis, consistent with Sec. 771.130(f) of this chapter.
    (e) Section 4(f) may apply to archeological sites discovered during 
construction, as set forth in Sec. 774.11(f). In such cases, the 
Section 4(f) process will be expedited and any required evaluation of 
feasible and prudent avoidance alternatives will take account of the 
level of investment already made. The review process, including the 
consultation with other agencies, will be shortened as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 774.11  Applicability.

    (a) The Administration will determine the applicability of Section 
4(f) in accordance with this part.
    (b) When another Federal agency is the Federal lead agency for the 
NEPA process, the Administration shall make any required Section 4(f) 
approvals unless the Federal lead agency is another U.S. DOT agency.
    (c) Consideration under Section 4(f) is not required when the 
official(s) with jurisdiction over a park, recreation area, or wildlife 
and waterfowl refuge determine that the property, considered in its 
entirety, is not significant. In the absence of such a determination, 
the Section 4(f) property will be presumed to be significant. The 
Administration will review a determination that a park, recreation area, 
or wildlife and waterfowl refuge is not significant to assure its 
reasonableness.
    (d) Where Federal lands or other public land holdings (e.g., State 
forests) are administered under statutes permitting management for 
multiple uses, and, in fact, are managed for multiple uses, Section 4(f) 
applies only to those portions of such lands which function for, or are 
designated in the plans of the administering agency as being for, 
significant park, recreation, or wildlife and waterfowl refuge purposes. 
The determination of which lands so function or are so designated, and 
the significance of those lands, shall be made by the official(s) with 
jurisdiction over the Section 4(f) resource. The Administration will 
review this determination to assure its reasonableness.
    (e) In determining the applicability of Section 4(f) to historic 
sites, the Administration, in cooperation with the applicant, will 
consult with the official(s) with jurisdiction to identify all 
properties on or eligible for the National Register of Historic Places 
(National Register). The Section 4(f) requirements apply to historic 
sites on or eligible for the National Register unless the Administration 
determines that an exception under Sec. 774.13 applies.
    (1) The Section 4(f) requirements apply only to historic sites on or 
eligible for the National Register unless the Administration determines 
that the application of Section 4(f) is otherwise appropriate.
    (2) The Interstate System is not considered to be a historic site 
subject to Section 4(f), with the exception of those individual elements 
of the Interstate System formally identified by FHWA for Section 4(f) 
protection on the basis of national or exceptional historic 
significance.
    (f) Section 4(f) applies to all archeological sites on or eligible 
for inclusion on the National Register, including those discovered 
during construction, except as set forth in Sec. 774.13(b).
    (g) Section 4(f) applies to those portions of federally designated 
Wild and

[[Page 448]]

Scenic Rivers that are otherwise eligible as historic sites, or that are 
publicly owned and function as, or are designated in a management plan 
as, a significant park, recreation area, or wildlife and waterfowl 
refuge. All other applicable requirements of the Wild and Scenic Rivers 
Act, 16 U.S.C. 1271-1287, must be satisfied, independent of the Section 
4(f) approval.
    (h) When a property formally reserved for a future transportation 
facility temporarily functions for park, recreation, or wildlife and 
waterfowl refuge purposes in the interim, the interim activity, 
regardless of duration, will not subject the property to Section 4(f).
    (i) When a property is formally reserved for a future transportation 
facility before or at the same time a park, recreation area, or wildlife 
and waterfowl refuge is established and concurrent or joint planning or 
development of the transportation facility and the Section 4(f) resource 
occurs, then any resulting impacts of the transportation facility will 
not be considered a use as defined in Sec. 774.17. Examples of such 
concurrent or joint planning or development include, but are not limited 
to:
    (1) Designation or donation of property for the specific purpose of 
such concurrent development by the entity with jurisdiction or ownership 
of the property for both the potential transportation facility and the 
Section 4(f) property; or
    (2) Designation, donation, planning, or development of property by 
two or more governmental agencies with jurisdiction for the potential 
transportation facility and the Section 4(f) property, in consultation 
with each other.


<R05>
Sec. 774.13  Exceptions.

    The Administration has identified various exceptions to the 
requirement for Section 4(f) approval. These exceptions include, but are 
not limited to:
    (a) Restoration, rehabilitation, or maintenance of transportation 
facilities that are on or eligible for the National Register when:
    (1) The Administration concludes, as a result of the consultation 
under 36 CFR 800.5, that such work will not adversely affect the 
historic qualities of the facility that caused it to be on or eligible 
for the National Register, and
    (2) The official(s) with jurisdiction over the Section 4(f) resource 
have not objected to the Administration conclusion in paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section.
    (b) Archeological sites that are on or eligible for the National 
Register when:
    (1) The Administration concludes that the archeological resource is 
important chiefly because of what can be learned by data recovery and 
has minimal value for preservation in place. This exception applies both 
to situations where data recovery is undertaken and where the 
Administration decides, with agreement of the official(s) with 
jurisdiction, not to recover the resource; and
    (2) The official(s) with jurisdiction over the Section 4(f) resource 
have been consulted and have not objected to the Administration finding 
in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (c) Designations of park and recreation lands, wildlife and 
waterfowl refuges, and historic sites that are made, or determinations 
of significance that are changed, late in the development of a proposed 
action. With the exception of the treatment of archeological resources 
in Sec. 774.9(e), the Administration may permit a project to proceed 
without consideration under Section 4(f) if the property interest in the 
Section 4(f) land was acquired for transportation purposes prior to the 
designation or change in the determination of significance and if an 
adequate effort was made to identify properties protected by Section 
4(f) prior to acquisition. However, if it is reasonably foreseeable that 
a property would qualify as eligible for the National Register prior to 
the start of construction, then the property should be treated as a 
historic site for the purposes of this section.
    (d) Temporary occupancies of land that are so minimal as to not 
constitute a use within the meaning of Section 4(f). The following 
conditions must be satisfied:
    (1) Duration must be temporary, i.e., less than the time needed for 
construction of the project, and there should be no change in ownership 
of the land;
    (2) Scope of the work must be minor, i.e., both the nature and the 
magnitude

[[Page 449]]

of the changes to the Section 4(f) property are minimal;
    (3) There are no anticipated permanent adverse physical impacts, nor 
will there be interference with the protected activities, features, or 
attributes of the property, on either a temporary or permanent basis;
    (4) The land being used must be fully restored, i.e., the property 
must be returned to a condition which is at least as good as that which 
existed prior to the project; and
    (5) There must be documented agreement of the official(s) with 
jurisdiction over the Section 4(f) resource regarding the above 
conditions.
    (e) Park road or parkway projects under 23 U.S.C. 204.
    (f) Certain trails, paths, bikeways, and sidewalks, in the following 
circumstances:
    (1) Trail-related projects funded under the Recreational Trails 
Program, 23 U.S.C. 206(h)(2);
    (2) National Historic Trails and the Continental Divide National 
Scenic Trail, designated under the National Trails System Act, 16 U.S.C. 
1241-1251, with the exception of those trail segments that are historic 
sites as defined in Sec. 774.17;
    (3) Trails, paths, bikeways, and sidewalks that occupy a 
transportation facility right-of-way without limitation to any specific 
location within that right-of-way, so long as the continuity of the 
trail, path, bikeway, or sidewalk is maintained; and
    (4) Trails, paths, bikeways, and sidewalks that are part of the 
local transportation system and which function primarily for 
transportation.
    (g) Transportation enhancement projects and mitigation activities, 
where:
    (1) The use of the Section 4(f) property is solely for the purpose 
of preserving or enhancing an activity, feature, or attribute that 
qualifies the property for Section 4(f) protection; and
    (2) The official(s) with jurisdiction over the Section 4(f) resource 
agrees in writing to paragraph (g)(1) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 774.15  Constructive use determinations.

    (a) A constructive use occurs when the transportation project does 
not incorporate land from a Section 4(f) property, but the project's 
proximity impacts are so severe that the protected activities, features, 
or attributes that qualify the property for protection under Section 
4(f) are substantially impaired. Substantial impairment occurs only when 
the protected activities, features, or attributes of the property are 
substantially diminished.
    (b) If the project results in a constructive use of a nearby Section 
4(f) property, the Administration shall evaluate that use in accordance 
with Sec. 774.3(a).
    (c) The Administration shall determine when there is a constructive 
use, but the Administration is not required to document each 
determination that a project would not result in a constructive use of a 
nearby Section 4(f) property. However, such documentation may be 
prepared at the discretion of the Administration.
    (d) When a constructive use determination is made, it will be based 
upon the following:
    (1) Identification of the current activities, features, or 
attributes of the property which qualify for protection under Section 
4(f) and which may be sensitive to proximity impacts;
    (2) An analysis of the proximity impacts of the proposed project on 
the Section 4(f) property. If any of the proximity impacts will be 
mitigated, only the net impact need be considered in this analysis. The 
analysis should also describe and consider the impacts which could 
reasonably be expected if the proposed project were not implemented, 
since such impacts should not be attributed to the proposed project; and
    (3) Consultation, on the foregoing identification and analysis, with 
the official(s) with jurisdiction over the Section 4(f) property.
    (e) The Administration has reviewed the following situations and 
determined that a constructive use occurs when:

[[Page 450]]

    (1) The projected noise level increase attributable to the project 
substantially interferes with the use and enjoyment of a noise-sensitive 
facility of a property protected by Section 4(f), such as:
    (i) Hearing the performances at an outdoor amphitheater;
    (ii) Sleeping in the sleeping area of a campground;
    (iii) Enjoyment of a historic site where a quiet setting is a 
generally recognized feature or attribute of the site's significance;
    (iv) Enjoyment of an urban park where serenity and quiet are 
significant attributes; or
    (v) Viewing wildlife in an area of a wildlife and waterfowl refuge 
intended for such viewing.
    (2) The proximity of the proposed project substantially impairs 
esthetic features or attributes of a property protected by Section 4(f), 
where such features or attributes are considered important contributing 
elements to the value of the property. Examples of substantial 
impairment to visual or esthetic qualities would be the location of a 
proposed transportation facility in such proximity that it obstructs or 
eliminates the primary views of an architecturally significant 
historical building, or substantially detracts from the setting of a 
Section 4(f) property which derives its value in substantial part due to 
its setting;
    (3) The project results in a restriction of access which 
substantially diminishes the utility of a significant publicly owned 
park, recreation area, or a historic site;
    (4) The vibration impact from construction or operation of the 
project substantially impairs the use of a Section 4(f) property, such 
as projected vibration levels that are great enough to physically damage 
a historic building or substantially diminish the utility of the 
building, unless the damage is repaired and fully restored consistent 
with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of 
Historic Properties, i.e., the integrity of the contributing features 
must be returned to a condition which is substantially similar to that 
which existed prior to the project; or
    (5) The ecological intrusion of the project substantially diminishes 
the value of wildlife habitat in a wildlife and waterfowl refuge 
adjacent to the project, substantially interferes with the access to a 
wildlife and waterfowl refuge when such access is necessary for 
established wildlife migration or critical life cycle processes, or 
substantially reduces the wildlife use of a wildlife and waterfowl 
refuge.
    (f) The Administration has reviewed the following situations and 
determined that a constructive use does not occur when:
    (1) Compliance with the requirements of 36 CFR 800.5 for proximity 
impacts of the proposed action, on a site listed on or eligible for the 
National Register, results in an agreement of ``no historic properties 
affected'' or ``no adverse effect;''
    (2) The impact of projected traffic noise levels of the proposed 
highway project on a noise-sensitive activity do not exceed the FHWA 
noise abatement criteria as contained in Table 1 in part 772 of this 
chapter, or the projected operational noise levels of the proposed 
transit project do not exceed the noise impact criteria for a Section 
4(f) activity in the FTA guidelines for transit noise and vibration 
impact assessment;
    (3) The projected noise levels exceed the relevant threshold in 
paragraph (f)(2) of this section because of high existing noise, but the 
increase in the projected noise levels if the proposed project is 
constructed, when compared with the projected noise levels if the 
project is not built, is barely perceptible (3 dBA or less);
    (4) There are proximity impacts to a Section 4(f) property, but a 
governmental agency's right-of-way acquisition or adoption of project 
location, or the Administration's approval of a final environmental 
document, established the location for the proposed transportation 
project before the designation, establishment, or change in the 
significance of the property. However, if it is reasonably foreseeable 
that a property would qualify as eligible for the National Register 
prior to the start of construction, then the property should be treated 
as a historic site for the purposes of this section; or

[[Page 451]]

    (5) Overall (combined) proximity impacts caused by a proposed 
project do not substantially impair the activities, features, or 
attributes that qualify a property for protection under Section 4(f);
    (6) Proximity impacts will be mitigated to a condition equivalent 
to, or better than, that which would occur if the project were not 
built, as determined after consultation with the official(s) with 
jurisdiction;
    (7) Change in accessibility will not substantially diminish the 
utilization of the Section 4(f) property; or
    (8) Vibration levels from project construction activities are 
mitigated, through advance planning and monitoring of the activities, to 
levels that do not cause a substantial impairment of protected 
activities, features, or attributes of the Section 4(f) property.


<R05>
Sec. 774.17  Definitions.

    The definitions contained in 23 U.S.C. 101(a) are applicable to this 
part. In addition, the following definitions apply:
    Administration. The FHWA or FTA, whichever is making the approval 
for the transportation program or project at issue. A reference herein 
to the Administration means the State when the State is functioning as 
the FHWA or FTA in carrying out responsibilities delegated or assigned 
to the State in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 325, 326, 327, or other 
applicable law.
    All possible planning. All possible planning means that all 
reasonable measures identified in the Section 4(f) evaluation to 
minimize harm or mitigate for adverse impacts and effects must be 
included in the project.
    (1) With regard to public parks, recreation areas, and wildlife and 
waterfowl refuges, the measures may include (but are not limited to): 
design modifications or design goals; replacement of land or facilities 
of comparable value and function; or monetary compensation to enhance 
the remaining property or to mitigate the adverse impacts of the project 
in other ways.
    (2) With regard to historic sites, the measures normally serve to 
preserve the historic activities, features, or attributes of the site as 
agreed by the Administration and the official(s) with jurisdiction over 
the Section 4(f) resource in accordance with the consultation process 
under 36 CFR part 800.
    (3) In evaluating the reasonableness of measures to minimize harm 
under Sec. 774.3(a)(2), the Administration will consider the 
preservation purpose of the statute and:
    (i) The views of the official(s) with jurisdiction over the Section 
4(f) property;
    (ii) Whether the cost of the measures is a reasonable public 
expenditure in light of the adverse impacts of the project on the 
Section 4(f) property and the benefits of the measure to the property, 
in accordance with Sec. 771.105(d) of this chapter; and
    (iii) Any impacts or benefits of the measures to communities or 
environmental resources outside of the Section 4(f) property.
    (4) All possible planning does not require analysis of feasible and 
prudent avoidance alternatives, since such analysis will have already 
occurred in the context of searching for feasible and prudent 
alternatives that avoid Section 4(f) properties altogether under Sec. 
774.3(a)(1), or is not necessary in the case of a de minimis impact 
determination under Sec. 774.3(b).
    (5) A de minimis impact determination under Sec. 774.3(b) subsumes 
the requirement for all possible planning to minimize harm by reducing 
the impacts on the Section 4(f) property to a de minimis level.
    Applicant. The Federal, State, or local government authority, 
proposing a transportation project, that the Administration works with 
to conduct environmental studies and prepare environmental documents. 
For transportation actions implemented by the Federal government on 
Federal lands, the Administration or the Federal land management agency 
may take on the responsibilities of the applicant described herein.
    CE. Refers to a Categorical Exclusion, which denotes an action with 
no individual or cumulative significant environmental effect pursuant to 
40 CFR 1508.4 and Sec. 771.117 of this chapter; unusual circumstances 
are taken into account in making categorical exclusion determinations.

[[Page 452]]

    De minimis impact. (1) For historic sites, de minimis impact means 
that the Administration has determined, in accordance with 36 CFR part 
800 that no historic property is affected by the project or that the 
project will have ``no adverse effect'' on the historic property in 
question.
    (2) For parks, recreation areas, and wildlife and waterfowl refuges, 
a de minimis impact is one that will not adversely affect the features, 
attributes, or activities qualifying the property for protection under 
Section 4(f).
    EA. Refers to an Environmental Assessment, which is a document 
prepared pursuant to 40 CFR parts 1500-1508 and Sec. 771.119 of this 
title for a proposed project that is not categorically excluded but for 
which an EIS is not clearly required.
    EIS. Refers to an Environmental Impact Statement, which is a 
document prepared pursuant to NEPA, 40 CFR parts 1500-1508, and 
Sec. Sec. 771.123 and 771.125 of this chapter for a proposed project 
that is likely to cause significant impacts on the environment.
    Feasible and prudent avoidance alternative. (1) A feasible and 
prudent avoidance alternative avoids using Section 4(f) property and 
does not cause other severe problems of a magnitude that substantially 
outweighs the importance of protecting the Section 4(f) property. In 
assessing the importance of protecting the Section 4(f) property, it is 
appropriate to consider the relative value of the resource to the 
preservation purpose of the statute.
    (2) An alternative is not feasible if it cannot be built as a matter 
of sound engineering judgment.
    (3) An alternative is not prudent if:
    (i) It compromises the project to a degree that it is unreasonable 
to proceed with the project in light of its stated purpose and need;
    (ii) It results in unacceptable safety or operational problems;
    (iii) After reasonable mitigation, it still causes:
    (A) Severe social, economic, or environmental impacts;
    (B) Severe disruption to established communities;
    (C) Severe disproportionate impacts to minority or low income 
populations; or
    (D) Severe impacts to environmental resources protected under other 
Federal statutes;
    (iv) It results in additional construction, maintenance, or 
operational costs of an extraordinary magnitude;
    (v) It causes other unique problems or unusual factors; or
    (vi) It involves multiple factors in paragraphs (3)(i) through 
(3)(v) of this definition, that while individually minor, cumulatively 
cause unique problems or impacts of extraordinary magnitude.
    FONSI. Refers to a Finding of No Significant Impact prepared 
pursuant to 40 CFR 1508.13 and Sec. 771.121 of this chapter.
    Historic site. For purposes of this part, the term ``historic site'' 
includes any prehistoric or historic district, site, building, 
structure, or object included in, or eligible for inclusion in, the 
National Register. The term includes properties of traditional religious 
and cultural importance to an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian 
organization that are included in, or are eligible for inclusion in, the 
National Register.
    Official(s) with jurisdiction. (1) In the case of historic 
properties, the official with jurisdiction is the SHPO for the State 
wherein the property is located or, if the property is located on tribal 
land, the THPO. If the property is located on tribal land but the Indian 
tribe has not assumed the responsibilities of the SHPO as provided for 
in the National Historic Preservation Act, then a representative 
designated by such Indian tribe shall be recognized as an official with 
jurisdiction in addition to the SHPO. When the ACHP is involved in a 
consultation concerning a property under Section 106 of the NHPA, the 
ACHP is also an official with jurisdiction over that resource for 
purposes of this part. When the Section 4(f) property is a National 
Historic Landmark, the National Park Service is also an official with 
jurisdiction over that resource for purposes of this part.
    (2) In the case of public parks, recreation areas, and wildlife and 
waterfowl refuges, the official(s) with jurisdiction are the official(s) 
of the agency or agencies that own or administer the

[[Page 453]]

property in question and who are empowered to represent the agency on 
matters related to the property.
    (3) In the case of portions of Wild and Scenic Rivers to which 
Section 4(f) applies, the official(s) with jurisdiction are the 
official(s) of the Federal agency or agencies that own or administer the 
affected portion of the river corridor in question. For State 
administered, federally designated rivers (section 2(a)(ii) of the Wild 
and Scenic Rivers Act, 16 U.S.C. 1273(a)(ii)), the officials with 
jurisdiction include both the State agency designated by the respective 
Governor and the Secretary of the Interior.
    ROD. Refers to a Record of Decision prepared pursuant to 40 CFR 
1505.2 and Sec. 771.127 of this chapter.
    Section 4(f) evaluation. Refers to the documentation prepared to 
support the granting of a Section 4(f) approval under Sec. 774.3(a), 
unless preceded by the word ``programmatic.'' A ``programmatic Section 
4(f) evaluation'' is the documentation prepared pursuant to Sec. 
774.3(d) that authorizes subsequent project-level Section 4(f) approvals 
as described therein.
    Section 4(f) Property. Section 4(f) property means publicly owned 
land of a public park, recreation area, or wildlife and waterfowl refuge 
of national, State, or local significance, or land of an historic site 
of national, State, or local significance.
    Use. Except as set forth in Sec. Sec. 774.11 and 774.13, a ``use'' 
of Section 4(f) property occurs:
    (1) When land is permanently incorporated into a transportation 
facility;
    (2) When there is a temporary occupancy of land that is adverse in 
terms of the statute's preservation purpose as determined by the 
criteria in Sec. 774.13(d); or
    (3) When there is a constructive use of a Section 4(f) property as 
determined by the criteria in Sec. 774.15.

<R05>
Sec. 777.1  Purpose.

    To provide policy and procedures for the evaluation and mitigation 
of adverse environmental impacts to wetlands and natural habitat 
resulting from Federal-aid projects funded pursuant to provisions of 
title 23, U.S. Code. These policies and procedures shall be applied by 
the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to projects under the Federal 
Lands Highway Program to the extent such application is deemed 
appropriate by the FHWA.


<R05>
Sec. 777.2  Definitions.

    In addition to those contained in 23 U.S.C. 101(a), the following 
definitions shall apply as used in this part:
    Biogeochemical transformations means those changes in chemical 
compounds and substances which naturally occur in ecosystems. Examples 
are the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles in nature, in which 
these elements are incorporated from inorganic substances into organic 
matter and recycled on a continuing basis.
    Compensatory mitigation means restoration, enhancement, creation, 
and under exceptional circumstances, preservation, of wetlands, wetland 
buffer areas, and other natural habitats, carried out to replace or 
compensate for the loss of wetlands or natural habitat area or 
functional capacity resulting from Federal-aid projects funded pursuant 
to provisions of title 23, U.S. Code. Compensatory mitigation usually 
occurs in advance of or concurrent with the impacts to be mitigated, but 
may occur after such impacts in special circumstances.
    Mitigation bank means a site where wetlands and/or other aquatic 
resources or natural habitats are restored, created, enhanced, or in 
exceptional circumstances, preserved, expressly for the purpose of 
providing

[[Page 454]]

compensatory mitigation in advance of authorized impacts to similar 
resources. For purposes of the Clean Water Act, Section 404 (33 U.S.C. 
1344), use of a mitigation bank can only be authorized when impacts are 
unavoidable.
    Natural habitat means a complex of natural, primarily native or 
indigenous vegetation, not currently subject to cultivation or 
artificial landscaping, a primary purpose of which is to provide habitat 
for wildlife, either terrestrial or aquatic. For purposes of this part, 
habitat has the same meaning as natural habitat. This definition 
excludes rights-of-way that are acquired with Federal transportation 
funds specifically for highway purposes.
    Net gain of wetlands means a wetland resource conservation and 
management principle under which, over the long term, unavoidable losses 
of wetlands area or functional capacity due to highway projects are 
offset by gains at a ratio greater than 1:1, through restoration, 
enhancement, preservation, or creation of wetlands or associated areas 
critical to the protection or conservation of wetland functions. This 
definition specifically excludes natural habitat, as defined in this 
section, other than wetlands.
    On-site, in-kind mitigation means compensatory mitigation which 
replaces wetlands or natural habitat area or functions lost as a result 
of a highway project with the same or like wetland or habitat type and 
functions adjacent or contiguous to the site of the impact.
    Practicable means available and capable of being done after taking 
into consideration cost, existing technology, and logistics, in light of 
overall project purposes.
    Service area of a mitigation bank means that the service area of a 
wetland or natural habitat mitigation bank shall be consistent with that 
in the Federal Guidance for the Establishment, Use and Operation of 
Mitigation Banks (60 FR 58605, November 28, 1995), i.e., the designated 
area (e.g., watershed, county) wherein a bank can be expected to provide 
appropriate compensation for impacts to wetlands and/or other aquatic or 
natural habitat resources.
    Wetland or habitat enhancement means activities conducted in 
existing wetlands or other natural habitat to achieve specific 
management objectives or provide conditions which previously did not 
exist, and which increase one or more ecosystem functions. Enhancement 
may involve tradeoffs between the resource structure, function, and 
values; a positive change in one may result in negative effects to other 
functions. Examples of activities which may be carried out to enhance 
wetlands or natural habitats include, but are not limited to, alteration 
of hydrologic regime, vegetation management, erosion control, fencing, 
integrated pest management and control, and fertilization.
    Wetland or habitat establishment period means a period of time 
agreed to by the FHWA, State DOT, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as 
necessary to establish wetland or natural habitat functional capacity in 
a compensatory mitigation project sufficient to compensate wetlands or 
habitat losses due to impacts of Federal-aid highway projects. The 
establishment period may vary depending on the specific wetland or 
habitat type being developed.
    Wetland or habitat functional capacity means the ability of a 
wetland or natural habitat to perform natural functions, such as provide 
wildlife habitat, support biodiversity, store surface water, or perform 
biogeochemical transformations, as determined by scientific functional 
assessment. Natural functions of wetlands include, but are not limited 
to, those listed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at 33 CFR 
320.4(b)(2)(i) through (viii).
    Wetland or habitat preservation means the protection of ecologically 
important wetlands, other aquatic resources, or other natural habitats 
in perpetuity through the implementation of appropriate legal and 
physical mechanisms. Preservation of wetlands for compensatory 
mitigation purposes may include protection of upland areas adjacent to 
wetlands as necessary to ensure protection and/or enhancement of the 
aquatic ecosystem.

    Wetland or habitat restoration means the reestablishment of wetlands 
or natural habitats on a site where they formerly existed or exist in a 
substantially degraded state.
    Wetland or wetlands means those areas that are inundated or 
saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration to 
support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of 
vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. 
Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas.
    Wetlands or habitat mitigation credit means a unit of wetlands or 
habitat mitigation, defined either by area or a measure of functional 
capacity through application of scientific functional assessment. With 
respect to mitigation banks, this definition means the same as that in 
the Federal Guidance for the Establishment, Use, and Operation of 
Mitigation Banks.

Sec. 777.3  Background.

    (a) Executive Order 11990 (42 FR 26961, 3 CFR, 1977 Comp., p. 121) 
Protection of Wetlands, and DOT Order 5660.1A, \1\ Preservation of the 
Nation's Wetlands, emphasize the important functions and values inherent 
in the Nation's wetlands. Federal agencies are directed to avoid new 
construction in wetlands unless the head of the agency determines that:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ DOT Order 5660.1A is available for inspection and copying from 
FHWA headquarters and field offices as prescribed at 49 CFR part 7.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) There is no practicable alternative to such construction, and
    (2) The proposed action includes all practicable measures to 
minimize harm to wetlands which may result from such use.
    (b) Sections 103 and 133 of title 23, U.S. Code, identify additional 
approaches for mitigation and management of impacts to wetlands and 
natural habitats which result from projects funded pursuant to title 23, 
U.S. Code, as eligible for participation with title 23, U.S. Code, 
funds.
    (c) 33 CFR parts 320 through 330, Regulatory Program, U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers; Section 404, Clean Water Act and 40 CFR part 230, 
Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines for the Specification of Disposal Sites for 
Dredged or Fill Material, establish requirements for the permitting of 
discharge of dredge or fill material in wetlands and other waters of the 
United States.
    (d) Federal Guidance for the Establishment, Use, and Operation of 
Mitigation Banks presents guidance for the use of ecological mitigation 
banks as compensatory mitigation in the Section 404 Regulatory Program 
for unavoidable impacts to wetlands and other aquatic resources.
    (e) Interagency Cooperation--Endangered Species Act of 1973, as 
amended (50 CFR part 402), presents regulations establishing interagency 
consultation procedures relative to impacts to species listed under the 
authority of the Act and their habitats as required by Section 7, 
Interagency Coordination, of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 
U.S.C. 1536).


<R05>
Sec. 777.5  Federal participation.

    (a) Those measures which the FHWA and a State DOT find appropriate 
and necessary to mitigate adverse environmental impacts to wetlands and 
natural habitats are eligible for Federal participation where the 
impacts are the result of projects funded pursuant to title 23, U.S. 
Code. The justification for the cost of proposed mitigation measures 
should be considered in the same context as any other public 
expenditure; that is, the proposed mitigation represents a reasonable 
public expenditure when weighed against other social, economic, and 
environmental values, and the benefit realized is commensurate with the 
proposed expenditure. Mitigation measures shall give like consideration 
to traffic needs, safety, durability, and economy of maintenance of the 
highway.
    (b) It is FHWA policy to permit, consistent with the limits set 
forth in this part, the expenditure of title 23, U.S. Code, funds for 
activities required for the planning, design, construction, monitoring, 
and establishment of wetlands and natural habitat mitigation projects, 
and acquisition of land or interests therein.

[[Page 456]]


<R05>
Sec. 777.7  Evaluation of impacts.

    (a) The reasonableness of the public expenditure and extent of 
Federal participation with title 23, U.S. Code, funds shall be directly 
related to:
    (1) The importance of the impacted wetlands and natural habitats;
    (2) The extent of highway impacts on the wetlands and natural 
habitats, as determined through an appropriate, interdisciplinary, 
impact assessment; and
    (3) Actions necessary to comply with the Clean Water Act, Section 
404, the Endangered Species Act of 1973, and other relevant Federal 
statutes.
    (b) Evaluation of the importance of the impacted wetlands and 
natural habitats shall consider:
    (1) Wetland and natural habitat functional capacity;
    (2) Relative importance of these functions to the total wetland or 
natural habitat resource of the area;
    (3) Other factors such as uniqueness, esthetics, or cultural values; 
and
    (4) Input from the appropriate resource management agencies through 
interagency coordination.
    (c) A determination of the highway impact should focus on both the 
short-and long-term affects of the project on wetland or natural habitat 
functional capacity, consistent with 40 CFR part 1500, 40 CFR 1502.16, 
33 CFR 320.4, and the FHWA's environmental compliance regulations, found 
at 23 CFR part 771.


<R05>
Sec. 777.9  Mitigation of impacts.

    (a) Actions eligible for Federal funding. There are a number of 
actions that can be taken to minimize the impact of highway projects on 
wetlands or natural habitats. The following actions qualify for Federal-
aid highway funding:
    (1) Avoidance and minimization of impacts to wetlands or natural 
habitats through realignment and special design, construction features, 
or other measures.
    (2) Compensatory mitigation alternatives, either inside or outside 
of the right-of-way. This includes, but is not limited to, such measures 
as on-site mitigation, when that alternative is determined to be the 
preferred approach by the appropriate regulatory agency; improvement of 
existing degraded or historic wetlands or natural habitats through 
restoration or enhancement on or off site; creation of new wetlands; and 
under exceptional circumstances, preservation of existing wetlands or 
natural habitats on or off site. Restoration of wetlands is generally 
preferable to enhancement or creation of new wetlands.
    (3) Improvements to existing wetlands or natural habitats. Such 
activities may include, but are not limited to, construction or 
modification of water level control structures or ditches, establishment 
of natural vegetation, re-contouring of a site, installation or removal 
of irrigation, drainage, or other water distribution systems, integrated 
pest management, installation of fencing, monitoring, and other measures 
to protect, enhance, or restore the wetland or natural habitat character 
of a site.
    (4) Mitigation banks. In accordance with all applicable Federal law 
(including regulations), with respect to participation in compensatory 
mitigation related to a project funded under title 23, U.S. Code, that 
has an impact on wetlands or natural habitat occurring within the 
service area of a mitigation bank, preference shall be given, to the 
maximum extent practicable, to the use of the mitigation bank, if the 
bank contains sufficient available credits to offset the impact and the 
bank is approved in accordance with the Federal Guidance for the 
Establishment, Use, and Operation of Mitigation Banks, or other 
agreement between appropriate agencies.
    (b) Mitigation banking alternatives eligible for participation with 
Federal-aid funds including such measures as the following:
    (1) Mitigation banks in which mitigation credits are purchased by 
State DOTs to mitigate impacts to wetlands or natural habitats due to 
projects funded under title 23, U.S. Code, including privately owned 
banks or those established with private funds to mitigate wetland or 
natural habitat losses.
    (2) Single purpose banks established by and for the use of a State 
DOT with Federal-aid participation; or multipurpose publicly owned 
banks, established with public, non-title 23 Federal highway funds, in 
which credits may be

[[Page 457]]

purchased by highway agencies using title 23 highway funds on a per-
credit basis.
    (c) Contributions to statewide and regional efforts to conserve, 
restore, enhance and create wetlands or natural habitats. Federal-aid 
funds may participate in the development of statewide and regional 
wetlands conservation plans, including any efforts and plans authorized 
pursuant to the Water Resources Development Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-
640, 104 Stat. 4604). Contributions to these efforts may occur in 
advance of project construction only if such efforts are consistent with 
all applicable requirements of Federal law and regulations and State 
transportation planning processes.
    (d) Mitigation or restoration of historic impacts to wetlands and 
natural habitats caused by past highway projects funded pursuant to 
title 23, U.S. Code, even if there is no current federally funded 
highway project in the immediate vicinity. These impacts must be related 
to transportation projects funded under the authority of title 23, U.S. 
Code.


<R05>
Sec. 777.11  Other considerations.

    (a) The development of measures proposed to mitigate impacts to 
wetlands or natural habitats shall include consultation with appropriate 
State and Federal agencies.
    (b) Federal-aid funds shall not participate in the replacement of 
wetlands or natural habitats absent sufficient assurances, such as, but 
not limited to, deed restrictions, fee ownership, permanent easement, or 
performance bond, that the area will be maintained as a wetland or 
natural habitat.
    (c) The acquisition of proprietary interests in replacement wetlands 
or natural habitats as a mitigation measure may be in fee simple, by 
easement, or by other appropriate legally recognized instrument, such as 
a banking instrument legally approved by the appropriate regulatory 
agency. The acquisition of mitigation credits in wetland or natural 
habitat mitigation banks shall be accomplished through a legally 
recognized instrument, such as permanent easement, deed restriction, or 
legally approved mitigation banking instrument, which provides for the 
protection and permanent continuation of the wetland or natural habitat 
nature of the mitigation.
    (d) A State DOT may acquire privately owned lands in cooperation 
with another public agency or third party. Such an arrangement may 
accomplish greater benefits than would otherwise be accomplished by the 
individual agency acting alone.
    (e) A State DOT may transfer the title to, or enter into an 
agreement with, an appropriate public natural resource management agency 
to manage lands acquired outside the right-of-way without requiring a 
credit to Federal funds. Any such transfer of title or agreement shall 
require the continued use of the lands for the purpose for which they 
were acquired. In the event the purpose is no longer served, the lands 
and interests therein shall immediately revert to the State DOT for 
proper disposition.
    (f) The reasonable costs of acquiring lands or interests therein to 
provide replacement lands with equivalent wetlands or natural habitat 
area or functional capacity associated with these areas are eligible for 
Federal participation.
    (g) The objective in mitigating impacts to wetlands in the Federal-
aid highway program is to implement the policy of a net gain of wetlands 
on a program wide basis.
    (h) Certain activities to ensure the viability of compensatory 
mitigation wetlands or natural habitats during the period of 
establishment are eligible for Federal-aid participation. These include, 
but are not limited to, such activities as repair or adjustment of water 
control structures, pest control, irrigation, fencing modifications, 
replacement of plantings, and mitigation site monitoring. The 
establishment period should be specifically determined by the mitigation 
agreement among the mitigation planners prior to beginning any 
compensatory mitigation activities.

Subpart B_Highway Public Transportation Projects and Special Use Highway 
                               Facilities


<R05>
Sec. 810.100  Purpose.

    The purpose of the regulations in this subpart is to implement 23 
U.S.C. 137, 142(a)(1), 142(b), and 149, which authorize various highway 
public mass transportation improvements and special use highway 
facilities as Federal-aid highway projects.


<R05>
Sec. 810.102  Eligible projects.

    Under this subpart the Federal Highway Administrator may approve on 
any Federal-aid system projects which facilitate the use of high 
occupancy vehicles and public mass transportation systems so as to 
increase the traffic capacity of the Federal-aid system for the movement 
of persons. Eligible projects include:
    (a) Construction of exclusive or preferential high occupancy 
vehicle, truck, or emergency vehicle lanes, except the

[[Page 460]]

construction of exclusive or preferential lanes limited to use by 
emergency vehicles can be approved only on the Federal-aid Interstate 
System;
    (b) Highway traffic control devices;
    (c) Passenger loading areas and facilities (including shelters) that 
are on or serve a Federal-aid system; and
    (d) Construction or designation of fringe and transportation 
corridor parking facilities. For parking facilities located in the 
central business district the Federal-aid project must be limited to 
space reserved exclusively for the parking of high occupancy vehicles 
used for carpools or vanpools.


<R05>
Sec. 810.104  Applicability of other provisions.

    (a) Projects authorized under Sec. 810.102 shall be deemed to be 
highway projects for all purposes of title 23 U.S.C., and shall be 
subject to all regulations of title 23 CFR.
    (b) Projects approved under this subpart on the Federal-aid 
Interstate System for exclusive or preferential high occupancy vehicle, 
truck, and emergency vehicle lanes are excepted from the minimum four-
lane requirement of 23 U.S.C. 109(b).
    (c) Exclusive or preferential lanes on the Interstate System, 
including approaches and directly related facilities, can be constructed 
with Interstate construction funds only if they were approved in the 
1981 Interstate Cost Estimate.
    (d) The Federal proportional share of a project approved under this 
subpart shall be as provided in 23 U.S.C. 120 for the class of funds 
involved. The Federal share for Interstate substitution projects is 85 
percent except for signalization projects which may be 100 percent as 
provided by 23 U.S.C. 120(d). The provisions of section 120(d) title 23 
U.S.C. may also be applied to regularly funded projects under Sec. 
810.102 of this subpart as follows:
    (1) Signalization projects.
    (2) Passenger loading area and facilities which principally serve 
carpools and vanpools.
    (3) Fringe and transportation corridor parking facilities or 
portions thereof which are reserved exclusively for use by carpool and 
vanpool passengers and vehicles.
    (e) As required by section 163 of the Surface Transportation 
Assistance Act of 1982, approval of Federal-aid highway funding for a 
physical construction or resurfacing project having a carpool lane(s) 
within the project limits may not be granted unless the project allows 
the use of the carpool lane(s) by motorcycles or it is certified by the 
State that such use will create a safety hazard. This requirement does 
not apply to high occupancy vehicle lanes which exclude carpools or to 
carpool lanes constructed by the State without the use of Federal-aid 
Highway funds. The issue of the extent of utilization of these 
facilities including those constructed prior to January 6, 1982 with 
Federal-aid Highway funds is a matter for individual determination by 
the State Highway Agency.


<R05>
Sec. 810.106  Approval of fringe and transportation corridor parking facilities.

    (a) In approving fringe and transportation corridor parking 
facilities, the Federal Highway Administrator:
    (1) Shall make a determination that the proposed parking facility 
will benefit the Federal-aid systems by improving its traffic capacity 
for the movement of persons;
    (2) May approve acquisition of land proximate to the right-of-way of 
a Federal-aid highway;
    (3) May approve construction of publicly-owned parking facilities on 
land within the right-of-way of any Federal-aid highway, including the 
use of the airspace above and below the established gradeline of the 
highway pavement, and on land, acquired with or without Federal-aid 
funds which is not within the right-of-way of any Federal-aid highway 
but which was acquired in accordance with the Uniform Relocation 
Assistance and Land Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (84 Stat. 1894, 42 
U.S.C. 4601 et seq.);
    (4) May permit the charging of fees for the use of the facility, 
except that the rate of the fee shall not be in excess of that required 
for maintenance and operation and the cost of providing shuttle service 
to and from the facility (including compensation to any person for 
operating such facility and for providing such shuttle service);

[[Page 461]]

    (5) Shall determine that the State, or the political subdivision 
thereof, where the project is to be located, or any agency or 
instrumentality of such State or political subdivision, has the 
authority and capability of constructing, maintaining, and operating the 
facility.
    (6) Shall receive assurance from the State that the facility will 
remain in public ownershp as long as the facility is needed and that any 
change in ownership shall have prior FHWA approval;
    (7) Shall enter into an agreement with the State, political 
subdivision, agency, or instrumentality governing the financing, 
maintenance, and operation of the parking facility; and
    (8) Shall approve design standards for constructing the facility as 
developed in cooperation with the State highway agency.
    (b) A State political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality 
thereof may contract with any person to operate any parking facility 
constructed under this section.
    (c) In authorizing projects involving fringe and transportation 
corridor parking facilities, the class of Federal-aid funds (primary, 
secondary, or urban system) used for projects under this subpart may be 
either funds designated for the Federal-aid system on which the facility 
is located or the Federal-aid system substantially benefited. For 
Interstate funds to be used for such eligible projects the Federal-aid 
Interstate system must be the system which substantially benefits. The 
benefiting system is that system which would have otherwise carried the 
high occupancy vehicle or rail passengers to their destination. 
Interstate construction funds may be used only where the parking 
facility was approved in the 1981 Interstate Cost Estimate and is 
constructed in conjunction with a high occupancy vehicle lane approved 
in the 1981 Interstate Cost Estimate.


<R05>
Sec. 810.108  Designation of existing facilities.

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of 23 CFR 810.102, the Federal 
Highway Administrator may approve on any Federal-aid system the work 
necessary to designate existing parking facilities (such as at shopping 
centers or other public or private locations) for fringe and 
transportation corridor parking.
    (1) Eligible activities include the acquisition of or the initial 
and renewal costs for leasing existing parking space, signing of and 
modifications to existing facilities, trail blazer signs, and passenger 
loading areas and facilities.
    (2) The approval criteria in 23 CFR 810.106 (a)(1), (4), (5), (7) 
and (8) apply to these parking facilities.
    (b) In accordance with the provisions of 23 CFR 810.102, the Federal 
Highway Administrator may approve on any Federal-aid system the work 
necessary to designate existing highway lanes as high occupancy vehicle 
lanes.
    (1) Eligible activities include preliminary engineering, signing, 
pavement marking, traffic control devices, minor physical modifications 
and initial inspection or monitoring of use.
    (2) Such improvements may be approved on any public road if they 
facilitate more efficient use of any Federal-aid highway.
    (c) Interstate construction funds may be used only where the 
proposed projects were approved in the 1981 Interstate Cost Estimate.

   Subpart C_Making Highway Rights-of-Way Available for Mass Transit 
                                Projects


<R05>
Sec. 810.200  Purpose.

    The purpose of this subpart is to implement 23 U.S.C. 142(g), which 
permits the Federal Highway Administrator to authorize a State to make 
available to a publicly-owned mass transit authority existing highway 
rights-of-way for rail or other non-highway public mass transit 
facilities.


<R05>
Sec. 810.202  Applicability.

    (a) The provisions of this subpart are applicable to the rights-of-
way of all Federal-aid highways in which Federal-aid highway funds have 
participated or will participate in any part of the cost of the highway.
    (b) The provisions of this subpart do not preclude acquisition of 
rights-of-way for use involving mass transit facilities under the 
provisions of subparts B and D of this part. Rights-of-way made 
available under this subpart

[[Page 462]]

may be used in combination with rights-of-way acquired under subparts B 
and D of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 810.204  Application by mass transit authority.

    A publicly-owned mass transit authority desiring to utilize land 
existing within the publicly acquired right-of-way of any Federal-aid 
highway for a rail or other nonhighway public mass transit facility may 
submit an application therefor to the State highway agency.


<R05>
Sec. 810.206  Review by the State Highway Agency.

    The State highway agency, after reviewing the application, may 
request the Federal Highway Administrator to authorize the State to make 
available to the publicly-owned mass transit authority the land needed 
for the proposed facility. A request shall be accompanied by evidence 
that utilization of the land for the proposed purposes will not impair

reservation of apportioned Federal-aid urban system funds. The State 
shall include in its submission advice that such reservation of funds 
will not impair its ability to comply with the provisions of section 
105(d) of Pub. L. 97-424 (if a State certifies it does not need forty 
percent of its Federal-aid urban system funds for 4R work, and the 
Secretary accepts such certification, the State may spend that unneeded 
amount for other eligible FAUS purpose, including nonhighway public mass 
transit projects).


<R05>
Sec. 810.306  Reservation of funds.

    (a) The FHWA Administrator shall review the State request, determine 
whether sufficient Federal-aid urban system funds are available, and 
notify the State highway agency and the UMTA Administrator of the 
reservation of funds.
    (b) The apportioned funds reserved for the proposed project under 
paragraph (a) of this section shall remain available for obligation 
unless the FHWA Administrator is notified that the application has been 
disapproved by the UMTA Administrator, or unless the responsible local 
officials in whose jurisdiction the project is to be located and the 
State highway agency jointly request the withdrawal of the project 
application.


<R05>
Sec. 810.308  Approval of urban system nonhighway public mass transit projects.

    (a) An urban system public mass transit project may be approved by 
the UMTA Administrator when it is determined that:
    (1) The application and project are in accordance with the current 
UMTA procedures relating to discretionary capital assistance grants; and
    (2) Notification has been received from the FHWA Administrator that 
sufficient apportioned Federal-aid urban system funds are available to 
finance the Federal share of the cost of the proposed project.
    (b) Approval of the plans, specifications, and estimates of a 
nonhighway public mass transit project shall be deemed to occur on the 
date the UMTA Administrator approves the project application. This 
approval which is subject to the availability of obligation authority at 
the time of approval, will obligate the United States to pay its 
proportional share of the cost of the project.
    (c) Upon approval of an urban system nonhighway public mass transit 
project, the UMTA Administrator will execute a grant contract covering 
implementation of the project.


<R05>
Sec. 810.310  Applicability of other provisions.

    The Federal proportional share of the cost of an urban system 
nonhighway public mass transit project approved under this subpart shall 
be equal to the Federal share which would have been paid if the project 
were a highway project as determined under 23 U.S.C. 120(a).

the occurrence of and the potential for fatalities and serious injuries 
resulting from crashes on all public roads.
    (b) Under 23 U.S.C. 148(a)(3), a variety of highway safety 
improvement projects are eligible for funding through the HSIP. In order 
for an eligible improvement to be funded with HSIP funds, States shall 
first consider whether the activity maximizes opportunities to advance 
safety. States shall fund safety projects or activities that are most 
likely to reduce the number of, or potential for, fatalities and serious 
injuries. Safety projects under any other section, and funded with 23 
U.S.C. 148 funds, are only eligible activities when a State is eligible 
to use up to 10 percent of the amount apportioned under 23 U.S.C. 
104(b)(5) for a fiscal year in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 148(e). This 
excludes minor activities that are incidental to a specific highway 
safety improvement project.
    (c) Other Federal-aid funds are eligible to support and leverage the 
safety program. Improvements to safety features that are routinely 
provided as part of a broader Federal-aid project should be funded from 
the same source as the broader project. States should address the full 
scope of their safety needs and opportunities on all roadway categories 
by using other funding sources such as Interstate Maintenance (IM), 
Surface Transportation Program (STP), National Highway System (NHS), and 
Equity Bonus (EB) funds in addition to HSIP funds.
    (d) Eligibility for Federal funding of projects for traffic control 
devices under this part is subject to a State and/or local 
jurisdiction's substantial conformance with National MUTCD or FHWA 
approved State MUTCDs and supplements in accordance with part 655, 
subpart F, of this title.

implementation, and evaluation of the HSIP and SHSP. These processes 
shall be developed by the States in consultation with the FHWA Division 
Administrator in accordance with this section. Where appropriate, the 
processes shall be developed cooperatively with officials of the various 
units of local and tribal governments. The processes may incorporate a 
range of procedures appropriate for the administration of an effective 
HSIP on individual highway systems, portions of highway systems,

[[Page 467]]

and in local political subdivisions, and when combined, shall cover all 
public roads in the State.

<R05>
Sec. 940.1  Purpose.

    This regulation provides policies and procedures for implementing 
section 5206(e) of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century 
(TEA-21), Public Law 105-178, 112 Stat. 457, pertaining to conformance 
with the National Intelligent Transportation Systems Architecture and 
Standards.


<R05>
Sec. 940.3  Definitions.

    Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) means electronics, 
communications, or information processing used singly or in combination 
to improve the efficiency or safety of a surface transportation system.
    ITS project means any project that in whole or in part funds the 
acquisition of technologies or systems of technologies that provide or 
significantly contribute to the provision of one or more ITS user 
services as defined in the National ITS Architecture.
    Major ITS project means any ITS project that implements part of a 
regional ITS initiative that is multi-jurisdictional, multi-modal, or 
otherwise affects regional integration of ITS systems.
    National ITS Architecture (also ``national architecture'') means a 
common framework for ITS interoperability. The National ITS Architecture 
comprises the logical architecture and physical architecture which 
satisfy a defined set of user services. The National ITS Architecture is 
maintained by the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) and 
is available on the DOT web site at http://www.its.dot.gov.
    Project level ITS architecture is a framework that identifies the 
institutional agreement and technical integration necessary to interface 
a major ITS project with other ITS projects and systems.
    Region is the geographical area that identifies the boundaries of 
the regional ITS architecture and is defined by and based on the needs 
of the participating agencies and other stakeholders. In metropolitan 
areas, a region should be no less than the boundaries of the 
metropolitan planning area.
    Regional ITS architecture means a regional framework for ensuring 
institutional agreement and technical integration for the implementation 
of ITS projects or groups of projects.
    Systems engineering is a structured process for arriving at a final 
design of a system. The final design is selected from a number of 
alternatives that would accomplish the same objectives and considers the 
total life-cycle of the project including not only the technical merits 
of potential solutions but also the costs and relative value of 
alternatives.


<R05>
Sec. 940.5  Policy.

    ITS projects shall conform to the National ITS Architecture and 
standards in accordance with the requirements contained in this part. 
Conformance with the National ITS Architecture is interpreted to mean 
the use of the National ITS Architecture to develop a regional ITS 
architecture, and the subsequent adherence of all ITS projects to that 
regional ITS architecture. Development of the regional ITS architecture 
should be consistent with the transportation planning process for 
Statewide and Metropolitan Transportation Planning.


<R05>
Sec. 940.7  Applicability.

    (a) All ITS projects that are funded in whole or in part with the 
highway

<R05>
Sec. 950.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to establish interoperability 
requirements for toll facilities that are tolled under section 1604 of 
the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A 
Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) (Pub. L. 109-59; 119 Stat. 1144) that use 
electronic toll collection.


<R05>
Sec. 950.3  Definitions.

    As used in this part:

[[Page 474]]

    1604 toll program refers to any of the tolling programs authorized 
under section 1604 of SAFETEA-LU. These programs include the Value 
Pricing Pilot Program, the Express Lanes Demonstration Program, and the 
Interstate System Construction Toll Pilot Program.
    Electronic toll collection means the ability for vehicle operators 
to pay tolls automatically without slowing down from normal highway 
speeds.
    Toll agency means the relevant public or private entity or entities 
to which toll authority has been granted for a facility under a 1604 
toll program.


<R05>
Sec. 950.5  Requirement to use electronic toll collection technology.

    (a) Any toll agency operating a toll facility pursuant to authority 
under a 1604 toll program shall use an electronic toll collection system 
as the method for collecting tolls from vehicle operators for the use of 
the facility unless the toll agency can demonstrate to the FHWA that 
some other method is either more economically efficient or will make the 
facility operate more safely. If a facility is collecting tolls pursuant 
to section 1604(b) of SAFETEA-LU, the toll agency shall only use 
electronic toll collection systems. Nothing in this subsection shall 
prevent a toll agency from using cash payment methods, such as toll 
booths, in areas that are not located in the toll facility's lanes of 
travel if the location and use of such methods do not create unsafe 
operating conditions on the toll facility.
    (b) A toll agency using electronic toll collection technology must 
develop and implement reasonable methods to enable vehicle operators 
that are not enrolled in a toll collection program that is interoperable 
with the toll collection system of the relevant toll facility to use the 
facility.
    (c) A toll agency using electronic toll collection technology must 
develop, implement, and make publicly available privacy policies to 
safeguard the disclosure of any data that may be collected through such 
technology concerning any user of a toll facility operating pursuant to 
authority under a 1604 toll program, but is not required to submit such 
policies to FHWA for approval.


<R05>
Sec. 950.7  Interoperability requirements.

    (a) For any toll facility operating pursuant to authority under a 
1604 toll program, the toll agency shall--
    (1) Identify the projected users of the facility;
    (2) Identify the predominant toll collection systems likely utilized 
by the users of the facility; and
    (3) Identify the noncash electronic technology likely to be in use 
within the next five years in that area.
    (b) Based on the identification conducted under subsection (a), the 
toll agency shall receive the FHWA's concurrence that the facility's 
toll collection system's standards and design meet the requirements of 
this part.
    (c) In requesting the FHWA's concurrence, the toll agency shall 
demonstrate to the FHWA that the selected toll collection system and 
technology achieves the highest reasonable degree of interoperability 
both with technology currently in use at other existing toll facilities 
and with technology likely to be in use at toll facilities within the 
next five years in that area. The toll agency shall explain to the FHWA 
how the toll collection system takes into account both the use of 
noncash electronic technology currently deployed within an appropriate 
geographic area of travel (as defined by the toll agency) and the 
noncash electronic technology likely to be in use within the next five 
years in that area. FHWA, in determining whether to concur in the toll 
agency's proposal, will give appropriate weight to current and future 
interoperability with toll facilities in that area. The facility's toll 
collection system design shall include the communications requirements 
between roadside equipment and toll transponders, as well as accounting 
compatibility requirements in order to ensure that users of the toll 
facilities are properly identified and tolls are charged to the 
appropriate account of the user.
    (d) A toll agency that operates any toll facility pursuant to 
authority under a 1604 toll program must upgrade its toll collection 
system to meet any

[[Page 475]]

applicable standards and interoperability tests that have been 
officially adopted through rulemaking by the FHWA.
    (e) With respect to facilities that are tolled pursuant to the Value 
Pricing Pilot Program, this part only applies if tolls are imposed on a 
facility after the effective date of this rule. However, such facility 
is subject to this part if the facility's toll collection system's 
method or technology used to collect tolls from vehicle operators is 
changed or upgraded after the effective date of the regulations in this 
part.
    (f) Nothing in this part shall be construed as requiring the use of 
any particular type of electronic toll collection technology. However, 
any such toll collection technology must meet the interoperability 
requirement of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 950.9  Enforcement.

    (a) The tolling authority of any facility operating pursuant to 
authority under a 1604 toll program shall be suspended in the event the 
relevant toll agency is not in compliance with this part within six (6) 
months of receiving a written notice of non-compliance from FHWA. If the 
toll agency demonstrates that it is taking the necessary steps to come 
into compliance within a reasonable period of time, FHWA shall extend 
such tolling authority.
    (b) The FHWA may take other action as may be appropriate, including 
action pursuant to Sec. 1.36 of this title.

    The purpose of this subpart is to implement 23 U.S.C. 204 which 
requires the Secretary and the Secretary of each appropriate Federal 
land management agency to the extent appropriate, to develop by rule 
safety, bridge, pavement, and congestion management systems for roads 
funded under the FLHP.


<R05>
Sec. 973.202  Applicability.

    The provisions in this subpart are applicable to the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs (BIA), the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and the 
Indian Tribal Governments (ITGs) that are responsible for satisfying 
these requirements for management systems pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 204.

[[Page 495]]


<R05>
Sec. 973.204  Management systems requirements.

    (a) The BIA, in consultation with the tribes, shall develop, 
establish and implement nationwide pavement, bridge, and safety 
management systems for federally and tribally owned IRRs. The BIA may 
tailor the nationwide management systems to meet the agency's goals, 
policies, and needs, after considering the input from the tribes, and 
using professional engineering and planning judgment to determine the 
required nature and extent of systems coverage consistent with the 
intent and requirements of this rule.
    (b) The BIA and the FHWA, in consultation with the tribes, shall 
develop an implementation plan for each of the nationwide management 
systems. These plans will include, but are not limited to, the 
following: Overall goals and policies concerning the nationwide 
management systems, each agency's responsibilities for developing and 
implementing the nationwide management systems, implementation schedule, 
data sources, including the need to accommodate State and local data, 
and cost estimate.
    (c) Indian tribes may develop, establish, and implement tribal 
management systems under a self-determination contract or self-
governance annual funding agreement. The tribe may tailor the management 
systems to meet its goals, policies, and needs, using professional 
engineering and planning judgment to determine the required nature and 
extent of systems coverage consistent with the intent and requirements 
of this rule.
    (d) The BIA, in consultation with the tribes, shall develop criteria 
for cases in which tribal management systems are not appropriate.
    (e) The BIA, in consultation with the tribes, or the tribes under a 
self-determination contract or self-governance annual funding agreement, 
may incorporate data provided by States and local governments into the 
nationwide or tribal management systems, as appropriate, for State and 
locally owned IRRs.
    (f) The BIA, in consultation with the tribes, shall develop and 
implement procedures for the development, establishment, implementation 
and operation of nationwide management systems. If a tribe develops 
tribal management systems, the tribe shall develop and implement 
procedures for the development, establishment, implementation and 
operation of tribal management systems. The procedures shall include:
    (1) A description of each management system;
    (2) A process to operate and maintain the management systems and 
their associated databases;
    (3) A process for data collection, processing, analysis and updating 
for each management system;
    (4) A process for ensuring the results of the management systems are 
considered in the development of IRR transportation plans and 
transportation improvement programs and in making project selection 
decisions under 23 U.S.C. 204; and
    (5) A process for the analysis and coordination of all management 
systems outputs to systematically operate, maintain, and upgrade 
existing transportation assets cost-effectively;
    (g) All management systems shall use databases with a common or 
coordinated reference system that can be used to geolocate all database 
information.
    (h) Existing data sources may be used by the BIA and the tribes to 
the maximum extent possible to meet the management system requirements.
    (i) A nationwide congestion management system is not required. The 
BIA and the FHWA, in consultation with the tribes, shall develop 
criteria for determining when congestion management systems are required 
for BIA or tribal transportation facilities providing access to and 
within the Indian reservations. Either the tribes or the BIA, in 
consultation with the tribes, shall develop, establish and implement 
congestion management systems for the transportation facilities that 
meet the criteria.
    (j) The BIA shall develop an appropriate means to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the nationwide management systems in enhancing 
transportation investment decisions and improving the overall efficiency 
of the affected transportation systems and facilities.

[[Page 496]]

This evaluation is to be conducted periodically, preferably as part of 
the BIA planning process to assist the FHWA in evaluating the efficiency 
and effectiveness of the management systems as a component of the IRR 
program, and may include consultation with the tribes, as appropriate.
    (k) The management systems shall be operated so investment decisions 
based on management system outputs can be accomplished at the BIA region 
and tribal level and can be utilized throughout the transportation 
planning process.


<R05>
Sec. 973.206  Funds for establishment, development, and implementation of the systems.

    The IRR program management funds may be used to accomplish 
nationwide management system activities. For tribal management system 
activities, the IRR two percent tribal transportation planning or

<R05>
Sec. 1200.10  Application.

    Each fiscal year, a State's application for funds for its highway 
safety program shall consist of the following components:
    (a) A Performance Plan, containing the following elements:
    (1) A list of objective and measurable highway safety goals, within 
the National Priority Program Areas and other program areas, based on 
highway safety problems identified by the State during the processes 
under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Each goal must be accompanied by 
at least one performance measure that enables the State to track 
progress, from a specific baseline, toward meeting the goal (e.g., a 
goal to ``increase safety belt use from XX percent in 19---- to YY 
percent in 20----,'' using a performance measure of ``percent of 
restrained occupants in front outboard seating positions in passenger 
motor vehicles'').
    (2) A brief description of the processes used by the State to

and performance measures, and develop projects and activities to address 
its problems and achieve its goals. In describing these processes, the 
State shall identify the participants in the processes (e.g., highway 
safety committees, community and constituent groups), discuss the 
strategies for project or activity selection (e.g., constituent 
outreach, public meetings, solicitation of proposals), and list the 
information and data sources consulted.
    (b) A Highway Safety Plan, approved by the Governor's Representative 
for Highway Safety, describing the projects and activities the State 
plans to implement to reach the goals identified in the Performance 
Plan. The Highway Safety Plan must, at a minimum, describe one year of 
Section 402 program activities (and may include activities funded from 
other sources, so long as the source of funding is clearly 
distinguished).
    (c) A Certification Statement, signed by the Governor's 
Representative for Highway Safety, providing assurances that the State 
will comply with applicable laws and regulations, financial and 
programmatic requirements, and in accordance with Sec. 1200.11 of this 
part, the special funding conditions of the Section 402 program.
    (d) A Program Cost Summary (HS Form 217 or its electronic 
equivalent), completed to reflect the State's proposed allocations of 
funds (including carry-forward funds) by program area, based on the 
goals identified in the Performance Plan and the projects and activities 
identified in the Highway Safety Plan. The funding level used shall be 
an estimate of available funding for the upcoming fiscal year.

from the prior-year Highway Safety Program (carry-forward funds) will be 
available for immediate use by the State on October 1. Reimbursement 
will be contingent upon the submission of an updated HS Form 217 (or its 
electronic equivalent), consistent with the requirements of 23 CFR 
1200.14(d), within 30 days after either the beginning of the fiscal year 
identified above or the date of this letter, whichever is later.

    (c) If approval is withheld, for reasons of non-compliance with 
Sec. 1200.10 or Sec. 1200.11 of this part or other applicable law, the 
Approving Official shall identify in writing the specific area(s) of 
non-compliance which formed the basis for withholding approval.

by law on the use of the funds.
    (c) The funds distributed under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section 
shall be available for expenditure by the states to satisfy the Federal 
share of expenses under the approved highway safety program, and shall 
constitute a contractual obligation of the Federal Government, subject 
to any conditions or limitations identified in the distributing 
document.
    (d)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c) of this 
section, reimbursement of State expenses shall be contingent upon the 
submission of an updated HS Form 217 (or its electronic equivalent),

    Any funds which remain unexpended after final reconciliation shall 
be carried forward, credited to the State's highway safety account for 
the new fiscal year, and made immediately available for use under the 
State's new highway safety program, subject to the approval requirements 
of Sec. 1200.13 of this part. Carry-forward funds must be identified by 
the program area from which they are removed when they are reprogrammed 
from the previous fiscal year. Once so identified, such funds are

within 4 years from the date that a State's apportionment is reduced 
under Sec. 1225.8, the apportionment for such State shall be increased 
by an amount equal to the reduction, as illustrated by appendix A of 
this part. The restored apportionment will be available to a State, as 
quickly as possible, upon a determination by NHTSA that the State is in 
conformance and notification to the FHWA.

certifications on or before September 30, to avoid the withholding of 
funds in a fiscal year.
    (b) This notification of compliance will take place through FHWA's 
normal certification of apportionments process. If the agencies do not 
receive a certification from a State, by June 15 of any fiscal year, or 
if the certification does not conform to the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 
163 and this part, the agencies will make an initial determination that 
the State is not in compliance.

with 23 U.S.C. 163 and this part, based on NHTSA and FHWA's preliminary 
review of its certification, will be advised of the amount of funds 
expected to be withheld under Sec. 1225.8 from apportionment, as part 
of the advance notice of apportionments required under 23 U.S.C. 104(e), 
which is ordinarily issued on July 1 of each fiscal year.
    (b) If NHTSA and FHWA determine that any State is not in compliance 
with 23 U.S.C. 163 and this part, based on the agencies' preliminary 
review, the State may submit documentation showing why it is in 
compliance. States will have until September 30 to rebut the initial 
determination or to come into compliance with 23 U.S.C. and this part. 
Documentation shall be submitted through NHTSA's Regional 
Administrators, who will refer the requests to appropriate NHTSA and 
FHWA offices for review.
    (c) Each fiscal year, each State determined not to be in compliance 
with 23 U.S.C. 163 and this part, based on NHTSA's and FHWA's final 
determination, will receive notice of the funds being withheld under 
Sec. 1225.8 from apportionment, as part of the certification of 
apportionments required under 23 U.S.C. 104(e), which normally occurs on 
October 1 of each fiscal year.

                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 1240.1  Purpose.

    This part establishes requirements and procedures governing the 
allocation of funds to States made under 23 U.S.C. 157(c), based on seat 
belt use rates.


<R05>
Sec. 1240.2  Applicability.

    These procedures apply to all allocations of funds to States, based 
on seat belt use rates, beginning with allocations for fiscal year 1999.


<R05>
Sec. 1240.3  Definitions.

    As used in this part--
    Base seat belt use rate means the highest State seat belt use rate 
for the State for any calendar year during the period from 1996 through 
the calendar year preceding the previous calendar year;
    Federal medical savings means the amount of Federal budget savings 
relating to Federal medical costs (including savings under the Medicare 
and Medicaid programs under titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security 
Act (42 U.S.C.1395 et seq.)), as determined under this part;
    FHWA means the Federal Highway Administration;
    NHTSA means the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration;
    Passenger motor vehicle means a passenger car, pickup truck, van, 
minivan, or sport utility vehicle;
    State means any of the fifty States, the District of Columbia, or 
Puerto Rico.
    State seat belt use rate means the seat belt use rate for a State, 
rounded to the nearest tenth of one percent, after any required 
weighting, adjustment, or substitution under this part, that is used in 
determining eligibility for and the amount of an allocation under this 
part.


<R04>
                 Subpart B_Determination of Allocations


<R05>
Sec. 1240.10  Identification of eligible States.

    (a) On or about September 1, 1998, and each September 1 thereafter, 
NHTSA will identify, on the basis of seat belt use rates determined, as 
applicable, under Sec. Sec. 1240.11, 1240.12, and 1240.13 of this 
part--
    (1) Each State that had a State seat belt use rate during the 
previous calendar year and the year preceding the previous calendar year 
that exceeded the national average seat belt use rate for each of those 
years; and
    (2) Each State that does not meet the requirements of paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section and that had a State seat belt use rate during 
the previous calendar year that exceeded the State's base seat belt use 
rate.
    (b) Any seat belt use rate used in making the determinations under 
this

[[Page 528]]

part shall be rounded to the nearest tenth of one percent.
    (c) A State identified under paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this 
section, and not ineligible under Sec. 1240.12(a)(2) of this part, 
shall receive an allocation of funds reflecting the Federal medical 
savings, in accordance with the procedures of Sec. Sec. 1240.14 and 
1240.15 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1240.11  Determination of State seat belt use rate for calendar years 1996 and 1997.

    (a) Review of State-submitted information. NHTSA will review 
available seat belt use rate information submitted by each State for 
calendar years 1996 and 1997 to determine whether--
    (1) Measurements of seat belt use were based on direct observation;
    (2) At least 70 percent of observation sites were surveyed during 
the calendar year for which the seat belt use rate is reported;
    (3) All passenger motor vehicles were sampled; and
    (4) All front seat outboard occupants in the sampled vehicles were 
counted.
    (b) Determination of State seat belt use rate. Seat belt use rate 
information submitted by a State for calendar year 1996 or 1997 will 
be--
    (1) Accepted as the State seat belt use rate if it satisfies 
paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(4) of this section.
    (2) Accepted after adjustment in accordance with the procedures of 
Appendix A of this part, as the State seat belt use rate, if it 
satisfies paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, but fails to 
satisfy paragraph (a)(3) or (a)(4) of this section.
    (3) Rejected, and the procedures of Appendix B of this part shall 
apply, if it fails to satisfy paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this 
section.


<R05>
Sec. 1240.12  Determination of State seat belt use rate for calendar year 1998 and beyond.

    (a) State seat belt use survey. (1) Beginning in calendar year 1998, 
State seat belt use rates used for determining allocations under this 
part shall be based on a survey conducted each calendar year by each 
State that satisfies all the requirements of Part 1340 of this title 
(the Uniform Criteria for State Observational Surveys of Seat Belt Use).
    (2) A State that does not conduct a survey required under paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section in any calendar year, or that conducts a survey 
that does not satisfy all the requirements of part 1340 of chapter III 
of this title, shall be ineligible for an allocation of funds on the 
basis of both Sec. 1240.10(a)(1) and Sec. 1240.10(a)(2) of this part 
during the second and third succeeding fiscal years (e.g., if a State 
fails to conduct a conforming survey in calendar year 1998, the State is 
ineligible for an allocation of funds during FY 2000 and FY 2001).
    (b) Submission of survey information. (1) Each State shall submit to 
NHTSA, no later than March 1st after the calendar year during which a 
survey required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section is conducted, the 
seat belt use rate determined under the survey, reported as a percentage 
to one decimal place, accompanied by a survey report, consisting of all 
documentation identified in Sec. 1340.5 of chapter III of this title 
and summarizing the results of any analyses conducted under the survey.
    (2) NHTSA will review a survey report submitted under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section to determine whether the survey complies with all 
the requirements of Sec. 1340 of chapter III of this title. Written 
notice of approval or disapproval of a survey will be sent to the 
Governor's Representative for Highway Safety within 30 days of receipt 
of the survey report. Any notice of disapproval will be accompanied by a 
detailed statement of the reasons for disapproval.
    (3) A State may elect to submit a description of its proposed survey 
methodology, consisting of all documentation identified in Sec. 1340.5 
(a), (b) and (c)(3) of chapter III of this title for advance review, 
prior to conducting the survey.
    (4) NHTSA will review a proposed survey methodology submitted under 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section and inform the Governor's 
Representative for Highway Safety in writing within 30 days of receipt 
of the proposed methodology whether the survey, if conducted in 
accordance with the methodology,

[[Page 529]]

would comply with all the requirements of Sec. 1340 of chapter III of 
this title. Any notice indicating non-compliance will be accompanied by 
a detailed statement of the reasons.
    (5) A State that submits a description of its proposed survey 
methodology under paragraph (b)(3) of this section continues to be 
required to submit all information required under paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section, after the State conducts its survey, for review under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (c) Submission of Certification--calendar year 1998 surveys. (1) A 
survey conducted by a State in calendar year 1998 shall be deemed to 
comply with the requirements of Sec. 1340 of chapter III of this title, 
if--
    (i) The survey's design was approved by the agency, in writing, on 
or after June 29, 1992, for the purposes of the grant program authorized 
under 23 U.S.C. 153;
    (ii) The survey design has remained unchanged since the survey was 
approved (except to the extent that the requirements of paragraph 
(c)(1)(iii) constitute a change); and
    (iii) The survey samples all passenger motor vehicles, measures seat 
belt use by all front seat outboard occupants in the sampled vehicles, 
and counts seat belt use only within the calendar year for which the 
seat belt use rate is reported.
    (2) A State that meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section shall submit a certification signed by the Governor's 
Representative for Highway Safety, in the form prescribed in Appendix C 
of this part, accompanied by the information required under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section.
    (3) Written notice of acceptance or rejection of a certification 
will be sent to the Governor's Representative for Highway Safety within 
30 days of receipt of the information required under paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section. Any notice of rejection will be accompanied by a detailed 
statement of the reasons for rejection.
    (d) Determination of State seat belt use rate. The seat belt use 
rate submitted by the State for a calendar year will be accepted as the 
State seat belt use rate for that calendar year if--
    (1) It was determined under a survey whose survey report was 
approved under paragraph (b)(2) of this section; or
    (2) For calendar year 1998 only, the State satisfies the 
requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, and its 
certification is accepted under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1240.13  Determination of national average seat belt use rate.

    The national average seat belt use rate for a calendar year shall be 
the sum of the individual State seat belt use rates for all the States, 
after weighting each individual State seat belt use rate in accordance 
with the procedures of Appendix D of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1240.14  Determination of Federal medical savings and notification of proposed allocations.

    On or about September 1, 1998, and each September 1 thereafter, 
NHTSA will--
    (a) Calculate, in accordance with the procedures in Appendix E of 
this part, the Federal medical savings and each State's share of those 
savings, due to the amount by which the State seat belt use rate for the 
previous calendar year--
    (1) Exceeds the national average seat belt use rate for that 
calendar year, for each State described in Sec. 1240.10(a)(1) of this 
part; or
    (2) Exceeds the State's base seat belt use rate, for each State 
described in Sec. 1240.10(a)(2) of this part; and
    (b) Notify the States described in Sec. 1240.10(c) of this part of 
their proposed allocations, which shall be equal to the amount of the 
Federal medical savings calculated under paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of 
this section, as applicable, reduced proportionately across all States 
if the allocations would exceed the total amount authorized for 
allocation during the fiscal year.


<R05>
Sec. 1240.15  Allocations.

    (a) Funds allocated under this part shall be available for any 
projects eligible for assistance under title 23, United States Code.
    (b) Not later than 25 days after notification under Sec. 1240.14(b) 
of this part, the Governor's Representative for

[[Page 530]]

Highway Safety and the Secretary of the State's Department of 
Transportation for each State that receives notification shall jointly 
identify, in writing to the appropriate NHTSA Regional Administrator and 
FHWA Division Administrator, the amounts of the State's proposed 
allocations that will be used in highway safety programs and in Federal-
aid highway programs.
    (c) On or about October 1, 1998, and each October 1 thereafter, the 
funds to which a State is entitled under this part will be allocated in 
the proportions identified by the State under paragraph (b) of this 
section, reduced proportionately across all States if the allocations 
would, in the aggregate, exceed total obligation limitations applicable 
to 23 U.S.C. 157.
    (d) Thereafter, each State shall identify specific NHTSA program 
areas and FHWA projects for which the allocated funds will be used.


<R05>
Sec. Appendix A to Part 1240--Adjustment Procedures for State-Submitted 
               Information (Calendar Years 1996 and 1997)

    A. In States where State-submitted information on seat belt use 
rates does not include data for Front outboard occupants in passenger 
motor vehicles (FOPV), an adjustment will be made based on the national 
ratio of seat belt use rates for FOPV to the seat belt use rate for the 
group of occupants and vehicles that were included in the State-
submitted information. The national seat belt use rates will be derived 
from the most recent National Occupant Protection Use Survey (NOPUS). 
For each affected State, the adjustment will be made by dividing the 
NOPUS seat belt use rate for FOPV by the NOPUS seat belt use rate for 
the surveyed group, or the seat belt use rate for the closest available 
group to the surveyed group. The NOPUS seat belt use rate for FOPV will 
be derived for each affected State by weighting the NOPUS seat belt use 
rates for passenger cars and for passenger motor vehicles that are not 
passenger cars (hereafter LTVs) by the relative number of registrations 
of passenger cars and LTVs in each State. This method will produce a 
factor which will be multiplied by the State's survey-based seat belt 
use rate to produce an adjusted seat belt use rate reflecting the 
required vehicle and occupant population.
    B. The process may be expressed mathematically as follows:

U<INF>a</INF> = U<INF>s</INF>((N<INF>pc</INF> * R<INF>pc</INF> + 
N<INF>ltv</INF> * R<INF>ltv</INF>) / N<INF>s</INF>)

Where:

U<INF>a</INF> = the adjusted State seat belt use rate
U<INF>s</INF> = the State-submitted seat belt use rate
N<INF>pc</INF> = the national front outboard passenger car seat belt use 
rate from NOPUS
N<INF>ltv</INF> = the national front outboard LTV seat belt use rate 
from NOPUS
R<INF>pc</INF> = the portion of State passenger motor vehicle 
registrations that are passenger cars
R<INF>ltv</INF> = the portion of State passenger motor vehicle 
registrations that are LTVs
N<INF>s</INF> = the national seat belt use rate for the State-surveyed 
vehicle and occupant population (or closest available group from NOPUS)


<R05>
   Sec. Appendix B to Part 1240--Procedures for Missing or Inadequate 
       State-Submitted Information (Calendar Years 1996 and 1997)

    A. If State-submitted seat belt use rate information is unavailable 
or inadequate for both calendar years 1996 and 1997, State seat belt use 
rates for calendars year 1996 and 1997 will be estimated based on seat 
belt use rates of fatally-injured occupants. Data from the Fatality 
Analysis Reporting System (FARS) will be translated into estimated 
observed seat belt use rates using an algorithm that relates historical 
belt use by fatally-injured occupants to observed use. \1\

Use. Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Transportation, NHTSA, DOT HS 
808 133, June, 1994.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    B. The algorithm is as follows:

u = (-.221794 + [radic].049193 + .410769F) / .456410

Where:

u = the estimated observed seat belt use
F = the seat belt use in potentially fatal crashes

    In the above formula, F is calculated as follows:

F = (f / (1 - e)) / ((f / (1 - e)) + 1 - f)

Where:

F = the seat belt use in potentially fatal crashes
e = State-specific weighted average effectiveness of seat belts in 
passenger cars and passenger motor vehicles that are not passenger cars
f = State-specific seat belt use rate of fatally-injured occupants of 
passenger vehicles

    C. If State-submitted seat belt use rate information is available 
for either calendar year 1996 or 1997, but not both, a State seat belt 
use rate for the year for which information is missing will be estimated 
by calculating the percent change in the FARS-based observed seat belt 
use rate (derived from the above algorithm) between the two years.

[[Page 531]]

This factor will then be applied to the seat belt use rate from the 
known year to derive an estimate of the seat belt use rate for the 
unknown year.

design was approved by NHTSA, in writing, on or after June 29, 1992, 
under the provisions of the grant program authorized by 23 U.S.C. 153.
    2. The survey design has remained unchanged since the survey was 
approved (except to the extent that the requirements of paragraph 3 
constitute a change).
    3. The survey samples all passenger motor vehicles (including cars, 
pickup trucks, vans, minivans, and sport utility vehicles), measures 
seat belt use by all front outboard occupants in the sampled vehicles, 
and counts seat belt use completely within the calendar year for which 
the seat belt use rate is reported.

  Sec. Appendix D to Part 1240--Determination of National Average Seat 
                              Belt Use Rate

    A. To determine the national average seat belt use rate in a 
calendar year, each State seat belt use rate for the calendar year will 
be weighted to reflect the percentage of total national vehicle miles 
traveled attributable to that State.
    B. If a State seat belt use rate is unavailable for a State during a 
calendar year (either because the State did not conduct a seat belt use 
survey or a survey was conducted but does not comply with the Uniform 
Criteria for State Observational Surveys of Seat Belt Use, 23 CFR Part 
1340), NHTSA will calculate a State seat belt use rate, using the last 
available State seat belt use rate determined under Sec. 1240.11 or 
Sec. 1240.12 of this part, as applicable, along with information on 
seat belt use rates from the FARS, and an algorithm relating FARS seat 
belt use rates to observed seat belt use rates (see Appendix 1, note). 
This procedure will produce an estimated State seat belt use rate for 
the unknown calendar year. The estimated State seat belt use rate will 
then be weighted in the manner described in paragraph A of this 
appendix.
    C. The national average seat belt use rate for the calendar year 
will be determined by adding the weighted State seat belt use rates for 
each of the States (i.e., the national average seat belt use rate is the 
weighted average of all the State seat belt use rates).
    D. NHTSA may elect to use a seat belt use survey that does not 
comply with the Uniform Criteria for State Observational Surveys of Seat 
Belt Use in determining the national average seat belt use rate (even 
though the State that submitted the survey is ineligible to receive an 
allocation of funds), if in NHTSA's judgment, the deficiencies in the 
survey are not so substantial as to render the survey less accurate than 
the FARS estimate.


<R05>
 Sec. Appendix E to Part 1240--Determination of Federal Medical Savings

    A. To determine the savings to the Federal Government from reduced 
medical costs attributable to seat belt use, NHTSA will first estimate 
the impact of seat belt use on the number of fatalities and injuries, 
using methods described in the report ``Estimating the Benefits from 
Increased Safety Belt Use.'' \1\ These methods establish a relationship 
between the effectiveness of seat belts, current use rates, and existing 
injury levels to determine the impact of increasing seat belt use on 
motor vehicle safety. Using these methods, NHTSA will estimate the 
fatalities prevented and the non-fatal injuries avoided by increased 
seat belt use.

Use. Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Transportation, NHTSA, DOT HS

    B. In the 1996 report ``The Economic Cost of Motor Vehicle Crashes, 
1994,'' \2\ NHTSA measured both the medical costs and payment sources 
for motor vehicle crashes. NHTSA will adjust the national medical cost 
figures from this report to individual State income levels to reflect 
local cost levels. These per-case costs will be further adjusted for 
inflation, using the most recent annual average Consumer Price Index for 
medical care, and then multiplied by the injuries and fatalities 
prevented in each State to derive the total medical care savings from 
increased seat belt use. The Federal portion of these costs will be 
derived from the best

they may become available.

Sec.
1250.1 Scope.
1250.2 Purpose.
1250.3 Policy.
1250.4 Determining local share.
1250.5 Waivers.

    Authority: 23 U.S.C. 315, 402(b); and delegations of authority at 49 
CFR 1.48 and 1.50.

    Source: 41 FR 23948, June 14, 1976, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1250.1  Scope.

    This part establishes guidelines for the States to assure their 
meeting the requirements for 40 percent political subdivision 
participation in State highway safety programs under 23 U.S.C. 402 
(b)(1)(C).


<R05>
Sec. 1250.2  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to provide guidelines to determine 
whether a State is in compliance with the requirement that at least 40 
percent of all Federal funds apportioned under 23 U.S.C. 402 will be 
expended by political subdivisions of such State.


<R05>
Sec. 1250.3  Policy.

    To assure that the provisions of 23 U.S.C. 402(b)(1)(C) are complied 
with, the NHTSA and FHWA field offices will:
    (a) Prior to approving the State's Annual Work Program (AWP), review 
the AWP and each of the subelement plans which make up the AWP. The 
NHTSA Regional Administrator will review the 14\1/2\ safety standard 
areas for which NHTSA is responsible and the FHWA Division Administrator 
will review the 3\1/2\ safety standard areas for which FHWA is 
responsible. The narrative description for each subelement plan should 
contain sufficient information to identify the funds to be expended by, 
or for the benefit of the political subdivisions.
    (b) Withhold approval of a State's AWP, as provided in Highway 
Safety Program Manual volume 103, chapter III, paragraph 3c, where the 
program does not provide at least 40 percent of Federal funds for 
planned local program expenditures.
    (c) During the management review of the State's operations, 
determine if the political subdivisions had an active voice in the 
initiation, development and implementation of the programs for which 
such sums were expended.


<R05>
Sec. 1250.4  Determining local share.

    (a) In determining whether a State meets the requirement that at 
least 40 percent of Federal 402 funds be expended by political 
subdivisions, FHWA and NHTSA will apply the 40 percent requirement 
sequentially to each fiscal year's apportionments, treating all 
apportionments made from a single fiscal year's authorizations as a 
single entity for this purpose. Therefore, at least 40 percent of each 
State's apportionments from each year's authorizations must be used in 
the highway safety programs of its political subdivisions prior to the 
period when funds would normally lapse. The 40 percent requirement is 
applicable to the State's total federally funded safety program 
irrespective of Standard designation or Agency responsibility.
    (b) When Federal funds apportioned under 23 U.S.C. 402 are expended 
by a political subdivision, such expenditures are clearly part of the 
local share. Local safety project related expenditures and associated 
indirect costs, which are reimbursable to the grantee local governments, 
are classifiable as the local share of Federal funds. Illustrations of 
such expenditures are the cost incurred by a local government in 
planning and administration of project related safety activities, driver 
education activities, traffic court programs, traffic records system 
improvements, upgrading emergency medical services, pedestrian safety 
activities, improved traffic enforcement, alcohol countermeasures, 
highway debris removal programs, pupil transportation programs, accident 
investigation, surveillance of high accident locations, and traffic 
engineering services.

[[Page 534]]

    (c) When Federal funds apportioned under 23 U.S.C. 402 are expended 
by the State or a State agency for the benefit of a political 
subdivision, such funds may be considered as part of the local share, 
provided that the political subdivision benefitted has had an active 
voice in the initiation, development, and implementation of the programs 
for which such funds are expended. In no case may the State arbitrarily 
ascribe State agency expenditures as ``benefitting local government.'' 
Where political subdivisions have had an active voice in the initiation, 
development, and implementation of a particular program, and a political 
subdivision which has not had such active voice agrees in advance of 
implementation to accept the benefits of the program, the Federal share 
of the cost of such benefits may be credited toward meeting the 40 
percent local participation requirement. Where no political subdivisions 
have had an active voice in the initiation, development, and 
implementation of a particular program, but a political subdivision 
requests the benefits of the program as part of the local government's 
highway safety program, the Federal share of the cost of such benefits 
may be credited toward meeting the 40 percent local participation 
requirement. Evidence of consent and acceptance of the work, goods or 
services on behalf of the local government must be established and 
maintained on file by the State, until all funds authorized for a 
specific year are expended and audits completed.
    (d) State agency expenditures which are generally not classified as 
local are within such standard areas as vehicle inspection, vehicle 
registration and driver licensing. However, where these Standards 
provide funding for services such as: driver improvement tasks 
administered by traffic courts, or where they furnish computer support 
for local government requests for traffic record searches, these 
expenditures are classifiable as benefitting local programs.


<R05>
Sec. 1250.5  Waivers.

    While the 40 percent requirement may be waived in whole or in part 
by the Secretary or his delegate, it is expected that each State program 
will generate political subdivision participation to the extent required 
by the Act so that requests for waivers will be minimized. Where a 
waiver is requested, however, it will be documented at least by a 
conclusive showing of the absence of legal authority over highway safety 
activities at the political subdivision levels of the State and will 
recommend the appropriate percentage participation to be applied in lieu 
of the 40 percent.

402).


<R05>
Sec. 1251.2  Policy.

    In order for a State to receive funds under the Highway Safety Act, 
the Governor shall exercise his or her responsibilities through a State 
Highway Safety Agency that has ``adequate powers and is suitably 
equipped and organized to carry out the program to the satisfaction of 
the Secretary.'' 23 U.S.C. 402(b)(1)(A). Accordingly, it is the policy 
of this part that approval of a State's Highway Safety Plan will depend 
upon the State's compliance with Sec. Sec. 1251.3 and 1251.4 of this 
part.


<R05>
Sec. 1251.3  Authority.

1252.2 Definitions.
1252.3 Applicability.
1252.4 Policy.
1252.5 Procedures.
1252.6 Responsibilities.

    Authority: 23 U.S.C. 402 and 315; 49 CFR 1.48(b) and 1.50.

    Source: 45 FR 47145, July 14, 1980, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1252.1  Purpose.

    This part establishes the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration (NHTSA) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) 
policy on planning and administration (P&A) costs for State highway 
safety agencies. It defines planning and administration costs, describes 
the expenditures that may be used to satisfy the State matching 
requirement, prescribes how the requirement will be met, and when States 
will have to comply with the requirement.


<R05>
Sec. 1252.2  Definitions.

    (a) Fiscal year means the twelve months beginning each October 1, 
and ending the following September 30.
    (b) Direct costs are those costs which can be identified 
specifically with a particular planning and administration or program 
activity. The salary of a data analyst on the State highway safety 
agency staff is an example of a direct cost attributable to P&A. The 
salary of an emergency medical technician course instructor is an 
example of direct cost attributable to a program activity.
    (c) Indirect costs are those costs (1) incurred for a common or 
joint purpose benefiting more than one program activity and (2) not 
readily assignable to the program activity specifically benefited. For 
example, centralized support services such as personnel, procurement, 
and budgeting would be indirect costs.
    (d) Planning and administration (P&A) costs are those direct and 
indirect costs that are attributable to the overall development and 
management of the Highway Safety Plan. Such costs could include 
salaries, related personnel benefits, travel expenses, and rental costs.
    (e) Program management costs are those costs attributable to a 
program

[[Page 536]]

area (e.g., salary of an emergency medical services coordinator, the 
impact evaluation of an activity, or the travel expenses of a local 
traffic engineer).
    (f) State highway safety agency is the agency directly responsible 
for coordinating the State's highway safety program authorized by 23 
U.S.C. 402.


<R05>
Sec. 1252.3  Applicability.

    The provisions of this part apply to obligations incurred after 
November 6, 1978, for planning and administration costs under 23 U.S.C. 
402.


<R05>
Sec. 1252.4  Policy.

    Federal participation in P&A activities shall not exceed 50 percent 
of the total cost of such activities, or the applicable sliding scale 
rate in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 120. The Federal contribution for P&A 
activities shall not exceed 10 percent of the total funds the State 
receives under 23 U.S.C. 402. In accordance with 23 U.S.C. 120(i), the 
Federal share payable for projects in the Virgin Islands, Guam, American 
Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands shall be 100 
percent. The Indian State, as defined by 23 U.S.C. 402 (d) and (i), is 
exempt from the provisions of this part. NHTSA funds shall be used only 
to finance P&A activities attributable to NHTSA programs and FHWA funds 
shall be used only to finance P&A costs attributable to FHWA programs.

[47 FR 15121, Apr. 8, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 1252.5  Procedures.

    (a) P&A tasks and related costs shall be described in the P&A module 
of the State's Highway Safety Plan. The State's matching share shall be 
determined on the basis of the total P&A costs in the module. Federal 
participation shall not exceed 50 percent (or the applicable sliding 
scale) of the total P&A costs. A State shall not use NHTSA funds to pay 
more than 50 percent of the P&A costs attributable to NHTSA programs nor 
use FHWA funds to pay more than 50 percent of the P&A costs attributable 
to FHWA programs. In addition, the Federal contribution for P&A 
activities shall not exceed 10 percent of the total funds in the State 
received under 23 U.S.C. 402.
    (b) FHWA and NHTSA funds may be used to pay for the Federal share of 
P&A costs up to the amounts determined by multiplying the Federal share 
by the ratio between the P&A costs attributable to FHWA programs and the 
P&A costs attributable to NHTSA programs. For example: A State's total 
P&A costs are $40,000. The State's share is 50 percent or $20,000. To 
pay the remaining $20,000, the State first ascertains the amount spent 
out of the total costs for each agency's programs, then applies the 
ratio between these two amounts to the $20,000. If $36,000 of the total 
costs are spent for NHTSA programs and $4,000 for FHWA programs, the 
ratio would be 9/1 and the corresponding allocation of the Federal share 
would be $18,000 to NHTSA and $2,000 to FHWA.
    (c) A State at its option may allocate salary and related costs of 
State highway safety agency employees to one of the following:
    (1) The administration and planning functions in the P&A module;
    (2) The program management functions in one or more Program modules; 
or
    (3) A combination of administration and planning functions in the 
P&A module and the program management functions in one or more program 
modules.
    (d) If an employee is principally performing administration and 
planning functions under a P&A module, the total salary and related 
costs may be allocated to the P&A module. If the employee is principally 
performing program management functions under one or more program 
modules, the total salary and related costs may be charged directly to 
the appropriate module(s). If an employee is spending time on a 
combination of administration and planning functions and program 
management functions, the total salary and related costs may be charged 
to the appropriate module(s) based on the actual time worked under each 
module. If the State highway safety agency elects to allocate costs 
based on acutal time spent on an activity, the State highway safety 
agency must keep accurate time records showing the work activities for 
each employee. The State's record keeping system

[[Page 537]]

must be approved by the appropriate FHWA and NHTSA officials.
    (e) Those tasks and related costs contained in the P&A module, not 
defined as P&A costs under Sec. 1252.2(d) of this part, are not subject 
to the planning and administration cost matching requirement.

[45 FR 47145, July 14, 1980, as amended at 47 FR 15121, Apr. 8, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 1252.6  Responsibilities.

    During the Highway Safety Plan approval process, the responsible 
FHWA and NHTSA officials shall approve a P&A module only if the 
projected State expenditure is at least 25 percent (or the appropriate 
sliding scale rate) of the total P&A costs identified in the module. If 
a State elects to prorate P&A and program management costs, the 
appropriate NHTSA and FHWA officials must approve the method that the 
State highway safety agency will use to record the time spent on these 
activities. During the process of reimbursement, the responsible FHWA 
and NHTSA officials shall assure that Federal reimbursement for P&A 
costs at no time exceeds 75 percent (of the applicable sliding scale 
rate) of the costs accumulated at the time of reimbursement.

Federal-aid highways and highway safety construction programs for 
carrying out projects under Section 402.
    (2) The amount of obligation authority referred to in paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section shall be determined by multiplying:
    (i) The amount of funds transferred under Sec. 1270.6 of this part 
to the apportionment of the State under Section 402 for the fiscal year; 
by
    (ii) The ratio that:
    (A) The amount of obligation authority distributed for the fiscal 
year to the State for Federal-aid highways and highway safety 
construction programs; bears to
    (B) The total of the sums apportioned to the State for Federal-aid 
highways and highway safety construction programs (excluding sums not 
subject to any obligation limitation) for the fiscal year.
    (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no limitation on the

minimum penalty, that all repeat intoxicated drivers shall:
    (1) Receive a driver's license suspension of not less than one year;
    (2) Be subject to either--
    (i) The impoundment of each of the driver's motor vehicles during 
the one-year license suspension;
    (ii) The immobilization of each of the driver's motor vehicles 
during the one-year license suspension; or
    (iii) The installation of a State-approved ignition interlock system 
on each of the driver's motor vehicles at the conclusion of the one-year 
license suspension;
    (3) Receive an assessment of their degree of alcohol abuse, and

avoid undue hardship to any individual who is completely dependent on 
the motor vehicle for the necessities of life, including any family 
member of the convicted individual, and any co-owner of the motor 
vehicle, but not including the offender.
    (2) A State may provide limited exceptions to the requirement to 
install an ignition interlock system on each of the offender's motor 
vehicles, contained in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, on an 
individual basis, to avoid undue financial hardship, provided the State 
law requires that the offender may not operate a motor vehicle without 
an ignition interlock system.
    (3) Such exceptions may be issued only in accordance with a State 
law, regulation or binding policy directive establishing the conditions 
under which vehicles may be released by the State or under Statewide 
published guidelines and in exceptional circumstances specific to the 
offender's motor vehicle, and may not result in the unrestricted use of 
the vehicle by the repeat intoxicated driver.

or agency, the request for an NDR file check may be submitted instead 
directly to the NDR in accordance with procedures established by the NDR 
for this purpose.
    (d) The request for an NDR file check or the written consent, 
whichever is used, must:
    (1) State that the NDR records are to be released;

search of the NDR (or in the case of a personnel security investigation 
state that the authorization is valid only for the duration of the 
investigation); and
    (5) Except for inquiries concerning personnel security 
investigations, specifically state that the NDR identifies probable 
matches that require further inquiry for verification; that it is 
recommended, but not required, that the employer/prospective employer 
verify matches with the State of Record; and that individuals have the 
right to request records regarding themselves from the NDR to verify 
their accuracy.

Federal government to provide grant funds shall be limited to the amount 
of funds released.
    (b) If any amounts authorized for grants under this part for a 
fiscal year are expected to remain unobligated in that fiscal year, the 
Administrator may transfer such amounts to the programs authorized under 
23 U.S.C. 405 and 23 U.S.C. 410, to ensure to the extent possible that 
each State receives the maximum incentive funding for which it is 
eligible.
    (c) If any amounts authorized for grants under 23 U.S.C. 405 and 23 
U.S.C. 410 are transferred to the grant program under this part in a 
fiscal year, the Administrator shall distribute the transferred amounts 
so that each eligible State receives a proportionate share of these 
amounts, subject to the conditions specified in Sec. 1335.8 and 
paragraph (a) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1335.10  Grant limitations.

    (a) No State may receive a grant under this part in more than six 
fiscal years.
    (b) Grants may be used by States only to adopt and implement

    Effective Date Note: At 76 FR 18056, Apr. 1, 2011, part 1340 was 
revised, effective May 2, 2011. For the convenience of the user, the 
revised text is set forth following the text currently in effect.


<R05>
Sec. 1340.1  Purpose.

    This part establishes uniform criteria for surveys of seat belt use 
conducted by States under 23 U.S.C. 157.


<R05>
Sec. 1340.2  Applicability.

    These uniform criteria apply to State surveys of seat belt use, 
beginning in calendar year 1998 (except as otherwise provided in this 
part), and continuing annually thereafter through calendar year 2001.


<R05>
Sec. 1340.3  Basic design requirements.

    Surveys conducted in accordance with this part shall incorporate the 
following minimum design requirements:
    (a) Probability-based requirement. The sample identified for the 
survey shall have a probability-based design such that estimates are 
representative of safety belt use for the population of interest in the 
state and sampling errors may be calculated for each estimate produced.
    (b) Observational requirement. Minimum requirements include the 
following:
    (1) The sample data shall be collected through direct observation of 
seat belt use on roadways within the State, conducted completely within 
the calendar year for which the seat belt use rate is being reported;
    (2) Seat belt use shall be determined by observation of the use or 
non-use of a shoulder belt;
    (3) Observers shall be required to follow a predetermined, clear 
policy in the event that observations cannot be made at an assigned site 
at the specified time (due to heavy rain, construction, safety problems, 
etc.);
    (4) Instructions to observers shall specify which road and which 
direction of traffic on that road are to be observed (observers must not 
be free to choose between roads at an intersection); and
    (5) Observers shall follow clear instructions on how to start and 
end an observation period and how to stop and start observations if 
traffic flow is too heavy to observe all vehicles or if vehicles begin 
moving too quickly for observation (to remove any possible bias, such as 
starting with the next belted driver).
    (c) Precision requirement. The relative error (standard error 
divided by the estimate) for safety belt use must not exceed 5 percent.


<R05>
Sec. 1340.4  Population, demographic, and time/day requirements.

    Surveys conducted in accordance with this part shall comply with the 
following minimum population, demographic, and time/day requirements:
    (a) Population of interest. (1) Drivers and front seat outboard 
passengers in passenger motor vehicles (passenger cars, pickup trucks, 
vans, and sport utility vehicles) must be observed in the survey. (Only 
overall restraint use for the population of interest is required. 
However, in order to assist in the evaluation of trends, it is 
recommended that data be collected in

[[Page 573]]

such a way that restraint use estimates can be reported separately for 
passenger cars and other covered vehicles, and separately for drivers 
and front-seat outboard passengers within those vehicle groups.)
    (2) Surveys conducted during calendar year 1998 shall be deemed to 
comply with paragraph (a)(1) of this section if passenger motor vehicles 
registered in-State are included in the survey. For surveys conducted 
during calendar year 1999 and thereafter, passenger motor vehicles 
registered both in-state and out-of-state must be included in the 
survey.
    (b) Demographics. Counties, or other primary sampling units, 
totaling at least 85 percent of the State's population must be eligible 
for inclusion in the sample. States may eliminate their least populated 
counties, or other primary sampling units, to a total of fifteen percent 
or less of the total State population, from the sampling frame.
    (c) Time of day and day of week. All daylight hours for all days of 
the week must be eligible for inclusion in the sample. Observation sites 
must be randomly assigned to the selected day-of-week/time-of-day time 
slots. If observation sites are grouped to reduce data collection 
burdens, a random process must be used to make the first assignment of a 
site within a group to an observational time period. Thereafter, 
assignment of other sites within the group to time periods may be made 
in a manner that promotes administrative efficiency and timely 
completion of the survey.

<R05>
Sec. 1340.5  Documentation requirements.

    All sample design, data collection, and estimation procedures used 
in State surveys conducted in accordance with this part must be well 
documented. At a minimum, the documentation must:
    (a) For sample design--
    (1) Define all sampling units, with their measures of size;
    (2) Define what stratification was used at each stage of sampling 
and what methods were used for allocation of the sample units to the 
strata;
    (3) Explain how the sample size at each stage was determined;
    (4) List all samples units and their probabilities of selection; and
    (5) Describe how observation sites were assigned to observation time 
periods.
    (b) For data collection--
    (1) Define an observation period;
    (2) Define an observation site and what procedures were implemented 
when the observation site was not accessible on the date assigned;
    (3) Describe what vehicles were observed and what procedures were 
implemented when traffic was too heavy to observe all vehicles; and
    (4) Describe the data recording procedures.
    (c) For estimation--
    (1) Display the raw data and the weighted estimates;
    (2) For each estimate, provide an estimate of one standard error and 
an approximate 95 percent confidence interval; and
    (3) Describe how estimates were calculated and how variances were 
calculated.


<R05>
               Sec. Appendix A to Part 1340--Sample Design

    Following is a description of a sample design that meets the final 
survey guidelines and, based upon NHTSA's experience in developing and 
reviewing such designs, is presented as a reasonably accurate and 
practical design. Depending on the data available in a State, 
substitutions in this design can be made without loss of accuracy. This 
information is intended only as an example of a complying survey design 
and to provide guidance for States concerning recommended design 
options. These are not design requirements. It is recommended that State 
surveys of safety belt use be designed by qualified survey 
statisticians.

                            I. Sample Design

    A. Sample population: It is recommended that all controlled 
intersections or all roadway segments in the State (or in the parts of 
the State that have not been excluded by the 85 present demographic 
guideline) be eligible for sampling.
    B. First Stage: Usually, counties are the best candidates for 
primary sampling units (PSUs). In large States with differing geographic 
areas, it is recommended that stratification of PSUs by geographic 
region be employed prior to PSU selection. Counties should be randomly 
selected, preferably with

[[Page 574]]

probabilities proportional to vehicle miles of travel (VMT) in each 
county. If VMT is not available by county, PSUs can also be selected 
with probability proportional to county population. When sampling PSUs, 
States should ensure that an adequate mix of rural and urban areas are 
represented. In some cases, urban/rural stratification must be employed 
prior to PSU selection. In other cases, it may be more practical to 
perform urban/rural stratification at the second sampling stage.
    C. Second Stage: Within sampled PSUs, it is recommended that road 
segments be stratified by road type. For example, a two-strata design 
might be major roads vs. local roads, a three strata design might be 
high, medium and low traffic volume roads. The sample should be 
allocated to these strata by estimated annual VMT in each stratum. The 
sample of road segments within a stratum should be selected with 
probability proportional to average daily VMT. When enumerating all 
local roads is impractical, additional stages of selection can be 
introduced and alternative sample probabilities can be used. For 
example, census tracts within counties can be selected with probability 
proportional to VMT, or, if VMT is not available, proportional to the 
square root of the population. Next, within each sampled census tract, 
road segments can be selected.
    D. Sample Size: The following tables are provided as rough 
guidelines for determining sample size for estimating belt use with the 
required level of precision. The numbers are based on results from 
previous probability-based seat belt surveys.

    E. Example: To achieve the required level of precision, a State with 
100 counties would sample 20 counties at the first stage. At the second 
stage, assuming an average of 100 road segments in each sampled county, 
a sample of 23 road segments per county would be selected. The total 
sample size would be 20x460 observational sites.

                           II. Data Collection

    A. Exact observation sites, such as the specific intersection on a 
road segment, should be determined prior to conducting the observations.
    B. Direction of traffic to be observed should be determined prior to 
conducting the observations.
    C. If traffic volume is too heavy to accurately record information, 
predetermined protocol should exist for selecting which travel lanes to 
observe.
    D. Observations should be conducted for a predetermined time period, 
usually one hour. Time periods should be the same at each site.
    E. To minimize travel time and distance required to conduct the 
observations, clustering of sampled sites can be done. Sample sites 
should be grouped into geographic clusters, with each cluster containing 
major and local roads. Assignment of sites and times within clusters 
should be random.
    F. Two counts should be recorded for all eligible vehicles:
    1. Number of front seat outboard occupants.
    2. Number of these occupants wearing shoulder belts.

                             III. Estimation

    A. Observations at each site should be weighted by the site's final 
probability of selection.
    B. An estimate of one standard error should be calculated for the 
estimate of belt

[[Page 575]]

use. Using this estimate, 95 percent confidence intervals for the 
estimate of safety belt use should be calculated.

    This subpart sets forth the minimum design requirements to be 
incorporated in surveys conducted under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1340.5  Selection of observation sites.

    (a) Sampling frame requirements--(1) County coverage. The sampling 
frame from which observation sites are selected shall include counties 
or county-equivalents (including tribal territories), as defined by the 
U.S. Census Bureau, that account for at least 85 percent of the State's 
passenger vehicle occupant fatalities, provided that the average of the 
last three, four or five years, at the State's option, of available 
Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) data or State fatality data 
approved by NHTSA shall be used to determine the State's passenger 
vehicle occupant fatalities.
    (2) Road coverage. (i) States shall select observation sites from a 
database of road inventories approved by NHTSA or provided by NHTSA.
    (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, 
all roads in the State shall be eligible for sampling. The sampling 
frame may not be limited only to roads having a stop sign, stop light or 
State-maintained roads.
    (iii) The sampling frame need not include: rural local roads, as 
classified by the Federal Highway Administration's Functional 
Classification Guidelines, in counties that are not within a 
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), as published by the Office of 
Management and Budget; non-public roads; unnamed roads; unpaved roads; 
vehicular trails; access ramps; cul-de-sacs; traffic circles; or service 
drives.

[[Page 576]]

    (b) Sampling selection requirements. The set of road segments 
selected for observation sites shall be chosen based on probability 
sampling, except that--
    (1) The specific observation site locations on the sampled road 
segments may be deterministically selected;
    (2) An alternate observation site may be used to replace an 
observation site selected based on probability sampling if it is located 
in the same county or county-equivalent, and has the same roadway 
classification (e.g., local road segment, collector road segment) when 
using the protocol of substitution and rescheduling of observation sites 
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Requirements for substitution and rescheduling of observation 
sites. The survey design shall include at a minimum the following 
protocols:
    (1) Protocol when observation site is temporarily unavailable for 
data collection.
    (i) Observers shall return to the observation site at another time 
provided that it is on the same day of the week and at same time of the 
day or select an alternate observation site, as described in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section, provided the data are collected on the same day 
and at approximately the same time as the originally-scheduled 
observation site.
    (ii) The original observation site must be used for future data 
collections.
    (2) Protocol when observation site is permanently unavailable for 
data collection. (i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii), another 
observation site shall be selected in accordance with paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (ii) If it is not feasible to select another observation site based 
on probability sampling for the current data collection, an alternate 
observation site, as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, may 
be selected, provided the data is collected on the same day and at 
approximately the same time as the originally-scheduled observation 
site.
    (iii) For future data collections, another observation site must be 
selected based on probability sampling in accordance with paragraph (b) 
of this section.
    (d) Precision requirement. The estimated seat belt use rate must 
have a standard error of no more than 2.5 percentage points.


<R05>
Sec. 1340.6  Assignment of observation times.

    (a) Daylight hours. All daylight hours between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. for 
all days of the week shall be eligible for inclusion in the sample.
    (b) Random assignment. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section, the day-of the week and time-of-the-day shall be randomly 
assigned to observation sites.
    (c) Grouping of observation sites in close geographic proximity. 
Observations sites in close geographic proximity may be grouped to 
reduce data collection burdens if:
    (1) The first assignment of an observation site within the group is 
randomly selected; and
    (2) The assignment of other observations sites within the group is 
made in a manner that promotes administrative efficiency and timely 
completion of the survey.


<R05>
Sec. 1340.7  Observation procedures.

    (a) Data collection dates. All survey data shall be collected 
through direct observation completely within the calendar year for which 
the Statewide seat belt use rate will be reported. Except as provided in 
Sec. 1340.5(c), the survey shall be conducted in accordance to the 
schedule determined in Sec. 1340.6.
    (b) Roadway and direction(s) of observation--(1) Intersections. If 
an observation site is located at an intersection of road segments, the 
data shall be collected from the sampled road segment, not the 
intersecting road segment(s).
    (2) Roads with two-way traffic. If an observation site is located on 
a road with traffic traveling in two directions, one or both directions 
of traffic may be observed, provided that--
    (i) If only one direction of traffic is observed, that direction 
shall be chosen randomly;
    (ii) If both directions of traffic are observed at the same time, 
States shall assign at least one person to observe each direction of 
traffic.
    (c) Vehicle coverage. Data shall be collected by direct observation 
from all passenger motor vehicles, including but not limited to 
passenger motor vehicles used for commercial purposes, passenger motor 
vehicles exempt from the State's seat belt use law and passenger motor 
vehicles bearing out-of-State license plates.
    (d) Occupant coverage. Data shall be collected by direct observation 
of all drivers and right front passengers, including right front 
passengers in booster seats, but excluding right front passengers in 
child safety seats. Observers shall record a person as--
    (1) Belted if the shoulder belt is in front of the person's 
shoulder;
    (2) Unbelted if the shoulder belt is not in front of the person's 
shoulder;
    (3) Unknown if it cannot reasonably be determined whether the driver 
or right front passenger is belted.
    (e) Survey data. At a minimum, the seat belt use data to be 
collected by direct observation shall include--
    (1) Seat belt status of driver;
    (2) Presence of right front passenger; and
    (3) Seat belt status of right front passenger, if present.
    (f) Data collection environment. When collecting seat belt survey 
data--
    (1) Observers shall not wear law enforcement uniforms;

[[Page 577]]

    (2) Police vehicles and persons in law enforcement uniforms shall 
not be positioned at observation sites;
    (3) Communications by signage or any other means that a seat belt 
survey is being or will be conducted shall not be present in the 
vicinity of the observation site.


<R05>
Sec. 1340.8  Quality control.

    (a) Quality control monitors. Monitors shall conduct random, 
unannounced visits to no less than five percent of the observation sites 
for the purpose of quality control. The same individual shall not serve 
as both the observer and quality control monitor at the same observation 
site at the same time.
    (b) Training. Observers and quality control monitors involved in 
seat belt use surveys shall have received training in data collection 
procedures within the past twelve months. Observers and quality control 
monitors shall be trained in the observation procedures of Sec. 1340.7 
and in the substitution and rescheduling requirements of Sec. 
1340.5(c).
    (c) Statistical review. Survey results shall be reviewed and 
approved by a survey statistician, i.e., a person with knowledge of the 
design of probability-based multi-stage samples, statistical estimators 
from such designs, and variance estimation of such estimators.


<R05>
Sec. 1340.9  Computation of estimates.

    (a) Data used. Except as otherwise provided in this section, all 
data collected pursuant to Sec. 1340.7(e) shall be used, without 
exclusion, in the computation of the Statewide seat belt use rate, 
standard error, and nonresponse rate.
    (b) Data editing. Known values of data contributing to the Statewide 
seat belt use rate shall not be altered in any manner.
    (c) Imputation. Unknown values of variables shall not be imputed 
unless NHTSA has approved the State's imputation procedure prior to data 
analysis.
    (d) Sampling weights. The estimation formula shall weight observed 
data by the sampling weights as required by the sample design and any 
subsequent adjustments.
    (e) Sampling weight adjustments for observation sites with no usable 
data. States shall include a procedure to adjust the sampling weights 
for observation sites with no usable data, including observation sites 
where no data were collected and observation sites where data were 
discovered to be falsified.
    (f) Nonresponse rate. (1) Subject to paragraph (f)(2) of this 
section, the nonresponse rate for the entire survey shall not exceed 10 
percent for the ratio of the total number of recorded unknown values of 
belt use to the total number of drivers and passengers observed.
    (2) The State shall include a procedure for collecting additional 
observations in the same calendar year of the survey to reduce the 
nonresponse rate to no more than 10 percent if the nonresponse rate in 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section exceeds 10 percent.
    (g) Variance estimation. (1) Subject to paragraph (g)(2) of this 
section, the estimated standard error, using the variance estimation

<R05>
Sec. 1345.5  Requirements for a grant.

    To qualify for an incentive grant, a State must adopt and implement 
effective programs to reduce highway deaths and injuries resulting from 
individuals riding unrestrained or improperly restrained in motor 
vehicles. A State must adopt and implement at least four of the 
following criteria:
    (a) Safety belt use law. (1) In fiscal years 1999 and 2000, a State 
must make unlawful throughout the State the operation of a passenger 
motor vehicle whenever an individual (other than a child who is secured 
in a child restraint system) in the front seat of the vehicle does not 
have a safety belt properly secured about the individual's body.
    (2) Beginning in fiscal year 2001, a State must make unlawful 
throughout the State the operation of a passenger motor vehicle whenever 
an individual (other than a child who is secured in a child restraint 
system) in any seating position in the vehicle does not have a safety 
belt properly secured about the individual's body.
    (3) To demonstrate compliance with this criterion, a State shall 
submit a copy of the State's safety belt use law, regulation or binding 
policy directive

[[Page 581]]

interpreting or implementing the law or regulation that provides for 
each element of paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2), as appropriate, of this 
section. The State is also required to identify any exemptions to its 
safety belt use law.
    (b) Primary safety belt use law. (1) A State must provide for 
primary enforcement of its safety belt use law.
    (2) To demonstrate compliance with this criterion, the State shall 
submit a copy of its law, regulation or binding policy directive 
interpreting or implementing the law or regulation that provides for 
each element of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (c) Minimum fine or penalty points. (1) A State must provide for the 
imposition of a minimum fine of not less than $25.00 or one or more 
penalty points on the driver's license of an individual:
    (i) For a violation of the State's safety belt use law; and
    (ii) for a violation of the State's child passenger protection law.
    (2)(i) To demonstrate compliance with this criterion, a Law State 
shall submit a copy of the law, regulation or binding policy directive 
interpreting or implementing the law or regulation that provides for 
each element of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (ii) For purposes of this paragraph, a ``Law State'' means a State 
that has a law, regulation or binding policy directive interpreting or 
implementing the law or regulation that provides for each element of the 
minimum fines or penalty points criterion including the imposition of a 
minimum fine of not less than $25.00 or one or more penalty points for a 
violation of the State's safety belt use and child passenger protection 
laws.
    (3)(i) To demonstrate compliance with this criterion, a Data State 
shall submit data covering a period of at least three months during the 
past twelve months showing the total number of persons who were 
convicted of a safety belt use or child passenger protection law 
violation and that 80 percent or more of all such persons were required 
to pay at least $25 in fines, fees or court costs or had one or more 
penalty points assessed against their driver's license. The State can 
provide the necessary data based on a representative sample.
    (ii) For purposes of this paragraph, a ``Data State'' means a State 
that does not require the mandatory imposition of a minimum fine of not 
less than $25.00 or one or more penalty points for a violation of the 
State's safety belt use and child passenger protection laws.
    (4) If a State has in effect a law that provides for the imposition 
of a fine of not less than $25.00 or one or more penalty points for a 
violation of the State's child passenger protection law, but provides 
that imposition of the fine or penalty points may be waived if the 
offender presents proof of the purchase of a child safety seat, the 
State shall be deemed to have in effect a law that provides for the 
imposition of a minimum fine or penalty points, as provided in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section.
    (d) Special traffic enforcement program. (1) A State must establish 
a statewide Special Traffic Enforcement Program for occupant protection 
that emphasizes publicity for the program. The program must provide for 
periodic enforcement efforts. Each enforcement effort must include the 
following five elements, in chronological order:
    (i) A seat belt observed use survey conducted before any enforcement 
wave;
    (ii) A media campaign to inform the public about the risks and costs 
of traffic crashes, the benefits of increased occupant protection use, 
and the need for traffic enforcement as a way to manage those risks and 
costs.
    (iii) Local media events announcing a pending enforcement wave;
    (iv) A wave of enforcement effort consisting of checkpoints, 
saturation patrols or other enforcement tactics.
    (v) A post-wave observed use survey coupled with a post-wave media 
event announcing the results of the survey and the enforcement effort.
    (2) The State's program must provide for at least two enforcement 
efforts each year and must require the participation of State and local 
law enforcement officials in each effort.
    (3) The State's program must cover at least 70% of the State's 
population.
    (4) To demonstrate compliance with this criterion in the first 
fiscal year the State receives a grant based on this

[[Page 582]]

criterion, the State shall submit a plan to conduct a program that 
covers each element identified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of 
this section. Specifically, the plan shall:
    (i) Provide the approximate dates, durations and locations of the 
efforts planned in the upcoming year;
    (ii) Specify the types of enforcement methods that will be used 
during each enforcement effort and provide a listing of the law 
enforcement agencies that will participate in the enforcement efforts 
along with an estimate of the approximate cumulative percentage of the 
State's population served by those agencies or the approximate 
percentage of the traffic volume on roadways covered by the enforcement 
program; and
    (iii) Document the activities the State plans to conduct to provide 
the public with information on the importance of occupant restraints and 
to publicize each enforcement effort and its results. This information 
should include a sample or synopsis of the content of the public 
information messages that will accompany the enforcement efforts and the 
strategy that the State intends to use to deliver each message to its 
target audience.
    (5) To demonstrate compliance with this criterion in subsequent 
fiscal years the State receives a grant based on this criterion, the 
State shall submit an updated plan for conducting a special traffic 
enforcement program in the following year and information documenting 
that the prior year's plan was effectively implemented. The information 
shall document that enforcement efforts were conducted; which law 
enforcement agencies were involved; and the dates, duration and location 
of each enforcement effort. The State must also submit samples of 
materials used, and document activities that took place to reach the 
target population.
    (e) Child passenger protection education program. (1) A State must 
provide an effective system for educating the public about the proper 
use of child safety seats. The program must, at a minimum:
    (i) Provide information to the public about proper seating positions 
for children in air bag equipped motor vehicles, the importance of 
restraint use, and instruction on how to reduce the improper use of 
child restraint systems;
    (ii) Provide for child passenger safety (CPS) training and 
retraining to establish or update child passenger safety technicians, 
law enforcement officials, fire and emergency personnel and other 
educators to function at the community level for the purpose of 
educating the public about proper restraint use and to teach child care 
givers how to install a child safety seat correctly. The training should 
encompass the goals and objectives of NHTSA's Standardized Child 
Passenger Safety Technician Curriculum;
    (iii) Provide periodic child safety seat clinics conducted by State 
and local agencies (health, medical, hospital, enforcement, etc.); and
    (iv) The States's public information program must reach at least 70% 
of the State's total population. The State's clinic program must reach 
at least 70% of a targeted population determined by the State and States 
must provide a rationale for choosing a specific group, supported by 
data, where possible.
    (2) To demonstrate compliance with this criterion in the first 
fiscal year the State receives a grant based on this criterion, the 
State shall submit a plan to conduct a child passenger protection 
education program that covers each element identified in paragraph (e) 
(1) of this section. The information shall include:
    (i) A sample or synopsis of the content of the planned public 
information program and the strategy that will be used to reach 70% of 
the State's population;
    (ii) A description of the activities that will be used to train and 
retrain child passenger safety technicians, law enforcement officials, 
fire and emergency personnel and other educators and provide the 
durations and locations of such training activities;
    (iii) An estimate of the approximate number of people who will 
participate in the training and retraining activities; and
    (iv) A plan to conduct clinics that will serve at least 70% of the 
targeted population.

[[Page 583]]

    (3) To demonstrate compliance with this criterion in subsequent 
fiscal years the State receives a grant based on this criterion, the 
State shall submit an updated plan for conducting a child passenger 
protection education program in the following year and information 
documenting that the prior year's plan was effectively implemented. The 
information shall document that a public information program, training 
and child safety seat clinics were conducted; which agencies were 
involved; and the dates, durations and locations of these programs.
    (f) Child passenger protection law. (1) The State must make unlawful 
the operation of a passenger motor vehicle whenever an individual who is 
less than 16 years of age is not properly secured in a child safety seat 
or other appropriate restraint system.
    (2) To demonstrate compliance with this criterion, a State shall 
submit a copy of the law(s), regulation or binding policy directive 
interpreting or implementing the law or regulation that provides for 
each element of paragraph (f)(1) of this section. In addition, the State 
must identify any exemptions to its child passenger protection law(s).
    (g) Certifications in subsequent fiscal years: (1) To demonstrate 
compliance in subsequent fiscal years the State receives a grant based 
on criteria in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) or (f) of this section, if the 
State's law, regulation or binding policy directive has not changed, the 
State, in lieu of resubmitting its law, regulation or binding policy 
directive as provided in paragraphs (a)(3), (b)(2), (c)(2)(i) or (f)(2) 
of this section, may submit a statement certifying that there have been 
no substantive changes in the State's laws, regulations, or binding 
policy directives.
    (2) The certifying statement shall be worded as follows:

(Name of certifying official), (position title), of the (State or 
Commonwealth) of --------, do hereby certify that the (State or 
Commonwealth) of -------- has not changed and is enforcing a law, that 
conforms to 23 U.S.C. 405 and 23 CFR 1345.5 (insert reference to section 
and paragraph), (citations to State law).

Sec. 1345.6  Award procedures.

    (a) In each Federal fiscal year, grants will be made to eligible 
States upon submission and approval of the application required by Sec. 
1345.4(a) and subject to the limitation in Sec. 1345.4(b). The release 
of grant funds under this part shall be subject to the availability of 
funding for that fiscal year. If there are expected to be insufficient 
funds to award full grant amounts to all eligible States in any fiscal 
year, NHTSA may release less than the full grant amounts upon initial 
approval of the State's application and documentation and the remainder 
of the full grant amounts, up to the State's proportionate share of 
available funds, before the end of that fiscal year. Project approval, 
and the contractual obligation of the Federal government to provide 
grant funds, shall be limited to the amount of funds released.
    (b) If any amounts authorized for grants under this part for a 
fiscal year are expected to remain unobligated in that fiscal year, the 
Administrator may transfer such amounts to the programs authorized under 
23 U.S.C. 408 and 23 U.S.C. 410, to ensure to the extent possible that 
each State receives the maximum incentive funding for which it is 
eligible.
    (c) If any amounts authorized for grants under 23 U.S.C. 408 and 23 
U.S.C. 410 are transferred to the grant program under this part in a 
fiscal year, the Administrator shall distribute the transferred amounts 
so that each eligible State receives a proportionate share of these 
amounts, subject to the conditions specified in Sec. 1345.4.

of authority at 49 CFR 1.50.

    Source: 71 FR 40898, July 19, 2006, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1350.1  Scope.

    This part establishes criteria, in accordance with section 2010 of 
the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A 
Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), for awarding incentive grants to States 
that adopt and implement effective programs to reduce the number of 
single- and multi-vehicle crashes involving motorcyclists.


<R05>
Sec. 1350.2  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to implement the provisions of section 
2010 of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity 
Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), and to encourage States to adopt 
effective motorcyclist safety programs.


<R05>
Sec. 1350.3  Definitions.

    As used in this part--
    FARS means NHTSA's Fatality Analysis Reporting System.
    Impaired means alcohol- or drug-impaired as defined by State law, 
provided that the State's legal alcohol-impairment level does not exceed 
.08 BAC.
    Majority means greater than 50 percent.
    Motorcycle means a motor vehicle with motive power having a seat or 
saddle for the use of the rider and designed to travel on not more than 
three wheels in contact with the ground.
    Motorcyclist awareness means an individual or collective awareness 
of--
    (1) The presence of motorcycles on or near roadways; and
    (2) Safe driving practices that avoid injury to motorcyclists.
    Motorcyclist awareness program means an informational or public 
awareness program designed to enhance motorcyclist awareness that is 
developed by or in coordination with the designated State authority 
having jurisdiction over motorcyclist safety issues, which may include 
the State motorcycle safety administrator or a motorcycle advisory 
council appointed by the Governor of the State.
    Motorcyclist safety training or Motorcycle rider training means a 
formal program of instruction that is approved for use in a State by the 
designated State authority having jurisdiction over motorcyclist safety 
issues, which may include the State motorcycle safety administrator or a 
motorcycle advisory council appointed by the Governor of the State.
    Preceding calendar year means the calendar year that precedes the 
beginning of the fiscal year of the grant by one year. (For example, for 
grant applications in fiscal year 2006, which began in October 2005, the 
preceding calendar year is the 2004 calendar year and final FARS data, 
State crash data and FHWA motorcycle registration data from the 
``preceding calendar year'' would, therefore, be such data from calendar 
year 2004.)
    State means any of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and 
Puerto Rico.
