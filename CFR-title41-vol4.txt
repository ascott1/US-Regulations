                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 1998), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 300-1.1  What is the FTR?

    The FTR is the regulation contained in 41 Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR), Chapters 300 through 304, which implements statutory 
requirements and Executive branch policies for travel by Federal 
civilian employees and others authorized to travel at Government 
expense.


<R05>
Sec. 300-1.2  What is the purpose of the FTR?

    There are two principal purposes:
    (a) To interpret statutory and other policy requirements in a manner 
that balances the need to assure that official travel is conducted in a 
responsible manner with the need to minimize administrative costs;
    (b) To communicate the resulting policies in a clear manner to 
Federal agencies and employees.

sections. However, while the employee provisions are addressed to the 
employee, the rules expressed in those provisions apply to the agency as 
well. The following lists the relevant employee and agency sections of 
the FTR:

 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                   The employee        And the agency

<R05>
Sec. 300-2.23  How is the user addressed in the FTR?

then answers the questions in the second and third person. In the 
employee sections, the employee is addressed in the singular, and in the 
agency sections, the agency is addressed in the plural. The

expenses incurred on a foreign ship in the absence of satisfactory proof 
of the necessity therefor.

    (2) General requirements of the Fly America Act. The Fly America 
Act, 49 U.S.C. App. 1517, as implemented by the Comptroller General's 
guidelines, Decision B-138942, March 31, 1981, requires Federal 
employees and their dependents, consultants, contractors, grantees, and 
others performing United States Government financed foreign air travel 
to travel by U.S. flag air carriers:
    (i) Unless travel by foreign air carrier is a matter of necessity as 
defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, or
    (ii) When U.S. flag air carrier service is available within the 
guidelines in paragraphs (b) (4) and (5) of this section.
    (3) Necessity for use of foreign air carrier service. Use of foreign 
air carrier service may be deemed necessary if a U.S. flag air carrier 
otherwise available cannot provide the air transportation needed, or use 
of U.S. flag air carrier service will not accomplish the agency's 
mission.
    (4) Availability of U.S. flag air carrier service--(i) General. U.S. 
flag air carrier service is available even though:
    (A) Comparable or a different kind of service can be provided at 
less cost by a foreign air carrier;
    (B) Foreign air carrier service is preferred by or is more 
convenient for the agency or the traveler; or
    (C) Service by a foreign air carrier can be paid for in excess 
foreign currency, unless U.S. flag air carriers decline to accept excess 
or near excess foreign currencies for transportation payable only out of 
those monies. (See also paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of this section.)
    (ii) Scheduling principles. In determining availability of U.S. flag 
air carrier service, the following scheduling principles should be 
followed unless their

[[Page 24]]

application results in the last or first leg of travel to and from the 
United States being performed by foreign air carrier:
    (A) U.S. flag air carrier service available at point of origin 
should be used to destination or, in the absence of direct or through 
service, to the farthest interchange point on a usually traveled route;
    (B) Where an origin or interchange point is not served by U.S. flag 
air carrier, foreign air carrier service should be used only to the 
nearest interchange point on a usually traveled route to connect with 
U.S. flag air carrier service; or
    (C) Where a U.S. flag air carrier involuntarily reroutes the 
traveler via a foreign carrier, the foreign air carrier may be used 
notwithstanding the availability of alternative U.S. flag air carrier 
service.
    (5) Guidelines for determining unavailability of U.S. flag air 
carrier service--(i) Travel to and from the United States. Passenger 
service by a U.S. flag air carrier will not be considered available when 
the travel is between a gateway airport in the United States and a 
gateway airport abroad and the gateway airport abroad is:
    (A) The traveler's origin or destination airport, and the use of 
U.S. flag air carrier service would extend the time in a travel status, 
including delay at origin and accelerated arrival at destination, by at 
least 24 hours more than travel by foreign air carrier;
    (B) An interchange point, and the use of U.S. flag air carrier 
service would require the traveler to wait 6 hours or more to make 
connections at that point, or delayed departure from or accelerated 
arrival at the gateway airport in the United States would extend the 
time in a travel status by at least 6 hours more than travel by foreign 
air carrier.
    (ii) Travel between two points outside the United States. For travel 
between two points outside the United States, U.S. flag air carrier 
service will not be considered to be reasonably available:
    (A) If travel by foreign air carrier would eliminate two or more 
aircraft changes en route;
    (B) Where one of the two points abroad is the gateway airport en 
route to or from the United States, if the use of a U.S. flag air 
carrier would extend the time in a travel status by at least 6 hours 
more than travel by foreign air carrier, including accelerated arrival 
at the overseas destination or delayed departure from the overseas 
origin, as well as delay at the gateway airport or other interchange 
point abroad; or
    (C) Where the travel is not part of a trip to or from the United 
States, if the use of a U.S. flag air carrier would extend the time in a 
travel status by at least 6 hours more than traveled by foreign air 
carrier including delay at origin, delay en route and accelerated 
arrival at destination.
    (iii) Short distance travel. For all short distance travel, 
regardless of origin and destination, U.S. flag air carrier service will 
not be considered available when the elapsed travel time on a scheduled 
flight from origin to destination airport by foreign air carrier is 3 
hours or less and service by U.S. flag air carrier would involve twice 
the travel time.
    (iv) Travel financed solely with excess foreign currencies. U.S. 
flag air carriers render themselves unavailable by declining to accept 
payment in foreign currencies for transportation services required by 
certain programs or activities of the Government which, under 
legislative authority, are financed solely with excess foreign 
currencies which may not be converted to U.S. dollars. In these 
instances, and notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(C) 
of this section, foreign flag air carriers that will accept the required 
foreign currency may be used to the extent necessary to accomplish the 
mission of the particular program or activity. The statement of 
justification required under paragraph (c)(3) of this section must 
indicate that the transportation service needed can be paid for only in 
excess foreign currencies and that otherwise available U.S. flag air 
carriers declined to accept payment in the foreign currencies.
    (c) Use of foreign flag air carriers--(1) Authorization or approval. 
Expenditures for commercial foreign air transportation on foreign air 
carrier(s) will be disallowed unless there is attached to the 
appropriate voucher a certificate or memorandum adequately explaining

[[Page 25]]

why service by U.S. flag air carrier(s) is not available, or why it was 
necessary to use a foreign air carrier. The use of foreign flag air 
carriers may be authorized or approved only when U.S. flag air carrier 
service is not available as determined under the guidelines in paragraph 
(b) of this section, or when foreign air carriers are used under the 
reciprocal terms of an appropriate bilateral or multilateral agreement 
as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, or when use of foreign 
carriers is necessary under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
    (2) Air transport agreements. Nothing in the guidelines contained in 
paragraph (b) of this section shall preclude and no penalty shall attend 
the use of a foreign air carrier which provides transportation under an 
air transport agreement between the United States and a foreign 
government, the terms of which are consistent with the international 
aviation policy goals set forth at 49 U.S.C. App. 1502(b) and provide 
reciprocal rights and benefits.
    (3) Justification statement. A statement executed by the traveler or 
agency justifying the use of a foreign flag air carrier for any part of 
foreign travel must be entered on or attached to the travel voucher, 
transportation request, or other payment document. Each request for a 
change in route or schedule which involves the use of a foreign flag air 
carrier must be accompanied by a statement justifying such use. The 
following is provided as a guide for preparing the required 
justification statement:

    I certify that it (is) (was) necessary for

    (4) Employee liability for disallowed expenditures. Where the travel 
is by indirect route or the traveler otherwise fails to use available 
U.S. flag air carrier service, the amount to be disallowed against the 
traveler is based on the loss of revenues suffered by U.S. flag air 
carriers as determined under the following formula set forth and more 
fully explained in 56 Comp. Gen. 209 (1977):

 
 
   Sum of certificated carrier
   segment mileage, authorized
---------------------------------      x            Fare payable by
   Sum of all segment mileage,                         Government
           authorized
      Minus


 
 
  Sum of certificated carrier

    Yes, when performing official travel, including local travel.


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.2  What expenses are payable as transportation?

    Fares, rental fees, mileage payments, and other expenses related to 
transportation.


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.3  What methods of transportation may my agency authorize me to use?

    Your agency may authorize:
    (a) Common carrier transportation (e.g., aircraft, train, bus, ship, 
or local transit system) under Subpart B;
    (b) Government vehicle under Subpart C;
    (c) POV under Subpart D; or
    (d) Special conveyance (e.g., taxi or commercial automobile) under 
Subpart E.


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.4  How does my agency select the method of transportation to be used?

    Your agency must select the method most advantageous to the 
Government, when cost and other factors are considered. Under 5 U.S.C. 
5733, travel must be by the most expeditious means of transportation 
practicable and commensurate with the nature and purpose of your duties. 
In addition, your agency must consider energy conservation, total cost 
to the Government (including costs of per diem, overtime, lost worktime, 
and actual transportation costs), total distance traveled, number of 
points visited, and number of travelers.


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.5  What are the presumptions as to the most advantageous method of transportation?

    (a) Common carrier. Travel by common carrier is presumed to be the 
most advantageous method of transportation and must be used when 
reasonably available.
    (b) Government automobile. When your agency determines that your 
travel must be performed by automobile, a Government automobile is 
presumed to be the most advantageous method of transportation.


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.6  What is my liability if I do not travel by the selected method of transportation?

    If you do not travel by the method of transportation required by 
regulation or selected by your agency, any additional expenses you incur 
will be borne by you.

[[Page 28]]


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.7  How should I route my travel?

    You must travel to your destination by the usually traveled route 
unless your agency authorizes or approves a different route as 
officially necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.8  What is my liability if, for personal convenience, I travel by an indirect route or interrupt travel by a direct route?

    Your reimbursement will be limited to the cost of travel by a direct 
route or on an uninterrupted basis. You will be responsible for any 
additional costs.


<R04>
                Subpart B--Common Carrier Transportation


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.100  What types of common carrier transportation may I be authorized to use?

    You may be authorized to use airline, train, ship, bus, or local 
transit system.

                                 Airline


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.106  What are the basic requirements for using airlines?

    The requirements for using airlines fall into three categories:
    (a) Using contract carriers, when available;
    (b) Using coach class service, unless premium class or first-class 
service is authorized;
    (c) Using U.S. flag air carrier or (ship) service, unless use of 
foreign air carrier or (ship) is authorized.
[63 FR 15955, Apr. 1, 1998; 63 FR 35537, June 30, 1998]

                     Use of Contract City-Pair Fares


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.107  When must I use a contract city-pair fare?

    You must always use a contract city-pair fare, if such fare is 
available to you unless one or more of the following conditions exist:
    (a) Seating space on the scheduled contract flight is not available 
in time to accomplish the purpose of travel, or use of contract service 
would require you to incur unnecessary overnight lodging costs which 
would increase the total cost of the trip; or
    (b) The contract's flight schedule is inconsistent with explicit 
policies of individual Federal departments and agencies or other 
mandatory users of scheduling employee travel during normal working 
hours; or
    (c) A non-contract carrier offers a lower fare available to the 
general public, the use of which will result in a lower total trip cost 
to the Government or other mandatory user. This determination should be 
based on a cost comparison to include the combined cost of 
transportation, lodging, meals and related expenses.


    Note to paragraph (c).  This exception does not apply if a contract 
carrier offers a comparable fare and has seats available at that fare, 
or if the lower fare offered by a non-contract carrier is restricted to 
Government and military travelers on official business and may only be 
purchased with a GTR, contractor issued charge card or centrally billed 
account (e.g., YDG, MDG, ODG, VDG, and similar fares).


    (d) Rail service is available, and such service is cost effective 
and is consistent with the mission.


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.108  Are there other situations when I may use a non-contract fare?

    You may also use a non-contract fare such as a through fare, special 
fare, commutation fare, excursion fare or reduced-rate round-trip fare 
in the following circumstances:
    (a) Your agency determines prior to your travel that this type of 
service is practical and economical to the Government; and
    (b) In the case of a fare that is restricted or has specific 
eligibility requirements, you know or reasonably can anticipate, based 
on the travel as planned, that you will use the ticket.


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.109  What is my liability for unauthorized use of a non-contract carrier when contract service is available and I do not meet one of the exceptions 
          for required use?

    Any additional costs or penalties incurred by you resulting from 
unauthorized use of non-contract service are borne by you.

[[Page 29]]


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.110  May I use contract passenger transportation service for personal travel?

    No.


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.111  When may I use a reduced group or charter fare?

    You may use a reduced group or charter fare when your agency has 
determined on an individual case basis prior to your travel that use of 
such a fare is economical to the Government and will not interfere with 
the conduct of official business.


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.112  What must I do when different airlines furnish the same service at different fares?

    When there is no contract fare, and common carriers furnish the same 
service at different fares between the same points for the same type of 
accommodations, you must use the lowest cost service unless your agency 
determines that the use of higher cost service is more advantageous to 
the Government.


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.113  What must I do if I change or do not use a common carrier reservation?

    If you know you will change or not use your reservation, you must 
take action to change or cancel it as prescribed by your agency. Also, 
you must report all changes of your reservation according to your 
agency's procedures in an effort to prevent losses to the Government. 
Failure to do so may subject you to liability for any resulting losses.


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.114  What must I do with unused Government Transportation Request(s)(GTR(s)), ticket(s) or refund application(s)?

    You must submit any unused GTR(s), unused ticket coupon(s), or 
refund application(s) to your agency in accordance with your agency's 
procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.115  Am I authorized to receive a refund or credit for unused transportation?

    No. You are not authorized to receive a refund, credit, or any other 
negotiable document from a carrier for unfurnished services (except as 
provided in Sec. 301-10.117) or any portion of an unused ticket issued 
in exchange for a GTR or billed to an agency's centrally billed account. 
However, any charges billed directly to your individually billed 
Government charge card should be credited to your account.
[63 FR 15955, Apr. 1, 1998; 63 FR 35537, June 30, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.116  What must I do with compensation an airline gives me if it denies me a seat on a plane?

    If you are performing official travel and a carrier denies you a 
confirmed reserved seat on a plane, you must give your agency any 
payment you receive for liquidated damages. You must ensure the carrier 
shows the ``Treasurer of the United States'' as payee on the 
compensation check and then forward the payment to the appropriate 
agency official.


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.117  May I keep compensation an airline gives me for voluntarily vacating my seat on my scheduled airline flight when the airline asks for 
          volunteers?

    Yes:
    (a) If voluntarily vacating your seat will not interfere with 
performing your official duties; and
    (b) If additional travel expenses, incurred as a result of vacating 
your seat, are borne by you and are not reimbursed; but

                           Rental Automobiles


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.450  When can I use a rental vehicle?

    Your agency must determine that use of a rental vehicle is 
advantageous to the Government and must specifically authorize such use.


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.451  May I be reimbursed for the cost of collision damage waiver (CDW) or theft insurance?

    (a) General rule--no. You will not be reimbursed for CDW or theft 
insurance for travel within CONUS for the following reasons:
    (1) The Government is a self-insurer.
    (2) Rental vehicles available under agreement(s) with the Government 
includes full coverage insurance for damages resulting from an accident 
while performing official travel.
    (3) Any deductible amount paid by you may be reimbursed directly to 
you or directly to the rental agency if the damage occurred while you 
were performing official business.
    (b) Exception. You will be reimbursed for collision damage waiver or 
theft insurance when you travel outside CONUS and such insurance is 
necessary because the rental or leasing agency requirements, foreign 
statute, or legal procedures could cause extreme difficulty for an 
employee involved in an accident.


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.452  May I be reimbursed for personal accident insurance?

    No. That is a personal expense and is not reimbursable.


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.453  What is my liability for unauthorized use of a rental automobile obtained with Government funds?

    You are responsible for any additional cost resulting from the 
unauthorized use of a commercial rental automobile for other than 
official travel-related purposes.

Sec. 301-11.7  What determines my maximum per diem reimbursement rate?

    Your TDY location determines your maximum per diem reimbursement 
rate. If you arrive at your lodging location after 12 midnight, you 
claim lodging cost for the preceding calendar day. If no lodging is 
required, the applicable M&IE reimbursement rate is the rate for the TDY 
location. (See Sec. 301-11.102.)
[63 FR 15961, Apr. 1, 1998; 63 FR 35537, June 30, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.8  What is the maximum per diem rate I will receive if lodging is not available at my TDY location?

    If lodging is not available at your TDY location, your agency may 
authorize or approve the maximum per diem rate for the location where 
lodging is obtained.


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.9  When does per diem or actual expense entitlement start/stop?

    Your per diem or actual expense entitlement starts on the day you 
depart your home, office, or other authorized point and ends on the day 
you return to your home, office or other authorized point.


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.10  Am I required to record departure/arrival dates and times on my travel claim?

    You must record the date of departure from, and arrival at, the 
official station or any other place travel begins or ends. You must show 
this same information for points where you perform TDY or for a stopover 
or official rest stop location when the arrival or departure affects 
your per diem allowance or other travel expenses. You also should show 
the dates for other points visited. You do not have to record departure/
arrival times, but you must annotate your travel claim when your travel 
is more than 12 hours but not exceeding 24 hours to reflect that fact.

[[Page 39]]


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.11  May I stay in a lodging facility of my choice?

    Yes. You are encouraged to stay in lodging facilities that have been 
approved by FEMA as ``approved accommodations''. To ensure that you are 
staying in an approved facility, given the best available choices and/or 
obtaining Government discount rates, you are further encouraged to make 
lodging arrangement through your agency's TMS.


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.12  How does the type of lodging I select affect my reimbursement?

    Your agency will reimburse you for different types of lodging as 
follows:
    (a) Conventional lodgings. (Hotel/motel, boarding house, etc.) You 
will be reimbursed the single occupancy rate.
    (b) Government quarters. You will be reimbursed, as a lodging 
expense, the fee or service charge you pay for use of the quarters.
    (c) Lodging with friend(s) or relative(s) (with or without charge). 
You may be reimbursed for additional costs your host incurs in 
accommodating you only if you are able to substantiate the costs and 
your agency determines them to be reasonable. You will not be reimbursed 
the cost of comparable conventional lodging in the area or a flat 
``token'' amount.
    (d) Nonconventional lodging. You may be reimbursed the cost of other 
types of lodging when there are no conventional lodging facilities in 
the area (e.g., in remote areas) or when conventional facilities are in 
short supply because of an influx of attendees at a special event (e.g., 
World's Fair or international sporting event). Such lodging includes 
college dormitories or similar facilities or rooms not offered 
commercially but made available to the public by area residents in their 
homes.
    (e) Recreational vehicle (trailer/camper). You may be reimbursed for 
expenses (parking fees, fees for connection, use, and disconnection of 
utilities, electricity, gas, water and sewage, bath or shower fees, and 
dumping fees) which may be considered as a lodging cost.


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.13  How does sharing a room with another person affect my per diem reimbursement?

    Your reimbursement is limited to one-half of the double occupancy 
rate if the person sharing the room is another Government employee on 
official travel. If the person sharing the room is not a Government 
employee on official travel, your reimbursement is limited to the single 
occupancy rate.


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.14  How is my daily lodging rate computed when I rent lodging on a long-term basis?

    When you obtain lodging on a long-term basis (e.g., weekly or 
monthly) your daily lodging rate is computed by dividing the total 
lodging cost by the number of days of occupancy for which you are 
entitled to per diem, provided the cost does not exceed the daily rate 
of conventional lodging. Otherwise the daily lodging cost is computed by 
dividing the total lodging cost by the number of days in the rental 
period. Reimbursement, including an appropriate amount for M&IE, may not 
exceed the maximum daily per diem rate for the TDY location.


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.15  What expenses may be considered part of the daily lodging cost when I rent on a long-term basis?

    When you rent a room, apartment, house, or other lodging on a long-
term basis (e.g., weekly, monthly), the following expenses may be 
considered part of the lodging cost:
    (a) The rental cost for a furnished dwelling; if unfurnished, the 
rental cost of the dwelling and the cost of appropriate and necessary 
furniture and appliances (e.g., stove, refrigerator, chairs, tables, 
bed, sofa, television, or vacuum cleaner);
    (b) Cost of connecting/disconnecting and using utilities;
    (c) Cost of reasonable maid fees and cleaning charges;
    (d) Monthly telephone use fee (does not include installation and 
long-distance calls); and,
    (e) If ordinarily included in the price of a hotel/motel room in the 
area concerned, the cost of special user fees (e.g., cable TV charges 
and plug-in

[[Page 40]]

charges for automobile head bolt heaters).


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.16  What reimbursement will I receive if I prepay my lodging expenses and my TDY is curtailed, canceled or interrupted for official purposes or for 
          other reasons beyond my control that are acceptable to my 
          agency?

    If you sought to obtain a refund or otherwise took steps to minimize 
the cost, your agency may reimburse expenses that are not refundable, 
including a forfeited rental deposit.


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.17  If my agency authorizes per diem reimbursement, will it reduce my M&IE allowance for a meal(s) provided by a common carrier or for a 
          complimentary meal(s) provided by a hotel/motel?

    No. A meal provided by a common carrier or a complimentary meal 
provided by a hotel/motel does not affect your per diem.


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.18  What M&IE rate will I receive if a meal(s) is furnished at nominal or no cost by the Government or is included in the registration fee?

    Your M&IE rate must be adjusted for a meal(s) furnished to you 
(except as provided in Sec. 301-11.17), with or without cost, by 
deducting the appropriate amount shown in the chart in this section for 
CONUS travel, reference Appendix B of this chapter for OCONUS travel, or 
any method determined by your agency. If you pay for a meal that has 
been previously deducted, your agency will reimburse you up to the 
deduction amount. The total amount of deductions made will not cause you 
to receive less than the amount allowed for incidental expenses.

<R05>
Sec. 301-11.19  How is my per diem calculated when I travel across the international dateline (IDL)?

    When you cross the IDL your actual elapsed travel time will be used 
to compute your per diem entitlement rather than calendar days.


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.20  May my agency authorize a rest period for me while I am traveling?

    (a) Your agency may authorize a rest period not in excess of 24 
hours at either an intermediate point or at your destination if:
    (1) Either your origin or destination point is OCONUS;
    (2) Your scheduled flight time, including stopovers, exceeds 14 
hours;
    (3) Travel is by a direct or usually traveled route; and
    (4) Travel is by less than premium-class service.
    (b) When a rest stop is authorized the applicable per diem rate is 
the rate for the rest stop location.


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.21  Will I be reimbursed for per diem or actual expenses on leave or non-workdays (weekend, legal Federal Government holiday, or other scheduled 
          non-workdays) while I am on official travel?

    (a) In general, you will be reimbursed as long as your travel status 
requires your stay to include a non-workday, (e.g., if you are on travel 
through Friday and again starting Monday you will be reimbursed for 
Saturday and Sunday), however, your agency should determine the most 
cost effective situation (i.e., remaining in a travel status and paying 
per diem or actual expenses or permitting your return to your official 
station).
    (b) Your agency will determine whether you will be reimbursed for 
non-workdays when you take leave immediately (e.g., Friday or Monday) 
before of after the non-workday(s).


    Note to Sec. 301-11.21:  If emergency travel is involved due to an 
incapacitating illness or injury, the rules in part 301-30 of this 
chapter govern.

<R05>
Sec. 301-11.22  Am I entitled to per diem or actual expense reimbursement if I am required to return to my official station on a non-workday?

transportation expenses for periodic return travel on non-workdays to 
your home or official station under the following circumstances:

    You must itemize all expenses, including meals, (each meal must be 
itemized separately) for which you will be reimbursed under actual 
expense. However, expenses that do not accrue daily (e.g., laundry, dry 
cleaning, etc.) may be averaged over the number of days your agency 
authorizes/approves actual expenses. Receipts are required for lodging, 
regardless of amount and any individual meal when the cost exceeds $75. 
Your agency may require receipts for other allowable per diem expenses, 
but it must inform you of this requirement in advance of travel. When 
your agency limits M&IE reimbursement to either the prescribed maximum 
M&IE rate for the locality concerned or a reduced M&IE rate, it may or 
may not require M&IE itemization at its discretion.

<R04>
               Subpart A--General Policies and Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.1  How must we administer the authorization and payment of travel expenses?

    You must limit the authorization and payment of travel expenses to 
travel that is necessary to accomplish your mission in the most 
economical and effective manner, in accordance with the rules stated 
throughout this chapter. Consideration should be given, but not limited, 
to budget constraints, adherence to travel policies, and reasonableness 
of expenses. You should always consider alternatives, including 
teleconferencing, prior to authorizing travel.


<R04>
      SUBPART B--POLICIES AND PROCEDURES RELATING TO TRANSPORTATION


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.100  How must we administer the authorization and payment of transportation expenses?

    You must:
    (a) Limit authorization and payment of transportation expenses to 
those expenses that result in the greatest advantage to the Government;
    (b) Ensure that travel is by the most expeditious means practicable.


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.101  What factors must we consider in determining which method of transportation results in the greatest advantage to the Government?

    In selecting a particular method of transportation you must 
consider:
    (a) The total cost to the Government, including per diem, overtime, 
lost worktime, actual transportation cost, total distance of travel, 
number of points visited, the number of travelers and energy 
conservation. As stated in 5 U.S.C. 5733, ``travel of an employee shall 
be by the most expeditious means of transportation practicable and shall 
be commensurate with the nature and purpose of the duties of the 
employee requiring such travel.''
    (b) Travel by common carrier (air, rail, bus) is considered the most 
advantageous method to perform official travel. Other methods of 
transportation may be authorized as advantageous only when the use of 
common carrier transportation would interfere with the performance of 
official business or impose an undue hardship upon the traveler, or when 
the total cost by common carrier exceeds the cost by another method of 
transportation. A determination that another method of transportation is 
more advantageous to the Government than common carrier will not be made 
on the basis of personal preference or inconvenience to the traveler.


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.102  What governing policies must we establish for authorization and payment of transportation expenses?

    You must establish policies and procedures governing:
    (a) Who will determine what method of transportation is more 
advantageous to the Government;
    (b) Who will approve any of the following:
    (1) Use of premium class service under Sec. 301-10.123, Sec. 301-
10.124, Sec. 301-10.162 and Sec. 301-10.183 of this chapter;
    (2) Use of a special-reduced fare or reduced group or charter fare;
    (3) Use of an extra-fare train service under Sec. 301-10.164;
    (4) Use of ship service;
    (5) Use of a foreign ship;
    (6) Use of a foreign air carrier;
    (c) When you will:
    (1) Require the use of a Government vehicle;
    (2) Allow the use of a Government vehicle; and
    (3) Prohibit the use of a Government vehicle;
    (d) When you will consider use of a POV advantageous to the 
Government, such as travel to/from common carrier terminals, or 
transportation to a TDY location;
    (e) Procedures for claiming POV reimbursement;
    (f) When you will allow use of a special conveyance (e.g. 
commercially rented vehicles);
    (g) What procedures an employee must follow when he/she travels by 
an indirect route or interrupts travel by a direct route; and
    (h) For local transportation whether to reimburse the full amount of 
transportation costs or only the amount by which transportation costs 
exceed the

[[Page 57]]

employee's normal costs for transportation between:
    (1) Office or duty point and another place of business;
    (2) Places of business; or
    (3) Residence and place of business other than office or duty point.


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.103  In what circumstance may we authorize use of ship service?

    Travel by ship is not generally regarded as advantageous. You must 
determine that the advantages accruing from the use of ocean 
transportation offset the higher costs associated with ship travel, 
i.e., per diem, transportation, and lost worktime.


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.104  What factors should we consider in determining whether to require an employee to commit to the use of a Government automobile?

    You should consider:
    (a) The advantages of using a Government automobile. Such advantages 
may include, but are not limited to:
    (1) Full utilization or availability of fleet vehicles;
    (2) Lower cost;
    (3) Official presence.
    (b) The type of travel the employee performs. You should require 
such a commitment when an employee or group of employees requires the 
use of an automobile for official travel on a frequent or repetitive 
basis.


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.105  May we prohibit an employee from using a POV on official travel?

    No, but if the employee elects to use a POV instead of an 
alternative form of transportation you authorize, you must:
    (a) Limit reimbursement to the constructive cost of the authorized 
method of transportation, which is the sum of per diem and 
transportation expenses the employee would reasonably have incurred when 
traveling by the authorized method of transportation; and
    (b) Charge leave for any duty hours that are missed as a result of 
travel by POV.


<R04>
    Subpart C--Policies and Procedures Relating to Per Diem Expenses


<R05>

(see Sec. 301-11.20 for minimum standards);
    (c) If, and in what instances, you will allow an employee to return 
to his/her official station on non-workdays;
    (d) Who will determine if an employee will be allowed to return to 
his/her official station on a case by case basis.
    (e) Who will determine in what instances you will pay a reduced per 
diem rate;
    (f) Who will determine, and in what instances, actual expenses are 
appropriate in each individual case; and
    (g) If you will define a radius broader than the official station in 
which per diem or actual expense will not be authorized.


<R04>
  Subpart D--Policies and Procedures Relating to Miscellaneous Expenses


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.300  How should we administer the authorization and payment of miscellaneous expenses?

    You should limit payment of miscellaneous expenses to only those 
expenses that are necessary and in the interest of the Government.


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.301  What governing policies must we establish for payment of miscellaneous expenses?

    You must establish policies and procedures governing:
    (a) Who will determine when excess baggage is necessary for official 
travel;
    (b) When you will pay for communications services, including whether 
you will pay for a telephone call to the employee's home or place where 
the employee's dependent children are;
    (c) Who will determine if other miscellaneous expenses are 
appropriate for

[[Page 58]]

reimbursement in connection with official travel.


<R04>
  Subpart E--Policies and Procedures Relating to Travel of an Employee 
                    with a Disability or Special Need


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.400  How should we authorize and administer the payment of additional travel expenses for an employee with a disability or special need?

    You should authorize and administer the payment to reasonably 
accommodate employee(s) with disabilities in accordance with the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 701-797(b) and 5 
U.S.C. 3102 and Part 301-13 of this chapter. An employee with a special 
need should be treated the same as an employee with a disability. The 
additional travel expenses must be necessary to accommodate the 
employee's needs.
[63 FR 15971, Apr. 1, 1998; 63 FR 35538, June 30, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.401  What governing policies and procedures must we establish regarding travel of an employee with a disability or special need?

    You must establish the policies and procedures governing:
    (a) Who will determine if an employee has a disability or special 
need which requires accommodation, including when documentation is 
necessary under Sec. Sec. 301-10.123, 301-10.124, 301-10.162, and 301-
10.183, and when a determination may be based on a clearly visible 
physical condition; and
    (b) Who will determine how to reasonably accommodate the employee

    (b) Who will determine if the employee's situation warrants payment 
for emergency travel expenses;
    (c) When and by whom travel to an alternate location other than 
official station or point of interruption will be authorized; and
    (d) Who will determine when and if the definition of family may be 
extended and to whom.


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.501  Does per diem continue when an employee interrupts a travel assignment because of an incapacitating illness or injury?

    Yes. Such an employee who takes leave of any kind will be allowed a 
per diem allowance not to exceed the maximum rates for the location 
where the interruption occurs. Per diem may be continued for a 
reasonable period, normally not to exceed 14 calendar days (including 
fractional days) for any one period of absence. However, per diem will 
not be paid if the employee is confined to a hospital or medical 
facility at the official duty station or medical facility which the 
employee would have selected for treatment if the illness or injury had 
occurred at the official station.


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.502  What additional emergency expenses should we allow for?

    When an employee discontinues a TDY assignment before its completion 
due to an incapacitating illness or injury, transportation and per diem 
expenses are allowed for return travel to the official station or to 
receive medical attention.


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.503  When the employee is able to travel, should we continue the use of the existing travel authorization?

    Not if the interrupted trip was authorized under a trip by trip 
authorization. If, when the employee's health has been restored, the 
agency decides that it is in the Government's interest to return the 
employee to the TDY location, such return is considered to be a new 
travel assignment at Government expense. An interrupted trip authorized 
under an open or limited open authorization may be continued without 
further authorization.

[[Page 59]]


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.504  May any travel costs be reimbursed if the employee travels to an alternate location for medical treatment?

    Yes. When an employee, interrupts a TDY assignment because of an 
incapacitating illness or injury and takes leave of absence for travel 
to an alternate location to obtain medical services and returns to the 
TDY assignment, you may reimburse certain excess travel costs provided 
in this section. Specifically, you may reimburse the excess (if any) of 
actual costs of travel from the point of interruption to the alternate 
location and return to the TDY assignment, over the constructive costs 
of round-trip travel between the official station and the alternate 
location. The nearest hospital or medical facility capable of treating 
the employee's illness or injury will not, however, be considered an 
alternate location.


    Note to Sec. 301-70.504:  An alternate location is a destination 
other than the employee's official station or the point of interruption.


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.505  How do we define actual cost and constructive cost when an employee interrupts a travel assignment because of an incapacitating illness or 
          injury?

    (a) Actual cost of travel will be the transportation expenses 
incurred and en route per diem for the travel as actually performed from 
the point of interruption to the alternate location and from the 
alternate location to the TDY assignment. No per diem is allowed for 
time spent at the alternate location if confined to a medical facility.
    (b) Constructive cost is the sum of transportation expenses the 
employee would reasonably have incurred for round-trip travel between 
the official station and the alternate location plus per diem calculated 
for the appropriate en route travel time.


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.506  May we authorize per diem if an employee discontinues a TDY assignment because of a personal emergency situation?

    Yes. Expenses of appropriate transportation and per diem while en 
route may be allowed, with the approval of an appropriate agency 
official, for return travel from the point of interruption to the 
official station.


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.507  How do we handle reimbursement if the employee travels to an alternate location and returns to the TDY location because of a personal emergency 
          situation?

    You may reimburse certain excess travel costs (transportation and en 
route per diem) to the same extent as provided in Sec. 301-70.501 for 
incapacitating illness or injury to the employee.


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.508  What factors must we consider in expanding the definition of family for emergency travel purposes?

    Agencies must consider on a case by case basis:
    (a) The extent of the emergency;
    (b) The employee's relationship to the individual involved in the 
emergency; and
    (c) The degree of the employee's responsibility for the individual 
involved in the emergency.


<R04>
     Subpart G--Policies and Procedures Relating to Threatened Law 
                   Enforcement/Investigative Employees


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.600  What governing policies and procedures must we establish related to threatened law enforcement/investigative employees?

    You must establish policies and procedures governing:
    (a) When you will pay transportation and subsistence expenses of 
threatened law enforcement/investigative employees, under part 301-31 of 
this chapter;
    (b) Who will determine the degree and seriousness of threat in each 
individual case;
    (c) Who will determine what protective action should be taken, 
including the location and duration of temporary lodging;
    (d) Who will reevaluate the situation to determine whether 
protective action should be continued or discontinued and how often;
    (e) What procedures must be followed to obtain authorization of 
transportation and subsistence expenses for threatened law enforcement/
investigative employees; and

[[Page 60]]

    (f) What special procedures must an employee follow to claim 
expenses.


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.601  What factors should we consider in determining whether to authorize payment of transportation and subsistence expenses for threatened law 
          enforcement/investigative employees?

    You should consider:
    (a) The degree and seriousness of the threat. You should pay 
transportation and subsistence expenses only if a situation poses a 
legitimate serious threat to life.
    (b) The option of relocating the employee. You should consider 
whether relocating the employee permanently would be advantageous given 
the specific nature of the threat, the continued disruption of the 
family, and the alternative costs of a change of official station.


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.602  How often must we reevaluate the payment of transportation and subsistence expenses to a threatened law enforcement/investigative employee?

    You must reevaluate the situation every 30 days based on the same 
factors you considered when you first authorized the payment of the 
expenses.

exceeds the amount of estimated travel expenses for the authorized 
period and collect the excess amount from the employee.


<R05>
Sec. 301-71.306  How do we collect the amount of a travel advance in excess of the amount of travel expenses substantiated by the employee?

    When the outstanding advance exceeds what you owe the employee, then

of the United States Code).


<R05>
Sec. 301-71.307  What should we do if the employee does not pay back a travel advance when the travel claim is filed?

    You should take alternative steps to collect the debt including:
    (a) Offset against the employee's salary, a retirement credit, or 
other amount owed the employee;
    (b) Deduction from an amount the Government owes the employee; or
    (c) Any other legal method of recovery.

    Travel by common carrier is presumed to be the most advantageous 
method of transportation because it generally results in the most 
efficient, least costly, most expeditious means of transportation and 
the most efficient use of energy resources.


<R05>
Sec. 301-72.2  May we utilize methods of transportation other than common carrier (e.g. POVs, chartered vehicles, etc.)?

    Yes, but only when use of common carrier transportation:
    (a) Would interfere with the performance of official business;
    (b) Would impose an undue hardship upon the traveler; or
    (c) When the total cost by common carrier would exceed the cost of 
the other method of transportation.


<R05>
Sec. 301-72.3  What method of payment must we authorize for common carrier transportation?

    You must authorize one or more of the following as appropriate:
    (a) GSA's Government contractor-issued individually billed charge 
card(s);
    (b) Agency centrally billed or other established accounts;
    (c) Cash payments (personal funds or travel advances in the form of 
travelers checks or authorized ATM cash withdrawals) when the cost of 
transportation is less than $100, under Sec. 301-51.100 of this chapter 
(cash may or may not be accepted by the carrier for the purchase of city 
pair fares); or
    (d) GTR(s) when no other option is available or feasible.

         Subpart B--Accounting for Common Carrier Transportation


<R05>

    (a) Authorize the use of cash in accordance with Sec. 301-51.100 or 
as otherwise required;
    (b) Correlate travel data accumulated by your authorization and 
claims accounting systems with common carrier transportation documents 
and data for audit purposes;
    (c) Identify unused tickets for refund;
    (d) Collect unused, partially used, or downgraded/exchanged tickets, 
from travelers upon completion of travel;
    (e) Track denied boarding compensation from employees;
    (f) Identify and collect refunds due from carriers for overpayments, 
or unused, partially used, or downgraded/exchanged tickets; and
    (g) Reconcile all centrally billed travel expenses (e.g. airline, 
lodging, car rentals, etc.) with travel authorizations and claims to 
assure that only authorized charges are paid.


<R05>
Sec. 301-72.101  What information should we provide an employee before authorizing the use of common carrier transportation?

    You should provide the employee:
    (a) Notice that he/she is accountable for all tickets, GTRs and 
other transportation documents;
    (b) Your procedures for the control and accounting of common carrier 
transportation documents, including the procedures for submitting 
unused, partially used, downgraded/exchanged tickets, refund receipts or 
ticket refund applications, and denied boarding compensation; and
    (c) A credit/refund address so the carrier can credit/refund the 
agency for unused tickets (when the tickets have been issued using an 
agency centrally billed account or by GTR).

    In accordance with Sec. 301-51.100.


<R05>
Sec. 301-72.201  What must we do if an employee uses cash in excess of the $100 limit to purchase common carrier transportation?

<R05>
Sec. 301-72.202  Who may approve cash payments in excess of the $100 limit?

    You must ensure the delegation of authority for the authorization or 
approval of cash payments over the $100 limit is in accordance with 41 
CFR 101-41.203-2.


<R05>
Sec. 301-72.203  When may we limit traveler reimbursement for a cash payment?

    If you determine that the cash payment was made under a non-
emergency circumstance, reimbursement to the traveler must not exceed 
the cost which would have been properly chargeable to the Government had 
the traveler used a government provided payment resource, (e.g. 
individual Government contractor-issued travel charge card, centrally 
billed account, or GTR). However, an agency can determine to make full 
payment when circumstances warrant (e.g. invitational travel, infrequent 
travelers and interviewees).
[63 FR 15976, Apr. 1, 1998; 63 FR 35538, June 30, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 301-72.204  What must we do to minimize the need for a traveler to use cash to procure common carrier transportation services?

individual Government contractor-issued travel charge card(s), or your 
agency's centrally billed or other established account, or a GTR (when 
no other option is available or feasible).

 Appendix A To Chapter 301--Prescribed Maximum Per Diem Rates for CONUS

    The maximum rates listed below are prescribed under Sec. 301-7.3(a) 
of this chapter for reimbursement of per diem expenses incurred during 
official travel within CONUS (the continental United States). The amount 
shown in column (a) is the maximum that will be reimbursed for lodging 
expenses including applicable taxes. The M&IE rate shown in column (b) 
is a fixed amount allowed for meals and incidental expenses covered by 
per diem. The per diem payment calculated in accordance with part 301-7 
of this chapter for lodging expenses plus the M&IE rate may not exceed 
the maximum per diem rate shown in column (c). Seasonal rates apply 
during the periods indicated.
    It is the policy of the Government, as reflected in the Hotel Motel 
Fire Safety Act of 1990 (Pub. L. No. 101-391, September 25, 1990), 
referred to as ``the Act'' in this paragraph, to save lives and protect 
property by promoting fire safety in hotels, motels, and all places of 
public accommodation affecting commerce. In furtherance of the Act's 
goals, employees are encouraged to stay in a facility which is fire-
safe, i.e., an approved accommodation, when commercial lodging is 
required. Lodgings that have met the Government requirements are listed 
on the U. S. Fire Administration's Internet site at http://
www.usfa.fema.gov/hotel/index.htm.

\1\ Unless otherwise specified, the per diem locality is defined as ``all locations within, or entirely
  surrounded by, the corporate limits of the key city, including independent entities located within those
  boundaries.''
\2\ Per diem localities with county definitions shall include ``all locations within, or entirely surrounded by,
  the corporate limits of the key city as well as the boundaries of the listed counties, including independent
  entities located within the boundaries of the key city and the listed counties.''
\3\ When a military installation or Government-related facility (whether or not specifically named) is located
  partially within more than one city or county boundary, the applicable per diem rate for the entire
  installation or facility is the higher of the two rates which apply to the cities and/or counties, even though
  part(s) of such activities may be located outside the defined per diem locality.
\4\ Federal agencies may submit a request to GSA for review of the costs covered by per diem in a particular
  city or area where the standard CONUS rate applies when travel to that location is repetitive or on a
  continuing basis and travelers' experiences indicate that the prescribed rate is inadequate. Other per diem
  localities listed in this appendix will be reviewed on an annual basis by GSA to determine whether rates are
  adequate. Requests for per diem rate adjustments shall be submitted by the agency headquarters office to the
  General Services Administration, Office of Governmentwide Policy, Attn: Travel and Transportation Management
  Policy Division (MTT), Washington, DC 20405. Agencies should designate an individual responsible for
  reviewing, coordinating, and submitting to GSA any requests from bureaus or subagencies. Requests for rate
  adjustments shall include a city designation, a description of the surrounding location involved (county or
  other defined area), and a recommended rate supported by a statement explaining the circumstances that cause
  the existing rate to be inadequate. The request also must contain an estimate of the annual number of trips to
  the location, the average duration of such trips, and the primary purpose of travel to the locations. Agencies
  should submit their requests to GSA no later than May 1 in order for a city to be included in the annual
  review.
\5\ The standard CONUS rate of $80 ($50 for lodging and $30 for M&IE) applies to all per diem localities in the
  State of North Dakota.

Appendix B to Chapter 301--Allocation of M&IE Rates to Be Used in Making 
                   Deductions From the M&IE Allowance

    M&IE rates for localities in nonforeign areas (prescribed in 
Civilian Personnel Per Diem Bulletins published periodically in the 
Federal Register by the Secretary of Defense) and for localities in 
foreign areas (established by the Secretary of State in section 925, a 
per diem supplement to the Standardized Regulations (Government 
Civilians, Foreign Areas)) shall be allocated as shown in this table 
(Sec. 301-7.12(a)(2)(ii) of this chapter) when making deductions from 
nonforeign or foreign area per diem rates.

27488, May 27, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.3  General provisions.

    (a) Travel covered--(1) Mandatory coverage. When change of official 
station or other action described in this paragraph is authorized or 
approved by such official or officials as the head of the agency may 
designate, travel and transportation expenses and applicable allowances 
as provided in this chapter (see applicability and exclusions in 
pertinent parts) shall be paid in the case of:
    (i) An employee transferring from one official duty station to 
another for permanent duty, provided the transfer is in the interest of 
the Government and is not primarily for the convenience or benefit of 
the employee or at his/her request; the transfer is to a new official 
station which is at least 10

[[Page 97]]

miles distant from the old official station; and, in the case of a 
relatively short distance relocation, a determination of eligibility is 
made under Sec. 302-1.7(a) of this part;
    (ii) Eligible employees outside the continental United States 
traveling in connection with overseas tour renewal agreement travel;
    (iii) Eligible employees returning from posts of duty outside the 
continental United States to places of actual residence for separation 
as provided in Sec. 302-1.12 of this part; and
    (iv) Eligible individuals, as defined in Sec. 302-1.101 of this 
chapter, qualifying for ``last move home'' benefits upon separation from 
Government service as provided in subpart B of this part.
    (2) Discretionary coverage. The head of an agency, or his/her 
designee, may authorize the payment of travel and transportation 
expenses and applicable allowances in the case of:
    (i) A new appointee, as defined in Sec. 302-1.4(d), relocating from 
his/her place of actual residence at the time of appointment (or at the 
time following the most recent Presidential election, but before 
selection or appointment, in the case of an individual who has performed 
transition activities under section 3 of the Presidential Transition Act 
of 1963 (3 U.S.C. 102 note) and who is appointed in the same fiscal year 
as the Presidential inauguration that immediately follows his/her 
transition activities) for permanent duty to an official station; and
    (ii) An employee authorized a temporary change of station under 
subpart C of this part in connection with the employee s long-term 
assignment to a temporary official station.
    (b) Reasonable advance notice of reassignment or transfer. As 
provided in 5 U.S.C. 5724(j), ``the reassignment or transfer of any 
employee, for permanent duty, from one official station or agency to 
another which is outside the employee's commuting area shall take effect 
only after the employee has been given advance notice for a reasonable 
period. Emergency circumstances shall be taken into account in 
determining whether the period of advance notice is reasonable.'' 
Agencies shall give as much advance notice as possible to enable the 
employee to begin the arrangements necessary when relocating family and 
residence. However, see Sec. 302-1.7 governing payment of travel and 
transportation expenses and applicable allowances when short distances 
are involved. A reasonable period of advance notice should not be less 
than 30 days except when:
    (1) The employee and both the losing and gaining agencies agree on a 
lesser period;
    (2) Other statutory authority and implementing regulations stipulate 
a lesser period (see Office of Personnel Management regulations for 
specified timeframes); or
    (3) Emergency circumstances prevail.
    (c) Travel authorization. When it is determined that a relocation 
will be authorized at Government expense, a written travel authorization 
shall be issued to the new appointee or employee before he/she reports 
to the first or new official station. The agency should advise the 
employee, or individual selected for appointment, not to incur 
relocation expenses in anticipation of a relocation until he/she has 
received written notification. The travel authorization shall indicate 
the specific allowances which are authorized as provided in this chapter 
and provide instructions on the Federal procedures for procurement of 
travel and transportation services. The guidelines in Sec. 301-1.102 of 
this title on issuance of travel authorizations shall be followed. See 
also Sec. 302-1.10(c) for procedural requirements applicable to new 
appointees.
    (d) Applicable provisions for reimbursement purposes. Because of 
successive changes to the statutes and the regulatory provisions 
governing relocation allowances and the extended period of time that 
employees retain eligibility for certain allowances (see Secs. 302-1.6 
and 302-6.1(e)), the reimbursement maximums or limitations applicable to 
certain allowances will not be the same for all employees even though 
claims may be filed within the same timeframe. The regulatory provisions 
in effect on the employee's or new appointee's effective date of 
transfer or appointment (see Sec. 302-1.4(l)) shall be

[[Page 98]]

used for payment or reimbursement purposes.

as the Presidential inauguration that immediately follows his/her 
transition activities. New appointee also includes an individual

title, the term new appointee includes a student trainee who is assigned

mentally incapable of self-support. (The term ``children'' shall include 
natural offspring; stepchildren; adopted children; grandchildren, legal 
minor wards, or other dependent children who are under legal 
guardianship of the employee or employee's spouse; and a child born 
after the employee's effective date of transfer when the travel of the

support (less than 51 percent) from the employee or employee's spouse 
without which they would be unable to maintain a reasonable standard of 
living.

shipment of the following prohibited articles:

and no preliminary or enroute servicing or watering or other 
preservative method is required of the carrier.
    (2) Items which are irreplaceable or are of extreme value or 
sentiment are not provided special security by the carrier even though 
extra-value insurance may be purchased. Employees and their immediate 
families are advised to personally transport these types of items.
    (k) Official station or post of duty. The building or other place 
where the officer or employee regularly reports for duty. (For 
eligibility for change of station allowances, see Secs. 302-1.3 and 302-
1.7.) With respect to entitlement under this chapter relating to the 
residence and the household goods and personal effects of an employee, 
official station or post of duty also means the residence or other 
quarters from which the employee regularly commutes to and from work. 
However, where the official station or post of duty is in a remote area 
where adequate family housing is not available within reasonable daily 
commuting distance, residence includes the dwelling where the family of 
the employee resides or will reside, but

[[Page 100]]

only if such residence reasonably relates to the official station as 
determined by an appropriate administrative official.
    (l) Effective date of transfer or appointment. The date on which an 
employee or new appointee reports for duty at his/her new or first 
official station.

Sec. 302-1.5  Service agreements.

    (a) Transfers within the continental United States and appointments 
and assignments of new appointees and student trainees to any position 
within the United States. In connection with the transfer of employees 
between official stations within the continental United States, expenses 
authorized under this chapter shall not be allowed until the employee 
selected for such transfer agrees in writing to remain in the service of 
the Government for 12 months following the effective date of the 
transfer, unless separated for reasons beyond his/her control that are 
acceptable to the agency concerned. In case of a violation of such an 
agreement, including failure to effect the transfer, any funds expended 
by the United States for expenses authorized under this chapter shall be 
recoverable from the individual concerned as a debt due the United 
States. Such an agreement also is required from new appointees and 
student trainees appointed or assigned to any position within the United 
States, as a condition of payment for travel, transportation, moving 
and/or storage of household goods, and allowances as provided in 
Sec. 302-1.10. A signed agreement for 12 months' service shall be 
required for each permanent change of station.
    (b) Transfers, appointments, and separations involving posts of duty 
outside the continental United States. (1) In connection with the 
transfer or appointment of employees to posts of duty outside the 
continental United States, or between posts located in (i) separate 
countries, (ii) separate areas of the United States located outside the 
continental United States (e.g., Alaska, Hawaii, the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico), or (iii) any combination of these areas, the expenses of 
travel, transportation, moving and/or storage of household goods, and 
other applicable allowances as provided in this chapter shall not be 
allowed unless and until the employee selected for such transfer or 
appointment agrees in writing to remain in the service of the Government 
for 12 months following the effective date of the transfer or 
appointment (or for 1 school year for Department of Defense overseas 
dependents school system teachers as determined under chapter 25 of 
title 20 of the United States Code), unless separated for reasons beyond 
his/her control and acceptable to the agency concerned. In case of a 
violation of such an agreement, including failure to effect the 
transfer, any funds expended by the United States for such travel, 
transportation, and allowances shall be recoverable from the individual 
concerned as a debt due the United States.
    (2) Except as precluded by this chapter, upon separation from 
service, the expenses for return travel, transportation, and moving and/
or storage of household goods shall be allowed whether the separation is 
for the purposes of the Government or for personal convenience. However, 
such expenses shall not be allowed unless:
    (i) The employee transferred or appointed to posts of duty outside 
the continental United States shall have served for a minimum period of 
not less than 1 nor more than 3 years prescribed in advance by the head 
of the agency (or for 1 school year for Department of Defense overseas 
dependents school system teachers as determined under chapter 25 of 
title 20, United States Code); or
    (ii) Separation is for reasons beyond the control of the individual 
and acceptable to the agency concerned.
    (3) The head of the agency also shall consider requiring a service 
agreement in connection with the transfer of employees not otherwise 
covered by this subpart. The agreement shall provide that in determining 
any employee indebtedness for violation of such agreement, credit shall 
be given to the extent of any unused entitlements he/she may have earned 
for return travel and transportation to his/her place of actual 
residence for separation.

[[Page 101]]

    (c) Employee liability. The agreement to remain in the service of 
the Government for 12 months following the effective date of transfer is 
not voided by a subsequent transfer whether such subsequent transfer is 
at the employee's request or in the interest of the Government, nor is 
such agreement voided by another service agreement made in connection 
with a second transfer. The liability of the employee for any funds 
expended by the United States for his/her travel, transportation, and 
relocation allowances is a separate liability for each service 
agreement. The liability in each instance is effective for the full 12-
month period in connection with the transfer for which the service 
agreement was made.

Sec. 302-1.6  Time limits for beginning travel and transportation.

    All travel, including that for the immediate family, and 
transportation, including that for household goods allowed under this 
chapter, shall be accomplished as soon as possible. The maximum time for 
beginning allowable travel and transportation shall not exceed 2 years 
from the effective date of the employee's transfer or appointment, 
except that:
    (a) The 2-year period is exclusive of the time spent on furlough for 
an employee who begins active military service before the expiration of 
such period and who is furloughed for the duration of his/her assignment 
to the post of duty for which transportation and travel expenses are 
allowed;
    (b) The 2-year period does not include any time during which travel 
and transportation is not feasible due to shipping restrictions for an 
employee who is transferred or appointed to or from a post of duty 
outside the continental United States; and
    (c) The 2-year period shall be extended for an additional period of 
time not to exceed 1 year when the 2-year time limitation for completion 
of residence transactions is extended under Sec. 302-6.1(e).

<R05>
Sec. 302-1.7  Short distance involved.

    (a) Transfers. When the change of official station involves a short 
distance (at least 10 miles between stations as provided in Sec. 302-
1.3(a)(1)) within the same general local or metropolitan area, the 
travel and transportation expenses and applicable allowances in 
connection with the employee's relocation of his/her residence shall be 
authorized only when the agency determines that the relocation was 
incident to the change of official station. Such determination shall 
take into consideration such factors as commuting time and distance 
between the employee's residence at the time of notification of transfer 
and his/her old and new posts of duty as well as the commuting time and 
distance between a proposed new residence and the new post of duty. 
Ordinarily, a relocation of residence shall not be considered as 
incident to a change of official station unless the one-way commuting 
distance from the old residence to the new official station is at least 
10 miles greater than from the old residence to the old official 
station. Even then, circumstances surrounding a particular case (e.g., 
relative commuting time) may suggest that the move of residence was not 
incident to the change of official station. (See also specific distance 
limitations applicable to individual allowances; i.e., househunting 
trips in Sec. 302-4.3(c) and eligibility for temporary quarters 
subsistence expenses in Sec. 302-5.4(b).)
    (b) Appointments. For new appointees, whose place of actual 
residence at the time of selection for appointment and first duty 
station are located in the same general local or metropolitan area and 
who relocate their places of residence as a result of the appointment, 
the travel and transportation expenses as provided in Sec. 302-1.10 
shall be authorized only when the agency determines that the relocation 
of residence was incident to the appointment. To the extent applicable, 
the principles prescribed for transferred employees shall be considered 
in making this determination.

<R05>
Sec. 302-1.8  Two or more family members employed.

    (a) Members of the same immediate family who are employees. When two 
or more employees are members of the same immediate family, the 
allowances authorized under this chapter shall apply either to:
    (1) Each employee separately, in which instance none of the 
employees is eligible for any allowance as a member of the immediate 
family; or
    (2) Only one of the employees selected in accordance with paragraph 
(c) of this section, in which case the other employee(s) is eligible for 
allowances solely as a member(s) of the immediate family.
    (b) Non-employee members of the immediate family. When two or more 
employee members of the same immediate family elect separate allowances 
under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, non-employee members of the 
immediate family shall not receive duplicate allowances because of the 
fact that the employee members elected separate allowances.
    (c) Payment limitation. When employee members of the same immediate 
family elect separate allowances under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, 
the employing agency or agencies shall not make duplicate payment for 
the same expenses.
    (d) Procedures. A determination as to which of the two alternatives 
provided in paragraph (a) of this section is selected shall be made in 
writing and signed by all employee members of the same immediate family. 
When employee family members elect separate allowances under paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, the determination also shall specify under which 
employee member's authorization non-employee family members will receive 
allowances. A copy of this determination shall be filed with the agency 
in which each employee member is employed.

<R05>
Sec. 302-1.9  Reduction in force involved.

    (a) Impending separation. When an employee is assigned to a new 
official station after having been notified of involuntary separation 
not for cause but incident to the reduction, cessation, or transfer of 
the work at the station where he/she was employed, the transfer of the 
employee is deemed to be in the interest of the Government unless there 
is an affirmative administrative determination that the transfer is 
primarily for the employee's convenience or benefit.
    (b) Reemployment after separation. A former employee separated by 
reason of reduction in force or transfer of function who within 1 year 
of the date of separation is reemployed by an agency for a nontemporary 
appointment, at a different permanent duty station from that where the 
separation occurred, may be allowed and paid the expenses and other 
allowances (excluding nontemporary storage when assigned to an isolated 
permanent duty station within the continental United States) in the same 
manner as though he/she had been transferred in the interest of the 
Government to the permanent duty station where reemployed, from the 
permanent duty station where separated, without a break in service, and 
subject to the eligibility limitations as prescribed in this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 302-1.10  New appointees.

    (a) Coverage. New appointees to any position are eligible for 
payment only of those travel and transportation expenses listed in 
paragraph (e) of this section in relocating to their first official 
station. New appointees include student trainees who are assigned upon 
completion of college work. New appointees include not only individuals 
when first appointed to Government service but also individuals 
appointed after a break in service except that employees separated as a 
result of reduction in force or transfer of function may be treated as 
transferees instead of new appointees under the conditions set forth in 
Sec. 302-1.9.
    (b) Authorization and eligibility--(1) Authority to pay. Agencies 
may pay the relocation expenses allowed in paragraph (e) of this section 
for new appointees determined eligible under paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section. However, once an agency has made the determination to pay 
relocation expenses in an individual case, it must pay all of

[[Page 103]]

the allowable relocation expenses contained in paragraph (e) of this 
section.
    (2) Eligibility determination. Each agency shall establish specific 
criteria for determining which new appointees qualify for payment of 
allowable relocation expenses. The Office of Personnel Management has 
issued guidelines in 5 CFR part 572 for agencies to follow in making 
these personnel determinations.
    (c) Agency responsibility. Because new appointees usually lack 
experience in Government procedures, each agency shall adopt special 
measures to provide full information to new appointees concerning the 
benefits which may be available to them for travel and transportation 
involved in reporting to their official stations. Special care shall be 
taken to inform appointees of the limitations on available benefits.
    (d) Procedural requirements--(1) Agreement. No payment for otherwise 
allowable expenses or for an advance of funds shall be made unless the 
appointee or student trainee has signed the agreement appropriate in 
his/her case as provided in Sec. 302-1.5.
    (2) Travel before appointment. Authorized expenses may be paid even 
though the individual concerned has not been appointed at the time 
travel to the first official station is performed. For individuals who 
have performed Presidential transition activities, as described in 
Sec. 302-1.3(a)(2), allowable travel and transportation may take place 
at any time following the most recent Presidential election. However, 
entitlement to such expenses does not vest by virtue of selection for 
the position or authorization for travel as provided in Sec. 302-1.3(c) 
but vests only upon actual appointment of the individual concerned. 
However, nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit the 
provisions of part 301-1, subpart C, allowing the payment of pre-
employment interview travel.
    (3) Prior payment. A student trainee may not receive payments at the 
time of his/her assignment if the expenses of travel and transportation 
were paid at the time he/she was appointed as a student trainee.
    (e) Allowable expenses. Items of expense listed in paragraphs (e) 
(1) through (6) of this section are payable under the conditions 
prescribed in this chapter governing the allowance in question. Note 
particularly that not all of the listed items will be applicable in each 
situation covered by this part.
    (1) Travel expenses including per diem for the appointee or student 
trainee as set forth in Sec. 302-2.1;
    (2) Transportation for immediate family of appointee or student 
trainee as set forth in Sec. 302-2.2(a);
    (3) Mileage if privately owned vehicle is used in travel as set 
forth in Sec. 302-2.3;
    (4) Transportation and temporary storage of household goods as set 
forth in part 302-8;
    (5) Nontemporary storage of household goods if appointed to an 
isolated location as set forth in Sec. 302-9.1; and
    (6) Transportation of mobile homes as set forth in part 302-7.
    (f) Expenses not allowable. Items of expense not listed in paragraph 
(e) of this section which are authorized for reimbursement in case of 
transfers under this chapter (e.g., per diem for family, cost of house-
hunting trip, subsistence while occupying temporary quarters, a 
miscellaneous expense allowance, residence sale and purchase expenses, 
lease-breaking expenses, and relocation services) are not allowable to 
appointees and student trainees eligible under this section.
    (g) Alternate origin and destination. The limit on travel and 
transportation expenses in each individual case is the cost of direct 
travel or transportation as allowable between the individual's place of 
residence at the time of selection or assignment (or in the case of 
individuals having performed Presidential transition activities, as 
described in Sec. 302-1.3(a)(2), the place of residence at the time of 
relocation following the most recent Presidential election) and the 
official station to which he/she is appointed or assigned; however, 
travel and transportation may be from and/or to other locations if the 
new appointee or student trainee pays any excess cost involved in such 
alternate travel or transportation.
    (h) Advance of funds. An advance of funds for expenses allowable 
under this section may be made to appointees and student trainees under 
the procedures prescribed in Sec. 302-1.14(a) and the part

[[Page 104]]

of this subtitle governing the allowance being considered.

Sec. 302-1.11  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.12  Overseas assignment and return.

    (a) Transferees. Employees transferred to, from, and between 
official stations outside the continental United States are eligible for 
many of the benefits provided by this chapter, and employees transferred 
to such stations are eligible for return transportation under the 
conditions and limitations contained in paragraphs (c) through (g) of 
this section. Specific eligibility provisions and applicable limitations 
are contained in the parts of this chapter relating to the benefits 
provided.
    (b) New appointees--(1) Residence at time of appointment. A new 
appointee to a position outside the continental United States is 
eligible for certain travel and transportation benefits under this 
chapter if his/her residence at the time of appointment is in an area 
other than the area in which his/her official station is located. Under 
this rule ``area'' means a foreign country, the continental United 
States, Alaska, Hawaii, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or a United States 
territory or possession.
    (2) Allowable expenses. Allowances and the parts of this chapter 
which apply are as follows:
    (i) Travel and per diem for appointees as set forth in Sec. 302-2.1;
    (ii) Travel for the appointee's immediate family, but not per diem, 
as set forth in Sec. 302-2.2;
    (iii) Mileage to the extent travel is performed by privately owned 
automobile as set forth in Sec. 302-2.3;
    (iv) Transportation and temporary storage of household goods as set 
forth in part 302-8;
    (v) Nontemporary storage of household goods as set forth in 
Sec. 302-9.2;
    (vi) Transportation of mobile homes in limited circumstances as set 
forth in part 302-7; and
    (vii) Transportation of an employee's personal automobile as set 
forth in part 302-10.
    (3) Expenses not allowable. Items of expense not listed in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section which are authorized for reimbursement under this 
chapter in the case of transfers (e.g., per diem for family, cost of 
house-hunting trip, subsistence while occupying temporary quarters, 
miscellaneous expense allowance, residence sale and purchase expenses, 
and lease-breaking expenses) may not be authorized for appointees 
eligible under this section.
    (4) Alternate origin or destination. Travel and transportation 
benefits authorized are from the employee's residence at time of 
appointment to his/her official station. If alternate origins or 
destinations are involved, the cost which will be paid by the Government 
may not exceed the cost that would have been incurred for the travel or 
transportation in question between the residence and the official 
station.
    (5) Advance of funds. An advance of funds for expenses allowable 
under paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be made to appointees under 
the procedures prescribed in Sec. 302-1.14(a) and the part of this 
chapter governing the allowance being considered.
    (c) Actual place of residence designation--(1) Designation by 
employee. When an employee is selected for transfer or appointment to a 
post of duty outside the continental United States, the place of actual 
residence shall be determined at the time of selection and designated in 
the written agreement prescribed in Sec. 302-1.5(b) to remain in the 
Government service for a minimum period of time prescribed by the agency 
head pursuant to law. An employee hired locally at a location outside 
the continental United States who claims residence at another location 
in the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or a United States 
territory or possession at time of appointment, shall designate in 
writing the claimed place of actual residence for the consideration of 
agency officials.
    (2) Determination by agency official. Determination of the place of 
actual

[[Page 105]]

residence shall be made by an authorized agency official on the basis of 
all the facts in the record. When there is doubt as to the place of 
actual residence, the employee is responsible for supplying any further 
information necessary to support designation of the claimed place of 
actual residence.
    (3) Guidance in determination of residence. While it is not feasible 
to establish rigid standards for what constitutes a place of residence, 
the concept of residence represented in an existing statutory provision 
(8 U.S.C. 1101(33)) may be used as general guidance. This concept views 
residence as the place of general abode, meaning the principal, actual 
dwelling place in fact, without regard to intent. Determination of the 
place of actual residence is primarily an administrative responsibility 
and the place constituting the actual residence must be determined upon 
the factual circumstances in each case. Examples of factors which shall 
be considered, whenever applicable, by agency officials charged with 
this responsibility are:
    (i) The place of actual residence of a dependent student generally 
is presumed to be the same as that of the parents and, except in rare 
instances, this situation would not be changed by the student attending 
college in another place.
    (ii) The place at which the employee physically resided at time of 
selection for appointment or transfer frequently constitutes the place 
of actual residence and shall be so regarded in the absence of 
circumstances reasonably indicating that another location may be 
designated as the place of actual residence.
    (iii) Designation of a place of actual residence in an official 
document signed by the employee earlier in Government employment shall 
be regarded as originally intended to be a continuing designation, and 
the burden is upon the employee to establish clearly that the earlier 
designation was in error or that later circumstances entitle a different 
designation to be made. After an employee has been transferred or 
appointed to a post of duty outside the continental United States, the 
location of the place of actual residence incorporated in the official 
records of such employment shall be changed only to correct an error in 
the designation of residence.
    (iv) Presence in the individual's work history of a representative 
amount of full-time employment at or in the immediate geographic area of 
the location designated as place of actual residence is a significant 
factor, but lack of such history does not preclude the designation of 
the location as place of actual residence.
    (v) The chronological record of individual or family association 
with a locality is usually significant only in connection with an 
analysis of other circumstances explaining the nature of such 
association. Frequent or extended visits to a locality must be evaluated 
in relation to the purpose of the visits and sometimes in relation to 
the nature of the area itself. For example, vacation visits to a resort 
area, without the added support of other factors, should not be regarded 
as adequate to establish a place of actual residence.
    (vi) Recognition and exercise by the employee of the privileges and 
duties of citizenship in a particular jurisdiction, such as voting and 
payment of taxes on income and personal property are factors for 
consideration, but agency application of standards about place of 
residence should not be such as to discourage employees from property 
ownership or participation in community affairs at a nonforeign location 
outside the continental United States.
    (d) Return for separation. When an employee is eligible for return 
travel and transportation to his/her place of actual residence upon 
separation after completion of the period of service specified in an 
agreement executed under Sec. 302-1.5(b) or is separated for reasons 
beyond his/her control and acceptable to the agency concerned, he/she 
may receive travel and transportation to an alternate location, provided 
the cost to the Government shall not exceed the cost of travel and 
transportation to his/her residence at the time he/she was assigned to 
an overseas station. However, under decisions of the Comptroller 
General, ordinarily, an employee is entitled to travel and

[[Page 106]]

transportation expenses upon separation only to the country of actual 
residence at the time of assignment to such duty.
    (e) Prior return of immediate family--(1) When employee is eligible 
for return transportation. When an employee has become eligible for 
return transportation by satisfactorily completing an agreed period of 
service at a post of duty outside the continental United States, the 
Government shall pay one-way transportation expenses for returning the 
employee's immediate family and household goods before the employee's 
return to his/her place of actual residence in the 50 States, the 
District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or a United States 
territory or possession.
    (2) Return for compassionate reasons. One-way transportation 
expenses for the return of the employee's immediate family and his/her 
household goods also may be paid without regard to the employee's 
completion of an agreed period of service provided it has been 
determined under regulations prescribed by the head of the agency 
concerned that the public interest requires the return of the immediate 
family for compelling personal reasons of a humanitarian or 
compassionate nature, which may involve physical or mental health, death 
of a member of the immediate family, or obligations imposed by authority 
or circumstances over which the individual has no control.
    (3) Limited to one return trip. Expenses allowed as provided in 
paragraphs (e) (1) and (2) of this section shall be paid by the 
Government not more than one time during each agreed period of service 
and are subject to chapter 301 of this title.
    (4) Part of household goods retained overseas. In connection with 
the prior return of his/her family, the employee may elect to retain a 
portion of the household goods with him/her at the post of duty and ship 
the remainder to his/her place of actual residence. In such an instance, 
the Government will pay for shipment of both parts of the household 
goods, provided the aggregate weight of both shipments does not exceed 
the applicable weight limits.
    (5) Alternate destination. If the employee's immediate family and 
household goods are returned to a location in the 50 States, the 
District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or a United States 
territory or possession other than the place of actual residence 
therein, the allowable expenses shall not exceed those allowable for 
return over a usually traveled route between the post of duty and the 
place of actual residence.
    (6) Prior return at employee's expense--reimbursement. There may be 
circumstances in which an employee elects to return his/her immediate 
family and the household goods or any part thereof at his/her own 
expense to any of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana 
Islands, or a United States territory or possession when he/she is not 
eligible for such transportation under this paragraph. In such an 
instance, and after the employee becomes eligible for transportation at 
Government expense, he/she may be reimbursed for the proper expenses 
which he/she had previously paid. He/She will be reimbursed in 
accordance with the applicable provisions of this paragraph only for 
expenses which are supported by receipts or other appropriate 
documentation furnished to the Government under regulations prescribed 
by the head of the agency concerned.
    (f) Return of former spouse and dependents. Paragraph (e) of this 
section also applies to the spouse and dependents of an employee who 
have traveled to the employee's overseas post of duty as dependents (as 
provided in Sec. 302-1.4(f)) at Government expense, even if, because of 
divorce or annulment, such individuals will have ceased to be dependents 
as of the date the employee becomes eligible for return travel. Travel 
of such former dependents is authorized by the employee's next 
entitlement to return travel but not beyond the end of the employee's 
current agreed tour of duty.
    (g) Return of family member over 21. If a member of the immediate 
family, as defined in Sec. 302-1.4(f), reaches his/her twenty-first 
birthday while the employee is assigned to duty overseas, that person 
may be returned to the

United States (or foreign location at which the actual residence is 
located) at Government expense, provided his/her last travel overseas 
was at Government expense as a member of the employee's immediate 
family. Return of that person is authorized by the employee's next 
entitlement to travel to the United States (or foreign location at which 
the actual residence is located) but not beyond the end of the 
employee's current agreed tour of duty.

Sec. 302-1.13  Overseas tour renewal agreement travel.

    Employees may be eligible to receive allowances for travel and 
transportation expenses for the purpose of returning home to take leave 
between tours of duty overseas as provided in this section. These 
provisions are applicable to employees serving tours of duty at posts of 
duty outside the United States. These provisions are also applicable to 
employees serving tours of duty in Alaska or Hawaii but only under the 
conditions specified in paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of this section.
    (a) Eligibility. Employees may be eligible to receive allowances for 
travel and transportation expenses for returning home between tours of 
duty overseas under the criteria set forth in paragraphs (a) (1) through 
(3) of this section.
    (1) Eligibility requirements for all areas outside the continental 
United States. In order to be eligible for allowances under this 
section, an employee before departure from his/her post of duty outside 
the continental United States must have:
    (i) Satisfactorily completed an agreed period of service or the 
prescribed tour of duty as provided in Sec. 302-1.5(b) for return travel 
entitlement;
    (ii) Entered into a new written agreement as provided in Sec. 302-
1.5(b) for another period of service at the same or another post of duty 
outside the continental United States. The agreement shall cover costs 
incident to the travel to the employee's place of actual residence or 
alternate location and return and any additional cost paid by the 
Government as a result of a transfer of the employee to another official 
station overseas at the time of the tour renewal agreement travel; but 
as provided in Sec. 302-1.5(b), the agreement will be for 12 months with 
respect to the transfer costs; and
    (iii) Qualified for eligibility status under the provisions of 
paragraphs (a) (2) and/or (3) of this section, if the post of duty 
involved is located in Alaska or Hawaii.
    (2) Employees stationed in Alaska or Hawaii on September 8, 1982. An 
employee whose status on September 8, 1982, was any one of the 
situations listed in paragraph (a)(2) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this 
section involving a post of duty in Alaska or in Hawaii will continue to 
be eligible to receive allowances for travel and transportation expenses 
for tour renewal agreement travel provided the employee continues to 
serve consecutive tours of duty at posts of duty within Alaska or at 
posts of duty within Hawaii. Transfers between a post of duty in Alaska 
and a post of duty in Hawaii will not constitute consecutive tours of 
duty for purposes of continuing eligibility under this section. On 
September 8, 1982, the employee must have been:
    (i) Serving a current tour of duty in Alaska or Hawaii;
    (ii) En route to a post of duty in Alaska or Hawaii under a written 
agreement to serve a tour of duty; or
    (iii) Engaged in tour renewal agreement travel and have entered into 
a new written agreement to serve another tour of duty in Alaska or in 
Hawaii.
    (3) Employees assigned, appointed, or transferred to a post of duty 
in Alaska or Hawaii after September 8, 1982. (i) Except for situations 
described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the travel and 
transportation expenses allowable for tour renewal agreement travel 
under this section may not otherwise be authorized for employees 
assigned, appointed, or transferred to a post of duty in Alaska or 
Hawaii after September 8, 1982, unless it is determined under 
regulations prescribed by the agency head that payment of these expenses 
is necessary for the purpose of

[[Page 108]]

recruiting or retaining an employee for service of a tour of duty at a 
post of duty in Alaska or Hawaii. This authority must be used sparingly 
and only when required to fulfill agency staffing needs to accomplish 
the agency's mission. These provisions are intended to ensure the 
availability of well qualified employees or those employees with special 
skills and knowledge who are not available in the local area, and to 
fill positions in remote areas. Agency regulations shall prescribe 
criteria and guidelines to determine the need for payment of tour 
renewal agreement travel expenses. The agency determination that it is 
necessary to pay the expenses of tour renewal agreement travel as a 
recruiting or retention incentive in order to fill a particular position 
in Alaska or Hawaii shall be reviewed periodically but not less than 
every 5 years.
    (ii) The payment of travel and transportation expenses for tour 
renewal agreement travel for recruiting or retention purposes is limited 
to two round trips beginning within 5 years after the date the employee 
first begins any period of consecutive tours of duty in Alaska or 
Hawaii. Employees shall be advised in writing of this limitation.
    (4) Effect on other allowances. Paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of this 
section do not affect the provisions of Sec. 302-1.12 governing overseas 
assignments and return for employees transferred or new appointees to 
posts of duty in Alaska and Hawaii.
    (b) Allowable travel and transportation--(1) Destination. An 
eligible employee and his/her immediate family shall be allowed expenses 
for travel from the post of duty outside the continental United States 
to his/her place of actual residence at the time of assignment to a post 
of duty outside the continental United States (also referred to as 
``actual residence'' in this section). Those expenses shall also be 
allowed from the place of actual residence upon return to the same or 
another post of duty outside the continental United States; except with 
respect to Alaska and Hawaii, the return must be to a post of duty 
located within the same State (Alaska or Hawaii) as the post of duty at 
which the employee served immediately before tour renewal agreement 
travel (see paragraph (a)(2) of this section).
    (2) Allowances. These allowances are payable under chapter 301 of 
this title and are limited to per diem and transportation costs for the 
employee and transportation costs, but not per diem, for his/her 
immediate family. (See Sec. 302-2.1.) If a transfer is also involved, 
family per diem may be paid as authorized by Sec. 302-2.2(b) to the 
extent such per diem is payable incident to direct travel between posts 
of duty.
    (3) Alternate destination. An employee and his/her family may travel 
to a location in the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or 
the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, a United States 
territory or possession, or another country in which the place of actual 
residence is located other than the location of the place of actual 
residence; however, an employee whose actual residence is in the United 
States must spend a substantial amount of time in the United States, the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana 
Islands, or a United States territory or possession incident to travel 
under this section to be entitled to the allowance authorized. The 
amount allowed for travel and transportation expenses when travel is to 
an alternate location shall not exceed the amount which would have been 
allowed for travel over a usually traveled route from the post of duty 
to the place of actual residence and for return to the same or a 
different post of duty outside the continental United States as the case 
may be.
    (c) Limitations--(1) Husband and wife both employed. If husband and 
wife are both employed in the immediate geographic area by the same or 
different agencies as employees under the terms of this chapter, the 
allowances authorized in this section shall apply to each of them 
separately, in which instance neither of them is eligible for any 
allowances as the spouse, or to either of them, in which instance one is 
considered the head of the household and the other is eligible for 
allowances as the spouse. In applying these alternatives, other members 
of the immediate family shall not receive duplicate allowances because 
of the fact that both

[[Page 109]]

husband and wife are employees. A determination as to which of the two 
alternatives is selected shall be made in writing and shall be signed by 
both husband and wife. A copy of this determination shall be filed with 
the agency in which each is employed.
    (2) Local hires not eligible--(i) Married persons in area with 
spouse. An employee hired locally is not eligible for allowances under 
this section if he/she is married and is in the immediate geographic 
area because his/her spouse is in the area as a member of the Foreign 
Service, a member of the uniformed services (as defined in title 37, 
U.S.C.), a private individual, or an employee of a private individual or 
a non-Federal organization.
    (ii) Minors in area with parents. An employee hired locally who is 
unmarried and under 21 years of age is not eligible for allowances under 
this section if a parent of the employee is in the immediate geographic 
area as a member of the Foreign Service, a member of the uniformed 
services (as defined in title 37, U.S.C.), a civilian employee under the 
terms of this subtitle, a private individual, or an employee of a 
private individual or a non-Federal organization.
    (iii) Denial of allowance to eligible local hires. Under regulations 
prescribed by the head of the agency concerned, the agency may in its 
discretion refuse eligibility for allowances under this subpart to an 
employee who was hired locally and who did not sign a written agreement 
as provided under Sec. 302-1.5(b), provided the agency notifies the 
employee of its intention before the employee has completed a period of 
service equal to the period generally applicable to employees of the 
agency serving at the post of duty concerned or in the same geographic 
area.
    (d) Liability of employee--noncompliance with new agreement. An 
employee who, for reasons not beyond his/her control and not acceptable 
to the agency concerned, fails to complete the period of service 
specified in a new service agreement is obligated for expenses and for 
allowances paid to him/her.
    (1) Failure to complete initial year of service. (i) If the employee 
fails to complete 1 year of service under a new agreement, he/she is 
indebted to the Government for any amounts spent by the Government for:
    (A) His/her transportation and per diem and transportation for his/
her immediate family incident to tour renewal agreement travel from the 
post of duty to his/her place of actual residence and from the place of 
actual residence to the last post of duty where he/she failed to 
complete a year of service;
    (B) Transportation for any member of the immediate family who 
traveled from the former to the last post of duty without going to the 
actual place of residence;
    (C) Transportation of his/her household goods from the former post 
of duty to the last post of duty (including amounts spent for packing, 
crating, drayage, unpacking, and temporary storage); and
    (D) Any other allowances paid under this subtitle when a transfer of 
official station is involved.
    (ii) In addition, the employee must bear the expense of 
transportation for himself/herself, and the family and household goods 
from the last post of duty to the place of actual residence, and he/she 
is indebted to the Government for any amounts spent by the Government 
for these purposes.
    (iii) The employee is entitled to an allowance if, prior to his/her 
current agreement which he/she did not complete, he/she completed an 
agreed period of service for which he/she did not receive all allowances 
to which he/she was entitled. The employee in such an instance is 
entitled to allowances for the return of himself/herself, and the family 
and household goods (including costs of packing, crating, drayage, 
unpacking, and temporary storage) from the post of duty at which the 
former period of service was completed to the actual place of residence.
    (iv) Since the employee did not avail himself/herself of the 
entitlement described in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section, the 
costs that would have been incurred for that purpose may be applied as a 
setoff against the indebtedness described in paragraphs (d)(1) (i) and 
(ii) of this section. The setoff amount shall be applied as follows:
    (A) If the amount of the setoff is less than the indebtedness, the 
difference is a debt due the United States; or

[[Page 110]]

    (B) If the setoff is larger than the indebtedness, the difference 
(excess setoff) will be applied to the costs, for which the employee is 
responsible, of moving the employee, and the family and household goods 
from the post of duty where he/she failed to complete a year of service 
to the place of actual residence. If the amount of excess setoff equals 
or exceeds the costs for which the employee is responsible, the 
Government will procure and pay for such transportation in full. If the 
amount of excess setoff is less than the costs for which the employee is 
responsible, the Government may procure and pay for the transportation 
and obtain reimbursement from the employee for the difference between 
the total costs and the amount of the excess setoff to be applied 
against the costs, or allow the employee to pay the total costs and 
reimburse him/her for the applicable amounts upon submission of an 
appropriate voucher.
    (2) Failure to complete agreed period after initial year. (i) If the 
employee completes 1 year or more of service under a new agreement, but 
does not complete the entire period of service specified in the 
agreement, he/she is not indebted to the Government for amounts spent by 
the Government for transportation and per diem for the employee and for 
transportation of his/her immediate family incident to tour renewal 
agreement travel from the post of duty at which he/she completed the 
previous tour of duty to his/her place of actual residence and from the 
place of actual residence to the post of duty at which he/she failed to 
complete the agreed upon tour of duty. Furthermore, if the post of duty 
where the employee failed to complete his/her agreement is not the same 
as the place where he/she did complete his/her previous assignment, he/
she is not indebted for the costs of transporting any members of the 
immediate family who traveled from the former to the latter post of duty 
without going to the actual place of residence, nor for the costs of 
transporting his/her household goods between these two posts of duty, 
including any related costs of packing, crating, drayage, unpacking, and 
temporary storage or for other allowances paid under this chapter 
incident to the transfer of official station.
    (ii) However, when the employee fails to complete the agreed period 
of service after the initial year, the employee must bear the costs of 
transportation for himself/herself and the immediate family and 
household goods from the post of duty at which he/she did not complete 
the agreed upon tour of duty under the new agreement to the place of 
actual residence.
    (iii) For the reasons described in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this 
section, however, the employee shall be allowed credit for an amount 
equal to the costs of transporting, from the post of duty at which the 
former period of service was completed to the place of actual residence, 
the household goods and any members of the immediate family who did not 
accompany him/her when he/she returned to the place of actual residence 
incident to renewal agreement travel toward the costs (see paragraph 
(d)(2)(ii) of this section) of return to the place of actual residence.
    (iv) The credit amount allowable and the costs involved shall be 
computed in the same manner as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this 
section.

Sec. 302-1.14  Use of funds.

    (a) Advance of funds--(1) Basis. An employee may be advanced funds 
for use while traveling and for certain expenses which he/she may incur 
incident to a transfer based on his/her prospective entitlement to 
reimbursement for those expenses after they are incurred.
    (2) Rules. Advances and collection of advances by deduction from the 
employee's voucher are subject to chapter 301 of this title.
    (3) Anticipated entitlements which may justify an advance. The 
expected entitlement of an employee to reimbursement for the following 
expenses will form the basis for payment of a travel advance. Specific 
authority with regard to each type of expense is contained in the 
sections governing the particular allowances.
    (i) Per diem, mileage, and common carrier costs incident to his/her 
change

owned vehicle as set forth in Sec. 302-10.11 of this chapter.
    (b) Funding of transfers between agencies. In the case of transfer 
from one agency to another, allowable expenses shall be paid from the 
funds of the agency to which the employee is transferred. However, in 
transfers between agencies for reasons of reduction-in-force or transfer 
of functions, expenses allowable under this chapter may be paid in whole 
or in part by the agency from which the employee is transferred or by 
the agency to which he/she is transferred as may be agreed upon by the 
heads of the agencies concerned except as excluded in paragraphs (b) (1) 
and (2) of this section.
    (1) Nontemporary storage when assigned to an isolated permanent duty 
station within the continental United States; and
    (2) Transfers to, from, or between foreign countries (except the 
areas and installations in the Republic of Panama made available to the 
United States under the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977 and related 
agreements (as described in section 3(a) of the Panama Canal Act of 
1979)).

Sec. 302-1.105  Origin and destination.

    (a) The expenses listed in Sec. 302-1.103 may be paid from the 
official station where separation of the eligible individual occurs to 
the place where the individual has elected to reside within the United 
States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or the Commonwealth of the 
Northern Mariana islands, a United States territory or possession, or 
the former Canal Zone area (i.e., areas and installations in the 
Republic of Panama made available to the United states under the Panama 
Canal Treaty of 1977 and related agreements (as described in section 
3(a) of the Panama Canal Act of 1979)); or if the individual dies before 
separating or after separating but before the travel and transportation 
are completed, expenses may be paid from the deceased individual's 
official station at the time of death or where separation occurred, as 
appropriate, to the place within the areas listed in this paragraph 
where the immediate family elects to reside even if different from the 
place elected by the separated eligible individual.
    (b) Travel and transportation expenses may be paid from an alternate 
origin or more than one origin provided the cost does not exceed the 
cost that the Government would have paid if all travel and 
transportation had originated at the official station from which the 
individual was separated to the place where the individual, or the 
immediate family, will reside.
    (c) This subpart comtemplates a move to a different georgraphical 
area. In the event the place where the individual has elected to reside 
is within the same general local or metropolitan area in which the 
official station or residence was located at the time of the 
individual's separation, the expenses authorized by this subpart may not 
be paid unless the mileage criteria

specified in Sec. 302-1.7 for a short distance transfer are met.

<R05>
Sec. 302-1.106  Time limits for beginning travel and transportation.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, all travel, 
including that for the separated covered individual, and transportation, 
including that for household goods, allowed under this subpart, shall be 
accomplished within 6 months of the date of separation (or date of death 
if the individual died before separating), or other reasonable period of 
time as determined by the agency concerned, but in no case later than 2 
years from the effective date of the individual's separation from 
Government service (or date of death if the individual died before 
separating).
    (b) For the immediate family of a covered individual who died in 
Government service between January 1, 1994 and May 13, 1997, all travel 
and transportation, including that for household goods, allowed under 
this subpart, shall be accomplished no later than May 13, 1999.

<R05>
Sec. 302-1.107  Use of funds.

    Travel advances will not be issued to cover any of the expenses 
authorized by this subpart. Transportation expenses should be paid 
through the use of U.S. Government Transportation Requests and U.S. 
Government Bills of Lading to the maximum extent possible to minimize 
travel and transportation costs and the need for individuals to use 
personal funds. However, individuals who have been authorized or 
approved to make their own moving arrangements may be reimbursed for 
their actual transportation expenses not to exceed applicable coach air 
fares for transportation of the individual and immediate family, or the 
applicable allowances under the commuted rate schedule for moving and 
storage of the household goods.

    Source: FTR Amdt. 64, 62 FR 13771, Mar. 21, 1997, unless otherwise 
noted.

    Note to subpart C: Use of the pronouns ``I'' and ``you'' throughout 
this subpart refers to the employee.


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.200  What is a ``temporary change of station (TCS)''?

    TCS means the relocation of an employee to a new official station 
for a temporary period while the employee is performing a long-term 
assignment, and subsequent return of the employee to the previous 
official station upon completion of that assignment.


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.201  What is the purpose of a TCS?

    TCS provides agencies an alternative to a long-term temporary duty 
travel assignment to increase employee satisfaction and enhance morale, 
reduce the employee's income tax liability, and save the Government 
money.


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.202  Am I eligible for a TCS?

    Yes, if you are an employee who is directed to perform a long-term 
assignment at a temporary location, and you otherwise would be eligible 
for payment of temporary duty travel allowances authorized under chapter 
301 of this subtitle. For exceptions, see Sec. 302-1.203.


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.203  Who is not eligible for a TCS?

    The following individuals are not eligible for a TCS:
    (a) A new appointee;
    (b) An employee assigned to or from a State or local Government 
under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act (5 U.S.C. 3372, et. seq.);
    (c) An individual employed intermittently in the Government service 
as a consultant or expert and paid on a daily when-actually-employed 
(WAE) basis;
    (d) An individual serving without pay or at $1 a year; or
    (e) An employee assigned under the Government Employees Training Act 
(5 U.S.C. 4109).

[[Page 115]]


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.204  Must my agency authorize a TCS when I am directed to perform a long-term assignment at a temporary official station?

    No. Your agency determines the conditions under which a TCS is 
necessary to accomplish the purposes of the Government effectively and 
economically.


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.205  Under what circumstances will my agency authorize a TCS?

    Your agency will authorize a TCS when:
    (a) You are directed to perform a long-term assignment at another 
duty station;
    (b) Your agency otherwise could authorize temporary duty travel and 
pay travel allowances, including payment of subsistence expenses, under 
chapter 301 of this subtitle for the long-term assignment;
    (c) Your agency determines it would be more advantageous, cost and 
other factors considered, to authorize a TCS; and
    (d) You meet any additional conditions your agency has established.


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.206  If my agency authorizes a TCS, do I have the option of electing payment of temporary duty travel allowances instead?

    No.


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.207  How long must my assignment be for me to qualify for a TCS?

    Not less than 6 months, nor more than 30 months.


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.208  What is the effect on my TCS reimbursement if my assignment lasts less than 6 months?

    Your agency may authorize a TCS only when a long-term assignment is 
expected to last 6 months or more. If your assignment is cut short for 
reasons other than separation from Government service, you will be paid 
TCS expenses.


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.209  What is the effect on my TCS reimbursement if my assignment lasts more than 30 months?

    If your assignment exceeds 30 months, your agency must permanently 
assign you to the temporary official station or return you to your 
previous official station. Your agency may not pay for nontemporary 
storage or property management services incurred after the last day of 
the thirtieth month. Your agency must pay the expenses of returning you 
and your immediate family and household goods to your previous official 
station unless you are permanently assigned to your temporary official 
station.


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.210  Is there any required minimum distance between an official station and a long-term assignment location that must be met for me to qualify for a 
          TCS?

    No. Your agency may establish the area within which it will not 
authorize a TCS.


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.211  Must I sign a service agreement to qualify for a TCS?

    No.


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.212  What is my official station during my long-term assignment?

                      Expenses Paid Upon Assignment


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.213  What expenses must my agency pay for a TCS upon my assignment?

    Your agency must pay the following:
    (a) Travel, including per diem, for you and your immediate family 
under part 302-2 of this chapter;
    (b) Transportation and temporary storage of your household goods 
under part 302-8 of this chapter;
    (c) Transportation of a mobile home instead of transportation of 
household goods under part 302-7 of this chapter;
    (d) A miscellaneous expenses allowance under part 302-3 of this

chapter for additional income taxes you incur on payments your agency 
makes under the authority of this section and Sec. 302-1.214 for your 
relocation expenses.


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.214  What expenses may my agency pay for a TCS upon my assignment?

                     Expenses Paid During Assignment


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.215  If my agency authorizes a TCS, will it pay for nontemporary storage of my household goods?

    Yes, when nontemporary storage is necessary. Nontemporary storage 
expenses include necessary packing, crating, unpacking, uncrating, 
transporting to and from place of storage, charges while in storage, and 
other necessary charges directly related to storage.


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.216  How long may my agency pay for nontemporary storage of household goods?

    For the duration of your long-term assignment.


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.217  Is there any limitation on the combined weight of household goods I may transport or nontemporarily store at Government expense?

    Yes, the maximum combined weight is 18,000 pounds net weight. If you 
transport and/or nontemporarily store household goods in excess of the 
maximum weight allowance, you will be responsible for any excess cost.


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.218  What are the income tax consequences if my agency pays for nontemporary storage of my household goods?

    You will be taxed on the amount of nontemporary storage expenses 
your agency pays. However, your agency will pay you a relocation income 
tax allowance under part 302-11 of this chapter for substantially all of 
the additional Federal, State and local income taxes you incur on the 
expenses your agency pays.


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.219  Will my agency pay for property management services when I am authorized a TCS?

    Yes. Your agency will reimburse you directly for expenses you incur 
or make payments on your behalf to a relocation services company, if you 
so choose. The term ``property management services'' refers to a program 
provided by a private company for a fee, which assists you in managing 
your residence at your previous official station as a rental property. 
Services provided by the company may include, but are not limited to, 
obtaining a tenant, negotiating a lease, inspecting the property 
regularly, managing repairs and maintenance, enforcing lease terms, 
collecting the rent, paying the mortgage and other carrying expenses 
from rental proceeds and/or funds of the employee, and accounting for 
the transactions and providing periodic reports to the employee.


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.220  What is the property for which my agency will pay for property management services?

    Only your residence at your previous official station.


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.221  How long will my agency pay for property management services?

    For the duration of your long-term assignment.


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.222  What are the income tax consequences when my agency pays for property management services?

    You will be taxed on the amount of property management expenses your 
agency pays, whether it reimburses you directly for your expenses or 
pays a relocation services company to manage your residence. However, 
your agency will pay you a relocation income tax allowance under part 
302-11 of this chapter for substantially all of the additional Federal, 
State and local income taxes you incur on the expenses your agency pays. 
You may wish to consult with a tax advisor to determine whether you will 
incur any additional

[[Page 117]]

tax liability, unrelated to your agency's payment of your property 
management expenses, as a result of maintaining your residence as a 
rental property.

  Expenses Paid Upon Completion of Assignment or Upon Separation From 
                           Government Service


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.223  What expenses will my agency pay when I complete my long-term assignment?

    Your agency will pay the following expenses in connection with your 
return to your previous official station:
    (a) Travel, including per diem, for you and your immediate family 
under part 302-2 of this chapter;
    (b) Transportation and temporary storage of your household goods 
under part 302-8 of this chapter;
    (c) Transportation of a mobile home instead of transportation of 
your household goods under part 302-7 of this chapter;
    (d) Temporary quarters subsistence expenses under part 302-5 of this 
chapter;
    (e) A miscellaneous expenses allowance under part 302-3 of this 
chapter;
    (f) Transportation of a privately owned vehicle(s) under part 302-10 
of this chapter; and
    (g) A relocation income tax allowance under part 302-11 of this 
chapter for additional income taxes you incur on payments your agency 
makes under the authority of this section for your relocation expenses.


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.224  If I separate from Government service upon completion of my long-term assignment, what relocation expenses will my agency pay upon my 
          separation?

    The same relocation expenses it would have paid had you not 
separated from Government service upon completion of your long-term 
assignment.


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.225  If I separate from Government service prior to completion of my long-term assignment, what relocation expenses will my agency pay upon my 
          separation?

    If the separation is for reasons beyond your control that are 
acceptable to your agency, your agency will pay the same relocation 
expenses it would pay under Sec. 302-1.224 if you separated from 
Government service upon completion of the long-term assignment. If this 
is not the case, the expenses your agency pays may not exceed the 
reimbursement that you would have received under chapter 301 of this 
subtitle had you been auhorized to perform temporary duty travel for the 
duration of the long-term assignment.


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.226  If I have been authorized successive temporary changes of station and reassigned from one temporary official station to another, what expenses 

          will my agency pay upon completion of my last assignment or my 
          separation from Government service?

    Your agency will pay the expenses authorized in Sec. 302-1.223 for 
your relocation from your current temporary official station to your 
last permanent official station.

           Permanent Assignment to Temporary Official Station


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.227  How is payment of my TCS expenses affected if I am permanently assigned to my temporary official station?

    Payment of TCS expenses stops once your temporary official station 
becomes your permanent official station. Your agency may not pay any TCS 
expenses incurred beginning the day your temporary official station 
becomes your permanent official station.


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.228  What relocation allowances may my agency pay when I am permanently assigned to my temporary official station?

    Your agency may pay the following:
    (a) Travel, including per diem, under part 302-2 of this chapter for 
one round trip between your temporary official station and your previous 
official station for you and members of your immediate family who 
relocated to the temporary official station with you. Your agency may 
also pay the same expenses for a one-way trip from the previous official 
station to the new permanent official station for any immediate family 
members who did not accompany you to the temporary official station.
    (b) Residence transaction expenses under part 302-6 of this chapter;

[[Page 118]]

    (c) Property management expenses under part 302-14 of this chapter;
    (d) Residence-related relocation services expenses, (e.g. expenses 
under a homesale program, expenses for homefinding assistance, and 
property management services) under part 302-12 of this chapter;
    (e) Temporary quarters subsistence expenses under part 302-5 of this 
chapter;
    (f) Transportation of household goods not previously transported to 
the temporary official station under part 302-8 of this chapter; and
    (g) Transportation of a privately owned vehicle(s) not previously 
transported to the temporary official station under part 302-10 of this 
chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.229  If I am permanently assigned to my temporary official station, is there any limitation on the weight of household goods I may transport at 
          Government expense to my official station?

    Yes. You are limited to 18,000 pounds net weight. This maximum 
weight will be reduced by the weight of any household goods transported 
at Government expense to your temporary official station under your TCS 
authorization. Subject to the 18,000 pound limit, your agency will pay 
to transport any household goods in nontemporary storage to your 
official station. Additionally, if you change your residence as a result 
of your permanent assignment to your temporary official station, your 
agency may pay for transporting your household goods, subject to the 
18,000 pound limit, between the residence you occupied during your 
temporary assignment and your new residence.


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.230  Are there any relocation allowances my agency may not pay if I am permanently assigned to my temporary official station?

    Your agency may not pay for the following:
    (a) Expenses of a househunting trip for you and your spouse to your 
temporary official station under part 302-4 of this chapter; or
    (b) Residence transaction expenses for selling a residence or 
breaking a lease at the temporary official station under part 302-6 of 
this chapter.

   Subpart D--Agency Responsibilities for Temporary Change of Station

    Source: FTR Amdt. 64, 62 FR 13774, Mar. 21, 1997, unless otherwise 
noted.

    Note to subpart D: Use of the pronouns ``we'' and ``you'' throughout 
this subpart refers to the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.300  How should we administer our TCS program?

    To minimize your travel and relocation costs.


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.301  What governing policies must we establish for our TCS program?

    Policies and procedures that govern:
    (a) When you will authorize a TCS, including whether you will impose 
a minimum distance between the employee s current official station and 
the proposed temporary official station for an employee to qualify for a 
TCS; and
    (b) Who will determine whether authorization of a TCS is appropriate 
in each situation.


<R05>
Sec. 302-1.302  What factors should we consider in determining whether to authorize a TCS for a long-term assignment?

    You should consider the following factors in determining whether to 
authorize a TCS:
    (a) Cost considerations. You should consider the cost of each 
alternative. A long-term temporary duty travel assignment requires the 
payment of either per diem or actual subsistence expenses for the entire 
period of the assignment. This could be very costly to the agency over 
an extended period. A TCS will require fairly substantial relocation 
allowance payments at the beginning and end of the assignment, and less 
substantial payments for nontemporary storage and property management 
services, when authorized, during the period of the assignment. Agencies 
should estimate the total cost of each alternative and authorize the one 
that is most advantageous for the agency, cost and other factors 
considered.

[[Page 119]]

    (b) Length of the long-term assignment. You should consider the 
length of the long-term assignment. The purpose of temporary duty travel 
allowances is to reimburse an employee for additional costs, including 
subsistence costs, incurred as a result of performing official business 
away from his/her official station. An employee receives a salary 
intended to cover his/her living expenses, including subsistence costs, 
at the official station. When an employee performs a long-term 
assignment and obtains extended stay living accommodations with 
facilities not unlike those the employee has at the official station, 
the assignment characteristics may be more similar to subsisting at the 
official station than at a temporary duty station. When this situation 
occurs, payment of temporary duty travel allowances in addition to 
payment of salary creates an inequitable reimbursement situation between 
an employee performing official travel and an employee officially 
stationed at the same location. In this situation, you should strongly 
consider authorizing a TCS for a long-term assignment.
    (c) Tax considerations. An employee who performs a temporary duty 
travel assignment exceeding one year at a single location is subject to 
income taxation of his/her travel expense reimbursements. An employee 
who is authorized and performs a TCS also will be subject to income 
taxation of some, but not all, of his/her TCS expenses. You will pay an 
offsetting relocation income tax allowance on an employee's TCS expense 
reimbursements but unless specifically authorized by statute, you do not 
have authority to pay such an allowance for income taxes incurred on 
temporary duty travel reimbursements. You, therefore, should authorize a 
TCS if a long-term temporary duty assignment will result in an 
unreimbursable income tax liability on an employee.
    (d) Employee concerns. The long-term assignment of an employee away 
from his/her official station and immediate family may negatively affect 
the employee's morale and job performance. Such negative effects may be 
alleviated by authorizing a TCS so the employee can transport his/her 
immediate family and/or household goods at Government expense to the 
location where he/she will perform the long-term assignment. You should 
consider the effects of a long-term temporary duty travel assignment on 
an employee when deciding whether to authorize a TCS.

Sec. 302-2.1  For the employee.

    (a) Applicability. This part applies to travel of
    (1) Transferred employees,
    (2) New appointees, and
    (3) Employees assigned to posts of duty outside the continental 
United States in connection with either overseas tour renewal agreement 
travel or return travel to places of residence for the purpose of 
separation.
    (b) Payment for employee's travel expenses. Except as specifically 
provided in this chapter, an agency shall pay per diem, transportation 
costs, and other travel expenses of the employee in accordance with the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5701-5709 and chapter 301 of this title. The 
prohibition in Sec. 301-7.5(b) of this title on paying per diem for 
travel of 12 hours or less applies to change of official station travel.
    (c) Maximum per diem rates for relocation travel--(1) Travel when en 
route between employee's old and new official stations. The maximum per 
diem rate for en route travel within CONUS between the employee's old 
and new official stations shall be the standard CONUS rate prescribed 
under Sec. 301-7.3 of this title.

locality where the employee obtains lodging accommodations. An agency 
may prescribe the standard CONUS rate as the maximum per diem rate if it 
determines that establishment of such lower rate is advantageous to the 
Government.

<R05>
Sec. 302-2.2  For members of an employee's immediate family.

    (a) Transportation. Except as specifically provided in this chapter, 
allowable travel expenses for the employee's immediate family, including 
transportation, are governed by chapter 301 of this title. Travel of the 
immediate family may begin at the employee's old official station or 
some other point, or partially at both, and may end at the new official 
station or some other place selected by the employee, or partially at 
both. However, the cost to the Government for transportation of the 
immediate family shall not exceed the allowable cost by the usually 
traveled route between the employee's old and new official stations.
    (b) Per diem allowance when en route between employee's old and new 
official stations. When an employee is transferred, an allowance shall 
be paid for per diem expenses incurred by the employee's immediate 
family while traveling between the old and new official stations 
regardless of where the old and new stations are located. If the actual 
travel involves departure and/or destination points other than the old 
or new official station, the per diem allowance shall not exceed the 
amount to which members of the immediate family would have been entitled 
if they had traveled by a usually traveled route between the old and new 
official stations. The prohibition in Sec. 301-7.5(b) of this title on 
paying per diem for travel of 12 hours or less applies to change of 
official station travel. The maximum allowable per diem rates are as 
follows:
    (1) For the spouse--(i) When accompanying the employee. When the 
spouse accompanies the employee who is traveling under Sec. 302-2.1, the 
spouse is authorized three-fourths of the per diem rate to which the 
employee is entitled. However, under this provision the minimum per diem 
rate shall be $6 unless the employee receives a per diem rate of less 
than $6 and, in that instance, the spouse will receive the same rate as 
the employee.
    (ii) When not accompanying the employee. When the spouse is not 
accompanying the employee while he/she is traveling under Sec. 302-2.1, 
the spouse is authorized the per diem rate to which the employee is 
entitled under Sec. 302-2.1. In such instance the travel time of the 
employee and the amount of per diem allowance paid him/her are not 
factors in computing the amount of per diem allowance for travel of the 
spouse. (When more than one privately owned automobile is used, the 
spouse shall be considered to have been accompanied by the employee if 
travel is performed on the same days along the same general route.)
    (2) For each other member of the employee's immediate family. Three-
fourths of the per diem rate to which the employee is entitled is 
authorized for each other member age 12 or older, and one-half of the 
per diem rate to which the employee is entitled is authorized for each 
child under 12 years of age. However, under this provision the minimum 
per diem rate shall be $6 unless the employee received a per diem rate

Sec. 302-2.3  For use of a privately owned automobile in connection with permanent change of station.

    (a) Determination of advantage to the Government. When an employee, 
with or without an immediate family, who is eligible for travel 
allowances under part 302-1, uses a privately owned automobile for 
permanent change of station travel, that use is deemed to be 
advantageous to the Government. The provisions in Sec. 302-2.3 also 
apply to new appointees, and employees returning from posts of duty 
outside the continental United States to places of actual residence for 
separation. The provisions do not apply to employees assigned to posts 
of duty outside the continental United States in connection with 
overseas tour renewal agreement travel. (See Sec. 302-1.13.)
    (b) Mileage rates prescribed. Payment of mileage allowances, when 
authorized or approved in connection with the transfer, shall be allowed 
as follows:

 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                 Mileage
                    Occupants of automobile                       rate
                                                                 (cents)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Employee only; or one member of immediate family..............     15
Employee and one member; or two members of immediate family...     17
Employee and two members; or three members of immediate family     19
Employee and three or more members; or four or more members of
 immediate family.............................................     20
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Mileage rates in special circumstances. Heads of agencies may 
prescribe that travel orders or other administrative determinations 
specify higher mileage rates at a rate not more than the maximum rate 
prescribed in Sec. 301-4.2(a)(1) of this title for individual transfers 
of employees or transfers of groups of employees when:
    (1) Employees are expected to use the privately owned automobiles on 
official business while assigned to the new duty stations;
    (2) The common carrier rates for the facilities provided between the 
old and new stations, the related constructive taxicab fares to and from 
terminals, and the per diem allowances prescribed under this part 
justify a higher mileage rate as advantageous to the Government; or
    (3) The costs of driving the privately owned automobile to, from, or 
between official stations located outside the continental United States 
justify a higher mileage rate as advantageous to the Government.
    (d) Maximum per diem allowances when privately owned automobile is 
used--(1) Rates as prescribed by agency. The per diem allowance for the 
employee while en route between the old and new duty stations shall be 
at appropriate rates, as prescribed by the agency concerned, within the 
applicable maximums and in accordance with provisions of Sec. 302-2.1 
and chapter 301 of this title. The per diem allowances prescribed in 
Sec. 302-2.2(b) apply for members of an employee's immediate family, 
except as excluded in Sec. 302-2.2(c).
    (2) Maximum allowance based on total distance. Per diem allowances 
should be paid on the basis of actual time used to complete the trip, 
but the allowances may not exceed an amount computed on the basis of a 
minimum driving distance per day which is prescribed as reasonable by 
the authorizing official and is not less than an average of 300 miles 
per calendar day. An exception to the daily minimum driving distance may 
be made by the agency concerned when travel between the old and new 
official stations is delayed for reasons clearly beyond the control of 
the travelers such as acts of God, restrictions by Governmental 
authorities, or other reasons acceptable to the agency; e.g., a 
physically handicapped employee. In such cases, per diem may be allowed 
for the period of the delay or for a shorter period as determined by the 
agency. The traveler must provide a statement on his/her reimbursement 
voucher fully explaining the circumstances which necessitated the en 
route travel delay. The exception to the daily minimum driving distance 
requires the approval of the agency's authorizing official.
    (3) Method of computation. In computing the per diem amount for a 
prescribed minimum driving distance per day, one-fourth of the 
prescribed per diem rate shall be allowed for each one-fourth of the 
prescribed minimum distance. For example, if the authorizing official 
prescribes a per diem rate of $12 for the employee and a reasonable 
minimum driving distance of 400 miles a day, the per diem amount will

[[Page 122]]

be $3 for each 100 miles or fraction of 100 miles traveled between the 
old and new official stations.
    (e) Use of more than one privately owned vehicle--(1) When 
authorized as advantageous to the Government. Use of no more than one 
privately owned automobile is authorized under this part as being 
advantageous to the Government in connection with permanent change of 
station travel except under the following special circumstances, when 
use of more than one privately owned automobile may be authorized:
    (i) If there are more members of the immediate family than 
reasonably can be transported with luggage in one vehicle;
    (ii) If because of age or physical condition special accommodations 
are necessary in transporting a member of the immediate family in one 
vehicle, and a second automobile is required for travel of other members 
of the immediate family;
    (iii) If an employee must report to a new official station in 
advance of travel by members of the immediate family who delay travel 
for acceptable reasons such as completion of school term, sale of 
property, settlement of personal business affairs, disposal or shipment 
of household goods, and temporary unavailability of adequate housing at 
the new official station;
    (iv) If a member of the immediate family performs unaccompanied 
travel between authorized points other than those for the employee's 
travel; or
    (v) If, in advance of the employee's reporting date, immediate 
family members must travel to the new official station for acceptable 
reasons such as to enroll children in school at the beginning of the 
term.
    (2) Allowances applicable. In those instances where more than one 
automobile is authorized under this paragraph, the allowances under 
paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section apply for each automobile 
and the occupants thereof.
    (3) Allowances when not justified as advantageous to the Government. 
If the use of more than one privately owned automobile is not justified 
under the circumstances described in this paragraph, only the allowances 
prescribed in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section shall be 
paid, as if all persons involved traveled in one automobile.

Sec. 302-2.4  Advance of funds.

    Advance of funds may be made for per diem and mileage allowances as 
provided in Secs. 302-2.1, 302-2.2(b), and 302-2.3 except in connection 
with employees assigned to posts of duty outside the continental United 
States performing authorized or approved overseas tour renewal agreement 
travel. Such advances may also be made upon return to the place of 
residence for the purpose of separation under the policies and 
procedures prescribed in Sec. 302-1.14(a).

<R04>
     Subpart A--Employee's Allowance for Househunting Trip Expenses

    Note to subpart A: Use of the pronouns ``I'' and ``you'' throughout 
this subpart refers to the employee.


<R05>
Sec. 302-4.1  What is a ``househunting trip''?

    The term ``househunting trip'' refers to a trip made by the employee 
and/or spouse to the new official station locality to find permanent 
living quarters to rent or purchase. The term ``living quarters'' in 
this part includes apartments, condominiums, and cooperatives in 
addition to townhomes and single family homes.


<R05>
Sec. 302-4.2  What is the purpose of the househunting trip expenses allowance?

    The allowance for househunting trip expenses is intended to 
facilitate and expedite the employee's move from the old official 
station to the new official station and to lower the Government's 
overall cost for the employee's relocation by reducing the amount of 
time an employee must occupy temporary quarters. The allowance for 
househunting trip expenses provides the employee and/or spouse a period 
of time to concentrate on finding a suitable permanent residence at the 
new official station and thereby expedites the employee's relocation.


<R05>
Sec. 302-4.3  Am I eligible for a househunting trip expenses allowance?

    You are eligible for a househunting trip expenses allowance if you 
are an employee who is authorized to transfer, and in addition:
    (a) Both your old and new official stations are located within the 
United States;
    (b) You are not assigned to Government or other prearranged housing 
at the new official station; and
    (c) Your old and new official stations are 75 or more miles apart 
(as measured by map distance) via a usually traveled surface route.


<R05>
Sec. 302-4.4  Who is not eligible for a househunting trip expenses allowance?

    New appointees and employees assigned under the Government Employees 
Training Act (5 U.S.C. 4109) are not eligible for a househunting trip 
expenses allowance.


<R05>
Sec. 302-4.5  Must my agency authorize payment of a househunting trip expenses allowance?

    No. Your agency determines when it is in the Government's interest 
to authorize you a househunting trip and the procedures you must follow 
if it is authorized.


<R05>
Sec. 302-4.6  Under what circumstances will I receive a househunting trip expenses allowance?

    You will receive a househunting trip expenses allowance if:
    (a) Your agency authorized you to perform a househunting trip in 
advance of the travel (the agency authorization must specify the mode of 
transportation and the period of time allowed for the trip);
    (b) You have signed a service agreement;
    (c) Your agency has established, and informed you of, the date you 
are to report to your new official station; and
    (d) You meet any additional conditions your agency has established.

[[Page 126]]


<R05>
Sec. 302-4.7  Who may travel on a househunting trip at Government expense?

    Only you and/or your spouse may travel on a househunting trip at 
Government expense.


<R05>
Sec. 302-4.8  How many househunting trips may my agency authorize in connection with a particular transfer?

    Your agency may authorize only one round trip for you and/or your 
spouse in connection with a particular transfer.


<R05>
Sec. 302-4.9  May my spouse and I perform separate househunting trips at Government expense?

    Yes. However, your reimbursement will be limited to the cost that 
would have been incurred if you and your spouse had traveled together on 
one round trip.


<R05>
Sec. 302-4.10  How soon may I and/or my spouse begin a househunting trip?

    You may begin your househunting trip as soon as your agency has 
notified you of your transfer and issued a travel authorization for a 
househunting trip. To take maximum advantage of your trip, however, it 
is very important that you become familiar as quickly as you can with 
your new official station area (e.g., housing market conditions, school 
locations, etc.). If you are selling your residence at your old official 
station, you should not begin your househunting trip until you have a 
current appraisal of the value of the residence so that you can more 
accurately determine the appropriate price range of residences to 
consider during your househunting trip.


<R05>
Sec. 302-4.11  Is there a time limit on the duration of a househunting trip?

    A househunting trip should be for a reasonable period, not to exceed 
10 calendar days, as authorized by your agency under Sec. 302-4.101(d).


<R05>
Sec. 302-4.12  When must my househunting trip be completed?

    You and/or your spouse must complete your househunting trip as 
indicated in the following table:

 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                       Your househunting trip must be

                                       (b) The day before the maximum

                                       (b) If you accept your agency's
                                        offer of the fixed amount
                                        option, and:

                                         a single amount determined by
                                         multiplying the applicable
                                         locality rate (listed in
                                         appendix A to chapter 301 of
                                         this subtitle) by 6.25, or

                                         determined by multiplying the
                                         applicable locality rate
                                         (listed in appendix A to
                                         chapter 301 of this subtitle)

<R05>
Sec. 302-4.14  What transportation expenses will my agency pay?

    Your agency will authorize you to travel by the transportation 
mode(s) (e.g., airline, train, or privately owned automobile) it 
determines to be advantageous to the Government. Your agency will pay 
for your transportation expenses by the authorized mode(s). If you 
travel by any other mode(s), your agency will pay your transportation 
expenses not to exceed the cost of transportation by the authorized 
mode(s).


<R05>
Sec. 302-4.15  Must I document my househunting trip expenses to receive reimbursement?

    To receive reimbursement for househunting trip transportation 
expenses you must itemize your transportation expenses and provide 
receipts as required by Sec. 301-11.3(c) of this subtitle. For fixed 
amount househunting trip subsistence reimbursement, you do not document 
your subsistence expenses. For per diem househunting trip subsistence 
expense reimbursement, you must itemize your lodging expenses and you 
must provide receipts as required by Sec. 301-7.9(b) and Sec. 301-
11.3(c) of this subtitle.


<R05>
Sec. 302-4.16  May I receive an advance of funds for househunting trip expenses?

    Your agency may authorize an advance of funds, in accordance with 
Sec. 302-1.14(a) of this chapter, for your househunting trip expenses. 
Your agency may not advance you funds in excess of the sum of your 
anticipated transportation costs and either the maximum per diem 
allowable under part 302-2 of this chapter for the location and duration 
of your househunting trip or your fixed amount househunting trip 
subsistence expenses payment, whichever applies.


<R05>
Sec. 302-4.17  Am I in a duty status when I perform a househunting trip?

    Yes.


<R04>
                   Subpart B--Agency Responsibilities

    Note to Subpart B: Use of the pronouns ``we'' and ``you'' throughout 
this subpart refers to the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 302-4.100  How should we administer the househunting trip expenses allowance?

    You should administer the househunting trip expenses allowance to 
minimize or avoid its use when other satisfactory and more economical 
arrangements are available.


<R05>
Sec. 302-4.101  What governing policies must we establish for the househunting trip expenses allowance?

    You must establish policies and procedures governing:
    (a) When you will authorize a househunting trip for an employee;
    (b) Who will determine if a househunting trip is appropriate in each 
situation;
    (c) If and when you will authorize the fixed amount option for 
househunting trip subsistence expenses reimbursement;
    (d) Who will determine the appropriate duration of a househunting 
trip for an employee who selects a per diem allowance under part 302-2 
of this chapter to reimburse househunting trip subsistence expenses; and
    (e) Who will determine the mode(s) of transportation to be used.


<R05>
Sec. 302-4.102  Under what circumstances may we authorize a househunting trip?

    You may authorize a househunting trip on an individual-case basis 
when the employee has accepted the transfer and his/her circumstances 
indicate that a househunting trip actually is needed. You may not 
authorize a househunting trip when the purpose of the trip is to assist 
the employee in deciding whether he or she will accept the transfer.

[[Page 128]]


<R05>
Sec. 302-4.103  What factors must we consider in determining whether to offer an employee the fixed amount househunting trip subsistence expenses reimbursement 
          option?

    You must consider the following factors:
    (a) Ease of administration. Payment of a per diem allowance under 
part 302-2 of this chapter requires you to review claims for the 
validity, accuracy, and reasonableness of each expense amount, except 
for meals and incidental expenses. Fixed amount househunting trip 
subsistence expenses reimbursement is easier to administer because you 
do not have to review expense amounts.
    (b) Cost considerations. You must weigh the cost of each 
reimbursement option on a case-by-case basis.
    (c) Treatment of employees. The employee is allowed to choose 
between a per diem allowance under part 302-2 of this chapter and fixed 
amount househunting trip subsistence expenses reimbursement when you 
offer the fixed amount reimbursement method. You therefore should weigh 
employee morale and productivity considerations against actual cost 
considerations in determining which method to offer.

                        Subpart A--General Rules

    Note to subpart A: Use of the pronouns ``I'' and ``you'' throughout 
this subpart refers to the employee.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.1  What are ``temporary quarters''?

    The term ``temporary quarters'' refers to lodging obtained for the 
purpose of temporary occupancy from a private or commercial source.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.2  What are ``temporary quarters subsistence expenses (TQSE)''?

    ``Temporary quarters subsistence expenses'' or ``TQSE'' are 
subsistence expenses incurred by an employee and/or his/her immediate 
family while occupying temporary quarters. TQSE does not include local 
transportation expenses incurred during occupancy of temporary quarters 
(see Sec. 302-5.18 for details).


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.3  What is the purpose of the TQSE allowance?

    The TQSE allowance is intended to reimburse an employee reasonably 
and equitably for subsistence expenses incurred when it is necessary to 
occupy temporary quarters.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.4  Am I eligible for a TQSE allowance?

    You are eligible for a TQSE allowance if you are an employee who is 
authorized to transfer; and
    (a) Your new official station is located within the United States, 
its territories or possessions, the Commonwealths of Puerto Rico or the 
Northern Mariana Islands, or the former Canal Zone area (i.e., areas and 
installations in the Republic of Panama made available to the United 
States pursuant to the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977 and related 
agreements (as described in 22 U.S.C. 3602(a))); and
    (b) Your old and new official stations are 40 miles or more apart 
(as measured by map distance) via a usually traveled surface route.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.5  Who is not eligible for a TQSE allowance?

    New appointees, employees assigned under the Government Employees 
Training Act (5 U.S.C. 4109), and employees returning from an overseas 
assignment for the purpose of separation are not eligible for a TQSE 
allowance.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.6  Must my agency authorize payment of a TQSE allowance?

    No, your agency determines whether it is in the Government's 
interest to pay TQSE.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.7  Under what circumstances will I receive a TQSE allowance?

    You will receive a TQSE allowance if:
    (a) Your agency authorizes it before you occupy the temporary 
quarters (the agency authorization must specify the period of time 
allowed for you to occupy temporary quarters); and
    (b) You have signed a service agreement; and
    (c) You meet any additional conditions your agency has established.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.8  Who may occupy temporary quarters at Government expense?

    Only you and/or your immediate family may occupy temporary quarters 
at Government expense.

[[Page 130]]


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.9  Where may I/we occupy temporary quarters at Government expense?

    You and/or your immediate family may occupy temporary quarters at 
Government expense within reasonable proximity of your old and/or new 
official stations. Neither you nor your immediate family may be 
reimbursed for occupying temporary quarters at any other location, 
unless justified by special circumstances that are reasonably related to 
your transfer.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.10  May my immediate family and I occupy temporary quarters at different locations?

    Yes. For example, if you must vacate your home at the old official 
station and report to the new official station and your family remains 
behind until the end of the school year, you may need to occupy 
temporary quarters at the new official station while your family 
occupies temporary quarters at the old official station.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.11  What methods may my agency use to reimburse me for TQSE?

    Your agency will reimburse you for TQSE under the actual expense 
method unless it permits the ``fixed amount'' reimbursement method as an 
alternative. If your agency makes both methods available to you, you may 
select the one you prefer.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.12  Must I document my TQSE to receive reimbursement?

    For fixed amount TQSE reimbursement, you do not document your TQSE. 
For actual TQSE reimbursement, you must document your TQSE by itemizing 
each expense and providing receipts as required by FTR Sec. 301-11.3(c) 
of this subtitle.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.13  How soon may I/we begin occupying temporary quarters at Government expense?

    As soon as your agency has authorized you to receive a TQSE 
allowance and you have signed a service agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.14  How is my TQSE allowance affected if my temporary quarters become my permanent residence quarters?

    If your temporary quarters become your permanent residence quarters, 
you may receive a TQSE allowance only if you show in a manner 
satisfactory to your agency that you initially intended to occupy the 
quarters temporarily.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.15  May I receive an advance of funds for TQSE?

    Yes. If authorized in accordance with Sec. 302-1.14(a) of this 
chapter, your agency may advance the amount of funds necessary to cover 
your estimated TQSE expenses for up to 30 days. Your agency subsequently 
may advance additional funds for periods up to 30 days.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.16  May I receive a TQSE allowance if I am receiving another subsistence expenses allowance?

    No, with one exception. You may receive a cost-of-living allowance 
payable under 5 U.S.C. 5941 in addition to a TQSE allowance.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.17  Am I eligible for a TQSE allowance if I transfer to a foreign area?

    No. You may not receive a TQSE allowance under this part when you 
transfer to an area outside the United States, its territories or 
possessions, the Commonwealths of Puerto Rico or the Northern Mariana 
Islands, or the former Canal Zone area (i.e., areas and installations in 
the Republic of Panama made available to the United States pursuant to 
the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977 and related agreements (as described in 
22 U.S.C. 3602(a))). However, you may qualify for a comparable allowance 
under the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas) 
prescribed by the State Department.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.18  May I be reimbursed for local transportation expenses incurred while I am occupying temporary quarters?

    Generally not. Local transportation expenses are not TQSE, and there 
is no

[[Page 131]]

authority to pay them as such. You may, however, be reimbursed under 
part 301-2 of this subtitle for necessary transportation expenses if you 
perform local official business travel while you are occupying temporary 
quarters.


<R04>
             Subpart B--Actual TQSE Method of Reimbursement

    Note to subpart B: Use of the pronouns ``I'' and ``you'' throughout 
this subpart refers to the employee.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.100  What am I paid under the actual TQSE reimbursement method?

    Your agency will pay your actual TQSE incurred, provided the 
expenses are reasonable and do not exceed the maximum allowable amount. 
The ``maximum allowable amount'' is the ``maximum daily amount'' 
multiplied by the number of days you actually incur TQSE not to exceed 
the number of days authorized, taking into account that the rates change 
after 30 days in temporary quarters. The ``maximum daily amount'' is 
determined by adding the rates in the following table for you and each 
member of your immediate family authorized to occupy temporary quarters:

 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                       The ``maximum daily amount'' of TQSE under the actual expense method that

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(That is, when the spouse necessarily occupies temporary quarters in lieu of the employee or in a location
  separate from the employee.)


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.101  May my agency reduce my TQSE allowance below the ``maximum allowable amount''?

    Yes. If the estimated daily amount of your TQSE is determined in 
advance to be lower than the maximum daily amount, your agency may 
reduce the maximum allowable amount to your expected expenses.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.102  What is the ``applicable per diem rate'' under the actual TQSE reimbursement method?

    The ``applicable per diem rate'' under the actual TQSE reimbursement 
method is as follows:

 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                               The applicable per diem

 installations in the Republic of Panama      this subtitle.
 made available to the United States
 pursuant to the Panama Canal Treaty of
 1977 and related agreements (as described
 in section 3(a) of the Panama Canal Act of
 1979)).
------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.103  What is the latest the period for which I claim actual TQSE reimbursement may begin?

    The period must begin before the maximum time for beginning 
allowable travel and transportation under Sec. 302-1.6 of this chapter 
expires.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.104  How long may I be authorized to claim actual TQSE reimbursement?

    Your agency may authorize you to claim actual TQSE in 30-day 
increments, not to exceed 60 consecutive days. However, if your agency 
determines that there is a compelling reason

[[Page 132]]

for you to continue occupying temporary quarters after 60 consecutive 
days, it may authorize an extension of up to 60 additional consecutive 
days. Under no circumstances may you be authorized to claim actual TQSE 
reimbursement for more than a total of 120 consecutive days.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.105  What is a ``compelling reason'' warranting extension of my authorized period for claiming actual TQSE reimbursement?

    A ``compelling reason'' is an event that is beyond your control and 
is acceptable to your agency. Examples include, but are not limited to:
    (a) Delivery of your household goods to your new residence is 
delayed due to strikes, customs clearance, hazardous weather, fires, 
floods or other acts of God, or similar events.
    (b) You cannot occupy your new permanent residence because of 
unanticipated problems (e.g., delay in settlement on the new residence, 
or short-term delay in construction of the residence).
    (c) You are unable to locate a permanent residence which is adequate 
for your family's needs because of housing conditions at your new 
official station.
    (d) Sudden illness, injury, or death of employee or immediate family 
member.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.106  May I interrupt occupancy of temporary quarters?

    Yes. Your authorized period for claiming actual TQSE reimbursement 
is measured in consecutive days, and once begun, normally continues to 
run whether or not you occupy temporary quarters. You may, however, 
interrupt your authorized period for claiming actual TQSE reimbursement 
in the following instances:
    (a) For the time allowed for en route travel between the old and new 
official stations;
    (b) For circumstances attributable to official necessity such as an 
intervening temporary duty assignment or military duty; or
    (c) For a non-official necessary interruption such as 
hospitalization, approved sick leave, or other reason beyond your 
control and acceptable to your agency.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.107  What effect do partial days of temporary quarters occupancy have on my authorized period for claiming actual TQSE reimbursement?

    Occupancy of temporary quarters for less than a whole day 
constitutes one full day of your authorized period. (However, see 
Sec. 302-5.110 regarding en route travel.)


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.108  When does my authorized period for claiming actual TQSE reimbursement end?

    The period ends at midnight on the earlier of:
    (a) The day preceding the day you and/or any member of your 
immediate family occupies permanent residence quarters.
    (b) The day your authorized period for claiming actual TQSE 
reimbursement expires.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.109  May the period for which I am authorized to claim actual TQSE reimbursement for myself be different from that of my immediate family?

    No, the eligibility period for which you are authorized to claim 
actual TQSE reimbursement for yourself and for each member of your 
immediate family must run concurrently.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.110  What effect do partial days have on my actual TQSE reimbursement?

    You may not receive reimbursement under both the actual TQSE 
allowance and another subsistence expenses allowance within the same 
calendar day, with one exception: if you claim TQSE reimbursement on the 
same day that en route travel per diem ends, your en route travel per 
diem will be computed under applicable partial day rules and you also 
may be reimbursed for actual TQSE you incur after 6:00 p.m. of that day.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.111  May I and/or my immediate family occupy temporary quarters longer than the period for which I am authorized to claim actual TQSE reimbursement?

    Yes, but you will not be reimbursed for any of the expenses you 
incur during the unauthorized period.

                  Subpart C--Fixed Amount Reimbursement

    Note to subpart C: Use of the pronouns ``I'' and ``you'' throughout 
this subpart refers to the employee.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.200  What am I paid under the fixed amount reimbursement method?

    If your agency offers and you select the fixed amount TQSE 
reimbursement method, you are paid a fixed amount for up to 30 days. No 
extensions are allowed under the fixed amount method.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.201  How do I determine the amount of my payment under the fixed amount reimbursement method?

    Multiply the number of days your agency authorizes TQSE by .75 times 
the maximum per diem rate (i.e., lodging plus meals and incidental 
expenses) prescribed in chapter 301 of this subtitle for the locality of 
the new official duty station. Then, for each member of your immediate 
family, multiply the same number of days by .25 times the same per diem 
rate. Your payment will be the sum of these calculations.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.202  Will I receive additional TQSE reimbursement if my fixed amount is not adequate to cover my TQSE?

    No.


<R04>
                   Subpart D--Agency Responsibilities

    Note to subpart D: Use of the pronouns ``we'' and ``you'' throughout 
this subpart refers to the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.300  How should we administer the TQSE allowance?

    Temporary quarters should be used only if, and only for as long as, 
necessary until the employee and/or his/her immediate family can move 
into permanent residence quarters. You must administer the TQSE 
allowance to minimize or avoid other relocation expenses.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.301  What governing policies must we establish for the TQSE allowance?

    You must establish policies and procedures governing:
    (a) When you will authorize temporary quarters for employees;
    (b) Who will determine if temporary quarters is appropriate in each 
situation;
    (c) If and when you will authorize the fixed amount option for TQSE 
reimbursement;
    (d) Who will determine the appropriate period of time for which TQSE 
reimbursement will be authorized, including approval of extensions and 
interruptions of temporary quarters occupancy;
    (e) Who will determine whether quarters were indeed temporary, if 
there is any doubt.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.302  Under what circumstances may we authorize the TQSE allowance?

    You may authorize a TQSE allowance on an individual-case basis when 
use of temporary quarters is justified in connection with an employee's 
transfer to a new official station. You may not authorize a TQSE 
allowance for vacation purposes or other reasons unrelated to the 
transfer.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.303  What factors should we consider in determining whether the TQSE allowance actually is necessary?

    The factors you should consider include:
    (a) The length of time the employee should reasonably be expected to 
occupy his/her residence at the old official station prior to reporting 
for duty at the new official station. An employee and his/her immediate 
family should continue to occupy the residence at the old official 
station for as long as practicable to avoid the necessity for temporary 
quarters.
    (b) The existence of less expensive alternatives. If a less 
expensive alternative to the TQSE allowance exists that will enable the 
employee to find permanent quarters at the new official station, you 
should consider such an alternative. For example, authorize a

[[Page 134]]

househunting trip instead of temporary quarters if it would cost less 
overall.
    (c) The existence of other opportunities to arrange for permanent 
quarters. Consider whether the employee had other adequate opportunity 
to arrange for permanent quarters. For example, you should not authorize 
temporary quarters if the employee had adequate opportunity during an 
extended temporary duty assignment to arrange for permanent quarters.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.304  What factors should we consider in determining whether to offer an employee the fixed amount TQSE reimbursement option?

    The factors you should consider include:
    (a) Ease of administration. Actual TQSE reimbursement requires an 
agency to review claims for the validity, accuracy, and reasonableness 
of each expense amount. Fixed amount TQSE reimbursement does not require 
review of expense amounts and is therefore easier to administer.
    (b) Cost considerations. You must weigh the cost of each 
alternative. Actual TQSE reimbursement may extend up to 120 consecutive 
days, while fixed amount TQSE reimbursement is limited to 30 days. 
Actual TQSE reimbursement may be less expensive, since its ceiling is 
based on the standard CONUS rate, while fixed amount TQSE reimbursement 
is based on the locality per diem rate. However, fixed amount TQSE 
reimbursement may be less expensive because the maximum daily rate under 
actual TQSE reimbursement is a higher percentage of the applicable per 
diem rate than fixed amount TQSE reimbursement.
    (c) Treatment of employee. The employee is allowed to choose between 
actual TQSE reimbursement and fixed amount TQSE reimbursement when you 
offer the fixed amount TQSE reimbursement method. You therefore should 
weigh employee morale and productivity considerations against actual 
cost considerations in determining which method to offer.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.305  What factors should we consider in determining whether quarters are temporary?

    In determining whether quarters are ``temporary'', you should 
consider factors such as the duration of the lease, movement of 
household effects into the quarters, the type of quarters, the 
employee's expressions of intent, attempts to secure a permanent 
dwelling, and the length of time the employee occupies the quarters.

<R05>
Sec. 302-6.1  Conditions and requirements under which allowances are payable.

    To the extent allowable under this part, the Government shall 
reimburse an employee for expenses required to be paid by him/her in 
connection with the sale of one residence at his/her old official 
station, for purchase (including construction) of one dwelling at his/
her new official station, or for the settlement of an unexpired lease 
involving his/her residence or a lot on which a mobile home used as his/
her residence was located at the old official station provided the 
conditions set forth in this section are met:
    (a) Transfers covered--agreement required. A permanent change of 
station is authorized or approved and, except as provided in paragraph 
(g) of this section, the old and new official stations are located 
within the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, a 
United States territory or possession, or the former Canal Zone area 
(i.e., areas and installations in the Republic of Panama made available 
to the United States under the Panama

[[Page 135]]

Canal Treaty of 1977 and related agreements (as described in section 
3(a) of the Panama Canal Act of 1979)), and the employee has signed an 
agreement as required in Sec. 302-1.5. (See exclusions in Sec. 302-6.4.)
    (b) Location and type of residence. The residence or dwelling is the 
residence as described in Sec. 302-1.4(k), which may be a mobile home 
and/or the lot on which such mobile home is located or will be located. 
These criteria also apply to the former nonforeign area official station 
residence of employees who are eligible for residence transaction 
expenses under paragraph (g) of this section (see definition in 
paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section).
    (c) Title requirements. The title to the residence or dwelling at 
the old or new official station, or the interest in a cooperatively 
owned dwelling or in an unexpired lease, is in the name of the employee 
alone, or in the joint names of the employee and one or more members of 
his/her immediate family, or solely in the name of one or more members 
of his/her immediate family. The rules in paragraphs (c) (1) through (3) 
of this section apply in determining title to the residence.
    (1) Title interest must have been acquired prior to notification of 
transfer. For an employee to be eligible for reimbursement of the costs 
of selling a dwelling or terminating a lease at the old official 
station, the employee's property interest must have been acquired prior 
to the date the employee was first officially notified of his/her 
transfer to the new official station. In the case of an employee covered 
by paragraph (g) of this section, the employee's interest must have been 
acquired prior to the date the employee was first officially notified of 
his/her transfer to the foreign area.
    (2) Legal title interest. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of 
this section, title to the residence is determined by the name of the 
party (or parties) on the title document (e.g., the deed).
    (3) Equitable title interest. The employee, and/or a member(s) of 
his/her immediate family, in a situation listed in paragraphs (c)(3) (i) 
through (v) of this section is deemed to have title to the residence 
without regard to whether his/her name appears on the title document.
    (i) Title held in trust. The property is held in trust and the 
conditions in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) (A) through (F) of this section 
apply.
    (A) The property must be the employee's residence as described in 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (B) The employee and/or a member(s) of the immediate family must be 
the only beneficiary(ies) of the trust during his/her lifetime.
    (C) The employee and/or a member(s) of the immediate family must 
retain the right to distribute the property during his/her lifetime.

direct distribution of the property upon dissolution of the trust or 
death.
    (F) The employee provides the agency with a copy of the trust 
document.
    (ii) Title held by financial institution. The title is held in the 
name of a financial institution and the conditions in paragraphs 
(c)(3)(ii) (A) through (D) of this section apply.
    (A) The property is the employee's residence as described in 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (B) The employee and/or a member(s) of the immediate family executed 
a financing agreement (e.g., mortgage) with the financial institution.
    (C) State or local law requires that lending parties take title to 
perfect (i.e., protect) a security interest in the property, or the 
financial institution requires that it take possession of title as a 
condition of the financing agreement.
    (D) The employee must provide the agency with a copy of the 
financing document. The agency may require that the employee also 
provide proof of state or local laws governing secured credit.
    (iii) Title includes an accommodation party or parties. The title is 
held both in the names of: the employee singularly, or the employee and 
one or more members of his/her immediate family jointly, or one or more 
members of his/her

[[Page 136]]

immediate family; and an individual (accommodation party) who is not an 
immediate family member. In addition, the conditions in paragraphs 
(c)(3)(iii) (A) through (G) of this section apply. (An accommodation 
party is an individual who signs an employee's financing agreement 
(e.g., a mortgage) to lend his/her name (i.e., credit) to the 
arrangement.)
    (A) The property is the employee's residence as described in 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (B) The employee and/or a member(s) of the immediate family has 
right to use the property and to direct conveyance of the property.

for payments under the financing arrangement (e.g., mortgage).
    (E) The accommodation party's name is on the title.
    (F) The accommodation party does not have a financial interest in 
the property unless the employee and/or a member(s) of the immediate 
family defaults on the financing arrangement.
    (G) The employee provides the agency with acceptable documentation 
of the accommodation. Agencies shall issue policy defining acceptable 
documentation of the accommodation. Such documentation may include a 
copy of the financing document and/or a written statement from the 
employee certifying that the conditions in paragraphs (c)(3)(iii) (A) 
through (G) of this section apply. Such documentation also may include a 
written statement from the accommodation party certifying that he/she 
does not have a financial interest in the property.
    (iv) Title held by seller of the property. The title is held in the 
name of the seller of the property and the conditions in paragraphs 
(c)(3)(iv) (A) through (D) of this section apply.
    (A) The property is the employee's residence as described in 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (B) The employee and/or a member(s) of the immediate family has 
right to use the property and to direct conveyance of the property.
    (C) The employee and/or a member(s) of the immediate family must

a land contract) providing for fixed periodic payments and transfer of 
title to the employee and/or a member(s) of the immediate family upon 
completion of the payment schedule.
    (D) The employee must provide the agency with a copy of the 
financing agreement.
    (v) Other equitable title situations. The title is held both in the 
names of: the employee singularly, or the employee and one or more 
members of his/her immediate family jointly, or one or more members of 
his/her immediate family; and an individual who is not an immediate 
family member. In addition, the conditions in paragraphs (c)(3)(v) (A) 
through (E) of this section apply.
    (A) The property is the employee's residence as described in 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (B) The employee and/or a member(s) of the immediate family has 
right to use the property and to direct conveyance of the property.
    (C) Only the employee and/or a member(s) of the immediate family has 
made payments on the property.
    (D) The employee and/or a member(s) of the immediate family received 
all proceeds from the sale of the property.
    (E) The employee must provide suitable documentation to the agency 
that the conditions listed in paragraphs (c)(3)(v) (A) through (D) of 
this section have been met. Agencies shall issue policy defining 
acceptable documentation. Such documentation must include financial 
documents proving that only the employee and/or a member(s) of the 
immediate family made payments on the property, and financial documents 
proving that the employee and/or a member(s) of the immediate family 
received all proceeds from the sale of the property.
    (d) Occupancy requirements. The dwelling for which reimbursement of 
selling expenses is claimed was, except as provided in paragraph (g) of 
this section, the employee's residence at the time he/she was first 
officially notified by competent authority of his/her transfer to the 
new official station.

[[Page 137]]

    (e) Time limitation--(1) Initial period. The settlement dates for 
the sale and purchase or lease termination transactions for which 
reimbursement is requested are not later than 2 years after the date 
that the employee reported for duty at the new official station. For 
employees eligible under paragraph (g) of this section, new official 
station means the official station to which the employee reports for 
duty when reassigned or transferred from a foreign area.
    (2) Extension of time limitation. (i) Upon an employee's written 
request, the 2-year time limitation for completion of the sale and 
purchase or lease termination transactions may be extended by the head 
of the agency or his/her designee for an additional period of time not 
to exceed 1 year.
    (ii) The employee's written request should be submitted to the 
appropriate agency official(s) as soon as the employee becomes aware of 
the need for an extension but before expiration of the 2-year 
limitation; however, in no case shall the request be submitted later 
than 30 calendar days after the expiration date unless this 30-day 
period is specifically extended by the agency.
    (iii) Approval of this additional period of time shall be based on a 
determination that extenuating circumstances, acceptable to the agency 
concerned, have prevented the employee from completing the sale and 
purchase or lease termination transactions in the initial timeframe and 
that the residence transactions are reasonably related to the transfer 
of official station.
    (iv) When an employee is eligible for an extension of the time 
limitations for completion of a residence transaction and such an 
extension is approved by an agency, relocation entitlements and 
allowances shall be determined by using the entitlements and allowances 
prescribed by regulations in effect on the employee's effective date of 
transfer and not the entitlements and allowances in effect at the time 
the extension of the time limitation is approved. (See Sec. 302-1.3(d).)
    (f) Reimbursement of expenses. The rules in paragraphs (f) (1) and 
(2) of this section govern the reimbursement of employee residence 
transaction expenses.
    (1) Employee must actually incur the expenses. An employee shall be 
reimbursed only for expenses actually incurred and paid by the employee 
or a member of the employee's immediate family. If any expenses were 
shared by persons other than the employee or a member of his/her 
immediate family, reimbursement is limited to the portion actually paid 
by the employee and/or a member of his/her immediate family.
    (2) Pro rata reimbursement. When the title possessed by an employee 
and/or a member(s) of his/her immediate family is not full title to the 
residence, or when an employee is deemed to have a title interest under 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the employee shall be reimbursed on a 
pro rata basis to the extent of his/her actual title interest plus his/
her deemed title interest in the residence. Additionally, an employee 
shall be reimbursed on a pro rata basis in the situations listed in 
paragraphs (f)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section.
    (i) Multiple occupancy dwelling. If the residence is a duplex or 
another type of multiple occupancy dwelling which is occupied only 
partially by the employee, or whenever the employee shares 
responsibility for a leased property (e.g., a shared apartment 
arrangement), expenses shall be reimbursed on a pro rata basis.
    (ii) Excess land. The employee shall be limited to pro rata 
reimbursement when he/she sells or purchases land in excess of that 
which reasonably relates to the residence site.
    (g) Transfer from a foreign area to a nonforeign area--(1) 
Definitions. For purposes of this paragraph, the following definitions 
apply:
    (i) Former nonforeign area official station. This term means the 
official station from which the employee was transferred when assigned 
to the post of duty in the foreign area.
    (ii) Nonforeign area. Nonforeign area includes the United States, 
its territories or possessions, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the former Canal Zone 
area (i.e., areas and installations in the Republic of Panama made 
available to

[[Page 138]]

the United States pursuant to the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977 and 
related agreements (as described in section 3(a) of the Panama Canal Act 
of 1979)).
    (iii) Foreign area. Foreign area refers to any area not defined as a 
nonforeign area.
    (2) Applicability. The provisions of this part are applicable, as 
specified in this paragraph, to employees who have completed an agreed 
upon tour of duty in a foreign area and instead of being returned to the 
former nonforeign area official station, are reassigned or transferred 
in the interest of the Government to a different nonforeign area 
official station than the official station from which the employee was 
transferred when assigned to the foreign post of duty. The distance 
between the former and new official stations must meet the mileage 
criteria specified in Sec. 302-1.7 for short distance transfers.
    (3) Authorized reimbursement. Generally, an employee is required to 
serve at least one tour of duty in a foreign area and retain a residence 
in a nonforeign area with the expectation of returning to the former 
official station in the nonforeign area. However, there are instances 
when an employee completes a tour of duty in a foreign area and is 
subsequently transferred to a different official station or post of duty 
in a nonforeign area than the one from which he/she transferred when 
assigned to the foreign post of duty. When this type of transfer is 
authorized or approved, reimbursement is allowable for real estate 
expenses required to be paid by the employee in connection with:
    (i) The sale of the residence (or the settlement of an unexpired 
lease) at the official station from which the employee was transferred 
when he/she was assigned to a post of duty located in a foreign area; 
and
    (ii) The purchase of a residence at the new official station when 
the employee is transferred in the interest of the Government from a 
post of duty located in a foreign area to a nonforeign area official 
station (other than the official station from which he/she was 
transferred when assigned to the foreign post of duty).
    (4) Reimbursement limitations. Reimbursement under this paragraph is 
prohibited for any sale (or settlement of an unexpired lease) or 
purchase transaction that occurs prior to the employee's first being 
officially notified (generally in the form of a change of official 
station travel authorization) that instead of returning to the former 
nonforeign area official station, he/she will be reassigned or 
transferred to a different nonforeign area official station than the one 
from which he/she was transferred when assigned to the foreign post of 
duty.
    (5) Service agreement required. A signed service agreement shall be 
required as prescribed in Sec. 302-1.5 for any employee who is eligible 
for reimbursement of residence transaction expenses authorized under 
this paragraph.

<R05>
Sec. 302-6.2  Reimbursable and nonreimbursable expenses.

    (a) Brokers' fees and real estate commissions. A broker's fee or 
real estate commission paid by the employee for services in selling his/
her residence is reimbursable but not in excess of rates generally 
charged for such services by the broker or by brokers in the locality of 
the old official station. No such fee or commission is reimbursable in 
connection with the purchase of a home at the new official station.
    (b) Other advertising, selling, and appraisal expenses. Costs of 
newspaper, bulletin board, multiple-listing services, and other 
advertising for sale of the residence at the old official station are 
reimbursable if the employee has not paid for such services in the form 
of a broker's fee or real estate agent's commission. The customary cost 
of an appraisal also may be reimbursed.
    (c) Legal and related expenses. To the extent such costs have not 
been included in brokers' or similar services for which reimbursement is 
claimed under other categories, the following expenses are reimbursable 
with respect to the sale and purchase of residences if they are 
customarily paid by the seller of a residence at the old official 
station or if customarily paid by the

[[Page 139]]

purchaser of a residence at the new official station, to the extent they 
do not exceed amounts customarily charged in the locality of the 
residence: costs of (1) searching title, preparing abstract, and legal 
fees for a title opinion, or (2) where customarily furnished by the 
seller, the cost of a title insurance policy; costs of preparing 
conveyances, other instruments, and contracts and related notary fees 
and recording fees; costs of making surveys, preparing drawings or plats 
when required for legal or financing purposes; and similar expenses. 
Costs of litigation are not reimbursable.
    (d) Miscellaneous expenses--(1) Reimbursable items. The following 
expenses are reimbursable in connection with the sale and/or purchase of 
a residence, provided they are customarily paid by the seller of a 
residence in the locality of the old official station or by the 
purchaser of a residence at the new official station, to the extent they 
do not exceed specifically stated limitations, or in the absence 
thereof, amounts customarily paid in the locality of the residence:
    (i) FHA or VA fee for the loan application.
    (ii) Loan origination fees and similar charges such as loan 
assumption fees and loan transfer fees. A loan origination fee is a fee 
paid by the borrower to compensate the lender for administrative type 
expenses incurred in originating and processing a loan. Reimbursement 
for a loan assumption fee or a loan transfer fee or a similar charge 
also may be allowed, if it is assessed in lieu of a loan origination fee 
and reflects charges for services similar to those covered by a loan 
origination fee. An employee may be reimbursed for these fees in an 
amount not in excess of 1 percent of the loan amount without itemization 
of the lender's administrative charges. Reimbursement may exceed 1 
percent only if the employee shows by clear and convincing evidence 
that:
    (A) The higher rate does not include prepaid interest, points, or a 
mortgage discount; and
    (B) The higher rate is customarily charged in the locality where the 
residence is located.
    (iii) Cost of preparing credit reports.
    (iv) Mortgage and transfer taxes.
    (v) State revenue stamps.
    (vi) Other fees and charges similar in nature to those listed in 
paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (v) of this section, unless specifically 
prohibited in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (vii) Charge for prepayment of a mortgage or other security 
instrument in connection with the sale of a residence at the old 
official station to the extent the terms in the mortgage or other 
security instrument provide for this charge. This prepayment penalty is 
also reimbursable when the mortgage or other security instrument does 
not specifically provide for prepayment, provided this penalty is 
customarily charged by the lender, but in that case the reimbursement 
may not exceed 3 months' interest on the loan balance.
    (viii) Mortgage title insurance policy, paid for by the employee, on 
a residence purchased by the employee for the protection of, and 
required by, the lender.
    (ix) Owner's title insurance policy, provided it is a prerequisite 
to financing or the transfer of the property; or if the cost of the 
owner's title insurance policy is inseparable from the cost of other 
insurance which is a prerequisite to financing or the transfer of the 
property.
    (x) Expenses in connection with construction of a residence, which 
are comparable to expenses that are reimbursable in connection with the 
purchase of an existing residence.
    (xi) Expenses in connection with environmental testing and property 
inspection fees when required by Federal, State, or local law; or by the 
lender as a precondition to sale or purchase.
    (2) Nonreimbursable items. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section, the following items of expense are not 
reimbursable:
    (i) Owner's title insurance policy, ``record title'' insurance 
policy, mortgage insurance or insurance against loss or damage of 
property, and optional insurance paid for by the employee in connection 
with the purchase of a residence for the protection of the employee;
    (ii) Interest on loans, points, and mortgage discounts;

[[Page 140]]

    (iii) Property taxes;
    (iv) Operating or maintenance costs;
    (v) No fee, cost, charge, or expense determined to be part of the 
finance charge under the Truth in Lending Act, title I, Pub. L. 90-321, 
as amended, and Regulation Z issued by the Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System (12 CFR part 226), unless specifically authorized 
in paragraph (d)(1) of this section; and
    (vi) Expenses that result from construction of a residence.
    (e) Losses due to prices or market conditions at the old and new 
posts of duty. Losses are not reimbursable when they are incurred by an 
employee:
    (1) Due to failure to sell a residence at the old official station 
at the price asked, or at its current appraised value, or at its 
original cost;
    (2) Due to failure to buy a dwelling at the new official station at 
a price comparable to the selling price of the residence at the old 
official station; or
    (3) Any similar losses.
    (f) Other expenses of sale and purchase of residences. Incidental 
charges made for required services in selling and purchasing residences 
may be reimbursable if they are customarily paid by the seller of a 
residence at the old official station or if customarily paid by the 
purchaser of a residence at the new official station, to the extent they 
do not exceed amounts customarily charged in the locality of the 
residence.
    (g) Overall limitations--(1) Sale of the residence at the old 
official station. The total amount of expenses that an agency may 
reimburse in connection with the sale of the residence at the old 
official station shall not exceed 10 percent of the actual sales price 
of the residence.
    (2) Purchase of a residence at the new official station. The total 
amount of expenses that an agency may reimburse in connection with the 
purchase of a residence at the new official station shall not exceed 5 
percent of the actual purchase price of the residence.
    (h) Settlement of an unexpired lease. Expenses incurred for settling 
an unexpired lease (including month-to-month rental) for residence 
quarters occupied by the employee at the old official station may 
include broker's fees for obtaining a sublease or charges for 
advertising an unexpired lease. Such expenses are reimbursable when (1) 
applicable laws or the terms of the lease provide for payment of 
settlement expenses, (2) such expenses cannot be avoided by sublease or 
other arrangement, (3) the employee has not contributed to the expense 
by failing to give appropriate lease termination notice promptly after 
he/she has definite knowledge of the transfer, and (4) the broker's fees 
or advertising charges are not in excess of those customarily charged 
for comparable services in that locality. Itemization of these expenses 
is required and the total amount shall be entered on an appropriate 
travel voucher. This voucher may be submitted separately or with a claim 
that is to be made for expenses incident to the purchase of a dwelling. 
Each item must be supported by documentation showing that the expense 
was in fact incurred and paid by the employee.

<R05>
Sec. 302-6.3  Procedural and control requirements.

    (a) Application for reimbursement and documentation of expenses. 
Employees shall be furnished appropriate forms for claiming 
reimbursement for expenses of real estate transactions. Agencies shall 
prescribe a claim application form which meets internal administrative 
requirements. The form should include the most commonly incurred items 
of expense for which reimbursement may be claimed and any necessary 
administrative approval blocks. Amounts claimed must be supported by 
documentation showing that the expense was in fact incurred and paid by 
the employee. Included in the required supporting documents (as 
appropriate) are copies of (1) the sales agreement, (2) the purchase 
agreement, (3) property settlement documents, (4) loan closing 
statements, and (5) invoices or receipts for other bills paid. An 
appropriate voucher shall be prepared by the employee and used in

[[Page 141]]

transmitting the claim application with supporting attachments. 
Reimbursement may be in two parts; i.e., a payment for expenses incurred 
in the sale of the former residence and a payment for expenses incurred 
in the purchase of a new dwelling.
    (b) Review and administrative approval of sale and purchase 
expenses. Applications shall be reviewed by a responsible official of 
the agency. The application for reimbursement of expenses for the sale 
of a residence shall be sent to the claimant's old official station for 
review and approval of the claim unless agency review and approval 
functions are performed elsewhere. In case of transfer between agencies, 
review and approval of the application shall be made, if appropriate, at 
an installation of the hiring agency in the locality of the employee's 
old official station, but if the hiring agency has no appropriate 
installation, it shall be sent to the losing agency at the old official 
station for review and approval. This review and approval are intended 
to be limited to determining whether the expenses claimed are reasonable 
in amount and customarily paid by the seller in the locality where the 
property is located. If items of cost appear to have been inflated or 
are higher than normally imposed for similar services in the locality, 
any portion of such costs determined to be excessive shall be 
disallowed. When approved, the application shall be returned with such 
memorandum of explanation as may be appropriate. A similar review and 
approval are required in connection with an application for 
reimbursement of the expenses of the purchase of a new dwelling. Final 
administrative approval of payment of the claim must be executed by an 
appropriate approving official. Such official may accept as conclusive 
the required prior approvals covering reasonableness and custom; he/she 
shall, however, in accordance with the provisions of this part, 
independently determine whether (1) the aggregate amount of expenses 
claimed in connection with a sale or purchase of a residence is within 
the prescribed limitation for either, (2) all conditions and 
requirements under which allowances may be paid have been met, and (3) 
the expenses themselves are those which are reimbursable. The employee's 
claim accompanied by the application and supporting documents shall be 
completed and submitted in accordance with the usual procedures of the 
agency concerned.
    (c) Assistance provided by local offices of the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development. Technical assistance in determining the 
reasonableness of an expense may be obtained from the local or area 
office of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) serving 
the area in which the expense occurred. The local office maintains and 
can furnish upon request a current Form HUD-92496, Schedule of Closing 
Costs, applicable to the area. This is a schedule of closing costs 
typically encountered in connection with the purchase and sale of single 
family properties in the locality. For the purpose of determining 
whether the expenses claimed are reasonable and may be approved for 
reimbursement, these closing costs should be used as guidelines and not 
as rigid limitations. The local office will also furnish upon request 
information concerning local custom and practices with respect to 
charging of closing costs related to either a sale or purchase, 
including information as to whether such costs are customarily paid by 
the seller or purchaser and the local terminology used to describe them. 
Area or insuring offices of HUD are located in all major cities. The 
mailing addresses for these offices are included in the U.S. Government 
Manual, published annually by the Office of the Federal Register, 
National Archives and Records Administration. A directory containing the 
addresses of all such offices (HUD Form 788) is available at any HUD 
office.
    (d) Violation of employment agreement. In the event the employee 
violates the terms of the agreement required under Sec. 302-1.5, no 
expenses will be paid, and any amounts paid prior to such violation 
shall be a debt due the United States until they are paid by the 
employee.

    Source: 54 FR 20323, May 10, 1989, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 302-7.1  Eligibility and limitations.

    (a) Eligibility. An employee who is entitled to transportation of 
his/her household goods under part 302-8 shall, instead of such 
transportation, be entitled to an allowance, as provided in this part, 
for the transportation of a mobile home for use as a residence. To be 
eligible for the allowance, the employee shall certify in a manner 
prescribed by the head of the employing agency that the mobile home is 
for use as a residence for the employee and/or his/her immediate family 
at the destination. If an employee is not eligible to receive an 
allowance for movement of his/her mobile home, he/she may be eligible to 
receive an allowance based on the transportation of his/her household 
goods under part 302-8.
    (b) Geographic limitations--(1) Overland transportation. Allowances 
for transportation of mobile homes overland may be made only for 
transportation of such homes within the continental United States 
(CONUS), within Alaska, and through Canada en route between Alaska and 
CONUS. Allowances for transportation within the limits prescribed may be 
paid even though the transportation involved originates, terminates, or 
passes through locations not covered, provided the amount of the 
allowance shall be computed on the basis of that part of the 
transportation which is within CONUS, within Alaska, or through Canada 
en route between Alaska and CONUS.
    (2) Over-water transportation. Allowances for transportation of 
mobile homes over-water may be made only for transportation of such 
homes from a point of origin either within CONUS or within Alaska to a 
destination point either within CONUS or within Alaska.
    (c) Relationship to other allowances. Allowances for transporting 
mobile homes (including mileage when towed by employee) are in addition 
to payment of per diem, mileage, and transportation expenses for 
employees and their immediate families. However, the fact that a mobile 
home may be moved at Government expense only if the employee certifies 
that it is to be used as a residence at the destination should be 
considered in determining allowances to be paid under parts 302-4, 302-
5, and 302-6.
[54 FR 20323, May 10, 1989, as amended by FTR Amdt. 20, 56 FR 46989, 
Sept. 17, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 302-7.2  Computation of distances.

    (a) Standard highway mileage. Where points of origin and destination 
are within the continental United States and Alaska, the allowable 
distance between these points shall be that shown in the standard 
highway mileage guides or actual miles driven as determined from 
odometer readings. (Actual odometer readings need not be shown on the 
travel voucher.) Any substantial deviation from distances shown in the 
standard highway mileage guides shall be explained.
    (b) Islands involved. In addition to mileage, if the point of origin 
or destination is an island within the boundaries of one of the 
continental United States or Alaska and a ferry is used in 
transportation of a mobile home, the statute mileage between the island 
and the usual place of arrival or departure on the mainland shall be 
allowed, except that when such mileage is included in the standard 
highway mileage guides the mileage shown therein shall be used.

[[Page 143]]

    (c) Unauthorized transportation involved. Where point of origin or 
destination, or both, are not in the continental United States or 
Alaska, the allowable distance shall be limited to the distance which 
the mobile home is transported within or between any of the continental 
United States and Alaska, and through Canada en route between Alaska and 
the continental United States. In such instances, the mileage shall be 
computed as provided in paragraph (a) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 302-7.3  Computation of allowances.

    (a) Transportation by commercial carrier. When a mobile home is 
transported by commercial carrier, an allowance for transportation costs 
shall include the following (see paragraph (d) of this section for 
preparation fees also allowable as transportation costs):
    (1) The carrier's charges for actual transportation of the mobile 
home in an amount not exceeding the applicable tariff as approved by the 
Interstate Commerce Commission (or appropriate State regulatory body for 
intrastate movements) for transportation of a mobile home of the size 
and type involved for the distance involved, provided any substantial 
deviation from mileage shown in the standard highway mileage guides is 
explained;
    (2) Ferry fares and bridge, road, and tunnel tolls;
    (3) Taxes, charges or fees fixed by a State or other government 
authority for permits to transport mobile homes in or through its 
jurisdiction;
    (4) Carrier's service charges for obtaining necessary permits; and
    (5) Charges for a pilot (flag) car or escort services, when such 
services are required by State or local law.
    (b) Transportation by private means--(1) Overland transportation. 
When a mobile homes is transported overland by means other than a 
commercial carrier, such as when it is towed by a privately owned 
conveyance, an allowance of 11 cents per mile shall be made as 
reimbursement for the transportation costs listed in paragraph (a) of 
this section. In addition, an agency may pay the costs of preparing a 
mobile home for movement and resettling it at the destination as 
provided in paragraph (d) of this section. No other allowance shall be 
made for transportation of the mobile home under this part. However, in 
addition to the 11-cent allowance and the allowance under paragraph (d) 
of this section, an agency may pay the mileage allowance for use of a 
privately owned conveyance as provided in Sec. 302-2.3.
    (2) Transportation over-water. When a boat used as a primary 
residence is transported over-water, an allowance for transportation 
costs shall include, but not be limited to:
    (i) The cost of fuel and oil used for propulsion of the boat;
    (ii) The cost of pilots or navigators in the open water;
    (iii) The cost of a crew;
    (iv) Charges for harbor pilots;
    (v) The cost of docking fees incurred in transit;
    (vi) Harbor or port fees and similar charges relating to entry in 
and navigation through ports; and
    (vii) The cost of towing, whether in tow or towing by pushing from 
behind.
    (c) Mixed method of transportation. When a mobile home is 
transported partly by commercial carrier and partly by private means, 
the allowances described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section apply 
to the respective portions of the transportation.
    (d) Other allowable transportation costs. In addition to the 
allowances provided for in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, 
an allowance for transportation shall include costs generally associated 
with preparing a mobile home at a point of origin inside Alaska or CONUS 
for movement and resettling the mobile home at the destination inside 
Alaska or CONUS. Any costs for preparing a mobile home located outside 
Alaska or CONUS for movement, and any costs for resettling a mobile home 
outside Alaska or CONUS shall not be reimbursed. Preparation costs 
include but are not limited to:
    (1) The costs of blocking and unblocking (including anchoring and 
unanchoring);
    (2) The labor costs of removing and installing skirting;
    (3) The cost of separating, preparing, and sealing each section for 
movement;
    (4) The cost of reassembling the two halves of a double-wide mobile 
home; and

[[Page 144]]

    (5) Travel lift fees.
    (e) Unallowable costs. An individual's transportation allowance 
shall not include the following costs (see part 302-3 which relates to 
the miscellaneous expenses allowance):
    (1) All costs for replacement parts, tire purchases, structural 
repairs, brake repairs, or any other repairs or maintenance performed;
    (2) Costs of insurance for valuation of mobile homes above carriers' 
maximum liabilities, or charges designated in the tariffs as ``Special 
Service;''
    (3) Costs of storage; and
    (4) Costs of connecting and disconnecting appliances, equipment, and 
utilities involved in relocation and costs of converting appliances for 
operation on available utilities.
    (f) Optional use of Government bill of lading. Instead of the 
allowances to the employee provided in paragraphs (a) through (e) of 
this section, the agency may, when it determines such action to be in 
the Government's interest, assume direct responsibility for 
transportation of an employee's mobile home, issuing necessary bills of 
lading, and paying the costs involved. In such instances, the employee 
shall not receive any other allowance for the transportation involved 
and shall be charged any cost the Government must pay under the bill of 
lading which would not be allowed under this section or which is in 
excess of that allowable under Sec. 302-7.4.

<R05>
Sec. 302-7.4  Limitation on allowances.

    The total amount allowable in Sec. 302-7.3 shall not exceed the 
maximum amount which would be allowable for transportation and 90 days' 
temporary storage of the employee's household goods if, instead of 
moving a mobile home, the maximum quantity of household goods allowable 
under Sec. 302-8.2 had been moved.


<R05>
Sec. 302-7.5  Advance of funds.

    An advance of funds may be allowed an employee for the 
transportation of a mobile home under the requirements provided in 
Sec. 302-1.14(a). The amount of advance shall not exceed either the 
estimated amount allowable under Sec. 302-7.3(a) of the construction 
cost determined under Sec. 302-7.4. No advance is authorized when a 
Government bill of lading is used as provided in     Sec. 302-7.3(f).

Sec. 302-8.1  Applicability.

    Employees covered by this subtitle who have complied with the 
general requirements as contained in part 302-1 are eligible for 
transportation and temporary storage of their household goods subject to 
the provisions of this part when they are transferred, regardless of 
whether the official stations involved are within or outside the 
continental United States, are appointed to positions in which 
Government transportation to the first official station is allowable, or 
are separated after completion of a period of service overseas.
[54 FR 20324, May 10, 1989, as amended by FTR Amdt. 26, 57 FR 28636, 
June 26, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 302-8.2  General limitations.

    (a) Maximum weight allowance. The maximum weight of household goods 
that may be transported or stored at Government expense is limited to 
18,000 pounds net weight for all employees. The total weight of 
household goods stored under Sec. 302-9.2 plus the weight of household 
goods transported under this part shall not exceed the maximum weight 
allowance prescribed in this paragraph.

[[Page 145]]

    (b) Professional books, papers, and equipment. (1) For purposes of 
this part, the term ``professional books, papers, and equipment'' 
includes those professional or specialized items and other materials 
which are personally owned by the employee for use in the performance of 
official duties. The term does not include sports equipment or office, 
household, or shop fixtures and furniture; e.g., bookcases, file 
cabinets, desks, and racks of any kind even though used in connection 
with the professional books, papers, and equipment.
    (2) There is no statutory authority to transport personally owned 
professional books, papers, and equipment in addition to the maximum 
weight allowance (Sec. 302-8.2(a)) established by law for transportation 
of an employee's household goods and personal effects. However, there 
may be instances in which the weight of the professional books, papers, 
and equipment would cause an employee's household goods shipment to be 
in excess of the maximum weight allowance. In such instances, the 
personally owned professional books, papers, and equipment may be 
transported to the new permanent duty station as an administrative 
expense of an agency (not chargeable to travel and transportation 
appropriations). Shipment of these items as an administrative expense 
would be instead of shipment as an allowance of the employee.
    (3) Authority to transport professional books, papers, and equipment 
as an administrative expense shall be subject to agency policy and 
discretion within the following guidelines:
    (i) The employee shall furnish an itemized inventory of professional 
books, papers, and equipment for review by an appropriate authorizing 
official at the new permanent duty station. In addition, the employee 
shall furnish appropriate evidence (as determined by the agency 
concerned) that transporting the itemized materials as part of the 
employee's household goods would result in an excess of the employee's 
maximum weight allowance.
    (ii) The authorizing official at the new permanent duty station 
shall review and certify that the professional books, papers, and 
equipment as itemized are necessary in the proper performance of the 
employee's duties at the new duty station and that if these items were 
not transported to the new duty station, the same or similar items would 
have to be obtained at Government expense for the employee's use at the 
new duty station.
    (iii) When professional books, papers, and equipment are certified 
as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section and shipped for the 
employee as an administrative expense of an agency, shipment shall be by 
the actual expense method; the commuted rate method shall not be used. 
When shipped in the same lot with the employee's household goods and 
other personal effects under the actual expense method, the professional 
books, papers, and equipment shall be packed and weighed separately; the 
weight thereof and the administrative appropriation chargeable shall be 
stated as separate items on the Government bill of lading. In unusual 
instances in which it is impractical or impossible to obtain separate 
weights, a constructive weight of 7 pounds per cubic foot may be used.
    (c) Determining the net weight--(1) Uncrated shipments. When 
household goods are shipped uncrated as in a household mover's van or 
similar conveyance, the net weight shall be that shown on the bill of 
lading or on the weight certificate attached thereto, which, under 
Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) regulations, includes the weight of 
barrels, boxes, cartons, and similar materials used in packing, but does 
not include pads, chains, dollies, and other equipment needed to load 
and secure the shipment. When a noncommercial means of shipment is 
involved (see Sec. 302-8.3(a)(3)), the ICC regulations shall apply for 
determining the net weight. When an employee's claim is based on 
constructive weight as authorized in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, 
the net weight shall be the weight as determined under that provision.
    (2) Crated shipments. When property is transported crated, the net 
weight shall not include the weight of the crating material. The net 
weight shall be computed as being 60 percent of the gross weight. 
However, if the net

[[Page 146]]

weight computed in this manner exceeds the applicable weight limitation 
and if it is determined that, for reasons beyond the employee's control, 
unusually heavy crating and packing materials were necessarily used, the 
net weight may be computed at less than 60 percent of the gross weight.
    (3) Containerized shipments. When special containers designed 
normally for repeated use, such as lift vans, CONEX transporters, and 
household-goods shipping boxes are used and the known tare weight does 
not include the weight of interior bracing and padding materials but 
only the weight of the container, the net weight of the household goods 
shall be 85 percent of the gross weight less the weight of the 
container. If the known tare weight includes interior bracing and 
padding materials so that the net weight is the same as it would be for 
uncrated shipments in interstate commerce, the net weight shall not be 
subject to the reduction. If the gross weight of the container cannot be 
obtained, the net weight of the household goods shall be determined from 
the cubic measurement on the basis of 7 pounds per cubic foot of 
properly loaded container space.
    (4) Constructive weight. If no adequate scale is available at point 
of origin, at any point en route, or at destination, a constructive 
weight, based on 7 pounds per cubic foot of properly loaded van space, 
may be used. Such constructive weight also may be used for a part-load 
when its weight could not be obtained at origin, en route, or at 
destination, without first unloading it or other part-loads being 
carried in the same vehicle, or when the household goods are not weighed 
because the carrier's charges for a local or metropolitan area move are 
properly computed on a basis other than the weight or volume of the 
shipment (as when payment is based on an hourly rate and the distance 
involved). However, in such instances the employee should obtain a 
statement from the carrier showing the amount of properly loaded van 
space required for the shipment. (See also Sec. 302-8.3(a)(3) with 
respect to proof of entitlement to a commuted rate payment when net 
weight cannot be shown.)
    (d) Temporary storage time limit. The time allowable for temporary 
storage in connection with an authorized shipment of household goods 
shall not exceed a period of 90 days. This time period also applies when 
an employee returns to his/her place of actual residence for leave 
before serving a new tour of duty outside the continental United States 
either at a different post of duty or at the same post of duty if the 
storage is provided instead of furnished quarters or a quarters 
allowance. However, upon an employee's written request, the initial 90-
day period may be extended an additional period not to exceed 90 days 
under certain conditions if approved by the agency head or his/her 
designee. Justification for an additional storage period may include, 
but is not limited to, the following reasons:
    (1) An intervening temporary duty or long-term training assignment;
    (2) Nonavailability of suitable housing;
    (3) Completion of residence under construction;
    (4) Serious illness of employee or illness or death of a dependent; 
or
    (5) Strikes, acts of God, or other circumstances beyond the control 
of the employee.
    (e) Origin and destination. Cost of transportation of household 
goods may be paid by the Government whether the shipment originates at 
the employee's last official station or place of residence or at some 
other point, or if part of the shipment originates at the last official 
station and the remainder at one or more other points. Similarly, these 
expenses are allowable whether the point of destination is the new 
official station or some other point selected by the employee, or if the 
destination for part of the property is the new official station and the 
remainder is shipped to one or more other points. However, the total 
amount which may be paid or reimbursed by the Government shall not 
exceed the cost of transporting the property in one lot by the most 
economical route from the last official station of the transferring 
employee (or the place of actual residence of the new appointee at time 
of appointment) to the new official station.

[[Page 147]]

In connection with return from overseas for separation, see Sec. 302-
1.12(d). No property acquired by the employee en route between old and 
new official stations shall be eligible for transportation under this 
part.
    (f) Loss and damage liability. Limitations on the Government's 
liability for loss or damage of an employee's household goods are 
contained in the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees' Claims Act 
of 1964 (31 U.S.C. 3721-3723) and in agency rules and regulations issued 
under the authority thereof. Since agency practices and regulations 
under that Act differ, and in view of the different circumstances under 
which household goods are transported and temporarily stored under the 
authority of this part, each agency should advise transferred employees 
of the applicability and restrictions on claims against the Government 
for loss and damage as related to the transportation circumstances 
involved. Agencies should also be prepared to give advice to employees 
as to the liability of the carrier for loss and damage of transported 
household goods in the transportation circumstances involved so that 
they will be able to evaluate the need for insurance and the 
advisability of incurring a valuation charge. (For interstate shipments 
by motor carrier on commercial bills of lading, see 49 CFR part 1056.)

Sec. 302-8.3  Transportation within the continental United States.

    (a) The commuted rate system--(1) Description. Under the commuted 
rate system an employee makes his/her own arrangements for transporting 
household goods between points within the continental United States. He/
She selects and pays the carrier or transports his/her goods by 
noncommercial means and is reimbursed by the Government in accordance 
with schedules of commuted rates which are contained in the GSA 
publication, Commuted Rate Schedule for Transportation of Household 
Goods. Agencies requiring this publication shall prepare a Standard Form 
1, Printing and Binding Requisition, and send it to: Superintendent of 
Documents, Departmental Account Representative Division, U.S. Government 
Printing Office (GPO), Washington, DC 20401. The schedules of commuted 
rates which are developed from tariffs that carriers have filed with the 
Interstate Commerce Commission consist of tables to be applied to the 
particular transportation involved. The commuted rate includes costs of 
line-haul transportation, packing, crating, unpacking, drayage incident 
to transportation, and other accessorial charges. Costs of temporary 
storage which are subject to reimbursement under Sec. 302-8.5 are stated 
separately in the schedule of commuted rates.
    (2) Reimbursement. When the commuted rate system is used, the amount 
to be paid to the employee for transportation and related services is 
computed by multiplying the number of hundreds of pounds shipped (within 
the maximum weight allowance) by the applicable rate per hundred pounds 
for the distance shipped as shown in the commuted rate schedule. The 
distance shall be determined in accordance with household goods mileage 
guides filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission. If the rate is not 
shown in the commuted rate schedule for the exact mileage, the rate 
shown for the next greater distance applies. If an employee is charged a 
minimum weight above the actual weight of his/her household goods under 
the applicable tariff (other than one based on expedited or special 
services), the reimbursement shall be based on the minimum weight as 
charged instead of the actual weight of the goods.
    (3) Documentation. Claims for reimbursement under the commuted rate 
system shall be supported by a receipted copy of the bill of lading (a 
reproduced copy may be accepted) including any attached weight 
certificate copies if such a bill was issued. If no bill of lading was 
involved, other evidence showing points of origin and destination and 
the weight of the goods must be submitted. Employees who transport their 
own household goods are cautioned to establish the weight of such goods 
by obtaining proper weight certificates showing gross weight (weight of 
vehicle and goods) and tare weight (weight of vehicle

[[Page 148]]

alone) because compliance with the requirements for payment at commuted 
rates on the basis of constructive weight (see Sec. 302-8.2(c)(4)) 
usually is not possible.
    (b) Actual expense method--(1) Description. Under the actual expense 
method, the Government assumes responsibility for awarding contracts and 
for other negotiations with carriers. The property is shipped on a 
Government bill of lading, and the Government audits and pays 
transportation vouchers directly to carriers. Under the actual expense 
method, the household goods are shipped by the Government, not by the 
employee.
    (2) Agency responsibility. Selection of the carrier, arranging for 
carrier services and for packing and crating, preparing the Government 
bill of lading, paying charges incurred, and processing any loss and 
damage claims are the direct responsibility of the agency.
    (3) Allowable charges. The actual costs of transportation of 
household goods within the authorized weight limits will be allowed at 
Government expense. Also, within that weight limit, the actual costs for 
packing, crating, unpacking, drayage incident to transportation, and 
necessary accessorial services shall be allowed.
    (4) Multiple shipment procedures. When the actual expense method is 
used in shipping household goods belonging to two or more employees 
between the same two points, the weight of the household goods of each 
employee is to be identified for the purpose of applying the maximum 
weight limitations.
    (5) Excess weight procedures. When the weight of an employee's 
household goods exceeds the maximum weight limitation, the total 
quantity may be shipped on a Government bill of lading, but the employee 
shall reimburse the Government for the cost of transportation and other 
charges applicable to the excess weight, computed from the total charges 
according to the ratio of excess weight to the total weight of the 
shipment.
    (c) Use of commuted rate or actual expense method--(1) 
Considerations. When the commuted rate system is used, the Government is 
relieved of the responsibility and administrative expense of selecting 
and dealing with carriers and making other arrangements for transporting 
employees' household goods; however, the Government cannot take 
advantage of special discounts which may be offered. On the other hand, 
when the actual expense method is used, the Government incurs the 
additional expenses of selecting and dealing with carriers, preparing 
bills of lading, auditing and paying transportation vouchers, 
supervising the packing of household goods, handling employee loss and 
damage claims, and other incidentals.
    (2) Estimating costs. Under the commuted rate system, an accurate 
estimate of cost depends upon the accuracy of the estimate of weight. 
However, under the actual expense method the cost to the Government will 
usually depend not only on the weight involved but also on the 
accessorial services required, the quality of packing and the quantity 
of individual cartons, boxes, barrels, and wardrobes used by the carrier 
in packing. When the commuted rate system is used, the packing and 
accessorial charges are authorized and paid for by the employee from the 
amounts allowed for those charges under that system. Under the actual 
expense method, the accessorial and packing charges are paid by the 
Government, and if those charges are high, they may more than offset any 
discount in the line-haul rate which may be available for shipments by 
Government bill of lading. A proper comparison of costs must take into 
account the line-haul transportation charge, the administrative costs as 
indicated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and the expected 
accessorial and packing charges.
    (3) Policy. The general policy is that commuted rates shall be used 
for transportation of employees' household goods when individual 
transfers are involved, and that appropriate action, depending on the 
amount of goods to be transported, shall be taken to estimate and 
compare actual expense method costs with commuted rate costs when groups 
of employees are transferred between the same official stations at 
approximately the same time so that the method resulting in less cost to 
the

[[Page 149]]

Government may be used. Specific procedures to be followed are contained 
in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
    (4) Criteria for use of the actual expense method--(i) Individual 
transfers. Agency experience with the actual expense method has shown 
that shipment by Government bill of lading does not result in savings 
simply because a line-haul discount is available. Therefore, the 
commuted rate system shall be used for individual transfers without 
consideration being given the actual expense method; except that the 
actual expense method may be used if the actual costs to be incurred by 
the Government for packing and other accessorial services are 
predetermined (at least as to price per 100 pounds) and if that method 
is expected to result in a real savings to the Government of $100 or 
more. (For intrastate transfers, see paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this 
section.)
    (ii) Multiple transfers. Under general rate tenders arranged by GSA 
and the Department of Defense (DOD), participating carriers agree to 
transport the household goods of Government employees at rates below 
commercial rates for specific periods of time. These tenders are 
arranged under 49 U.S.C. 10721, and no further agency negotiation is 
necessary to take advantage of them. Agencies shall evaluate the use of 
such rates when, because of the transfer of several employees, they have 
a large volume of household goods to be moved between the same places at 
the same time even though no mass move is involved; however, the added 
costs for use of the actual expense method, as discussed in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section, and the uncertainty as to total cost for packing 
and accessorial services, as discussed in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, shall be taken into consideration, and the actual expense 
method shall be selected only if it is considered likely that a real 
savings to the Government will result from the use of that method.
    (iii) Mass moves. Whenever an entire facility is being relocated or 
whenever it is anticipated that 10 or more shipments of household goods 
are to be transported between the same two points at approximately the 
same time, the agency involved shall notify the appropriate regional or 
zonal office of the General Services Administration (for civilian 
agencies without specialized transportation personnel) or the 
appropriate transportation office of DOD (for components of that 
Department) of the forthcoming move so that an analysis can be made of 
existing available rates for use under the actual expense method. The 
notification shall be accompanied by all pertinent information 
concerning points of origin and destination, estimated weights of 
property, the number of persons or different families involved, and 
dates or periods of time when each person or family is expected to move. 
When appropriate, the GSA or DOD transportation organization shall 
attempt to arrange with carriers for worthwhile reduced rates and shall 
advise the agency concerned of the results of such efforts. If these 
efforts show that a saving will result, considering all direct and 
indirect costs involved, the actual expense method shall be used. 
Otherwise, the commuted rate system shall be used.
    (iv) Unusual circumstances. The commuted rates do not take into 
account intrastate rates that in some instances may be substantially 
higher than the interstate rates that form the basis for the commuted 
rates. In order to avoid the necessity of prescribing commuted rates for 
such circumstances, the actual expense method (Government bill of 
lading) may be used when it is administratively determined that the 
commuted rate system would cause an unusual hardship for an employee 
transferring between official stations within a State. This authority 
shall not be used indiscriminately, and its use shall be carefully 
documented and justified.

Sec. 302-8.4  Transportation outside the continental United States.

    (a) Coverage. This section contains special rules which are 
applicable to the transportation of household goods at Government 
expense to, from, and between points outside the continental United 
States. Individual eligibility is covered in part 302-1.
    (b) Weight limitation. The maximum weight specified in Sec. 302-8.2 
is applicable; however, where furnished or partly

[[Page 150]]

furnished quarters are to be provided outside the continental United 
States (in the case of a transfer to such a station) or have been 
provided (in the case of a return to the continental United States), 
agencies shall make an appropriate reduction in the weight of household 
goods which may be authorized for shipment at Government expense.
    (c) Allowable costs--(1) Actual expense basis. Transportation 
authorized under this section shall be on an actual expense basis. 
Actual expense includes costs of transportation of household goods, 
packing and crating (including packing and crating materials and 
temporary containers), unpacking, and other necessary accessorial 
charges within applicable limits.
    (2) Drayage. If door-to-door common carrier rates are not 
applicable, allowable costs include the actual costs of drayage to and 
from the common carrier for goods not in excess of the authorized 
weight.
    (3) Lift vans. Charges allowable for packing and crating and for 
transportation include expenses incurred in hiring, transporting, and 
packing lift vans when shipments are made in whole or in part by water, 
but do not include charges in connection with any shipment or storage of 
empty lift vans or import duties on lift vans.
    (4) Valuation. The valuation of property as declared for shipping 
will not exceed that to which the lowest freight rates will apply except 
as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
    (d) Procedures applicable--(1) Transportation and related services. 
The allowable transportation and related services may be obtained by the 
agency concerned from any available commercial carrier, except that all 
shipments of property by water shall be made on ships registered under 
the laws of the United States whenever such ships are available.
    (2) Use of Government bill of lading. Commercial shipments will be 
made on Government bills of lading or purchase orders whenever possible; 
otherwise, reimbursement shall be made to the employee for 
transportation expenses actually and necessarily incurred within the 
limitations prescribed by this section.
    (3) Itemization of charges. If the services rendered cover, in 
addition to transportation, other services such as packing, crating, 
drayage, unpacking, and temporary storage, the total charge for the 
services shall be itemized to show the charge for each service.
    (e) Services in excess of those authorized--(1) By means other than 
selected. An employee may elect to have his/her household goods moved by 
some means other than the means selected by the Government, except as 
noted in paragraph (d)(1) of this section relating to transportation by 
foreign flag vessels, on the condition that he/she will pay the amount, 
if any, by which the charges for the means of transportation selected by 
him/her exceed the charges for the means of transportation selected by 
the Government.
    (2) Excess weight. If household goods in excess of the weight 
allowable under this regulation are shipped on a Government bill of 
lading or purchase order, the employee shall promptly upon completion of 
the shipment pay the proper agency official for the excess cost. The 
excess cost shall be computed from the total charges according to the 
ratio of excess weight to the total weight of the shipment.
    (3) Excess valuation or insurance. An employee may declare a 
valuation above the minimum permitted if he/she assumes all additional 
expenses resulting therefrom, including the cost of insurance needed to 
protect the higher valuation. (See Sec. 302-8.2(f).)

<R05>
Sec. 302-8.5  Temporary storage.

    (a) Applicability. Temporary storage of household goods at 
Government expense may be allowable only when such storage is incident 
to transportation of the household goods at Government expense.
    (b) Allowable expenses--(1) Commuted rate system. In connection with 
transportation within the continental United States under the commuted 
rate system, costs of temporary storage within the applicable weight 
limit will be reimbursed to the employee in the amount of his/her costs 
for storage

[[Page 151]]

including in and out charges and necessary drayage, but not to exceed 
the commuted rates for storage in the GSA publication, Commuted Rate 
Schedule for Transportation of Household Goods. (See Sec. 302-
8.3(a)(1).) A receipted copy of the warehouse or other bill for storage 
costs is required to support reimbursement.
    (2) Actual expense method. In connection with transportation within 
or outside the United States when the actual expense method is used, the 
Government will normally arrange for necessary temporary storage and pay 
the cost thereof direct. If an employee must arrange for temporary 
storage in connection with transportation by the actual expense method, 
he/she may be reimbursed for reasonable costs incurred for storage 
including in and out charges and necessary drayage within the applicable 
limitations. Charges for excess weight, valuation above the minimum 
amount, and services obtained by the employee at higher costs shall be 
the responsibility of the employee in the same manner as he/she is 
responsible for excess costs incident to transportation. (See Secs. 302-
8.3(b)(5) and 302-8.4(e).)


<R05>
Sec. 302-8.6  Advance of funds.

    (a) Commuted rate system. Advances of funds may be made to employees 
up to the estimated amount of the commuted payment for the cost of 
authorized transportation and temporary storage of their household goods 
under the procedures and policies prescribed in Sec. 302-1.14(a).
    (b) Overseas shipments. For overseas shipment, advance of funds may 
be made for the estimated cost of transportation and temporary storage 
only if the cost of authorized transportation and temporary storage will 
not be paid directly by the Government, as is the case when a Government 
bill of lading or purchase order is used.
    (c) Procedures. In requesting an advance of funds, the employee 
shall submit a written statement designating:
    (1) The points of origin and destination,
    (2) The estimated weight of household goods to be shipped, and
    (3) Any anticipated temporary storage not to exceed a period of 90 
days at Government expense. The estimate of weight required in support 
of an advance of funds shall consist of a statement of the estimated 
weight signed by the carrier selected to handle the shipment, if 
available. If not available, evidence of actual weight or a reasonable 
estimate thereof acceptable to the agency shall be furnished.

<R05>
Sec. 302-9.1  Nontemporary storage during assignment to isolated locations in the continental United States.

    (a) Policy. Nontemporary storage of household goods belonging to an 
employee transferred or a new appointee assigned to an official station 
at an isolated location in the continental United States shall be 
allowed only when it is clearly justified under the conditions in this 
part and is not primarily for the convenience or at the request of the 
employee or the new appointee.
    (b) Isolated official stations--criteria. Under this section, an 
official station at an isolated location is a place of permanent duty 
assignment in the continental United States at which an employee has no 
alternative except to live where he/she is unable to use his/her 
household goods because:
    (1) The type of quarters he/she is required to occupy at the 
isolated permanent duty station will not accommodate his/her household 
goods; or
    (2) Residence quarters which would accommodate his/her household 
goods are not available within reasonable

[[Page 152]]

daily commuting distance of the official station. However, the 
designation of an official station as isolated in accordance with 
paragraph (c) of this section shall not preclude a determination in 
individual instances that adequate housing is available for some 
employees stationed there based on housing which may be available within 
daily commuting distance and the size and other characteristics of each 
employee's immediate family. In such instances, the station shall not be 
considered isolated with regard to those employees for whom adequate 
family housing is determined to be available.
    (c) Isolated official stations--designation. Heads of agencies 
concerned are responsible for designating the isolated official stations 
at which conditions exist for allowing nontemporary storage of household 
goods at Government expense for some or all employees.
    (d) Eligibility. Eligibility for nontemporary storage of household 
goods and personal effects applies to an employee stationed at an 
isolated official station, which meets the criteria in paragraph (b) of 
this section, who performed permanent change of station travel or travel 
as a new appointee.
    (e) Authorization. The authorization for nontemporary storage should 
be contained in the travel order or other document authorizing transfer 
or appointment at an isolated official station. However, storage may be 
approved subsequently if the employee or new appointee is otherwise 
eligible.
    (f) Allowable storage--(1) Place of storage. Under regulations 
prescribed by the head of the agency concerned, the property may be 
stored either in available Government-owned storage space or in suitable 
commercial or privately owned space obtained by the Government if 
Government-owned space is not available or if commercial or privately 
owned space is more economical or suitable because of location, 
difference of transportation costs, or for other reasons.
    (2) Allowable costs. Allowable costs for storing the property 
include the cost of necessary packing, crating, unpacking, uncrating, 
transportation to and from place of storage, charges while in storage, 
and other necessary charges directly relating to the storage.
    (3) Partial storage. An eligible employee or new appointee may be 
authorized to have a portion of his/her household goods transported to 
the isolated official station and to have the remainder stored at 
Government expense. However, the weight of the goods stored plus the 
weight of the goods transported shall not exceed the maximum applicable 
weight allowance for which the employee is eligible.
    (4) Changes in type of storage. Authority may be granted for the 
conversion of household goods from temporary to nontemporary storage and 
from storage at personal expense to nontemporary storage at Government 
expense.
    (g) Time limitations. Nontemporary storage shall be authorized for 
periods of time not exceeding 1 year and extended as necessary in 
accordance with the length of an employee's assignment at an isolated 
official station. Appropriate periodic review shall be made to determine 
whether current conditions at the isolated locality with regard to 
availability of housing warrant continuation of the authority for 
nontemporary storage. Eligibility for nontemporary storage at Government 
expense shall terminate on the employee's last day of active duty at the 
isolated official station. When an employee ceases to be eligible, 
nontemporary storage at Government expense may continue until the 
beginning of the second month after the month in which his eligibility 
terminates. However, the period of nontemporary storage shall not exceed 
3 years.

<R05>
Sec. 302-9.2  Nontemporary storage during assignment outside the continental United States.

    (a) Eligibility. Under regulations that may be prescribed by the 
head of the agency concerned, an employee stationed at an official 
station other than one located in the continental United States or an 
employee or new appointee transferred or appointed to such a station may 
be allowed nontemporary storage of his/her household goods while so 
assigned if:

[[Page 153]]

    (1) The official station is one to which he/she is not authorized to 
take, or at which he/she is unable to use, the household goods; or
    (2) The storage is authorized in the public interest; or
    (3) The estimated cost of storage would be less than the cost of 
round-trip transportation (including temporary storage) of the household 
goods to the new official station.
    (b) Authorization. Normally, the authorization for nontemporary 
storage shall be contained in the travel order or other document 
authorizing the employee's change of station or authorizing a new 
appointee to report to his/her official station. However, storage may be 
approved subsequently if the employee or new appointee would otherwise 
be eligible.
    (c) Allowable storage--(1) Place of storage. The property may be 
stored either in available Government-owned storage space or in suitable 
commercial or privately owned space if Government-owned space is not 
available or if commercial or privately owned space obtained by the 
Government is more economical or suitable because of location, 
difference of transportation costs, or other reasons.
    (2) Allowable costs. Allowable costs for storing the property 
include the cost of necessary packing, crating, unpacking, uncrating, 
transportation to and from place of storage, charges while in storage, 
and other necessary charges directly relating to the storage.
    (3) Partial storage. The employee or new appointee may be authorized 
to have a portion of his/her goods transported to the official station 
unless it is a station to which he/she is not authorized to take, or at 
which he/she is unable to use, any of the goods. However, the weight of 
the goods stored plus the weight of the goods transported shall not 
exceed the maximum applicable weight allowance for which the employee is 
eligible.
    (4) Change in type of storage. Authority may also be granted for the 
conversion of household goods from temporary to nontemporary storage at 
Government expense, and from storage at personal expense to nontemporary 
storage at Government expense, if the employee or new appointee is 
otherwise eligible.
    (d) Time limitations. Nontemporary storage at Government expense may 
be authorized for a period not to exceed the length of the employee's 
tour of duty at the overseas station plus 1 month prior to the time the 
tour begins. The storage period may be extended for subsequent service 
or tours of duty at the same or other overseas stations if the 
provisions of paragraph (a) of this section continue to be met. When an 
employee ceases to be eligible for the allowance, storage at Government 
expense may continue until the beginning of the second month after the 
month in which his/her eligibility terminates, unless to avoid inequity 
the agency extends the period. Eligibility shall be deemed to terminate 
on the last day of active duty at the overseas station.

Sec. 302-9.3  Storage during school recess for Department of Defense overseas teachers.

    (a) Description. The Department of Defense Overseas Teachers Pay and 
Personnel Practices Act (20 U.S.C. 905) provides authority for the 
storage of the household goods of Department of Defense overseas 
teachers during the recess period between 2 consecutive school years.
    (b) Regulations. Storage of household goods of Department of Defense 
overseas teachers may be allowed at Government expense under regulations 
prescribed by the Secretary of Defense in accordance with this part.
    (c) Authorization and conditions--(1) Authorization. Storage during 
the school recess should be authorized prior to the close of the school 
year. However, storage may be approved at a later date if all the 
required terms and conditions have been fulfilled.
    (2) Agreement. To be eligible for recess storage, a teacher serving 
at the close of a school year must agree in writing to serve as a 
teacher for the next school year.
    (3) Forfeited entitlements. The storage shall be instead of quarters 
or quarters allowance authorized by 20 U.S.C. 905 and any other storage 
of household goods to which the teacher might be

[[Page 154]]

entitled through employment in another position during any recess period 
between 2 school years.
    (d) Allowable storage--(1) Place of storage. The property may be 
stored either in available Government-owned space or in suitable 
commercial or privately owned space if Government-owned space is not 
available or if commercial or privately owned space obtained by the 
Government is more economical or suitable because of location, 
difference of transportation costs, or other reasons.
    (2) Allowable costs. Allowable costs for storing the property 
include the cost of necessary packing, crating, unpacking, uncrating, 
transportation to and from place of storage, charges while in storage, 
and other necessary charges directly relating to the storage.
    (3) Weight limitations. The weight of the household goods stored 
during the recess period shall not exceed the weight authorized for the 
employee less the weight of household goods stored under Sec. 302-9.2.
    (e) Time limitation. The period of storage shall not exceed the 
period of the recess between the 2 school years.
    (f) Breach of agreement. If the teacher does not report for service 
at the beginning of the next school year, except for reasons beyond his/
her control and acceptable to the Department of Defense, he/she shall be 
obligated to reimburse the Department in the amount paid by the 
Department for the commercial storage, including related services. If, 
however, the property was stored in a Government facility, the teacher 
shall pay the agency an amount equal to the reasonable value of the 
storage furnished, including related services.

    You will be reimbursed the transportation costs you actually incur, 
not to exceed what it would have cost to transport your POV from your 
authorized origin to the authorized destination.


<R05>
Sec. 302-10.208  If I retain my POV at my post of duty after conditions change to make use of the POV no longer in the interest of the Government, may I 
          transport it at Government expense from the post of duty at a 
          later date?

    Yes, your agency will pay the transportation costs not to exceed the 
cost of transporting it to the authorized destination, provided you 
otherwise meet all conditions for transportation of a POV.

Sec. 302-11.1  Authority.

    Payment of a relocation income tax (RIT) allowance is authorized to 
reimburse eligible transferred employees for substantially all of the 
additional Federal, State, and local income taxes incurred by the 
employee, or by the employee and spouse if a joint tax return is filed, 
as a result of certain travel and transportation expenses and relocation 
allowances which are furnished in kind, or for which reimbursement or an 
allowance is provided by the Government. Payment of the RIT allowance 
also is authorized for income taxes paid to the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. 
possessions in accordance with a decision of the Comptroller General of 
the United States (67 Comp. Gen. 135 (1987)). The RIT allowance shall be 
calculated and paid as provided in this part.

<R05>
Sec. 302-11.2  Coverage.

    (a) Eligible employees. Payment of a RIT allowance is authorized for 
employees transferred on or after November 14, 1983, in the interest of 
the Government from one official station to another for permanent duty. 
The effective date of an employee's transfer is the date the employee 
reports for duty at the new official station as provided in Sec. 302-
1.4(l).
    (b) Individuals not covered. The provisions of this part are not 
applicable to the following individuals or employees:
    (1) New appointees;
    (2) Employees assigned under the Government Employees Training Act 
(see 5 U.S.C. 4109); or
    (3) Employees returning from overseas assignments for the purpose of

<R05>
Sec. 302-11.3  Types of moving expenses or allowances covered and general limitations.

    The RIT allowance is limited by law as to the types of moving 
expenses that can be covered. The law authorizes reimbursement of 
additional income taxes resulting from certain moving expenses furnished 
in kind or for which reimbursement or an allowance is provided to the 
transferred employee by the Government. However, such moving expenses 
are covered by the RIT allowance only to the extent that they are 
actually paid or incurred, and are not allowable as a moving expense 
deduction for tax purposes. The types of expenses or allowances listed 
in paragraphs (a) through (i) of this section, are covered by the RIT 
allowance within the limitations discussed.
    (a) En route travel. Travel (including per diem) and transportation 
expenses of the transferred employee and immediate family for en route 
travel from the old official station to the new official station. (See 
part 302-2.)
    (b) Household goods shipment. Transportation (including temporary 
storage) expenses for movement of household goods from the old official 
station to the new official station. (See part 302-8.)
    (c) Nontemporary storage expenses. Allowable expenses for 
nontemporary storage of household goods belonging to an employee 
transferred on or after November 14, 1983, through October 11, 1984, to 
an isolated location in the continental United States. (See Sec. 302-
9.1.) Nontemporary storage expenses are not covered by the RIT allowance 
for transfers on or after October 12, 1984. (See Sec. 302-11.4(c).)
    (d) Mobile home movement. Expenses for the movement of a mobile home 
for use as a residence when movement is authorized instead of shipment 
and

[[Page 164]]

temporary storage of household goods. (See part 302-7.)
    (e) Househunting trip. Travel (including per diem) and 
transportation expenses of the employee and spouse for one round trip to 
the new official station to seek permanent residence quarters. (See part 
302-4.)
    (f) Temporary quarters. Subsistence expenses of the employee and 
immediate family during occupancy of temporary quarters. (See part 302-
5.)
    (g) Real estate expenses. Allowable expenses for the sale of the 
residence (or expenses of settlement of an unexpired lease) at the old 
official station and for purchase of a home at the new official station 
for which reimbursement is received by the employee. (See part 302-6.)
    (h) Miscellaneous expense allowance. A miscellaneous expense 
allowance for the purpose of defraying certain expenses associated with 
discontinuing a residence at one location and establishing a residence 
at the new location in connection with an authorized or approved 
permanent change of station. (See part 302-3.)
    (i) Relocation services. Payments, or portions thereof, made to a 
relocation service company for services provided to a transferred 
employee (see part 302-12), subject to the conditions stated in this 
paragraph and within the general limitations of this section applicable 
to other covered expenses.
    (1) For employees transferred on or after November 14, 1983, through 
October 11, 1984. The amount of a broker's fee or real estate 
commission, or other real estate sales transaction expenses which 
normally are reimbursable to the employee under Sec. 302-6.2 but have 
been paid by a relocation service company incident to an assigned sale 
from the employee, provided that such payments constitute income to the 
employee. For the purposes of this regulation, an assigned sale occurs 
when an employee obtains a binding agreement for the sale of his/her 
residence and assigns the inherent rights and obligations of that 
agreement to a relocation company that is providing services under 
contract with the employing agency. For example, if the employee incurs 
an obligation to pay a specified broker's fee or real estate commission 
under the terms of the sales agreement, this obligation along with the 
sales agreement is assigned to the relocation company and may, upon 
payment of the obligation by the relocation company, constitute income 
to the employee. (See Sec. 302-12.7 entitled ``Income tax consequences 
of using relocation companies.'')
    (2) For employees transferred on or after October 12, 1984. Expenses 
paid by a relocation company providing relocation services to the 
transferred employee pursuant to a contract with the employing agency to 
the extent such payments constitute income to the employee. (See 
Sec. 302-12.7.)

    Note: See reference shown in parentheses for reimbursement 
provisions for each allowance listed in paragraphs (a) through (i) of 
this section. See section 217 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Publication 521 entitled ``Moving 
Expenses'' and appropriate State and local tax authority publications 
for additional information on the taxability of moving expense 
reimbursements and the allowable tax deductions for moving expenses.

<R05>
Sec. 302-11.4  Exclusions from coverage.

    The provisions of this part are not applicable to the following:
    (a) Any tax liability that may result from payments by the 
Government to relocation companies on behalf of employees transferred on 
or after November 14, 1983, through October 11, 1984, other than the 
payments for those expenses specified in Sec. 302-11.3(i)(1).
    (b) Any tax liability incurred for local income taxes other than 
city income tax as a result of moving expense reimbursements for 
employees transferred on or after November 14, 1983, through October 11, 
1984. (See definition in Sec. 302-11.5(b).)
    (c) Any tax liability resulting from reimbursed expenses for any 
nontemporary storage of household goods except as specifically provided 
for in Sec. 302-11.3(c).
    (d) Any tax liability resulting from paid or reimbursed expenses for 
shipment of a privately owned automobile.
    (e) Any tax liability resulting from an excess of reimbursed amounts 
over the actual expense paid or incurred.

[[Page 165]]

For instance, if an employee's reimbursement for the movement of 
household goods is based on the commuted rate schedule and his/her 
actual moving expenses are less than the reimbursement, the tax 
liability resulting from the difference is not covered by the RIT 
allowance. (See Sec. 302-11.8(c)(2)(i).)
    (f) Any tax liability resulting from an employee's decision not to 
deduct moving expenses for which a tax deduction is allowable under the 
Internal Revenue Code or appropriate State and local tax codes. (See 
Secs. 302-11.8(b)(1) and 302-11.8(c)(2).)
    (g) Any tax liability resulting from the payment of recruitment, 
retention, or relocation bonuses authorized by the Office of Personnel 
Management pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5753 and 5754, or any other provisions 
which allow relocation payments that are not reimbursements for travel, 
transportation, and other expenses incurred in relocation.

<R05>
Sec. 302-11.5  Definitions and discussion of terms.

    For purposes of this part, the following definitions will apply:
    (a) State income tax. A tax, imposed by a State tax authority, that 
is deductible for Federal income tax purposes as a State income tax 
under section 164(a)(3) of the IRC. ``State'' means any one of the 
several States of the United States and the District of Columbia.
    (b) Local income tax. A tax, imposed by a recognized city or county 
tax authority, that is deductible for Federal income tax purposes as a 
local (city or county) income tax under section 164(a)(3) of the IRC; 
except, that for employees transferred on or after November 14, 1983, 
through October 11, 1984, local income tax shall be construed to mean 
only city income tax. For purposes of this regulation:
    (1) City means any unit of general local government which is 
classified as a municipality by the Bureau of the Census, or which is a 
town or township that in the determination of the Secretary of the 
Treasury possesses powers and performs functions comparable to those 
associated with municipalities, is closely settled, and contains within 
its boundaries no incorporated places as defined by the Bureau of the 
Census (31 CFR 215.2(b)(1)).
    (2) County means any unit of local general government which is 
classified as a county by the Bureau of the Census (31 CFR 215.2(e)).
    (c) Covered moving expense reimbursements or covered reimbursements. 
As used herein, these terms include those moving expenses listed in 
Sec. 302-11.3 as being covered by the RIT allowance and which may be 
furnished in kind, or for which reimbursement or an allowance is 
provided by the Government.
    (d) Covered taxable reimbursements. Covered moving expense 
reimbursements minus the tax deductions allowable under the IRC and IRS 
regulations for moving expenses. (See determination in Sec. 302-
11.8(c).)
    (e) Year 1 or reimbursement year. The calendar year in which 
reimbursement or payment for moving expenses is made to, or for, the 
employee under the provisions of this part. All or part of these 
reimbursements (see Sec. 302-11.6) are reported to the IRS as income 
(wages, salary, or other compensation) to the employee for that tax year 
under the provisions of the IRC and IRS regulations, and are subject to 
Federal tax withholding. The withholding tax allowance (WTA) (see 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section) is calculated in Year 1, to cover the 
employee's Federal tax withholding obligations each time covered moving 
expense reimbursements are made that result in a Federal tax withholding 
obligation. For purposes of this part, an advance of funds for any of 
the covered moving expenses is not considered to be a reimbursement or a 
payment until the travel voucher settlement for such expenses takes 
place. If an employee's reimbursement for moving expenses is spread over 
more than one year, he/she will have more than one Year 1.
    (f) Year 2. The calendar year in which a claim for the RIT allowance 
is paid.
    (1) Generally, Year 2 will be the calendar year immediately 
following Year 1 and in which the employee files a tax return reflecting 
his/her tax liability for income received in Year 1. However,

[[Page 166]]

there may be instances where the employee's claims submission and/or 
payment of the RIT allowance is delayed beyond the calendar year 
immediately following Year 1. (Year 1 will always be the calendar year 
that reimbursements are received; see paragraph (e) of this section.) 
Year 2 will be the calendar year in which the RIT allowance is actually 
paid.
    (2) The RIT allowance is calculated in Year 2 and paid to cover the 
additional tax liability (resulting from moving expense reimbursements 
received in Year 1) not covered by the WTA paid in Year 1. If an 
employee's covered taxable reimbursements are spread over more than one 
year, he/she will have more than one Year 2.
    (g) Federal withholding tax rate (FWTR). The tax rate applied to 
incremental income to determine the amount to be withheld for Federal 
income tax from salary or other compensation such as moving expense 
reimbursements. Because moving expense reimbursements constitute 
supplemental wages for Federal income tax purposes, the 20 percent flat 
rate of withholding is generally applicable to such reimbursements. (See 
Sec. 302-11.7(c).) Agencies should refer to the Treasury Financial 
Manual, TFM 3-5000, and applicable IRS regulations for complete and up-
to-date information on this subject.
    (h) Earned income. For purposes of the RIT allowance, ``earned 
income'' shall include only the gross compensation (salary, wages, or 
other compensation such as reimbursement for moving expenses and the 
related WTA (see paragraph (n) of this section) and any RIT allowance 
(see paragraph (m) of this section) paid for moving expense 
reimbursement in a prior year) that is reported as income on IRS Form W-
2 for the employee (employee and spouse, if filing jointly), and if 
applicable, the net earnings (or loss) for self-employment income shown 
on Schedule SE of the IRS Form 1040. Earned income may be from more than 
one source. (See Sec. 302-11.8(d).)
    (i) Marginal tax rate (MTR). The tax rate (for example, 33 percent) 
applicable to a specific increment of income. The Federal, Puerto Rico, 
and State marginal tax rates to be used in calculating the RIT allowance 
are provided in appendices A through D of this part. (See Sec. 302-
11.8(e)(3) of this part for instructions on local marginal tax rate 
determinations.)
    (j) Combined marginal tax rate (CMTR). A single rate determined by 
combining the applicable marginal tax rates for Federal (or Puerto Rico, 
when applicable), State, and local income taxes, using formulas provided 
in Sec. 302-11.8(e)(5).
    (k) Gross-up. Payment for the estimated additional income tax 
liability incurred by an employee as a result of reimbursements or 
payments by the Government for the covered moving expenses listed in 
Sec. 302-11.3.
    (l) Gross-up formulas. The formulas used to determine the amount of 
the gross-up for the WTA and the RIT allowance. The gross-up formulas 
used herein compensate the employee for the initial tax, the tax on tax, 
etc. Note that the WTA gross-up formula in Sec. 302-11.7(d) is different 
than the RIT gross-up formula prescribed in Sec. 302-11.8(f).
    (m) RIT allowance. The amount of payment computed and paid in Year 2 
to cover substantially all of the estimated additional tax liability 
incurred as a result of the covered moving expense reimbursements 
received in Year 1.
    (n) Withholding tax allowance (WTA). The withholding tax allowance 
(WTA), paid in Year 1, covers the employee's Federal income tax 
withholding liability on covered taxable reimbursements received in Year 
1. The amount is computed by applying the withholding gross-up formula 
prescribed in Sec. 302-11.7(d) (using the Federal withholding tax rate) 
each time that a Federal withholding obligation is incurred on covered 
moving expense reimbursements received in Year 1. Grossing-up the 
Federal withholding amount protects the employee from using part of his/
her moving expense reimbursement to pay Federal withholding taxes. (See 
Sec. 302-11.7.)
    (o) State gross-up. Payment for the estimated additional State 
income tax liability incurred by an employee as a result of 
reimbursements or payments by the Government for the covered moving 
expenses listed in Sec. 302-11.3 that

[[Page 167]]

are deductible for Federal income tax but not for State income tax 
purposes.
    (p) State gross-up formula. The formula prescribed in Sec. 302-
11.8(f)(3) to be used in determining the amount to be included in the 
RIT allowance to compensate an employee for the additional State income 
tax incurred in States that do not allow the deduction of moving 
expenses.

Sec. 302-11.6  Procedures in general.

    (a) This regulation sets forth procedures for the computation and 
payment of the RIT allowance and defines agency and employee 
responsibilities. This part does not require changes to those internal 
fiscal procedures established by the individual agencies pursuant to IRS 
regulations, or the Treasury Financial Manual, provided that the intent 
of the statute authorizing the RIT allowance and this part are not 
disturbed.
    (b) The total amount reimbursed or paid to the employee, or on his/
her behalf, for travel, transportation, and other relocation expenses 
and allowances is includable in the employee's gross income pursuant to 
the IRC and certain State or local government tax codes. Some moving 
expenses for which reimbursements are received may be deducted from 
income by the employee as moving expense deductions, subject to certain 
limitations prescribed by the IRS or pertinent State or local tax 
authorities. Reimbursements for nondeductible moving expenses are 
subject to income tax. (See IRS Publication 521 entitled ``Moving 
Expenses'' and the appropriate State and local tax codes for detailed 
information.)
    (c) Usually, if the employee is reimbursed for nondeductible moving 
expenses, the amount of these reimbursements is subject to withholding 
of Federal income tax in accordance with IRS regulations at the time of 
reimbursement. Under existing fiscal procedures, the amount of the 
employee's withholding obligation is usually deducted either from 
reimbursements for the moving expenses at the time of reimbursement or 
from the employee's salary. (See Treasury Financial Manual.)
    (d) Payment of a WTA established herein will offset deductions for 
the Federal income tax withholding on moving expense reimbursements, and 
on the WTA itself, from the employee's moving expense reimbursements or 
from salary.
    (e) The total amount of the RIT allowance can be computed after the 
end of Year 1 as soon as the earned income level, income tax filing 
status, total covered taxable reimbursements, and the applicable 
marginal tax rates can be determined. Employee claims for the RIT 
allowance should be submitted in accordance with this part and the 
employing agency's procedures.
    (f) Procedures are prescribed in Secs. 302-11.7 and 302-11.8 for 
computation and payment of the WTA and the RIT allowance. These 
procedures are built on existing fiscal procedures and IRS regulations 
regarding reporting of employee income from reimbursements and 
withholding of taxes on supplemental wages.

Sec. 302-11.7  Procedures for determining the WTA in Year 1.

    (a) General rules. The WTA is designed to cover only the employee's 
withholding tax obligation for Federal income taxes on income resulting 
from covered moving expense reimbursements. (See definition in Sec. 302-
11.5(c).) Other withholding tax obligations, if any, such as for social 
security taxes or for State and/or local income taxes on income 
resulting from moving expense reimbursements shall not be included in 
the calculation of the WTA payment. The amount of the WTA is equal to 
the Federal income tax withholding obligation incurred by the employee 
on covered moving expense reimbursements (which are not offset by 
deductible moving expenses) and on the WTA itself. Each time covered 
moving expense reimbursements are paid to or on behalf of the employee, 
the WTA shall be calculated, accounted for, and reported as provided in 
paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section.
    (b) Determination of amount of reimbursement subject to withholding. 
Under

[[Page 168]]

IRS regulations, income resulting from reimbursements for nondeductible 
moving expenses is subject to withholding of Federal income taxes. (See 
IRS Publication 521, ``Moving Expenses.'') There are some moving 
expenses which may be reimbursed but are not covered taxable 
reimbursements (see definition in Sec. 302-11.5(d)) for purposes of the 
WTA and RIT allowance calculations, such as nontemporary storage of 
household goods. (See exclusions in Sec. 302-11.4.) Therefore, the 
actual amount of the covered taxable reimbursements may be different 
than the amount of nondeductible moving expenses subject to Federal 
income tax withholding. The difference in these amounts should not be 
substantial; therefore, the amount of nondeductible moving expenses 
subject to Federal income tax withholding, as determined by the agency 
pursuant to IRS regulations, may be used in calculating the WTA. (Note 
that the RIT calculation procedure in Sec. 302-11.8 requires 
determination of covered taxable reimbursements.)
    (c) Determination of Federal withholding tax rate (FWTR). Moving 
expense reimbursements constitute supplemental wages for Federal income 
tax purposes. Therefore, an agency must withhold at the withholding rate 
applicable to supplemental wages. Currently, the supplemental wages 
withholding rate is 28 percent. The supplemental wages withholding rate 
should be used in calculating the WTA unless under an agency's 
withholding procedures a different withholding rate is used pursuant to 
IRS tax regulations. In such cases, the applicable withholding rate 
shall be substituted for the supplemental wages withholding rate in the 
calculation shown in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) Calculation of the WTA. The WTA is calculated by substituting 
the amounts determined in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section into 
the following WTA gross-up formula:

    Formula:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR10MR97.022
    
    Where:
    Y = WTA
    X = FWTR (generally, 28 percent)
    N = nondeductible moving expenses/covered taxable reimbursements
    Example:
    If:
    X = 28 percent
    N = $20,000
    Then:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR10MR97.023
    
    Y = .3889($20,000)
    Y = $7778.00

    (e) WTA payment and employee agreement for repayment. (1) The WTA 
may be calculated several times within Year 1 if reimbursements for 
moving expenses are made on more than one travel voucher. Each time an 
employee is reimbursed for moving expenses which are subject to Federal 
tax withholding in accordance with the IRS regulations, the WTA will be 
calculated and paid unless the employee fails to comply with the 
requirements in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (2) The employee shall be required to agree in writing to repay any 
excess amount paid to him/her in Year 1 (see Secs. 302-11.8(f)(5) and 
302-11.9(b)(3)), and submit the required certified tax information and 
claim for his/her RIT allowance within a reasonable length of time (as 
determined by the agency) after the close of Year 1. Failure of the 
employee to comply with this requirement will preclude the agency's 
payment of the WTA. The entire WTA will be considered an excess payment 
if the RIT allowance claim is not submitted in a timely manner to settle 
the RIT allowance account.
    (f) Determination of employee's withholding tax on WTA. Since the 
amount of the WTA is considered income to the employee, it is subject to 
the same tax withholding requirements as all other moving expense 
reimbursements. (See Treasury Financial Manual, Section 4080, Moving 
Expense Reimbursements, for withholding requirements.)
    (g) End of year reporting. At the end of the year, agencies 
generally are required to issue IRS Form(s) W-2 for each employee 
showing total gross compensation (including moving expense 
reimbursements) and the applicable amount of Federal taxes withheld. For 
tax reporting purposes, the

[[Page 169]]

WTA is to be treated as a moving expense reimbursement. The total amount 
of the employee's WTA's paid during the year as well as the amount of 
moving expense reimbursements should be included as income on the 
employee's Form W-2. The Federal tax withholding amount applicable to 
the moving expense reimbursements and the WTA should also be included on 
the employee's Form W-2. The amount of the WTA's also will be furnished 
to the employee along with the amount of moving expense reimbursements 
on IRS Form 4782 or another itemized listing provided for the employee's 
use in preparing his/her tax return (see IRS regulations for further 
guidance) and in claiming the RIT allowance as provided in Sec. 302-
11.8.

<R05>
Sec. 302-11.8  Rules and procedures for determining the RIT allowance in Year 2.

    (a) Summary/overview of procedures. The RIT allowance will be 
calculated and claimed in Year 2. This can be accomplished as soon as 
the employee can determine earned income (as defined herein), income tax 
filing status, covered taxable reimbursements for Year 1, and the 
applicable marginal tax rates. The RIT allowance is then calculated 
using the gross-up formula under procedures prescribed herein. Since the 
RIT allowance is considered income, appropriate withholding taxes on the 
RIT allowance are deducted and the balance constitutes the net payment 
to the employee. Rules, procedures, and the prescribed tax tables for 
these calculations are provided in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this 
section, and in appendices A, B, and C of this part.
    (b) General rules and assumptions. (1) The procedures prescribed 
herein for calculations and payment of the RIT allowance are based on 
certain assumptions jointly developed by GSA and IRS, and tax tables 
developed by IRS. This approach avoids a potentially controversial and 
administratively burdensome procedure requiring the employee to furnish 
extensive documentation, such as certified copies of actual tax returns 
and reconstructed returns, in support of a claim for a RIT allowance 
payment. Specifically, the following assumptions have been made:
    (i) The employee will claim allowable moving expense deductions for 
the same tax year in which the corresponding moving expense 
reimbursements are included in income;
    (ii) Changes to the IRC, applicable to the 1987 and subsequent tax 
years, require that allowable moving expense deductions must be taken as 
an itemized deduction from gross income rather than as an adjustment to 
gross income as in previous tax years. It is assumed that employees will 
receive the benefit of allowable moving expense deductions to offset 
income either by itemizing their moving expense deductions or through 
the increased standard deductions.
    (iii) Prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986, it was assumed that the 
employee's (and spouse's, if a joint return is filed) earned income, 
filing status, and CMTR determined for Year 1 (and used in determining 
the RIT allowance in Year 2) would remain the same or would not be 
substantially different in the second and subsequent tax years. However, 
the Tax Reform Act of 1986 substantially changed the Federal tax 
structure making it necessary to compute a separate CMTR for Year 1 and 
for Year 2. (See paragraph (e) of this section.) The formula for 
calculating the RIT allowance to be paid in 1988 and subsequent years is 
shown in paragraph (f) of this section. It is assumed that within the 
accuracy of the calculation, the State and local tax rates for Year 1 
and Year 2 will remain the same or will not be substantially different. 
Therefore, the State and local tax rates for Year 1 shall be used in 
calculating the CMTR for Year 2.
    (2) The prescribed procedures, which yield an estimate of an 
employee's additional tax liability due to moving expense 
reimbursements, are to be used uniformly. They are not to be adjusted to 
accommodate an employee's unique circumstance which may differ from the 
assumed circumstances stated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (3) An adjustment of the RIT allowance paid in Year 2 for the 
covered taxable reimbursements received in Year 1

[[Page 170]]

is required if the tax information certified to on the RIT allowance 
claim is different than that shown on the actual Federal tax return 
filed with IRS for Year 1 or changed for any reason after filing of the 
tax return, so as to affect the CMTR's used in the RIT allowance 
calculation. (See Sec. 302-11.10 for claims procedures.)
    (c) Determination of covered taxable reimbursements. (1) Generally, 
the amount of the covered taxable reimbursements is the difference 
between (i) the amount of covered moving expense reimbursements for the 
allowances listed in Sec. 302-11.3 that was included in the employee's 
income in Year 1, and (ii) the maximum amount of allowable moving 
expenses that may be claimed as a moving expense deduction by the 
employee on his/her Federal tax return under IRS tax regulations to 
offset the income resulting from moving expense reimbursements for Year 
1. The covered taxable reimbursements will be determined as if the 
employee had itemized and deducted all allowable moving expense 
deductions. (See assumption made in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this 
section.) If the employee is precluded from claiming moving expense 
deductions because he/she does not meet IRS requirements for the 
distance test, then the amount of covered taxable reimbursements is the 
same as the amount of covered moving expense reimbursements. (See 
Sec. 302-11.5(d).)
    (2) For purposes of calculating the RIT allowance, the following 
special rules apply to the determination of moving expense deductions to 
offset moving expense reimbursements reported as income:
    (i) The total amount of reimbursement (which was reported as income) 
for the expenses of en route travel for the employee and family (see 
Sec. 302-11.3(a)) and transportation (including up to 30 days temporary 
storage) of household goods (see Sec. 302-11.3(b)) to the new official 
station shall be used as a moving expense deduction. (See also Sec. 302-
11.4 (e) and (f).)
    (ii) The total amount of reimbursement for a househunting trip, 
temporary quarters (up to 30 days at new station) and real estate 
transaction expenses (see Sec. 302-11.3 (e), (f), (g), and (i)), up to 
the maximum allowable deduction under IRS tax regulations, shall be used 
as a moving expense deduction. For example, an employee and spouse 
filing a joint return and residing in the same household at the end of 
the tax year may deduct up to $3,000 for these expenses. (No more than 
$1,500 of the $3,000 may be claimed for a househunting trip and 
temporary quarters expenses combined.) If the employee was reimbursed 
$1,350 for a househunting trip and temporary quarters expenses and 
$9,000 for real estate expenses, the moving expense deductions would be 
$1,350 for the househunting trip and temporary quarters expenses and 
$1,650 for real estate expenses. If the employee's reimbursement was 
$1,850 for the househunting trip and temporary quarters expenses and 
$9,000 for real estate expenses, the moving expense deductions would be 
$1,500 for the househunting trip and temporary quarters expenses and 
$1,500 for real estate expenses. If the employee had no reimbursement 
for a househunting trip and temporary quarters, the full $3,000 would be 
applied to the $9,000 reimbursement for real estate expenses. (See IRS 
Publication 521, ``Moving Expenses,'' for these and other maximums which 
vary by situation and filing status.)
    (3) Procedures and examples are provided herein as if all moving 
expense reimbursements are received in one year with all moving expense 
deductions applied in that same year to arrive at the covered taxable 
reimbursements. However, when reimbursements span more than one year, 
the amount of covered taxable reimbursements must be determined 
separately for each reimbursement year (Year 1). The maximum moving 
expense deductions apply to the entire move. Under IRS tax regulations, 
the employee has some discretion as to when he/she claims these 
deductions (e.g., in the year of the move when the expense was paid or 
in the year of reimbusement, if these actions do not occur in the same 
year). However, for purposes of the RIT allowance procedures, the moving 
expense deductions will be applied in the year that the corresponding 
reimbursement is made. For example, if an employee incurred and was 
reimbursed $1,000 for a househunting trip and temporary

[[Page 171]]

quarters in 1989 and an additional $1,000 for temporary quarters in 
1990, this employee, according to his/her particular situation and tax 
filing status, may deduct $1,500 of these expenses in moving expense 
deductions. In calculating the RIT allowance for 1989, $1,000 of the 
$1,500 deduction is used to offset the $1,000 reimbursement in 1989 
resulting in zero covered taxable reimbursements for the househunting 
trip and temporary quarters for 1989. The remaining $500 (balance of the 
$1,500 not used in determining covered taxable reimbursements for 1989) 
will be used to offset the $1,000 temporary quarters reimbursement in 
1990 (second Year 1), leaving $500 of the temporary quarters 
reimbursement as a covered taxable reimbursement for 1990.
    (4) Although the WTA amount is included in income (see Sec. 302-
11.7), it shall not be included in the amount of covered taxable 
reimbursements. Under the procedures and formulas established herein, 
the proper amount of the RIT allowance is calculated using the RIT 
gross-up formula with the WTA and any prior RIT allowance payments 
excluded from covered taxable reimbursements.
    (5) Agencies are cautioned that there may be moving expenses 
reimbursed to the employee that are not covered by the RIT allowance. 
(See exclusions in Sec. 302-11.4; also see discussion in Sec. 302-11.7 
regarding covered taxable reimbursements versus nondeductible expenses.)
    (d) Determination of income level and filing status. In order to 
determine the CMTR's needed to calculate the RIT allowance, the employee 
must determine the appropriate amount of earned income (as prescribed 
herein) that was or will be reported on his/her Federal tax return for 
the tax year in which the covered taxable reimbursements were received 
(Year 1). Such amount will also include the spouse's earned income if a 
joint filing status is claimed. For purposes of this regulation, 
appropriate earned income shall include only the amount of gross 
compensation reported on IRS Form(s) W-2, and, if applicable, the net 
earnings (or loss) from self-employment income as shown on Schedule SE 
of IRS Form 1040. (See Sec. 302-11.5(h).) (Note that moving expense 
reimbursements including the WTA amounts and any RIT allowance paid for 
a prior Year 1 are to be included in earned income and should be shown 
as income on the Form W-2; if they are not, other appropriate 
documentation shall be furnished by the agency.) (See Sec. 302-11.7(g).) 
The amount of earned income as determined under this paragraph and the 
tax filing status (for example, from lines 1 through 5 on the 1987 IRS 
Form 1040) shall be contained in a certified statement on, or attached 
to, the voucher claiming the RIT allowance. (See Sec. 302-11.10.) If a 
joint filing status is claimed and the spouse's earned income is 
included, the spouse must sign the certified statement. If the spouse 
does not sign the statement, earned income will include only the 
employee's earned income and the RIT allowance will be calculated on 
that basis. This condition will not apply if an employee is allowed, 
under IRS rules, to file a joint return as a surviving spouse.
    (e) Determination of the CMTR's. The gross-up formula used to 
calculate the RIT allowance in paragraph (f) of this section, requires 
the use of two CMTR's--one for Year 1 in which reimbursements were 
received and the other for Year 2 in which the RIT allowance is paid. 
CMTR's are single tax rates calculated to represent the Federal, State, 
and/or local income tax rates applicable to the earned income determined 
for Year 1. (See paragraph (d) of this section.) The CMTR's will be 
determined as follows:
    (1) Federal marginal tax rates. The Federal marginal tax rates for 
Year 1 and Year 2 are determined by using the income level and filing 
status determined under paragraph (d) of this section and contained in 
the certified statement by the employee (or employee and spouse) on the 
RIT allowance claim, and applying the prescribed Federal tax tables 
contained in appendices A and C of this part. For example, if the income 
level for the 1989 tax year (Year 1) was $84,100 for a married employee 
filing a Federal joint return, the Federal marginal tax rate would be 33 
percent for Year 1 (1989) (see appendix A of this part) and 28 percent 
for Year 2 (1990) (see appendix C of this part). These rates would be 
used regardless of how much of the $84,100

[[Page 172]]

was attributable to reimbursement for the employee's relocation 
expenses.

    Note: These marginal rates are different from the withholding tax 
rate used for WTA.


If the employee incurs only Federal income tax (i.e., there are no State 
or local taxes), the Federal marginal tax rates determined from 
appendices A and C of this part are the CMTR's to be used in the RIT 
gross-up formula provided in Sec. 302-11.8(f). In such cases, the 
provisions of paragraphs (e) (2) and (3) of this section do not apply.
    (2) State marginal tax rate. (i) If the employee incurs an 
additional State income tax (see definition in Sec. 302-11.5(a)) 
liability as a result of moving expense reimbursements, the appropriate 
State tax table in appendix B of this part is to be used to determine 
the applicable State marginal tax rate that will be substituted into the 
formula for determining the CMTR for both Year 1 and Year 2. The 
appropriate State tax table will be the one that corresponds to the tax 
year in which the reimbursements are paid to the employee (Year 1). The 
income level determined in paragraph (d) of this section for Federal 
taxes shall be used to identify the appropriate income bracket in the 
State tax table. The applicable State marginal tax rate is obtained from 
the selected income bracket column for the State where the employee is 
required to pay State income tax on moving expense reimbursements. The 
tax rates shown in the table apply to all employees regardless of their 
filing status, except where a separate rate is shown for a single filing 
status.
    (ii) The lowest income bracket shown in the State tax tables in 
appendix B of this part is $20,000-$24,999. In cases where the 
employee's (employee's and spouse's, if filing jointly) earned income as 
determined under paragraph (d) of this section is less than this income 
bracket, an appropriate State marginal tax rate shall be established by 
the employing agency from the applicable State tax code or regulations 
issued pursuant thereto. Such State marginal tax rate shall be 
representative of the earned income level in question but in no case 
more than the marginal tax rate established in appendix B of this part 
for the $20,000-$24,999 income bracket for the particular State in which 
an additional tax obligation has been incurred.
    (iii) The prescribed State marginal tax rates generally are 
expressed as a percent of taxable income. However, if the applicable 
State marginal tax rate is stated as a percentage of the Federal income 
tax liability, the State tax rate must be converted to a percent of 
taxable income to be used in the CMTR formulas in paragraph (e)(5) of 
this section. This is accomplished by multiplying the applicable Federal 
tax rate for Year 1 by the applicable State tax rate. For example, if 
the Federal tax rate is 33 percent for Year 1 and the State tax rate is 
25 percent of the Federal income tax liability, the State tax rate 
stated as a percent of taxable income would be 8.25 percent. The State 
tax rate thus determined for Year 1 will be used in determining the CMTR 
for both Year 1 and Year 2.
    (iv) An employee may incur a State income tax liability on moving 
expense reimbursements in more than one State at the same or different 
marginal tax rates (i.e., double taxation). For example, an employee may 
incur taxes on moving expense reimbursements in one State because of 
residency in that State, and in another State because that particular 
State taxes income earned within its jurisdiction irrespective of 
whether the employee is a resident. In such cases, a single State 
marginal tax rate must be determined for use in the CMTR formulas in 
paragraph (e)(5) of this section. The general rules in paragraph 
(e)(2)(iv) (A) through (C) of this section apply in determining the 
applicable single State marginal tax rate in such cases.
    (A) If two or more States impose an income tax on an employee's 
moving expense reimbursement, but no two States tax the same portion of 
the reimbursement, then the reimbursement is not subject to double 
taxation. In this situation, the average of the applicable State 
marginal tax rates, as determined under paragraphs (e)(2) (i) through 
(iii) of this section, shall be treated as being imposed on the entire 
reimbursement, and shall be used in the CMTR formula.

[[Page 173]]

    (B) If two or more States impose an income tax on the moving expense 
reimbursement, and more than one State taxes the same portion of the 
reimbursement, but those States allow an adjustment or credit for income 
taxes paid to the other State(s), then the reimbursement is not subject 
to double taxation. In this situation, the highest of the applicable 
State marginal tax rates, as determined under paragraphs (e)(2) (i) 
through (iii) of this section, shall be used in the CMTR formula.
    (C) If two or more States impose an income tax on the moving expense 
reimbursement, and more than one State taxes the same portion of the 
reimbursement without allowing an adjustment or credit for income taxes 
paid to the other, then the reimbursement is subject to double taxation. 
In this situation, the sum of the applicable State marginal tax rates, 
as determined under paragraphs (e)(2) (i) through (iii) of this section, 
shall be used in the CMTR formula.
    (3) Local marginal tax rate. Because of the impracticality of 
establishing a single marginal tax rate table for local income taxes 
that could be applied uniformly on a nationwide basis, appropriate local 
marginal tax rates shall be determined as provided in paragraphs (e)(3) 
(i) through (iii) of this section.
    (i) If the employee incurs an additional local income tax (see 
definition Sec. 302-11.5(b)) liability as a result of moving expense 
reimbursements, he/she shall certify to such fact when claiming the RIT 
allowance (see certification statement in Sec. 302-11.10) by specifying 
the name of the locality imposing the income tax and the applicable 
marginal tax rate determined from the actual marginal tax rate table or 
schedule prescribed by the taxing locality. The marginal tax rate shall 
be the one applicable to the taxable income portion of the amount of 
earned income determined under paragraph (d) of this section for the 
employee (and spouse, if filing jointly). The same tax rate shall be 
used in calculating the CMTR for both Year 1 and Year 2. The employing 
agency shall establish procedures to determine whether the employee-
certified local marginal tax rate is appropriate for the employee's 
income level and filing status and approve its use in the CMTR formulas. 
(See also Sec. 302-11.10(b)(2).)
    (ii) If the local marginal tax rate is stated as a percentage of 
Federal or State income tax liability, such rate must be converted to a 
percent of taxable income for use in the CMTR formulas. This is 
accomplished by multiplying the applicable Federal or State tax rate for 
Year 1 as determined in paragraph (e) (1) or (2) of this section by the 
applicable local tax rate. For example, if the State tax rate for Year 1 
is 6 percent and the local tax rate is 50 percent of State income tax 
liability, the local tax rate stated as a percentage of taxable income 
would be 3 percent. The local tax rate thus determined for Year 1 will 
be used in determining the CMTR for both Year 1 and Year 2.
    (iii) The situations described in paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this 
section with respect to State income taxes may also be encountered with 
local income taxes. If such situations do occur, the rules prescribed 
for determining the single State marginal tax rate shall also be applied 
to determine the single local marginal tax rate for use in the CMTR 
formulas.
    (4) Marginal tax rates for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. possessions--
(i) The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. A Federal employee who is relocated 
to or from a point, or between points, in the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico may be subject to income tax on the employee's salary (including 
moving expense reimbursements) by both the U.S. Government and the 
government of Puerto Rico. However, under the current law of Puerto 
Rico, such employee receives a credit on his/her Puerto Rico income tax 
for the amount of taxes paid to the United States. The rules in 
paragraphs (e)(4)(i) (A) through (C) apply in determining the marginal 
tax rate applicable for transfers to, from, or between points in Puerto 
Rico.
    (A) The applicable Puerto Rico marginal tax rate shall be determined 
by using the income level determined in paragraph (d) of this section 
for Federal taxes and the employee's filing status. The Puerto Rico 
marginal tax

[[Page 174]]

rate for Year 1 will be used in computing the CMTR for both Year 1 and 
Year 2. The Puerto Rico tax tables are contained in appendix D of this 
part.
    (B) If the applicable Puerto Rico marginal tax rate is higher than 
the applicable Federal marginal tax rate, then the total amount of taxes 
paid by the employee to both jurisdictions is equal to the employee's 
total income tax liability to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico before any 
credit is given for taxes paid to the United States. The Federal 
marginal tax rate, therefore, is of no consequence and will be 
disregarded. In such cases, the formula in paragraph (e)(5)(iii) of this 
section will be used to compute the CMTR. The CMTR formula shall include 
only the Puerto Rico marginal tax rate, the State marginal tax rate as 
determined under paragraph (e)(2) of this section (when applicable), and 
the local marginal tax rate as determined under paragraph (e)(3) of this 
section. For purposes of applying the Puerto Rico CMTR formula in 
paragraph (e)(5)(iii) of this section, the State marginal tax rate will 
be applicable if both Puerto Rico and one or more of the States impose 
an income tax on the moving expense reimbursement, and more than one of 
these entities taxes the same portion of the reimbursement without 
allowing an adjustment or credit for income taxes paid to the other. In 
this situation, the S component of the CMTR formula will be the 
applicable State marginal tax rate as determined under paragraph (e)(2) 
of this section.
    (C) If the applicable Puerto Rico marginal tax rate is equal to or 
lower than the applicable Federal marginal tax rate, then the total 
amount of taxes paid by the employee to both jurisdictions is equal to 
the employee's total Federal income tax liability. The Puerto Rico 
marginal tax rate, therefore, is of no consequence in such cases and 
will be disregarded. The CMTR will be computed using the formula in 
paragraphs (e)(5) (i) and (ii) of this section. This formula will 
include the Federal marginal tax rate as determined under paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section, the State marginal tax rate as determined under 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section (when applicable), and the local 
marginal tax rate as determined under paragraph (e)(3) of this section. 
The State marginal tax rate will be applicable if one or more States 
impose tax on the moving expense reimbursement.
    (ii) The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. 
possessions. A Federal employee who is relocated to or from a point, or 
between points, in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or 
the U.S. possessions (Guam, American Samoa, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) 
is subject to both Federal income tax and income tax assessed by the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or the U.S. possession, as 
applicable. However, the income tax system and rates for the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and for the U.S. 
possessions are identical to the U.S. Federal income tax system and 
rates. This constitutes a ``mirror tax'' system. A tax credit or 
exclusion is provided by one of the taxing jurisdictions (either the 
U.S., the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the U.S. 
possession, as appropriate) to prevent double taxation. The marginal tax 
rate for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or the U.S. 
possession, therefore, is of no consequence since it is identical to the 
Federal marginal income tax rate and is completely offset by a 
corresponding credit or exclusion. Thus, the Commonwealth's or the 
possession's tax rate will not be factored into the CMTR formula. The 
CMTR will be computed as provided in paragraphs (e)(5) (i) and (ii) 
based solely on the Federal marginal tax rate; when applicable, the 
State(s) marginal tax rate; and the local marginal tax rate.
    (5) Calculation of the CMTR's. As stated above, the gross-up formula 
for calculating the RIT allowance requires the use of two CMTR's. 
However, the required CMTR's cannot be calculated by merely adding the 
Federal, State, and local marginal tax rates together because of the 
deductibility of State and local income taxes from income for Federal 
income tax purposes. The State tax tables prescribed in appendix B of 
this part are designed to use the same income amount as that determined 
for the Federal taxes, which reflects, among other things, State and 
local tax deductions. The formulas prescribed below for calculating the

[[Page 175]]

CMTR's are designed to adjust the State and local tax rates to 
compensate for their deductibility from income for Federal tax purposes.
    (i) Calculation of the CMTR for Year 1. The following formula shall 
be used to calculate the CMTR for Year 1.

CMTR Formula: X = F + (1 - F)S + (1 - F)L

Where:

    X = CMTR for Year 1
    F = Federal tax rate for Year 1
    S = State tax rate for Year 1
    L = Local tax rate for Year 1

    (A) Federal, State, and local taxes incurred. If the employee incurs 
Federal, State, and local income taxes on moving expense reimbursements, 
the CMTR formula may be solved as follows:

Example:

If:

    F=33 percent of income
    S=6 percent of income
    L=3 percent of income

Then:

    X=.33+(1.00-.33).06+(1.00-.33).03
    X=.3903

    (B) Federal and State income taxes only. If the employee incurs tax 
liability on moving expense reimbursements for Federal and State income 
taxes but none for local income tax, the value of ``L'' is zero and the 
CMTR formula may be solved as follows:

Example:

If:

    F=33 percent of income
    S=6 percent of income
    L=Zero

Then:

    X=.33+(1.00-.33).06
    X=.3702

    (C) Federal and local income taxes only. If the employee incurs a 
tax liability on moving expense reimbursements for Federal and local 
income taxes but none for State income tax, the value of ``S'' is zero 
and the CMTR formula may be solved as follows:

Example:

If:

    F=33 percent of income
    S=Zero
    L=3 percent of income

Then:

    X=.33+(1.00-.33).03
    X=.3501

    (ii) Calculation of the CMTR for Year 2. The calculation of the CMTR 
for Year 2 is the same as described for Year 1, except that the Federal 
tax rate for Year 2 is used in place of the Federal tax rate for Year 1. 
State and local tax rates remain the same as for Year 1. The following 
formula shall be used to determine the CMTR for Year 2:

CMTR Formula: W=F+(1-F)S+(1-F)L

Where:

    W=CMTR for Year 2
    F=Federal tax rate for Year 2
    S=State tax rate for Year 1
    L=local tax rate for Year 1

    (iii) Calculation of CMTR's for Puerto Rico. The following formula 
shall be used to calculate the CMTR for transfers to, from, or between 
points in Puerto Rico. (This formula is different from the formulas 
provided in paragraphs (e)(5) (i) and (ii) of this section since the 
Federal marginal tax rate is disregarded.)

CMTR Formula: X = P + S + L

Where:

    X = CMTR for Year 1 and Year 2
    P = Puerto Rico tax rate for Year 1
    S = State tax rate for Year 1, when applicable (See Sec. 302-
11.8(e)(4)(i)(B).)
    L = Local tax rate for Year 1

    (f) Determination of the RIT allowance. The RIT allowance to cover 
the tax liability on additional income resulting from the covered 
taxable reimbursements received in Year 1 is calculated in Year 2 as 
provided below:
    (1) The RIT allowance is calculated by substituting the amount of 
covered taxable reimbursements for Year 1, the CMTR's for Year 1 and 
Year 2, and the total amount of the WTA's paid in Year 1 into the gross-
up formula as follows:

 
 
                         X                             1-X
    Z         =    ------------    (R)        -    -----------    (Y)
                        1-W                            1-W
 .......

Where:

    Z=RIT allowance payable in Year 2
    X=CMTR for Year 1
    W=CMTR for Year 2
    R=covered taxable reimbursements
    Y=total WTA's paid in Year 1

Example:

If:


[[Page 176]]


    X=.3903
    W=.3448
    R=$21,800
    Y=$5,450

Then:
     

 
             .3903                             1.00-.3903
  Z=   -----------------   ($21,800)     -  ----------------   ($5,450)
           1.00-.3448                          1.00-.3448
 

    Z=.5957 ($21,800)-.9306 ($5,450)
    Z=$12,986.26-$5,071.77
    Z=$7,914.49

    (2) There may be instances when a WTA was not paid in Year 1 at the 
time moving expense reimbursements were made. In cases where there is no 
WTA to be deducted, the value of ``Y'' is zero and the formula stated in 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section for calculating the amount of the RIT 
allowance (Z) due the employee in Year 2 may be solved as shown in the 
following example:

Example:

If:

    X=.3903
    W=.3448
    R=$21,800
    Y=Zero

Then:

     

 
                                     .3903
      Z             =      ------------------------       ($21,800)
                                  1.00-.3448
 ...........

    Z=.5957 ($21,800)
    Z=$12,986.26

    (3) Certain States do not allow the deduction of all or part of the 
covered moving expenses that are deductible for Federal income tax 
purposes. The State gross-up to cover the additional State income tax 
liability resulting from the covered moving expense reimbursements 
received in Year 1 that are deductible for Federal income tax purposes 
but not for State income tax purposes is calculated in Year 2 as 
follows:
    (i) The State gross-up is calculated by substituting the amount of 
covered moving expense reimbursements that are deductible for Federal 
income tax purposes but not for State income tax purposes, the Federal 
tax rate for Year 1, the State tax rate for Year 1, and the combined 
marginal tax rate for Year 2 into the State gross-up formula as follows:

Formula:


 
                                         S(1-F)
                              A = ------------------- N
                                          1-W
 

Where:

    A=State gross-up
    F=Federal tax rate for Year 1
    S=State tax rate for Year 1
    W=CMTR for Year 2
    N=covered moving expense reimbursements that are deductible for 
Federal income tax purposes but not for State income tax purposes

Example:

If:

    F=.33
    S=.06
    W=.3448
    N=$9,250

Then:


 
                                    .06(1-.33)
                              A = -------------  $9,250
                                     1-.3448
 

    A=.0614 ($9,250)
    A=$567.95

    (ii) Add the State gross-up to the RIT allowance amount as 
calculated using the formula in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. The 
result is the RIT allowance adjusted for those States that do not allow 
moving expense deductions.

Example:

 
 
 
RIT allowance payable in Year 1.............................   $7,914.49
Plus adjustment factor......................................     +567.95
 
                                                             -----------
    Total...................................................   $8,482.44
 

    (4) If the amount of the RIT allowance is greater than zero, it is 
payable to the employee on the travel voucher as a relocation or moving 
expense allowance. The RIT allowance amount is included in the 
employee's gross income for Year 2 and, therefore, subject to 
appropriate withholding taxes. (See net payment to employee in paragraph 
(g) of this section.) The RIT allowance amount will be reported on IRS 
Form W-2 for Year 2 (including applicable income tax withholding 
amounts) and on IRS Form 4782 for the employee's information.
    (5) If the calculation of the RIT allowance results in a negative 
amount, the employee is obligated to repay this amount as a debt due the 
Government. (See Secs. 302-11.7(e)(2) and 302-11.9(b).)

[[Page 177]]

    (6) Any changes to the employee's income level or filing status for 
Year 1 that would affect the marginal tax rates (Federal, State, or 
local) used in calculating the RIT allowance must be reported to the 
agency by the employee as provided in Sec. 302-11.9(b)(2). (See also 
Sec. 302-11.10 for certified statement regarding these changes.)
    (g) Determination of the net payment due employee in Year 2. Since 
the amount of the RIT allowance is income to the employee in Year 2, it 
is subject to the same tax withholding requirements as all other moving 
expense reimbursements. Agencies should determine the appropriate 
amounts for withholding taxes under their internal tax withholding 
procedures. The amount of withholding taxes is deducted from the RIT 
allowance to arrive at the net payment to the employee.

<R05>
Sec. 302-11.9  Responsibilities.

    (a) Agency. Finance offices will calculate the amount of the gross-
up for the WTA in Year 1 in accordance with procedures outlined herein 
and credit this amount to the employee at the time of reimbursement as 
provided in Sec. 302-11.7(e). The WTA will be reflected on the 
employee's Form W-2 for Year 1. The RIT allowance may be calculated in 
Year 2 either by the employee or by the agency finance office based on 
information provided by the employee on the voucher, as directed by the 
agency's implementing policies and procedures. In addition, agencies 
shall prescribe appropriate and necessary implementing procedures as 
provided elsewhere in this part.
    (b) Employee. (1) The employee is required to submit a claim for the 
RIT allowance and to file the tax information for Year 1 specified in 
Sec. 302-11.10 with his/her agency in Year 2, regardless of whether any 
additional reimbursement for the RIT allowance is owed the employee. 
(See Sec. 302-11.7(e) for employee agreement.)
    (2) If any action occurs (i.e., amended tax return, tax audit, etc.) 
that would change the information provided in Year 2 by the employee to 
his/her agency for use in calculating the RIT allowance due the employee 
for Year 1 taxes, this information must be provided by the employee to 
his/her agency under procedures prescribed by the agency. (See Sec. 302-
11.10.)
    (3) If the calculation of the RIT allowance results in a negative 
amount, the employee is obligated to repay this amount as a debt due the 
Government. (See Secs. 302-11.7(e)(2) and 302-11.8(f)(5).)

<R05>
Sec. 302-11.10  Claims for payment and supporting documentation and verification.

    (a) Claims forms. Claims for payment of the RIT allowance shall be 
submitted by the employee in Year 2 on SF 1012 (Travel Voucher) or other 
authorized travel voucher form. When claiming payment for the RIT 
allowance, the employee shall furnish and certify to certain tax 
information that has been or will be shown on his/her actually prepared 
tax returns. The spouse must also sign statement if joint filing status 
is claimed and spouse's income is included on statement. This 
information shall be contained in a certified statement on, or attached 
to, the SF 1012 reading essentially as follows:

                           Certified Statement

    I certify that the following information, which is to be used in 
calculating the RIT allowance to which I am entitled, has been (or will 
be) shown on the income tax returns filed (or to be filed) by me (or by 
my spouse and me) with the applicable Federal, State, and local (specify 
which) tax authorities for the 19____ tax year.
--Gross compensation as shown on attached IRS Form(s) W-2 and, if 
applicable, net earnings (or loss) from self-employment income shown on 
attached Schedule SE (Form 1040):

(Specify one of the filing status items that was (or will be) claimed on 
IRS Form 1040.)
--Marginal tax rates from appendices A, B, and C of 41 CFR part 302-11

    The above information is true and accurate to the best of my 
knowledge. I (we) agree to notify the appropriate agency official of any 
changes to the above (i.e., from amended tax returns, tax audit, etc.) 
so that appropriate adjustments to the RIT allowance can be made. The 
required supporting documents are attached. Additional documentation 
will be furnished if requested.
    I (we) further agree that if the 12-month service agreement required 
by 41 CFR 302-1.5 is violated, the total amount of the RIT allowance 
will become a debt due the United States Government and will be repaid 
according to agency procedures.

 Date___________________________________________________________________

    \1\ If a joint filing status is claimed and spouse's income is 
included, the spouse must sign the statement. If the spouse does not 
sign the document, earned income will include only the employee's earned 
income as provided in 41 CFR 302-11.8(d). This condition will not apply 
if an employee is allowed, under IRS rules, to file a joint return as a 
surviving spouse.

    (b) Supporting documentation/verification. The claim for the RIT 
allowance shall be supported by documentation attached to the voucher 
and by verification of State and local tax obligations as provided 
below:
    (1) Copies of the appropriate IRS Forms W-2 and, if applicable, the 
completed IRS Schedule SE (Form 1040) shall be attached to the voucher 
to substantiate the income amounts shown in the certified statement. 
Employee (and spouse, if filing jointly) must agree to provide 
additional documentation to verify income amounts, filing status, and 
State and local income tax obligations if requested by the agency.
    (2) In order to determine or verify whether a particular State or 
local tax authority imposes a tax on moving expense reimbursements, it 
is incumbent upon the appropriate agency officials to become familiar 
with the State and local tax laws that affect their transferring 
employees. In cases where the taxability of moving expense 
reimbursements is not clear, an agency may pay a RIT allowance which 
reflects only those State and local tax obligations that are clearly 
imposed under State and local tax law. Once the questionable State or 
local tax obligations are resolved, agencies may recompute the RIT 
allowance and make appropriate payment adjustments.
    (c) Fraudulent claims. A claim against the United States is 
forfeited if the claimant defrauds or attempts to defraud the Government 
in connection therewith (28 U.S.C. 2514). In addition, there are two 
criminal provisions under which severe penalties may be imposed on an 
employee who knowingly presents a false, fictitious, or fraudulent claim 
against the United States (18 U.S.C. 287 and 1001). The employee's claim 
for payment of the RIT allowance shall accurately reflect the facts 
involved in every instance so that any violation of these provisions 
will be avoided.


<R05>
Sec. 302-11.11  Violation of service agreement.

    In the event the employee violates the terms of the service 
agreement required under Sec. 302-1.5, no part of the RIT allowance or 
the WTA will be paid, and any amounts paid prior to such violation shall 
be a debt due the United States until they are repaid by the employee.


<R05>
Sec. 302-11.12  Advance of funds.

    No advance of funds is authorized in connection with the allowance 
provided in this part.

\1\ Earned income amounts that fall between the income brackets shown in this table (e.g., $24,999.45,
  $49,999.75) should be rounded to the nearest dollar to determine the marginal tax rate to be used in
  calculating the RIT allowance.
\2\ If the earned income amount is less than the lowest income bracket shown in this table, the employing agency
  shall establish an appropriate marginal tax rate as provided in Sec.  302-11.8(e)(2)(ii).
\3\ This rate applies only to those individuals certifying that they will file under a single status within the
  States where they will pay income taxes. All other taxpayers, regardless of filing status, will use the other
  rate shown.
\4\ Rates shown as a percent of Federal income tax liability must be converted to a percent of income as
  provided in Sec.  302-11.8(e)(2)(iii).

\1\ Earned income amounts that fall between the income brackets shown in this table (e.g., $24,999.45,
  $49,999.75) should be rounded to the nearest dollar to determine the marginal tax rate to be used in
  calculating the RIT allowance.
\2\ If the earned income amount is less than the lowest income bracket shown in this table, the employing agency
  shall establish an appropriate marginal tax rate as provided in Sec.  302-11.8(e)(2)(ii).
\3\ This rate applies only to those individuals certifying that they will file under a single status within the
  States where they will pay income taxes. All other taxpayers, regardless of filing status, will use the other
  rate shown.
\4\ Rates shown as a percent of Federal income tax liability must be converted to a percent of income as
  provided in Sec.  302-11.8(e)(2)(iii).

\1\ Earned income amounts that fall between the income brackets shown in this table (e.g., $24,999.45,
  $49,999.75) should be rounded to the nearest dollar to determine the marginal tax rate to be used in
  calculating the RIT allowance.
\2\ If the earned income amount is less than the lowest income bracket shown in this table, the employing agency
  shall establish an appropriate marginal tax rate as provided in Sec.  302-11.8(e)(2)(ii).
\3\ This rate applies only to those individuals certifying that they will file under a single status within the
  States where they will pay income taxes. All other taxpayers, regardless of filing status, will use the other
  rate shown.
\4\ Rates shown as a percent of Federal income tax liability must be converted to a percent of income as
  provided in Sec.  302-11.8(e)(2)(iii).
\5\ The income tax rate for Vermont (for other than single status) is 31 percent of Federal income tax liability
  for employees whose earned income amounts are between $20,000-$24,999; for all other employees the rate is 34
  percent of Federal income tax liability.

  $49,999.75) should be rounded to the nearest dollar to determine the marginal tax rate to be used in
  calculating the RIT allowance.
\2\ If the earned income amount is less than the lowest income bracket shown in this table, the employing agency
  shall establish an appropriate marginal tax rate as provided in Sec.  302-11.8(e)(2)(ii).

<R04>
        Subpart A--Agency's Use of a Relocation Services Company

    Note to subpart A: Use of the pronouns ``we'' and ``you'' throughout 
this subpart refers to the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.1  What are ``relocation services''?

    ``Relocation services'' are services provided by a private company 
under a contract with an agency to assist a transferred employee in 
relocating to the new official station. Examples include homesale 
programs, home marketing assistance, home finding assistance, and 
property management services.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.2  May we enter into a contract with a relocation services company for the company to provide relocation services?

    Yes.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.3  What contracted relocation services may we provide at Government expense?

    You may pay for contracted relocation services that are a substitute 
for reimbursable relocation allowances authorized throughout this 
chapter. For example, you may pay for homesale services as a substitute 
for residence sale expenses, or household goods management services as a 
substitute for transportation of household goods.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.4  May we separately contract for each type of relocation service?

    Yes, or you may combine several types of relocation services in a 
single contract.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.5  What is the purpose of contracting for relocation services?

    To improve the treatment of employees who are directed to relocate 
to facilitate the retention of a well-qualified workforce.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.6  How must we administer a relocation services contract?

    You must balance the positive effects that availability of 
relocation services has on employee mobility and morale with any 
increased costs your agency may experience as a result of providing 
relocation services.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.7  What policies must we establish when offering our employees the services of a relocation services company? You must establish policies governing:

    (a) The conditions under which you will authorize an employee to use 
a relocation services company;
    (b) Which employees you will allow to use a relocation services 
company;
    (c) What relocation services you will offer an employee; and
    (d) Who will determine in each case if an employee may use a 
relocation services company and what services will be offered.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.8  What rules must we follow when contracting for relocation services?

    The rules contained in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) (48 
CFR) and/or other procurement regulations applicable to you.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.9  What are the income tax consequences that we must consider when offering relocation services?

    Amounts you pay to a relocation services company on behalf of an 
employee may be taxable to the employee. In some cases, such as with 
certain homesale programs, the amounts may not be taxable. You must 
determine the taxability of such payments, and pay a relocation income 
tax (RIT) allowance in accordance with part 302-11 of this chapter on 
payments you determine to be taxable to the employee. You may contact 
the Assistant Chief Counsel (Income Tax & Accounting), Internal Revenue 
Service, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW., Room 5501,

[[Page 208]]

Washington, DC 20224, for information on the income tax consequences of 
payments you make to a relocation services company.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.10  What must we consider in deciding whether to use the fixed-fee or cost-reimbursable contracting method?

    You must consider the following factors in deciding which 
contracting method to use:
    (a) Risk of alternative methods. Under a fixed fee contract, the 
relocation services company bears all risks not expressly contained in 
the contract. Under a cost-reimbursable contract, you must assume some 
or all risks and, therefore, must assume some management 
responsibilities under the contract as well. For example, under a fixed 
fee homesale program you are not directly liable for losses incurred if 
a residence does not sell immediately, while under a cost-reimbursable 
homesale program you assume some or all risks of selling the residence.
    (b) Cost of alternative methods. Under the fixed fee method of 
contracting, the fee includes a cost component for risk assumed by the 
relocation services company. Under the cost-reimbursable method of 
contracting, you are directly responsible for some or all of the costs 
associated with management of the contract. In deciding whether to use 
cost-reimbursable contracting you, therefore, must consider the cost of 
resources you would require (including personnel costs) to manage a 
cost-reimbursable relocation services contract.
    (c) Effect on the obligation of funds. You must obligate funds for a 
relocation in the fiscal year in which the purchase order is awarded 
under the contract. Under the fixed fee contracting method, the amount 
of the relocation services fee is fixed and you have a basis for 
determining the amount of funds to obligate. Under the cost-reimbursable 
contracting method, you must obligate funds based on an estimate of the 
costs that will be incurred. When opting for cost-reimbursable 
contracting you, therefore, should establish a reliable method of 
computing fund obligation estimates.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.11  May we take title to an employee's residence?

    No, you may not take title to an employee's residence except as 
specifically provided by statute. The statutes which form the basis for 
the provisions of this part do not provide such authority.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.12  Under a homesale program, may we establish a maximum home value above which we will not pay for homesale services?

    Yes. If a home exceeding the maximum value is sold under your 
homesale program, the employee will be responsible for any additional 
costs. You must establish a maximum amount commensurate with your 
agency's experience. You may consider, among other factors, budgetary 
constraints, the value range of homes in areas where you have offices, 
and the value range of homes previously entered in your program.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.13  Under a homesale program, may we pay an employee for losses he/she incurs on the sale of a residence?

    No. But, this does not preclude your reimbursing a relocation 
services company for losses incurred while the contractor holds the 
property.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.14  Under a homesale program, may we direct the relocation services company to pay an employee more than the fair market value of his/her residence?

    No. Under a homesale program you may not direct the relocation 
services company to pay an employee more than the fair market value (as 
determined by the residence appraisal process) of his/her home.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.15  May we use a relocation services contract for services which we are contractually bound to obtain under another travel services contract?

    No. For example, you may not use a relocation services contract to 
circumvent the travel and transportation expense payment system contract 
if you are a user of that contract.

<R04>
       Subpart B--Employee's Use of a Relocation Services Company

    Note to subpart B: Use of the pronouns ``I'' and ``you'' throughout 
this subpart refers to the employee.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.100  Am I eligible to use a relocation services company?

    Yes, if you are an employee who is authorized to transfer.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.101  Must my agency allow me to use a relocation services company?

    No. Your agency determines if you may use a relocation services 
company.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.102  Under what conditions may I use a relocation services company?

    You may use a relocation services company if:
    (a) You meet all conditions required for you to be eligible for an 
allowance contained in this chapter for which a service provided by the 
relocation services company would serve as a substitute, and you are 
authorized to use a specific relocation service provided by the company 
as a substitute;
    (b) You have signed a service agreement; and
    (c) You meet any specific conditions your agency has established.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.103  For what relocation services expenses will my agency pay?

    Your agency will pay the relocation services company s fees/expenses 
for the services you are authorized to use. If your agency pays the 
relocation services company for actual expenses the company incurs on 
your behalf, payment to the company is limited to what you would have 
received under the direct reimbursement provisions of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.104  If I use a contracted-for relocation service that is a substitute for reimbursable relocation allowance, will I be reimbursed for the 
          relocation allowance as well?

    No.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.105  What expenses will my agency pay if I use a relocation services company to ship household goods in excess of the maximum weight allowance?

    Your agency will pay the portion of the fee attributable to 18,000 
pounds net weight. You must pay the rest.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.106  What expenses will my agency pay if I use a relocation services company to sell or purchase a residence for which I and/or a member(s) of my 
          immediate family do not have full title?

    Your agency will pay the portion of the relocation services 
company's fee attributable to your pro rata share of the residence, as 
determined in accordance with Sec. 302-6.1(f) of this chapter. You must 
pay any portion of the fee attributable to other than your pro rata 
share of the residence.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.107  If my agency authorizes me to enter a homesale program, must I accept a buyout offer from the relocation services company?

    No. Your agency must give you the option to accept or reject an 
offer from the relocation services company.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.108  What are the income tax consequences if I use a relocation services company?

    You may incur income taxes on relocation services provided by a 
relocation services company and paid for by your agency. Section 82 of 
the Internal Revenue Code states there shall be included in gross income 
(as compensation for services) any amount received or accrued, directly 
or indirectly, by an individual as a payment for or reimbursement of 
expenses of moving from one residence to another residence which is 
attributable to employment. You will receive a relocation income tax 
(RIT) allowance if your agency determines that such expenses are 
taxable. The Government does not assume responsibility for payment of 
your taxes, however, and you may wish to consult a tax professional on 
income tax reporting.

<R04>
             Subpart A--Payment of Incentive to the Employee

    Note to subpart A: Use of the pronouns ``I'' and ``you'' throughout 
this subpart refers to the employee.


<R05>
Sec. 302-14.1  What is a ``homesale program''?

    It is a program offered by an agency through a contractual 
arrangement with a relocation services company. The relocation services 
company purchases a transferred employee s residence at fair market 
(appraised) value and then independently markets and sells the 
residence.


<R05>
Sec. 302-14.2  What is the purpose of a home marketing incentive payment?

    To reduce the Government s relocation costs by encouraging 
transferred employees who participate in their employing agency s 
homesale program to independently and aggressively market, and find a 
bona fide buyer for, their residence. This significantly reduces the 
fees/expenses their agencies must pay to relocation services companies 
and effectively lowers the cost of such programs.


<R05>
Sec. 302-14.3  Am I eligible to receive a home marketing incentive payment?

    Yes, if you are an employee who is authorized to transfer and you 
otherwise meet requirements for sale of your residence at Government 
expense.


<R05>
Sec. 302-14.4  Must my agency pay me a home marketing incentive?

    No. Your agency determines when it is in the Government s interest 
to offer you a home marketing incentive.


<R05>
Sec. 302-14.5  Under what circumstances will I receive a home marketing incentive payment?

    You will receive a home marketing incentive payment when:
    (a) You enter your residence in your agency s homesale program;
    (b) You independently and aggressively market your residence;
    (c) You find a bona fide buyer for your residence as a result of 
your independent marketing efforts;
    (d) You transfer the residence to the relocation services company;
    (e) Your agency pays a reduced fee/expenses to the relocation 
services company as a result of your independent marketing efforts; and
    (f) You meet any additional conditions your agency has established, 
including but not limited to, mandatory marketing periods, list price 
guidelines, closing requirements, and residence value caps.

[[Page 211]]


<R05>
Sec. 302-14.6  How much may my agency pay me for a home marketing incentive?

    Your agency determines the amount of your home marketing incentive 
payment. The incentive payment, however, may not exceed the lesser of:
    (a) Five percent of the price the relocation services company paid 
when it purchased the residence from you; or
    (b) The savings your agency realized from the reduced fee/expenses 
it paid as a result of your finding a bona fide buyer.


<R05>
Sec. 302-14.7  Are there tax consequences when I receive a home marketing incentive payment?

    Yes, the home marketing incentive payment is considered income. 
Consequently, you will be taxed, and your agency will withhold income 
and employment taxes, on the home marketing incentive payment. You will 
not, however, receive a withholding tax allowance (WTA) to offset the 
withholding on your home marketing incentive payment, nor will you 
receive a relocation income tax (RIT) allowance payment for 
substantially all of your Federal, state and local income taxes on the 
incentive payment.


<R04>
                   Subpart B--Agency Responsibilities

    Note to subpart B: Use of the pronouns ``we'' and ``you'' throughout 
this subpart refers to the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 302-14.100  How should we administer our home marketing incentive payment program?

    Your goal in using an incentive payment program is to reduce your 
overall relocation costs. You must not make a home marketing incentive 
payment that exceeds the savings you realize from the reduced fees/
expenses you pay the relocation services company.


<R05>
Sec. 302-14.101  What policies must we establish to govern our home marketing incentive payment program?

    You must establish policies to govern:
    (a) The conditions under which you will authorize a home marketing 
incentive payment for an employee;
    (b) The amount of the home marketing incentive payment(s) you will 
offer (or the method you will use to compute your home marketing 
incentive payments); and
    (c) Who will determine in each case whether a home marketing 
incentive payment is authorized.


<R05>
Sec. 302-14.102  What factors should we consider in determining whether to establish a home marketing incentive payment program?

    You should consider:
    (a) Whether the program will increase the percentage of residences 
sold for which employees find a bona fide buyer. You should establish a 
benchmark for the percentage of residences for which you expect 
employees to find a bona fide buyer resulting in lower homesale costs to 
you. If your historical percentage of employee-generated sales is below 
your benchmark, a home marketing incentive payment program may benefit 
you.
    (b) The expected net savings from a home marketing incentive payment 
program.


<R05>
Sec. 302-14.103  What factors should we consider in determining the amount of a home marketing incentive payment?

    You should consider:
    (a) Amount of savings from reduced fee/expenses paid to the 
relocation services company. The home marketing incentive payment 
program is intended to reduce your relocation costs. The amount of each 
home marketing incentive payment you make, therefore, must not exceed 
the savings you realize from the reduced fee you pay to the relocation 
services company.
    (b) Employee's efforts in marketing the residence. The purpose of a 
home marketing incentive payment program is to encourage a transferred 
employee who participates in a homesale program to independently and 
aggressively market his/her residence and find a bona fide buyer.

                Subpart A--General Rules for the Employee

    Note to subpart A: Use of the pronouns ``I'' and ``you'' throughout 
this subpart refers to the employee.


<R05>
Sec. 302-15.1  What are ``property management services''?

    ``Property management services'' are programs provided by private 
companies for a fee, which help an employee to manage his/her residence 
at the old official station as a rental property. These services 
typically include, but are not limited to, obtaining a tenant, 
negotiating the lease, inspecting the property regularly, managing 
repairs and maintenance, enforcing lease terms, collecting the rent, 
paying the mortgage and other carrying expenses from rental proceeds 
and/or funds of the employee, and accounting for the transactions and 
providing periodic reports to the employee.


<R05>
Sec. 302-15.2  What is a ``nonforeign area''?

    A ``nonforeign area'' is the United States, its territories or 
possessions, the Commonwealths of Puerto Rico or the Northern Mariana 
Islands, or the former Canal Zone area (i.e., areas and installations in 
the Republic of Panama made available to the United States pursuant to 
the Panama Canal

[[Page 213]]

Treaty of 1977 and related agreements (as described in 22 U.S.C. 
3602(a))).


<R05>
Sec. 302-15.3  What is a ``foreign area''?

    A ``foreign area'' means any area that is not a ``nonforeign area'', 
as defined in Sec. 302-15.2.


<R05>
Sec. 302-15.4  What are the purposes of the allowance for property management services?

    The purpose is to reduce overall Government relocation costs when 
used instead of sale of the employee's residence at Government expense. 
When authorized in connection with an employee's transfer to a foreign 
area post of duty, the purpose is to relieve the employee of the costs 
of maintaining a home in a nonforeign area while stationed at a foreign 
area post of duty.


<R05>
Sec. 302-15.5  In what situations may my agency authorize payment for property management services?

    Your agency may authorize payment when:
    (a) You transfer in the interest of the Government to a foreign area 
post of duty; or
    (b) You are transferred back to a different nonforeign area official 
station than the one you left when you were transferred to a foreign 
area, and you are otherwise eligible for the sale of your residence at 
Government expense.


<R05>
Sec. 302-15.6  Must my agency authorize payment for property management services?

    No, your agency determines when it is in the Government's interest 
to authorize payment for these services and what procedures you must 
follow when it authorizes such payment.


<R05>
Sec. 302-15.7  What are the income tax consequences when my agency pays for my property management services?

    You will be taxed on the amount of expenses your agency pays for 
property management services whether it reimburses you directly or 
whether it pays a relocation services company to manage your residence. 
Your agency must pay you a relocation income tax (RIT) allowance for the 
additional Federal, State and local income taxes you incur on property 
management expenses it reimburses you or pays on your behalf. You may 
wish to consult with a tax advisor to determine whether you will incur 
any additional tax liability, unrelated to your agency's payment of your 
property management expenses, as a result of maintaining your residence 
as a rental property.


<R05>
Sec. 302-15.8  Who is not eligible for payment for property management services?

    New appointees, employees assigned under the Government Employees 
Training Act (5 U.S.C. 4109), and employees transferring wholly within a

this subpart refers to the employee.


<R05>
Sec. 302-15.100  Am I eligible for payment for property management services under this subpart?

    Yes, when your transfer to a foreign area post of duty is in the 
interest of the Government and you and/or a member(s) of your immediate

Government expense under part 302-6 or 302-12 of this chapter if you 
were transferred to or within a nonforeign area.

This part does not authorize acceptance of such payments by an employee

an event to be sponsored jointly by the agency and the non-Federal 
source, the agency or employee may inform the non-Federal source of this 
authority.

honorary degree, which is in recognition of meritorious public service

accepted by the employee consistent with the applicable standards of 
conduct regulation.
    (4) Non-Federal source. ``Non-Federal source'' means any person or 
entity other than the Government of the United States. The term includes 
any

[[Page 226]]

individual, private or commercial entity, nonprofit organization or 
association or international or multinational organization (irrespective 
of whether an agency holds membership in the organization or 
association), or foreign, state, or local government (including the 
government of the District of Columbia).
    (5) Payment. ``Payment'' means funds paid by a non-Federal source 
for travel, subsistence, and related expenses by check or similar 
instrument to an agency, or payment in kind.
    (6) Payment in kind. ``Payment in kind'' means goods, services, or 
other benefits provided by a non-Federal source for travel, subsistence,

Sec. 304-1.3  Policy.

    (a) Acceptance of payment for employee. As provided in this part, an 
agency may accept payment from a non-Federal source (or authorize an 
employee to receive such payment on its behalf) with respect to 
attendance of the employee at a meeting or similar function which the 
employee has been authorized to attend in an official capacity on behalf 
of the employing agency.
    (b) Acceptance of payment for an accompanying spouse. An agency may 
accept payment under this part from a non-Federal source for an 
accompanying spouse when the spouse's presence at the meeting or similar 
function is in the interest of the agency. A spouse's presence at an 
event may be determined to be in the interest of the agency if the 
spouse will:
    (1) Support the mission of the agency or substantially assist the 
employee in carrying out his/her official duties;
    (2) Attend a ceremony at which the employee will receive an award or 
honorary degree described in Sec. 304-1.2(c)(3); or
    (3) Participate in substantive programs related to the agency's 
programs or operations.
    (c) Administration and delegation of authority. Payment acceptance 
must be in accordance with internal agency procedures. Agencies shall 
ensure that officials delegated authority to determine the propriety of 
accepting payments under this part are at as high an administrative 
level as practical to ensure adequate consideration and review of the 
circumstances surrounding the offer and acceptance of the payment.
    (d) Payment in excess of regulatory limitations--(1) Subsistence 
expenses. When a non-Federal source makes full payment for subsistence 
expenses, acceptance of payment for, and when applicable, reimbursement 
by an agency to, an employee (and/or the accompanying spouse of such 
employee when applicable) under this part are not subject to the maximum 
per diem or actual subsistence expense rates prescribed in chapter 301 
of this subtitle or by the Secretary of Defense in Civilian Personnel 
Per Diem Bulletins published periodically in the Federal Register.
    (2) Transportation expenses. When a non-Federal source makes full 
payment for common carrier transportation expenses, acceptance of 
payment for, and when applicable, reimbursement by an agency to, an 
employee (and/or the accompanying spouse of such employee when 
applicable) under this part are not subject to the transportation class 
of service limitations applicable to premium-class other than

[[Page 227]]

first-class accommodations, as prescribed in chapter 301 of this 
subtitle or the JFTR. Acceptance of payment for first-class 
transportation accommodations is allowed only when the use of first-
class transportation accommodations is authorized in accordance with 
Sec. 301-3.3 of this subtitle.
    (e) Reduced per diem rate in partial payment situation. If the 
designated agency official determines in advance of the travel that a 
payment covers some but not all of the per diem costs to be incurred by 
the employee (and/or the accompanying spouse when applicable), the 
agency should authorize a reduced per diem rate, in accordance with 
Sec. 301-7.12 of this subtitle or analogous provisions of 6 FAM 100 or 
the JFTR, as applicable, that is commensurate with the known subsistence 
expense levels.
[57 FR 53289, Nov. 9, 1992, as amended by FTR Amdt. 32, 58 FR 58244, 
Oct. 29, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 304-1.4  Conditions for acceptance.

    (a) An agency may accept payment for employee and/or spousal travel 
from a non-Federal source when a general authorization to accept payment 
(rather than an item-by-item authorization) is issued in advance of the 
travel following a determination by the agency official designated in 
accordance with Sec. 304-1.3(c) that the payment is:
    (1) For travel relating to an employee's official duties (including 
attendance because the employee's presence at the meeting is necessary 
to permit participation in the meeting by another employee or because a 
spouse's presence at the meeting or similar function is in the interest 
of the agency) under an official travel authorization issued to the 
employee, and to an accompanying spouse when applicable;
    (2) For attendance at a meeting or similar function (as defined in 
Sec. 304-1.2(c)(3) relating to the official duties of the employee; and
    (3) From a non-Federal source that is not disqualified under 
Sec. 304-1.5 on conflict-of-interest grounds.
    (b) Payments may be accepted from multiple sources under paragraph 
(a) of this section.
    (c) If a meeting or similar function does not concern a subject of 
mutual interest to the employee's agency and the non-Federal source, 
acceptance of payment from the non-Federal source under paragraph (a) of 
this section is limited to payment in kind and to the types of services 
the non-Federal source generally provides; e.g., air passenger 
transportation services provided by a commercial airline.


<R05>
Sec. 304-1.5  Conflict-of-interest analysis.

    (a) Payment from a non-Federal source shall not be accepted if the 
authorized agency official determines that acceptance under the 
circumstances would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of all the 
facts relevant to a particular case to question the integrity of agency 
programs or operations. In making this determination, an authorized 
agency official shall be guided by all relevant considerations, 
including, but not limited to:
    (1) The identity of the non-Federal source;
    (2) The purpose of the meeting or similar function;
    (3) The identity of other expected participants;
    (4) The nature and sensitivity of any matter pending at the agency 
affecting the interests of the non-Federal source;
    (5) The significance of the employee's role in any such matter; and
    (6) The monetary value and character of the travel benefits offered 
by the non-Federal source.
    (b) The authorized agency official may find that, while acceptance 
from the non-Federal source is permissible, it is in the interest of the 
agency to qualify acceptance of the offered payment by, for example, 
authorizing attendance at only a portion of the event or limiting the 
type or character of benefits that may be accepted.


<R05>
Sec. 304-1.6  Payment guidelines.

    (a) Payment other than in kind. Payments from a non-Federal source 
for an employee and/or accompanying spouse, other than payments in kind, 
shall be by check or similar instrument made payable to the agency. Any 
such payment received by the employee on behalf of the agency for his/
her travel and/or that of the accompanying spouse is accepted on behalf 
of the agency and is to be submitted as soon

[[Page 228]]

as practicable for credit to the agency appropriation applicable to such 
expenses. When the acceptance of payment has been approved in advance by 
the designated agency official, the agency, or employee on behalf of the 
agency for his/her travel (and/or that of the accompanying spouse, when 
applicable), may, in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 304-1.3(d), 
accept payment in excess of applicable limitations, provided that the 
accommodation or other benefit furnished is comparable in value to that 
offered to, or purchased by, other similarly situated individuals 
attending the meeting or similar function. When the applicable 
limitation will be exceeded, payment should be required in advance of 
the travel.
    (b) Payment in kind. When the acceptance of payment has been 
approved in advance by the designated agency official, the employee, for 
his/her travel (and/or that of the accompanying spouse, when 
applicable), may, in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 304-1.3(d), 
accept payment in kind in excess of applicable limitations, provided 
that the accommodation or other benefit furnished is comparable in value 
to that offered to, or purchased by, other similarly situated 
individuals attending the meeting or similar function.


<R05>
Sec. 304-1.7  Reimbursement claims for official travel expenses.

    (a) The employee (and/or accompanying spouse when applicable) shall 
submit to the employing agency on authorized reimbursement forms all 
travel expense reimbursement claims, and shall itemize all expenses 
incurred which exceed applicable limitations (see Sec. 304-1.3(d)). 
Generally, the employee, and/or accompanying spouse when applicable, 
shall be reimbursed an amount not to exceed applicable limitations. 
However, when the non-Federal source, in accordance with the provisions 
of Sec. 304-1.3(d), makes full payment in excess of applicable 
limitations for reimbursable subsistence expenses or common carrier 
transportation expenses incurred, reimbursement shall be the amount of 
the payment from the non-Federal source. Reimbursement for expenses in 
excess of regulatory limitations shall not in any case exceed the amount 
of the expenses incurred.
    (b) The agency may reimburse the employee (and/or accompanying 
spouse of such employee when applicable) for only the types of expenses 
defined in Secs. 301-7.1 (b)(6) and (c) of this subtitle or in analogous 
provisions of 6 FAM 100 or the JFTR, as applicable, for per diem 
allowances, transportation expenses, or other miscellaneous travel 
expenses.
    (c) If an accepted payment covers only a portion of one or more 
types of the expenses incurred (e.g., $50.00 per night for lodging in a 
locality with an $85.00 per night maximum lodging allowance), the agency 
shall reimburse the employee (and/or accompanying spouse when 
applicable) only the amount to which he/she otherwise would be entitled 
under applicable regulation (chapter 301 of this subtitle, 6 FAM 100, or 
the JFTR). (See Sec. 304-1.3(e) regarding reduced per diem rate 
situations.)
    (d) If an accepted payment covers in full one or more types of 
expenses described in paragraph (b) of this section (e.g., payment for 
lodging accommodations) but does not cover all of the travel expenses 
incurred, the agency shall reimburse the employee (and/or accompanying 
spouse of such employee when applicable) for those expenses that are not 
covered by the payment, not to exceed applicable limitations established 
in chapter 301 of this subtitle or in analogous provisions of 6 FAM 100 
or the JFTR.


<R05>
Sec. 304-1.8  Limitations and penalties.

    (a) This part is the only authority under which an agency may accept 
payment from a non-Federal source, or authorize an employee to accept 
such payment on behalf of the agency, in connection with the attendance 
of its employee (and/or the accompanying spouse of such employee when 
applicable) at a meeting or similar function. An agency may not accept, 
under an agency gift statute or other similar authority, payment for 
travel, subsistence, and related expenses incurred by an employee and/or 
accompanying spouse to attend a meeting or similar function. However, 
nothing in this part prohibits an agency or employee from accepting 
payment as follows:

[[Page 229]]

    (1) When authorized under 5 U.S.C. 4111 or 5 U.S.C. 7342;
    (2) When payment is for travel to be performed for a partisan rather 
than an official purpose in the case of an employee who is exempt from 
the Hatch Act under 5 U.S.C. 7324(d);
    (3) When authorized pursuant to an agency gift statute or similar 
statutory authority and payment is for attendance at or participation in 
an event (other than a meeting or similar function) relating to the 
official duties of the employee; or
    (4) When consistent with the applicable standards of ethical conduct 
regulation concerning personal acceptance of gifts.
    (b) An employee who accepts any payment in violation of this part is 
subject to the following:
    (1) The employee may be required, in addition to any penalty 
provided by law and applicable regulations, to repay for deposit to the 
general fund of the Treasury, an amount equal to the amount of the 
payment so accepted; and
    (2) When repayment is required under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, the employee shall not be entitled to any reimbursement from 
the Government for such expenses.


<R05>
Sec. 304-1.9  Reports.

    (a) Agency reports. Each agency shall submit semiannual reports of 
payments (see definition of payment in Sec. 304-1.2(c)) which total more 
than $250 per event, and which have been accepted under this part with 
respect to the attendance at, or participation in, a meeting or similar 
function by an agency employee, and/or accompanying spouse of such 
employee when applicable. Negative reports are required.
    (1) Submission. The head of each agency (or his/her designee) shall 
submit the semiannual report to the Director of the Office of Government 
Ethics (OGE), 1201 New York Avenue, N.W., Suite 500, Washington, DC 
20005-3917. The report shall be based on when payment is received rather 
than when travel is performed, and shall be submitted as follows:
    (i) Not later than May 31 of each year with respect to payments 
received in the preceding period beginning on October 1 and ending on 
March 31; and
    (ii) Not later than November 30 of each year with respect to 
payments received in the preceding period beginning on April 1 and 
ending on September 30.
    (2) Information required. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(6) of 
this section, the report shall specify the following information in the 
order presented:
    (i) The name of the agency submitting the report;
    (ii) Each event (meeting or similar function) for which an agency 
accepts payment under this part of more than $250 for an employee and 
spouse together, or for either the employee or the spouse separately, 
including:
    (A) The sponsor(s) of the event;
    (B) The location of the event;
    (C) The date(s) of the event; and
    (D) The nature of the event;
    (iii) The name of each employee for whom such payment was accepted 
in connection with the event, including:
    (A) The employee's Government position; and
    (B) The employee's travel date(s) in connection with attendance at 
the event;
    (iv) The name of the accompanying spouse, if applicable, for whom 
payment was accepted in connection with the event, including:
    (A) The name of the employee accompanied by the spouse;
    (B) The employee's Government position; and
    (C) The spouse's travel date(s) in connection with attendance at the 
event;
    (v) The identity of any non-Federal source from which payment was 
accepted in connection with the event;
    (vi) An itemization of the benefits accepted by the agency in 
connection with attendance at the event, including for each benefit:
    (A) A description of the benefit, provided that benefits accepted as 
a part of a conference or training fee need not be reported separately;
    (B) The method of payment (payment in kind or by check or similar 
instrument);
    (C) The individual for whom payment was accepted (employee or 
spouse);

[[Page 230]]

    (D) The non-Federal source that provided the benefit; and
    (E) The amount of the payment; and
    (vii) The total value of the payments accepted for the employee and/
or spouse in connection with the event identified as follows:
    (A) The total amount of payments provided by check or similar 
instrument; and
    (B) The total value of payments provided in kind.
    (3) Valuation of payments in kind. In the case of conference, 
training, or similar fees waived or paid by the non-Federal source, 
report the amount charged other participants. In the case of 
transportation or lodging, report the cost to the non-Federal source, or 
indicate the rate that would have been charged a similar non-Federal 
source for a similar benefit at the time the benefit was provided. In 
the case of meals or other benefits that are not provided incident to 
transportation, lodging, or a conference, training, or similar fee, 
report the cost to the non-Federal source or provide a reasonable 
approximation of the market value of the benefit.
    (4) Valuation of noncommercial benefits furnished by a non-Federal 
source--(i) Transportation. In the case of transportation on a 
chartered, corporate or other private aircraft, report the first-class 
rate that would have been charged by an air common carrier at the time 
the transportation was provided or, if common carrier transportation was 
unavailable between the two locations, report the cost of chartering a 
similar aircraft using a commercially available service.
    (ii) Lodging. In the case of lodging for which no commercial rate is 
available, report the maximum lodging rate prescribed in chapter 301 of 
this subtitle; section 925, a per diem supplement to the Standardized 
Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas); or Civilian Personnel 
Per Diem Bulletins issued by the Secretary of Defense, as applicable.
    (5) Public availability of reports. Except as provided in paragraph 
(a)(6) of this section, the Director of OGE shall make any report filed 
pursuant to this section available for public inspection and copying 
within 30 days after the applicable due date or within 30 days after the 
date OGE actually receives the report, whichever is later.
    (6) Exemption. To the extent that information is protected from 
disclosure by statute, an agency is not required to furnish information 
otherwise required to be reported. Information that may be disclosed 
shall be submitted to OGE and made available to the public in accordance 
with paragraph (a)(5) of this section. Information that is not disclosed 
because it is protected from disclosure by statute shall be made 
available by the reporting agency for review by properly cleared OGE 
personnel.
    (b) Employee reports. Payments properly accepted under this part are 
accepted by the agency. Receipt of a benefit by an employee and/or the 
accompanying spouse, when applicable, on behalf of the agency under the 
authority of this part is not required to be reported as a gift on any 
confidential or public financial disclosure report that the employee is 
required to file pursuant to law or OGE regulation. Acceptance of 
payment by an employee for himself/herself and/or the accompanying 
spouse, when applicable, under authorities other than this part may be 
subject to other reporting requirements such as those required by the 
Ethics in Government Act of 1978, as amended, including reporting the 
payment on the employee's financial disclosure report.

Sec. 304-2.3  Conditions for approval of contributions or payments.

    Section 303(j) of Executive Order 11348 of April 20, 1967, and the 
regulations issued by the Office of Personnel Management under section 
401(b) of that Order, prescribe the conditions under which agency heads 
may approve the acceptance by employees of contributions and awards 
incident to training and payments incident to attendance at meetings, 
under 5 U.S.C. 4111(a), from the organizations described therein. These 
organizations are referred to in this part as ``donors.''
[56 FR 9881, Mar. 8, 1991, as amended by FTR Amdt. 26, 57 FR 28637, June 
26, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 304-2.4  Agency responsibilities.

    Agency heads shall provide adequate safeguards to ensure that the 
following provisions of this section are carried out:
    (a) Where an approved payment by a donor fully covers expenses 
incident to training in a non-Government facility, or travel, 
subsistence, or other expenses incident to attendance at a meeting, the 
agency shall not pay for such expenses or shall recover payments 
previously made in the manner described in paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (b) If an approved payment by a donor does not fully cover expenses 
described in paragraph (a) of this section, the agency may pay an amount 
considered sufficient to cover the balance of the expenses to the extent 
authorized by law and regulation, including 5 U.S.C. 4109 and 4110. If 
an amount in excess of such balance has been previously paid by the 
agency, such amount shall be recovered from the employee in the manner 
described in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Recoveries of payments, as provided in paragraph (b) of this 
section, shall be made in the manner prescribed by regulations of the 
agency concerned and shall be issued according to 5 U.S.C. 5514.
    (d) No reduction in payment by an agency is required where an 
approved contribution or award to an employee covers types of expenses 
which the agency is not authorized to pay. For example, where an agency 
authorizes travel expenses of an employee, including per diem and 
transportation expenses of his/her immediate family and household goods 
and personal effects to a training location, no reduction in payment by 
the agency is required if an approved contribution or award covers 
subsistence expenses of the family en route and expenses incurred by the 
employee in establishing himself/herself and the family at the training 
location.
    (e) Expense data shall be obtained from employees or donors in such 
detail as the agency head deems necessary to carry out the provisions of 
this part.
