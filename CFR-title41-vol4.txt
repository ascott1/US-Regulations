                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2003), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 300-1.1  What is the FTR?

    The FTR is the regulation contained in 41 Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR), Chapters 300 through 304, which implements statutory 
requirements and Executive branch policies for travel by Federal 
civilian employees and others authorized to travel at Government 
expense.


<R05>
Sec. 300-1.2  What is the purpose of the FTR?

    There are two principal purposes:
    (a) To interpret statutory and other policy requirements in a manner 
that balances the need to assure that official travel is conducted in a 
responsible manner with the need to minimize administrative costs;
    (b) To communicate the resulting policies in a clear manner to 
Federal agencies and employees.

employee, the rules expressed in those provisions apply to the agency as 
well. The following lists the relevant employee and agency sections of

<R05>
Sec. 300-2.23  How is the user addressed in the FTR?

    The FTR asks questions in the first person, as the user would. It 
then answers the questions in the second and third person. In the 
employee sections, the employee is addressed in the singular, and in the 
agency sections, the agency is addressed in the plural. The following 
describes how employee and agency are addressed in both sections:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                          The employee is referred to       And the agency is

<R05>
Sec. 301-10.1  Am I eligible for payment of transportation expenses?

    Yes, when performing official travel, including local travel.


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.2  What expenses are payable as transportation?

    Fares, rental fees, mileage payments, and other expenses related to 
transportation.

[[Page 25]]


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.3  What methods of transportation may my agency authorize me to 
use?

    Your agency may authorize:
    (a) Common carrier transportation (e.g., aircraft, train, bus, ship, 
or local transit system) under Subpart B;
    (b) Government vehicle under Subpart C;
    (c) POV under Subpart D; or
    (d) Special conveyance (e.g., taxi or commercial automobile) under 
Subpart E.


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.4  How does my agency select the method of transportation to be 
used?

    Your agency must select the method most advantageous to the 
Government, when cost and other factors are considered. Under 5 U.S.C. 
5733, travel must be by the most expeditious means of transportation 
practicable and commensurate with the nature and purpose of your duties. 
In addition, your agency must consider energy conservation, total cost 
to the Government (including costs of per diem, overtime, lost worktime, 
and actual transportation costs), total distance traveled, number of 
points visited, and number of travelers.


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.5  What are the presumptions as to the most advantageous method 
of transportation?

    (a) Common carrier. Travel by common carrier is presumed to be the 
most advantageous method of transportation and must be used when 
reasonably available.
    (b) Government automobile. When your agency determines that your 
travel must be performed by automobile, a Government automobile is 
presumed to be the most advantageous method of transportation.


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.6  What is my liability if I do not travel by the selected 
method of transportation?

    If you do not travel by the method of transportation required by 
regulation or selected by your agency, any additional expenses you incur 
will be borne by you.


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.7  How should I route my travel?

    You must travel to your destination by the usually traveled route 
unless your agency authorizes or approves a different route as 
officially necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.8  What is my liability if, for personal convenience, I travel 
by an indirect route or interrupt travel by a direct route?

    Your reimbursement will be limited to the cost of travel by a direct 
route or on an uninterrupted basis. You will be responsible for any 
additional costs.


<R04>
                Subpart B--Common Carrier Transportation


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.100  What types of common carrier transportation may I be 
authorized to use?

    You may be authorized to use airline, train, ship, bus, or local 
transit system.

                                 Airline


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.106  What are the basic requirements for using airlines?

    The requirements for using airlines fall into three categories:
    (a) Using contract carriers, when available;
    (b) Using coach class service, unless premium class or first-class 
service is authorized;
    (c) Using U.S. flag air carrier or (ship) service, unless use of 
foreign air carrier or (ship) is authorized.

[FTR Amdt. 70, 63 FR 15955, Apr. 1, 1998; 63 FR 35537, June 30, 1998]

                     Use of Contract City-Pair Fares


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.107  When must I use a contract city-pair fare?

    You must always use a contract city-pair fare for scheduled air 
passenger transportation service, (an Internet list of city-pairs is 
available at http://pub.fss.gsa.gov/services/citypairs), if you are a 
civilian employee of an agency (see Sec. 301-1.1 of this chapter), 
unless one or more of the following conditions exist(s):
    (a) Space or a scheduled contract flight is not available in time to 
accomplish the purpose of your travel, or

[[Page 26]]

use of contract service would require you to incur unnecessary overnight 
lodging costs which would increase the total cost of the trip; or
    (b) The contractor's flight schedule is inconsistent with explicit 
policies of your Federal department or agency with regard to scheduling 
travel during normal working hours; or
    (c) A non-contract carrier offers a lower fare available to the 
general public, the use of which will result in a lower total trip cost 
to the Government, to include the combined costs of transportation, 
lodging, meals, and related expenses.

    Note to paragraph (c):
    This exception does not apply if the contract carrier offers a 
comparable fare and has seats available at that fare, or if the lower 
fare offered by a noncontract carrier is restricted to Government and 
military travelers on official business and may only be purchased with a 
GTR, contractor-issued charge card, or centrally billed account (e.g., 
YDG, MDG, ODG, VDG, and similar fares); or

    (d) Rail service is available and such service is cost effective and 
consistent with mission requirements; or

or more passengers may request contract service on an optional basis. 
Contract carriers may, but are not required, to furnish service to such 
groups.

    You may use a reduced group or charter fare when your agency has 
determined, on an individual case basis prior to your travel, that use 
of such a fare is cost effective. Chartered aircraft are subject to the 
same rules as Government aircraft, and agencies in the executive branch 
of the Federal Government are subject to the requirements of Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-126 and 41 CFR part 101-37 in 
making such cost effectiveness determinations.

[FTR Amdt. 108, 67 FR 57964, Sept. 13, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.112  What must I do when different airlines furnish the same 
service at different fares?

    When there is no contract fare, and common carriers furnish the same

accommodations, you must use the lowest cost service unless your agency 
determines that the use of higher cost service is more advantageous to 
the Government.


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.113  What must I do if I change or do not use a common carrier 
reservation?

    If you know you will change or not use your reservation, you must 
take action to change or cancel it as prescribed by your agency. Also, 
you must report all changes of your reservation

[[Page 27]]

according to your agency's procedures in an effort to prevent losses to 
the Government. Failure to do so may subject you to liability for any 
resulting losses.


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.114  What must I do with unused Government Transportation 
Request(s) (GTR(s)), ticket(s) or refund application(s)?

provided in Sec. 301-10.117) or any portion of an unused ticket issued 
in exchange for a GTR or billed to an agency's centrally billed account. 
However, any charges billed directly to your individually billed 
Government charge card should be credited to your account.

vacating my seat on my scheduled airline flight when the airline asks for 
          volunteers?

    Yes:
    (a) If voluntarily vacating your seat will not interfere with 
performing your official duties; and
    (b) If additional travel expenses, incurred as a result of vacating 
your seat, are borne by you and are not reimbursed; but
    (c) If volunteering delays your travel during duty hours, your 
agency will charge you with annual leave for the additional hours.

first-class accommodations under paragraph (a) through (d) of this 
section.
    (a) No other coach-class or premium-class other than first-class 
accommodation is reasonably available. ``Reasonably available'' means

(including connecting points) provide only premium-class accommodations 
and you certify such on your voucher; or

United States Information Agency, United States International 
Development Cooperation Agency, or the Arms Control Disarmament Agency,

    (e) A U.S. flag air carrier involuntarily reroutes your travel on a 
foreign air carrier; or
    (f) Service on a foreign air carrier would be three hours or less, 
and use of the U.S. flag air carrier would at least double your en route

    (b) If a U.S. flag air carrier does not offer nonstop or direct 
service (no aircraft change) between your origin and your destination, 
you must use a U.S. flag air carrier on every portion of the route where

the U.S. by 2 or more; or
    (2) Extend your travel time by at least 6 hours or more; or
    (3) Require a connecting time of 4 hours or more at an overseas 
interchange point.

[[Page 30]]


<R05>

Sec. 301-10.137  What exceptions to the Fly America Act requirements apply 
when I travel solely outside the United States, and a U.S. flag air carrier 
provides 
          service between my origin and my destination?

    You must always use a U.S. flag carrier for such travel, unless, 
when compared to using a foreign air carrier, such use would:

unreasonable risk to your safety and is approved by your agency (e.g., 
terrorist threats). Written approval of the use of foreign air carrier 
service based on an unreasonable risk to your safety must be approved by 
your agency on a case by case basis. An agency determination and 
approval of use of a foreign air carrier based on a threat against a 
U.S. flag air carrier must be supported by a travel advisory notice 
issued by the Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of 
State. An agency determination and approval of use of a foreign air 
carrier based on a threat against Government employees or other 
travelers must be supported by evidence of the threat(s) that form the 
basis of the determination and approval; or
    (3) When you can not purchase a ticket in your authorized class of 
service on a U.S. flag air carrier, and a seat is available in your 
authorized class of service on a foreign air carrier.

<R05>
Sec. 301-10.143  What is my liability if I improperly use a foreign air 
carrier?

    You will not be reimbursed for any transportation cost for which you 
improperly use foreign air carrier service. If you are authorized by 
your agency to use U.S. flag air carrier service for your entire trip, 
and you improperly use a foreign air carrier for any part of or the 
entire trip (i.e., when not permitted under this regulation), your 
transportation cost on the foreign air carrier will not be payable by 
your agency. If your agency authorizes you to use U.S. flag air carrier 
service for part of your trip and foreign air carrier service for 
another part of your trip, and you improperly use a foreign air carrier 
(i.e., when neither authorized to do so nor otherwise permitted under 
this regulation), your agency will pay the transportation cost on the 
foreign air carrier for only the portion(s) of the trip for which you 
were authorized to use foreign air carrier service. The agency must 
establish internal procedures for denying reimbursement to travelers 
when use of a foreign air carrier was neither authorized nor otherwise 
permitted under this regulation.

<R05>
Sec. 301-10.163  What is an extra-fare train?

    A train that operates at an increased fare due to the extra 
performance of the train (i.e., faster speed or fewer stops).


<R05>
Sec. 301-10.164  When may I use extra-fare train service?

advantageous to the Government and no further agency approval is needed. 
On the Amtrak Acela Express or Metroliner train service, the lowest 
available class is business and on the Amtrak Regional train service the 
lowest available class of service is coach. AMTRAK Acela and Metroliner 
first-class accommodations may be authorized/approved only as provided

<R05>
Sec. 301-11.7  What determines my maximum per diem reimbursement rate?

    Your TDY location determines your maximum per diem reimbursement 
rate. If you arrive at your lodging location after 12 midnight, you 
claim lodging cost for the preceding calendar day. If no lodging is 
required, the applicable M&IE reimbursement rate is the rate for the TDY 
location. (See Sec. 301-11.102.)

[FTR Amdt. 70, 63 FR 15961, Apr. 1, 1998; 63 FR 35537, June 30, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.8  What is the maximum per diem rate I will receive if lodging is 
not available at my TDY location?

    If lodging is not available at your TDY location, your agency may 
authorize or approve the maximum per diem rate for the location where 
lodging is obtained.


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.9  When does per diem or actual expense entitlement start/stop?

    Your per diem or actual expense entitlement starts on the day you 
depart your home, office, or other authorized point and ends on the day 
you return to your home, office or other authorized point.


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.10  Am I required to record departure/arrival dates and times on 
my travel claim?

    You must record the date of departure from, and arrival at, the 
official station or any other place travel begins or ends. You must show 
this same information for points where you perform TDY or for a stopover 
or official rest stop location when the arrival or departure affects 
your per diem allowance or other travel expenses. You also should show 
the dates for other points visited. You do not have to record departure/
arrival times, but you must annotate your travel claim when your travel 
is more than 12 hours but not exceeding 24 hours to reflect that fact.


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.11  How do I make my lodging reservations?

    You must make your lodging reservations through your agency travel 
management system as required by part 301-50 of this chapter.

[FTR Amdt. 108, 67 FR 57965, Sept. 13, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.12  How does the type of lodging I select affect my reimbursement?

    Your agency will reimburse you for different types of lodging as 
follows:
    (a) Conventional lodgings. (Hotel/motel, boarding house, etc.) You 
will be reimbursed the single occupancy rate.
    (b) Government quarters. You will be reimbursed, as a lodging 
expense, the fee or service charge you pay for use of the quarters.
    (c) Lodging with friend(s) or relative(s) (with or without charge). 
You may be reimbursed for additional costs your host incurs in 
accommodating you only if you are able to substantiate the costs and 
your agency determines them to be reasonable. You will not be reimbursed 
the cost of comparable conventional lodging in the area or a flat 
``token'' amount.
    (d) Nonconventional lodging. You may be reimbursed the cost of other 
types of lodging when there are no conventional lodging facilities in 
the area (e.g., in remote areas) or when conventional facilities are in 
short supply because of an influx of attendees at a special event (e.g., 
World's Fair or international sporting event). Such lodging includes 
college dormitories or similar

[[Page 41]]

facilities or rooms not offered commercially but made available to the 
public by area residents in their homes.
    (e) Recreational vehicle (trailer/camper). You may be reimbursed for 
expenses (parking fees, fees for connection, use, and disconnection of 
utilities, electricity, gas, water and sewage, bath or shower fees, and 
dumping fees) which may be considered as a lodging cost.


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.13  How does sharing a room with another person affect my per 
diem reimbursement?

    Your reimbursement is limited to one-half of the double occupancy 
rate if the person sharing the room is another Government employee on 
official travel. If the person sharing the room is not a Government 
employee on official travel, your reimbursement is limited to the single 
occupancy rate.


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.14  How is my daily lodging rate computed when I rent lodging on 
a long-term basis?

    When you obtain lodging on a long-term basis (e.g., weekly or 
monthly) your daily lodging rate is computed by dividing the total 
lodging cost by the number of days of occupancy for which you are 
entitled to per diem, provided the cost does not exceed the daily rate 
of conventional lodging. Otherwise the daily lodging cost is computed by 
dividing the total lodging cost by the number of days in the rental 
period. Reimbursement, including an appropriate amount for M&IE, may not 
exceed the maximum daily per diem rate for the TDY location.


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.15  What expenses may be considered part of the daily lodging 
cost when I rent on a long-term basis?

    When you rent a room, apartment, house, or other lodging on a long-
term basis (e.g., weekly, monthly), the following expenses may be 
considered part of the lodging cost:
    (a) The rental cost for a furnished dwelling; if unfurnished, the 
rental cost of the dwelling and the cost of appropriate and necessary 
furniture and appliances (e.g., stove, refrigerator, chairs, tables, 
bed, sofa, television, or vacuum cleaner);
    (b) Cost of connecting/disconnecting and using utilities;
    (c) Cost of reasonable maid fees and cleaning charges;
    (d) Monthly telephone use fee (does not include installation and 
long-distance calls); and,
    (e) If ordinarily included in the price of a hotel/motel room in the 
area concerned, the cost of special user fees (e.g., cable TV charges 
and plug-in charges for automobile head bolt heaters).


<R05>

Sec. 301-11.16  What reimbursement will I receive if I prepay my lodging 
expenses and my TDY is curtailed, canceled or interrupted for official 
purposes or for 
          other reasons beyond my control that are acceptable to my 
          agency?

    If you sought to obtain a refund or otherwise took steps to minimize 
the cost, your agency may reimburse expenses that are not refundable, 
including a forfeited rental deposit.


<R05>

Sec. 301-11.17  If my agency authorizes per diem reimbursement, will it 
reduce my M&IE allowance for a meal(s) provided by a common carrier or for 
a 
          complimentary meal(s) provided by a hotel/motel?

    No. A meal provided by a common carrier or a complimentary meal 
provided by a hotel/motel does not affect your per diem.


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.18  What M&IE rate will I receive if a meal(s) is furnished at 
nominal or no cost by the Government or is included in the registration fee?

    Your M&IE rate must be adjusted for a meal(s) furnished to you 
(except as provided in Sec. 301-11.17), with or without cost, by 
deducting the appropriate amount shown in the chart in this section for 
CONUS travel, reference Appendix B of this chapter for OCONUS travel, or 
any method determined by your agency. If you pay for a meal that has 
been previously deducted, your agency will reimburse you up to the 
deduction amount. The total amount of deductions made will not cause you 
to receive less than the amount allowed for incidental expenses.

Sec. 301-11.19  How is my per diem calculated when I travel across the 
international dateline (IDL)?

    When you cross the IDL your actual elapsed travel time will be used 
to compute your per diem entitlement rather than calendar days.


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.20  May my agency authorize a rest period for me while I am traveling?

    (a) Your agency may authorize a rest period not in excess of 24 
hours at either an intermediate point or at your destination if:
    (1) Either your origin or destination point is OCONUS;
    (2) Your scheduled flight time, including stopovers, exceeds 14 
hours;
    (3) Travel is by a direct or usually traveled route; and
    (4) Travel is by less than premium-class service.
    (b) When a rest stop is authorized the applicable per diem rate is 
the rate for the rest stop location.


<R05>

Sec. 301-11.21  Will I be reimbursed for per diem or actual expenses on leave 
or non-workdays (weekend, legal Federal Government holiday, or other scheduled 
          non-workdays) while I am on official travel?

    (a) In general, you will be reimbursed as long as your travel status 
requires your stay to include a non-workday, (e.g., if you are on travel 
through Friday and again starting Monday you will be reimbursed for 
Saturday and Sunday), however, your agency should determine the most 
cost effective situation (i.e., remaining in a travel status and paying 
per diem or actual expenses or permitting your return to your official 
station).
    (b) Your agency will determine whether you will be reimbursed for 
non-workdays when you take leave immediately (e.g., Friday or Monday) 
before of after the non-workday(s).

    Note to Sec. 301-11.21: If emergency travel is involved due to an 
incapacitating illness or injury, the rules in part 301-30 of this 
chapter govern.


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.22  Am I entitled to per diem or actual expense reimbursement 
if I am required to return to my official station on a non-workday?

    If required by your agency to return to your official station on a 
non-workday, you will be reimbursed the amount allowable for return

<R05>
Sec. 301-11.27  Are taxes included in the lodging portion of the Government 
per diem rate?

    No. Lodging taxes paid by you are reimbursable as a miscellaneous 
travel expense limited to the taxes on reimbursable lodging costs. For 
example, if your agency authorizes you a maximum lodging rate of $50 per 
night, and you elect to stay at a hotel that costs $100 per night, you 
can only claim the amount of taxes on $50, which is the maximum 
authorized lodging amount. This section is effective January 1, 1999, 
for CONUS locations and effective January 1, 2000, for non-foreign 
areas. For foreign areas, lodging taxes have not been removed from 
foreign per diem rates established by the Department of State. Separate 
claims for lodging taxes incurred in foreign areas are not allowed.

Sec. 301-11.28  As a traveler on official business, am I required to pay 
applicable lodging taxes?

    Yes, unless exempted by the State or local jurisdiction.


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.29  Are lodging facilities required to accept a generic federal, 
state or local tax exempt certificate?

    Exemptions from taxes for Federal travelers, and the forms required 
to claim them, vary from location to location. The GSA Travel Homepage 
(http://policyworks.gov/travel) lists jurisdictions where tax exempt 
certificates should be honored.


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.30  What is my option if the Government lodging rate exceeds my 
lodging reimbursement?

    You may request reimbursement on an actual expense basis, not to 
exceed 300 percent of the maximum per diem allowance.
    Approval of actual expenses is usually in advance of travel and at 
the discretion of your agency. (See Sec. 301-11.302.)

Sec. 301-11.31  Are laundry, cleaning and pressing of clothing expenses 
reimbursable?

    Yes. The expenses incurred for laundry, cleaning and pressing of 
clothing at a TDY location are reimbursable as a miscellaneous travel 
expense. However, you must incur a minimum of 4 consecutive nights 
lodging on official

[[Page 44]]

travel to qualify for this reimbursement. Laundry and dry cleaning 
expenses have not been removed from foreign per diem rates established 
by the Department of State, or from non-foreign area per diem rates 
established by the Department of Defense. Separate claims for laundry 
and dry cleaning expenses incurred in foreign areas and non-foreign 
areas are not allowed.

Sec. 301-11.32  May I be reimbursed for an advance room deposit in situations 
where a lodging facility requires the payment of a deposit, prior to the 
beginning 
          of my scheduled official travel?

    Yes, your agency may reimburse you for an advance room deposit, when 
such a deposit is required by the lodging facility to secure a room 
reservation, prior to the beginning of your scheduled official travel. 
However, if you are reimbursed the advance room deposit, but fail to 
perform the scheduled official travel for reasons not acceptable to your 
agency, resulting in forfeit of the deposit, you are indebted to the 
Government for that amount and must repay it in a manner prescribed by 
your agency.

    When:
    (a) Lodging and/or meals are procured at a prearranged place such as 
a hotel where a meeting, conference or training session is held;
    (b) Costs have escalated because of special events (e.g., missile 
launching periods, sporting events, World's Fair, conventions, natural 
disasters); lodging and meal expenses within prescribed allowances 
cannot be obtained nearby; and costs to commute to/from the nearby 
location consume most or all of the savings achieved from occupying less 
expensive lodging;
    (c) Because of mission requirements; or
    (d) Any other reason approved within your agency.


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.301  Who in my agency can authorize/approve my request for 
actual expense?

    Any official designated by the head of your agency.


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.302  When should I request authorization for reimbursement under 
actual expense?

    Request for authorization for reimbursement under actual expense 
should be made in advance of travel. However, subject to your agency's 
policy, after the fact approvals may be granted when supported by an 
explanation acceptable to your agency.


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.303  What is the maximum amount that I may be reimbursed under 
actual expense?

    The maximum amount that you may be reimbursed under actual expense

applicable maximum per diem rate. However, subject to your agency's 
policy, a lesser amount may be authorized.


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.304  What if my expenses are less than the authorized amount?

    When authorized actual expense and your expenses are less than the 
locality per diem rate or the authorized amount, reimbursement is 
limited to the expenses incurred.


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.305  What if my actual expenses exceed the 300 percent ceiling?

    Your reimbursement is limited to the 300 percent ceiling. There is 
no authority to exceed this ceiling.


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.306  What expenses am I required to itemize under actual expense?

    You must itemize all expenses, including meals, (each meal must be 
itemized separately) for which you will be reimbursed under actual 
expense. However, expenses that do not accrue daily (e.g., laundry, dry 
cleaning, etc.) may be averaged over the number of days your agency 
authorizes/approves actual expenses. Receipts are required for lodging, 
regardless of amount and any individual meal when the cost exceeds $75. 
Your agency may require receipts for other allowable per diem expenses, 
but it must inform you of this requirement in advance of travel. When 
your agency limits M&IE reimbursement to either the prescribed maximum 
M&IE rate for the locality concerned or a reduced M&IE rate, it may or 
may not require M&IE itemization at its discretion.

Sec. 301-11.521  Must I file a claim to be reimbursed for the additional 
income taxes incurred?

    Yes. A claim must be submitted in accordance with your agency's

<R05>

Sec. 301-11.522  If I was assessed an income tax penalty and/or interest 
payment due to incorrect income tax withholdings, are those payments

    Your agency will determine what documentation is sufficient. (See 
Sec. 301-11.531.)


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.524  What steps must my agency take to determine my ITRA?

    Your agency should:

title or copies of completed Federal, State and local tax return for the 
tax year in which the taxes were withheld and paid.
    (b) Copies of W-2's and Form 1099's.
    (c) Any documentation received from the IRS identifying any interest 
or penalty payment (tax years 1993 and 1994 only).

<R05>
Sec. 301-11.532  How should we compute the employee's ITRA?

    You should follow the procedures prescribed for the relocation 
income tax allowance, see Sec. 302-11.7, Sec. 302-11.8 and Appendices A,

Government to withhold the appropriate income taxes are reimbursable.


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.534  What tax tables should we use to calculate the amount of 
allowable reimbursement?

    The tax tables for the year the tax was incurred are to be used.


<R05>
Sec. 301-11.535  How should we calculate the ITRA?

    (a) Use the documents prescribed in Sec. 301-11.531 to calculate the 
ITRA as follows:

the procedures and the marginal tax tables established for the 
relocation income tax allowance in Sec. 302-11.7, Sec. 302-11.8 and 
Appendices A, B, C and D to part 302-11 of this title; and

meals and laundry/cleaning expenses if:
    (a) Your temporary living accommodations do not have kitchen or 
laundry facilities; or
    (b) Your agency determines that other extenuating circumstances 
exist which necessitate payment of these expenses.

Sec. 301-31.10  How will my agency pay my subsistence expenses?

    Your agency will pay your actual subsistence expenses not to exceed 
the ``maximum allowable amount'' for the period you or your family 
occupy temporary living accommodations. The ``maximum allowable amount'' 
is the ``maximum daily amount'' multiplied by the number of days you or 
your family occupy temporary living accommodations not to exceed the 
number of days authorized. The ``maximum daily amount'' is determined by 
adding the rates in the following table for you and each member of your 
family authorized to occupy temporary living accommodations:

noted.


<R05>
Sec. 301-50.1  How should I arrange my travel?

    If your agency provides travel management services under a 
Government contract, you must use those services, to arrange for common 
carrier transportation, lodging, and rental car(s). If your agency does 
not provide travel management services under a Government contract, you 
must arrange your travel according to your agency's policy. Services 
under a Government contract may be furnished by a commercial travel 
agent, electronic travel services system, or other travel management 
services provider.


<R05>
Sec. 301-50.2  What is my liability if I use an unauthorized travel agent or 
unauthorized travel management system?

    You are responsible for any additional costs that result from the 
unauthorized use, and you are subject to any penalties your agency may 
impose.


<R05>
Sec. 301-50.3  Are there any limits on the travel arrangements I may make?

    Yes, there are limits on the travel arrangements you may make for 
common carrier, commercial lodging, and car rental accommodations.
    (a) Common carrier accommodations. If your agency is a mandatory 
user of the GSA city-pair fare contract for air passenger 
transportation, you must use the contract carrier, unless you have an 
approved exemption as cited in Secs. 301-10.107 and 301-10.108 of this 
chapter.
    (b) Lodging accommodations. You should always stay in a ``fire 
safe'' facility. This is a facility that meets the fire safety 
requirements of the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990, as amended 
(see 5 U.S.C. 5707a). When selecting a commercial lodging facility, 
first consideration must be given to the commercial lodging facilities 
contracted by GSA under the Federal Premier Lodging Program (FPLP) that 
meet the fire safety requirements, where available, unless one or more 
of the following conditions exist. (A list of FPLP facilities may be 
found at http://policyworks.gov/perdiem). If a FPLP facility is not 
available in the location you need, your agency's designated TMS must 
provide you with a list of alternative facilities that meet the fire 
safe requirements of the Act.
    (1) There are no FPLP facilities under contract within a reasonable 
proximity of your temporary duty location;
    (2) There are no vacancies at the available FPLP facilities;
    (3) Your agency has other contractual arrangements with commercial 
lodging facilities that meet the FEMA fire safe requirements;
    (4) Your agency determines on a case-by-case basis that it is not 
practical to use FPLP facilities to meet mission requirements;
    (5) You are attending a conference with prearranged lodging 
accommodations and to ensure that the set aside rooms are used attendees 
are required to book lodging directly with the lodging facility; or
    (6) Your travel is OCONUS.
    (c) Rental vehicles. When authorized to use a rental vehicle under 
Sec. 301-10.450 of this chapter, you must rent a vehicle from a vendor 
that participates in the Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC) 
Government Car Rental Agreement, unless you are OCONUS, and no agreement 
is in place for your TDY location. MTMC has negotiated rental car 
agreements that include

Sec. 301-51.202  When must I account for my advance?

authorization, your agency may reimburse you the full amount of your 
travel expenses without any deduction of your advance until such time as 
you file a final voucher. If the amount advanced is less than the amount

amount. If the advance exceeds the reimbursable amount, you must 
immediately refund the excess.

must my agency notify me of any error that would prevent payment within 30 
calendar 
          days after submission?

    Your agency must notify you as soon as practicable after you submit 
your travel claim of any error that would prevent payment within 30 
calendar days after submission and must provide the reason(s) why your 
travel claim is not proper. However, not later than May 1, 2002, 
agencies must achieve a maximum time period of seven working days for 
notifying you that your travel claim is not proper.

amount, based on an agencywide average of travel claim payments; and
    (c) In addition to the fee required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section, your agency must also pay you an amount equivalent to any 
late payment charge that the card contractor would have been able to 
charge you had you not paid the bill.

[FTR Amdt. 92, 65 FR 21366, Apr. 21, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 301-52.21  Is there a minimum amount the late payment fee must exceed 
before my agency will pay it to me?

    Yes, a late payment fee will only be paid when the computed late 
payment fee is $1.00 or greater.

[FTR Amdt. 90, 65 FR 3056, Jan. 19, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 301-52.22  Will any late payment fees I receive be reported as wages 
on a Form W-2?

    No, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has determined that the late 
payment fee is in the nature of interest (compensation for the use of 
money). Your agency will report payments in accordance with IRS 
guidelines.

<R05>

Form W-2.

<R05>
Sec. 301-52.24  Does mandatory use of the Government contractor-issued travel 
charge card change my obligation to pay my travel card bill by the due date?

    No, mandatory use of the Government contractor-issued travel charge 
card does not relieve you of your obligation to pay your bill in 
accordance with your cardholder agreement.

refer to the employee.


<R05>
Sec. 301-53.2  What may I do with promotional benefits or materials I 
receive from a travel service provider?

    Any promotional benefits or materials received from a travel service 
provider in connection with official travel may be retained for personal 
use, if such items are obtained under the same conditions as those 
offered to the general public and at no additional cost to the 
Government.

    Note to Sec. 301-53.2: Promotional benefits or materials you receive 
from a travel service provider in connection with your planning and/or 
scheduling an official conference or other group travel (as opposed to 
performing official travel yourself) are considered property of the 
Government, and you may only accept the benefits or materials on behalf 
of the Federal Government (see Sec. 301-74.1(d) of this chapter).

<R05>
Sec. 301-53.3  How may I use promotional materials and frequent traveler 
benefits?

    Promotional materials and frequent traveler benefits may be used as 
follows:
    (a) You may use frequent traveler benefits earned on official travel 
to obtain travel services for a subsequent official travel 
assignment(s); however, you may also retain such benefits for your 
personal use, including upgrading to a higher class of service while on 
official travel.
    (b) If you are offered such benefits as a result of your role as a 
conference planner or as a planner for other group travel, you may not 
retain such benefits for your personal use (see Sec. 301-53.2 of this 
chapter). Rather, you may only accept such benefits on behalf of the 
Federal Government. Such accepted benefits may only be used for official 
Government business.

[FTR Amdt. 2003-04, 68 FR 27937, May 22, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 301-53.4  May I select travel service providers for which my agency is 
not a mandatory user in order to maximize my frequent traveler benefits?

    No, you may not select a traveler service provider based on whether 
it provides frequent traveler benefits. You must use the travel service 
provider for which your agency is a mandatory user. This includes 
contract passenger transportation services and travel management 
systems. You may not choose a travel service provider to gain frequent 
traveler benefits for personal use. (Also see Secs. 301-10.109 and 301-
10.110 of this chapter.)


<R05>
Sec. 301-53.5  Are there exceptions to the mandatory use of contract 
city-pair fares and an agency's travel management system?

    Yes, the exceptions are in accordance with Secs. 301-10.107 and 301-
10.108 of this chapter for the mandatory use of a contract city-pair

for which I may retain compensation received from an airline whether 
voluntary or 
          involuntary?

<R04>
               Subpart A--General Policies and Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.1  How must we administer the authorization and payment of travel 
expenses?

    You must limit the authorization and payment of travel expenses to 
travel that is necessary to accomplish your mission in the most 
economical and effective manner, in accordance with the rules stated 
throughout this chapter. Consideration should be given, but not limited, 
to budget constraints, adherence to travel policies, and reasonableness 
of expenses. You should always consider alternatives, including 
teleconferencing, prior to authorizing travel.


<R04>
      Subpart B--Policies and Procedures Relating to Transportation


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.100  How must we administer the authorization and payment of 
transportation expenses?

    You must:
    (a) Limit authorization and payment of transportation expenses to 
those expenses that result in the greatest advantage to the Government;
    (b) Ensure that travel is by the most expeditious means practicable.


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.101  What factors must we consider in determining which method 
of transportation results in the greatest advantage to the Government?

    In selecting a particular method of transportation you must 
consider:
    (a) The total cost to the Government, including per diem, overtime, 
lost worktime, actual transportation cost, total distance of travel, 
number of points visited, the number of travelers and energy 
conservation. As stated in 5 U.S.C. 5733, ``travel of an employee shall 
be by the most expeditious means of transportation practicable and shall 
be commensurate with the nature and purpose of the duties of the 
employee requiring such travel.''
    (b) Travel by common carrier (air, rail, bus) is considered the most 
advantageous method to perform official travel. Other methods of 
transportation may be authorized as advantageous only when the use of 
common carrier transportation would interfere with the performance of 
official business or impose an undue hardship upon the traveler, or when 
the total cost by common carrier exceeds the cost by another method of 
transportation. A determination that another method of transportation is 
more advantageous to the Government than common carrier will not be made 
on the basis of personal preference or inconvenience to the traveler.

[[Page 68]]


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.102  What governing policies must we establish for authorization 
and payment of transportation expenses?

    You must establish policies and procedures governing:
    (a) Who will determine what method of transportation is more 
advantageous to the Government;
    (b) Who will approve any of the following:
    (1) Use of premium class service under Sec. 301-10.123, Sec. 301-
10.124, Sec. 301-10.162 and Sec. 301-10.183 of this chapter;
    (2) Use of a special-reduced fare or reduced group or charter fare;
    (3) Use of an extra-fare train service under Sec. 301-10.164;
    (4) Use of ship service;
    (5) Use of a foreign ship;
    (6) Use of a foreign air carrier;
    (c) When you will:
    (1) Require the use of a Government vehicle;
    (2) Allow the use of a Government vehicle; and
    (3) Prohibit the use of a Government vehicle;
    (d) When you will consider use of a POV advantageous to the 
Government, such as travel to/from common carrier terminals, or 
transportation to a TDY location;
    (e) Procedures for claiming POV reimbursement;
    (f) When you will allow use of a special conveyance (e.g. 
commercially rented vehicles);
    (g) What procedures an employee must follow when he/she travels by 
an indirect route or interrupts travel by a direct route; and
    (h) For local transportation whether to reimburse the full amount of 
transportation costs or only the amount by which transportation costs 
exceed the employee's normal costs for transportation between:
    (1) Office or duty point and another place of business;
    (2) Places of business; or
    (3) Residence and place of business other than office or duty point.


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.103  In what circumstance may we authorize use of ship service?

    Travel by ship is not generally regarded as advantageous. You must 
determine that the advantages accruing from the use of ocean 
transportation offset the higher costs associated with ship travel, 
i.e., per diem, transportation, and lost worktime.


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.104  What factors should we consider in determining whether to 
require an employee to commit to the use of a Government automobile?

    You should consider:
    (a) The advantages of using a Government automobile. Such advantages 
may include, but are not limited to:
    (1) Full utilization or availability of fleet vehicles;
    (2) Lower cost;
    (3) Official presence.
    (b) The type of travel the employee performs. You should require 
such a commitment when an employee or group of employees requires the 
use of an automobile for official travel on a frequent or repetitive 
basis.


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.105  May we prohibit an employee from using a POV on official 
travel?

    No, but if the employee elects to use a POV instead of an 
alternative form of transportation you authorize, you must:
    (a) Limit reimbursement to the constructive cost of the authorized 
method of transportation, which is the sum of per diem and 
transportation expenses the employee would reasonably have incurred when 
traveling by the authorized method of transportation; and
    (b) Charge leave for any duty hours that are missed as a result of 
travel by POV.


<R04>
    Subpart C--Policies and Procedures Relating to Per Diem Expenses

to his/her official station on non-workdays;

[[Page 69]]

    (d) Who will determine if an employee will be allowed to return to 
his/her official station on a case by case basis.
    (e) Who will determine in what instances you will pay a reduced per 
diem rate;
    (f) Who will determine, and in what instances, actual expenses are 
appropriate in each individual case; and
    (g) If you will define a radius broader than the official station in 
which per diem or actual expense will not be authorized.


<R04>
  Subpart D--Policies and Procedures Relating to Miscellaneous Expenses


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.300  How should we administer the authorization and payment of 
miscellaneous expenses?

    You should limit payment of miscellaneous expenses to only those 
expenses that are necessary and in the interest of the Government.


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.301  What governing policies must we establish for payment of 
miscellaneous expenses?

    You must establish policies and procedures governing:
    (a) Who will determine when excess baggage is necessary for official 
travel;
    (b) When you will pay for communications services, including whether 
you will pay for a telephone call to the employee's home or place where 
the employee's dependent children are;
    (c) Who will determine if other miscellaneous expenses are 
appropriate for reimbursement in connection with official travel.


<R04>
  Subpart E--Policies and Procedures Relating to Travel of an Employee 
                    with a Disability or Special Need


<R05>

Sec. 301-70.400  How should we authorize and administer the payment of 
additional travel expenses for an employee with a disability or special 
need?

    You should authorize and administer the payment to reasonably 
accommodate employee(s) with disabilities in accordance with the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 701-797(b) and 5 
U.S.C. 3102 and Part 301-13 of this chapter. An employee with a special 
need should be treated the same as an employee with a disability. The 
additional travel expenses must be necessary to accommodate the 
employee's needs.

[FTR Amdt. 70, 63 FR 15971, Apr. 1, 1998; 63 FR 35538, June 30, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.401  What governing policies and procedures must we establish 
regarding travel of an employee with a disability or special need?

    You must establish the policies and procedures governing:
    (a) Who will determine if an employee has a disability or special 
need which requires accommodation, including when documentation is 
necessary under Sec. Sec. 301-10.123, 301-10.124, 301-10.162, and 301-
10.183, and when a determination may be based on a clearly visible 
physical condition; and
    (b) Who will determine how to reasonably accommodate the employee 
and what expenses you will pay.


<R04>
Subpart F--Policies and Procedures for Emergency Travel of Employee Due 
                          to Illness or Injury


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.500  What governing policies and procedures should we establish 
relating to emergency travel?

    Each agency must determine:
    (a) When you will authorize emergency travel under part 301-30;
    (b) Who will determine if the employee's situation warrants payment 
for emergency travel expenses;
    (c) When and by whom travel to an alternate location other than 
official station or point of interruption will be authorized; and
    (d) Who will determine when and if the definition of family may be 
extended and to whom.


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.501  Does per diem continue when an employee interrupts a travel 
assignment because of an incapacitating illness or injury?

    Yes, when an employee interrupts a travel assignment because of an 
incapacitating illness or injury and takes leave (annual or sick), per 
diem will be allowed, not to exceed the maximum

[[Page 70]]

rate for the location where the interruption occurs, for a reasonable 
period, normally not to exceed 14 calendar days (including fractional 
days) for any one period of absence. You may approve a longer period if 
justified.

[FTR Amdt. 108, 67 FR 57967, Sept. 13, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.502  Are there any limitations to the payment of these expenses?

    Yes, there are limitations to the payment of these expenses. Per 
diem is not payable, or if paid, must be collected from the employee 
when--
    (a) The employee is confined to a hospital or medical facility that 
is within the proximity of the official duty station or that is the same 
one the employee would have been admitted to if the illness or injury 
had occurred while at the official duty station; and/or
    (b) The Government provides or reimburses the employee for 
hospitalization under any Federal statute (including hospitalization in 
a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center or military 
hospital) other than 5 U.S.C. 8901-8913 (Federal Employees Health 
Benefits program).

[FTR Amdt. 108, 67 FR 57967, Sept. 13, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.503  What additional emergency expenses should we allow?

    When an employee discontinues a TDY assignment before its completion 
due to an incapacitating illness or injury, you may pay--
    (a) Transportation and per diem expenses for travel to an alternate 
location to receive medical treatment;
    (b) Transportation and per diem expenses to return to the official 
station; and
    (c) Transportation costs of a medically necessary attendant.

[FTR Amdt. 108, 67 FR 57967, Sept. 13, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.504  When the employee is able to travel, should we continue the 
use of the existing travel authorization?

    Not if the interrupted trip was authorized under a trip by trip 
authorization. If, when the employee's health has been restored, the 
agency decides that it is in the Government's interest to return the 
employee to the TDY location, such return is considered to be a new 
travel assignment at Government expense. An interrupted trip authorized 
under an open or limited open authorization may be continued without 
further authorization.

[FTR Amdt. 70, 63 FR 15971, Apr. 1, 1998. Redesignated by FTR Amdt. 108, 
67 FR 57967, Sept. 13, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 301-70.505  May any travel costs be reimbursed if the employee travels 
to an alternate location for medical treatment?

    Yes. When an employee, interrupts a TDY assignment because of an 
incapacitating illness or injury and takes leave of absence for travel 
to an alternate location to obtain medical services and returns to the 
TDY assignment, you may reimburse certain excess travel costs provided 
in this section. Specifically, you may reimburse the excess (if any) of 
actual costs of travel from the point of interruption to the alternate 
location and return to the TDY assignment, over the constructive costs 
of round-trip travel between the official station and the alternate 
location. The nearest hospital or medical facility capable of treating 
the employee's illness or injury will not, however, be considered an 
alternate location.

    Note to Sec. 301-70.504: An alternate location is a destination 
other than the employee's official station or the point of interruption.

[FTR Amdt. 70, 63 FR 15971, Apr. 1, 1998. Redesignated by FTR Amdt. 108,

<R05>

Sec. 301-70.506  How do we define actual cost and constructive cost when an 
employee interrupts a travel assignment because of an incapacitating illness 
or 
          injury?

    (a) Actual cost of travel will be the transportation expenses 
incurred and en route per diem for the travel as actually performed from 
the point of interruption to the alternate location and from the 
alternate location to the TDY assignment. No per diem is allowed for 
time spent at the alternate location if confined to a medical facility.
    (b) Constructive cost is the sum of transportation expenses the 
employee would reasonably have incurred for round-trip travel between 
the official

[[Page 71]]

station and the alternate location plus per diem calculated for the 
appropriate en route travel time.

<R05>
Sec. 301-70.507  May we authorize per diem if an employee discontinues a TDY 
assignment because of a personal emergency situation?

    Yes. Expenses of appropriate transportation and per diem while en 
route may be allowed, with the approval of an appropriate agency 
official, for return travel from the point of interruption to the 
official station.

[FTR Amdt. 70, 63 FR 15971, Apr. 1, 1998. Redesignated by FTR Amdt. 108,

<R05>

Sec. 301-70.508  How do we handle reimbursement if the employee travels to 
an alternate location and returns to the TDY location because of a personal 
emergency 
          situation?

    You may reimburse certain excess travel costs (transportation and en 
route per diem) to the same extent as provided in Sec. 301-70.501 for 
incapacitating illness or injury to the employee.

<R05>
Sec. 301-70.509  What factors must we consider in expanding the definition 
of family for emergency travel purposes?

    Agencies must consider on a case by case basis:
    (a) The extent of the emergency;
    (b) The employee's relationship to the individual involved in the 
emergency; and
    (c) The degree of the employee's responsibility for the individual 
involved in the emergency.

threatened law enforcement/investigative employees, under part 301-31 of 
this chapter;
    (b) Who will determine the degree and seriousness of threat in each

Sec. 301-70.601  What factors should we consider in determining whether to 
authorize payment of transportation and subsistence expenses for threatened 
law 
          enforcement/investigative employees?

    You should consider:

transportation and subsistence expenses only if a situation poses a 
legitimate serious threat to life.
    (b) The option of relocating the employee. You should consider 
whether relocating the employee permanently would be advantageous given 
the specific nature of the threat, the continued disruption of the 
family, and the alternative costs of a change of official station.

<R05>

Sec. 301-70.602  How often must we reevaluate the payment of transportation 
and subsistence expenses to a threatened law enforcement/investigative 
employee?

    You must reevaluate the situation every 30 days based on the same

expenses.

    To reduce travel charge card delinquencies by your employees, you 
should consider implementing one or more of the following suggestions 
(this list is not comprehensive; you may adopt other appropriate 
procedures):
    (a) Agency travel program coordinators must be trained and aware of 
their responsibilities and the delinquency management tools available 
under your agreement with the travel charge card contractor (internet 
training is available for the GSA SmartPay(<SUP>TM</SUP>) Travel Charge 
Card at: http://fss.gsa.gov/training/transtrav.
    (b) Ensure that managers and supervisors are provided monthly 
delinquency and questionable charges report.
    (c) Periodically, but at least once a year, verify that cardholders 
are still current employees.
    (d) For inactive accounts (cards not used within 6 months, one year, 
etc., reduce card limit to $1, increase dollar limit when necessary.
    (e) Work with the charge card contractor to block certain high-risk 
category codes (e.g. department stores, automobile dealerships, 
specialty stores), etc.
    (f) Review ATM cash withdrawals for reasonableness and association 
with official travel.
    (g) Implement a salary offset program. (See part 301-76 of this 
chapter).
    (h) Implement split disbursement in your travel vouchering system, 
so that an employee may authorize you to make certain payments directly 
to the charge card contractor on the employee's behalf.
    (i) Refer potential fraud cases to your agency IG for investigation.
    (j) For some helpful do's and don'ts for travel cardholders see GSA 
publication (Card-F001) entitled ``But I didn't know * * * --Helpful 
Hints for Travel Cardholders''. This publication is available on the 
internet at http://fss.gsa.gov/services/gsa-smartpay, click on GSA 
SmartPay Agency Information, click on ``But I didn't know * * * --
Helpful Hints for Travel Cardholders''. You may print or call for 
telephone numbers listed for copies.
    (k) Ensure that employees turn in their travel charge card when they 
retire or leave the agency.

must be paid for any proper travel claim not reimbursed within 30 
calendar days of submission to the approving official.

[FTR Amdt. 92, 65 FR 3057, Jan. 19, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 301-71.210  How do we calculate late payment fees?

    Late payment fees are calculated either by:
    (a) Using the prevailing Prompt Payment Act Interest Rate beginning 
on the 31st day after submission of a proper travel claim and ending on 
the date on which payment is made; or
    (b) A flat fee, of not less than the prompt payment amount, based on 
an agencywide average of travel claim payments; and
    (c) In addition to the fee required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section, you must also pay an amount equivalent to any late payment 
charge that the card contractor would have been able to charge had the 
employee not paid the bill. Payment of this additional fee will be based 
upon the effective date that a late payment charge would be allowed 
under the agreement between the employee and the card contractor.

[FTR Amdt. 92, 65 FR 21366, Apr. 21, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 301-71.211  Is there a minimum amount the late payment fee must exceed 
before we will pay it?

    Yes, a late payment fee will only be paid when the computed late 
payment fee is $1.00 or greater.

[FTR Amdt. 90, 65 FR 3058, Jan. 19, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 301-71.212  Should we report late payment fees as wages on a Form W-2?

    No, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has determined that the late 
payment fee is in the nature of interest (compensation for the use of 
money).

[FTR Amdt. 90, 65 FR 3058, Jan. 19, 2000]


<R05>

Sec. 301-71.213  Is the additional fee, which is the equivalent to any late 
payment charge that the card contractor would have been able to charge had 
the 
          employee not paid the bill, considered income?

    Yes, you must report this late payment fee as additional wages on 
Form W-2.

[FTR Amdt. 90, 65 FR 3058, Jan. 19, 2000]


<R05>

Sec. 301-71.214  Does mandatory use of the Government contractor-issued 
travel charge card change the employee's obligation to pay his/her travel 
card bill by 
          the due date?

    No, mandatory use of the Government contractor-issued travel charge 
card does not relieve the employee of his/her obligation to honor his/
her cardholder payment agreement.

[FTR Amdt. 90, 65 FR 3058, Jan. 19, 2000]


<R04>
                Subpart D--Accounting for Travel Advances


<R05>
Sec. 301-71.300  What is the policy governing the use of travel advances?

    You should minimize the use of cash travel advances. However, you 
should not require an employee to pay travel expenses using personal 
funds unless the employee has elected not to use alternative resources 
provided by the Government, such as a Government contractor-issued 
charge card.


<R05>

Sec. 301-71.301  In situations where a lodging facility requires the payment 
of a deposit, may we reimburse an employee for an advance room deposit prior 
to the 
          beginning of scheduled official travel?

    Yes, you may reimburse an employee an advance room deposit, when 
such a deposit is required by the lodging facility to secure a room 
reservation, prior to the beginning of an employee's scheduled official 
travel. However, if the employee is reimbursed the advance room deposit, 
but fails to perform the scheduled official travel for reasons not 
acceptable to the agency, resulting in the forfeit of the deposit,

[[Page 79]]

the employee is indebted to the Government and must repay that amount in 
a timely manner as prescribed by you.

[FTR Amdt. 108, 67 FR 57967, Sept. 13, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 301-71.302  For how long may we issue a travel advance?

    You may issue a travel advance for a reasonable period not to exceed 
45 days.

[FTR Amdt. 70, 63 FR 15974, Apr. 1, 1998. Redesignated by FTR Amdt. 108, 
67 FR 57967, Sept. 13, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 301-71.303  What data must we capture in our travel advance accounting 
system?

    You must capture the following data:
    (a) The name and social security number of each employee who has an 
advance;
    (b) The amount of the advance;
    (c) The date of issuance; and
    (d) The date of reconciliation for unused portions of travel 
advances.

travel advances?

    Yes.

67 FR 57967, Sept. 13, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 301-71.305  When must an employee account for a travel advance?

    An employee must account for an outstanding travel advance each time 
a travel claim is filed. If the employee receives a travel advance but 
determines that the related travel will not be performed, then the 
employee must inform you that the travel will not be performed and repay 
the advance at that time.

[FTR Amdt. 70, 63 FR 15974, Apr. 1, 1998. Redesignated by FTR Amdt. 108, 
67 FR 57967, Sept. 13, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 301-71.306  Are there exceptions to collecting an advance at the time 
the employee files a travel claim?

    Yes, when the employee is in a continuous travel status and
    (a) You review each outstanding travel advance on a periodic basis 
(the period will be for a reasonable time of 45 days or less); and
    (b) You determine the amount, if any, of the outstanding balance 
exceeds the amount of estimated travel expenses for the authorized 
period and collect the excess amount from the employee.

[FTR Amdt. 70, 63 FR 15974, Apr. 1, 1998. Redesignated by FTR Amdt. 108, 
67 FR 57967, Sept. 13, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 301-71.307  How do we collect the amount of a travel advance in excess 
of the amount of travel expenses substantiated by the employee?

    When the outstanding advance exceeds what you owe the employee, then 
the employee must submit cash or a check for the difference in 
accordance with your policy. Your failure to collect the amount in 
excess of substantiated expenses will cause a violation of the 
accountable plan rules contained in the Internal Revenue Code (title 26 
of the United States Code).

[FTR Amdt. 70, 63 FR 15974, Apr. 1, 1998. Redesignated by FTR Amdt. 108, 
67 FR 57967, Sept. 13, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 301-71.308  What should we do if the employee does not pay back a travel 
advance when the travel claim is filed?

    You should take alternative steps to collect the debt including:
    (a) Offset against the employee's salary, a retirement credit, or 
other amount owed the employee;
    (b) Deduction from an amount the Government owes the employee; or
    (c) Any other legal method of recovery.

<R05>
Sec. 301-71.309  What internal policies and procedures must we establish 
governing travel advances?

    Accounting for cash advances for travel, recovery, and reimbursement 
shall be in accordance with procedures prescribed by the General 
Accounting Office (see General Accounting Office Policy and Procedures

<R04>
         Subpart A--Procurement of Common Carrier Transportation


<R05>
Sec. 301-72.1  Why is common carrier presumed to be the most advantageous 
method of transportation?

    Travel by common carrier is presumed to be the most advantageous 
method of transportation because it generally results in the most 
efficient, least costly, most expeditious means of transportation and 
the most efficient use of energy resources.


<R05>
Sec. 301-72.2  May we utilize methods of transportation other than common 
carrier (e.g. POVs, chartered vehicles, etc.)?

    Yes, but only when use of common carrier transportation:
    (a) Would interfere with the performance of official business;
    (b) Would impose an undue hardship upon the traveler; or
    (c) When the total cost by common carrier would exceed the cost of 
the other method of transportation.


<R05>
Sec. 301-72.3  What method of payment must we authorize for common carrier 
transportation?

    You must authorize one or more of the following as appropriate:

travelers checks or authorized ATM cash withdrawals) when the cost of 
transportation is less than $100, under Sec. 301-51.100 of this chapter 
(cash may or may not be accepted by the carrier for the purchase of city 
pair fares); or
    (d) GTR(s) when no other option is available or feasible.

<R04>
         Subpart B--Accounting for Common Carrier Transportation


<R05>
Sec. 301-72.100  What must my travel accounting system do in relation to 
common carrier transportation?

    Your system must:
    (a) Authorize the use of cash in accordance with Sec. 301-51.100 or 
as otherwise required;
    (b) Correlate travel data accumulated by your authorization and 
claims accounting systems with common carrier transportation documents 
and data for audit purposes;
    (c) Identify unused tickets for refund;
    (d) Collect unused, partially used, or downgraded/exchanged tickets, 
from travelers upon completion of travel;
    (e) Track denied boarding compensation from employees;
    (f) Identify and collect refunds due from carriers for overpayments, 
or unused, partially used, or downgraded/exchanged tickets; and
    (g) Reconcile all centrally billed travel expenses (e.g. airline, 
lodging, car rentals, etc.) with travel authorizations and claims to 
assure that only authorized charges are paid.


<R05>
Sec. 301-72.101  What information should we provide an employee before 
authorizing the use of common carrier transportation?

    You should provide the employee:
    (a) Notice that he/she is accountable for all tickets, GTRs and 
other transportation documents;
    (b) Your procedures for the control and accounting of common carrier 
transportation documents, including the procedures for submitting 
unused, partially used, downgraded/exchanged tickets, refund receipts or 
ticket refund applications, and denied boarding compensation; and
    (c) A credit/refund address so the carrier can credit/refund the 
agency for unused tickets (when the tickets have been issued using an 
agency centrally billed account or by GTR).


<R04>
  Subpart C--Cash Payments for Procuring Common Carrier Transportation 
                                Services


<R05>
Sec. 301-72.200  Under what conditions may we authorize cash payments for 
procuring common carrier transportation services?

    In accordance with Sec. 301-51.100.


<R05>
Sec. 301-72.201  What must we do if an employee uses cash in excess of the 
$100 limit to purchase common carrier transportation?

    To justify the use of cash in excess of $100, both the agency and 
traveler must certify on the travel claim the necessity for such use. 
See 41 CFR 101-41.203-2.


<R05>
Sec. 301-72.202  Who may approve cash payments in excess of the $100 limit?

approval of cash payments over the $100 limit is in accordance with 41 
CFR 101-41.203-2.


<R05>
Sec. 301-72.203  When may we limit traveler reimbursement for a cash payment?

    If you determine that the cash payment was made under a non-
emergency circumstance, reimbursement to the traveler must not exceed 
the cost which would have been properly chargeable to the Government had 
the traveler used a government provided payment resource, (e.g. 
individual Government contractor-issued travel charge card, centrally 
billed account, or GTR). However, an agency can determine to make full 
payment when circumstances warrant (e.g. invitational travel, infrequent 
travelers and interviewees).

    Yes.


<R05>
Sec. 301-73.101  What are the basic services that should be covered by a 
travel management system?

    The travel management system selected should, as a minimum include:
    (a) The ability to provide the following as appropriate to the 
agency's travel needs:
    (1) Common carrier information (e.g., flight confirmation and seat 
assignment; compliance with the Fly America Act, governmentwide travel 
policies, and contract city-pair fares, electronic ticketing and ticket 
delivery);
    (2) Lodging information (e.g., room availability and confirmation, 
compliance with Hotel/Motel Fire Safety Act, per diem rate 
acceptability);
    (3) Car rental information (e.g. availability of Government rate and 
confirmation of reservations).
    (b) Provide basic management information, such as:
    (1) Number of reservations by type of service (common carrier, 
lodging, and car rental);
    (2) Policy compliance and reasons for exceptions;
    (3) Origin and destination points of common carrier use;

<R05>
Sec. 301-73.102  Must we require travelers to use a travel management system?

    Yes, you must use a TMS selected by you for all common carrier, 
lodging, and car rental accommodations to ensure compliance with the 
Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990, as amended (see 5 U.S.C. 
5707a). A TMS, as defined in Sec. 300-3.1 of this chapter, provides the 
services required by Sec. 301-73.101 of this part. You must require that 
travelers use the TMS selected by you to make common carrier, lodging, 
and car rental reservations, unless an exemption is granted under 
Sec. 301-73.103 of this part.

[FTR Amdt. 108, 67 FR 57968, Sept. 13, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 301-73.103  Are there any exceptions to this requirement?

    Yes, exceptions to this requirement may be made as follows:
    (a) An agency head, or his/her designee, may exempt certain types of 
travel arrangements from the mandatory use of the TMS. In certain 
situations, it may be impractical to make

[[Page 84]]

advance reservations, and therefore no reason exists to use a TMS.
    (b) Attending a conference where the conference sponsor has 
negotiated with one or more lodging facilities to set aside a specific 
number of rooms for conference attendees. To ensure that the set aside 
rooms are used attendees are required to book lodging directly with the 
lodging facility.
    (c) When lodging accommodations are required for travel OCONUS.
    Note to Sec. 301-73.103: Agencies may have preexisting contractual 
arrangements with a TMS, which require use of a TMS even though the FTR 
does not. Agencies must alert their employees to any such requirements.

                   Subpart A--Agency Responsibilities

    Note to Subpart A: Use of pronouns ``we'', ``you'', and their 
variants throughout this subpart refers to the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 301-74.1  What policies must we follow in planning a conference?

    When planning a conference, you must:
    (a) Minimize all conference costs, including administrative costs, 
conference attendees' travel costs, and conference attendees' time 
costs;
    (b) Maximize the use of Government-owned or Government provided 
conference facilities as much as possible;
    (c) Identify opportunities to reduce costs in selecting a particular 
conference location and facility (e.g., through the availability of 
lower rates during the off-season at a site with seasonal rates); and
    (d) Ensure that the conference planner or designee does not retain 
for personal use any promotional benefits or materials received from a 
travel service provider as a result of booking the conference (see 
Secs. 301-53.2 and 301-53.3 of this chapter); and
    (e) Develop and establish internal policies to ensure these 
standards are met.

[FTR Amdt. No. 89, 65 FR 1327, Jan. 10, 2000, as amended by FTR Amdt. 
2003-04, 68 FR 27937, May 22, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 301-74.2  What costs should be considered when planning a conference?

    When planning a conference, you should consider all direct and 
indirect conference costs paid by the Government, whether paid directly 
by agencies or reimbursed by agencies to travelers or others associated 
with the conference. Some examples of such costs are:
    (a) Authorized travel and per diem expenses;
    (b) Hire of rooms for official business;
    (c) Audiovisual and other equipment usage;
    (d) Computer and telephone access fees;
    (e) Light refreshments;
    (f) Printing;
    (g) Registration fees;
    (h) Ground transportation; and
    (i) Employees' time at the conference and on en route travel.


<R05>
Sec. 301-74.3  What must we do to determine which conference expenditures 
result in the greatest advantage to the Government?

    To determine conference expenditures, you must:
    (a) Assure there is appropriate management oversight of the 
conference planning process;
    (b) Always do cost comparisons of the size, scope, and location of 
the proposed conference;
    (c) Determine if a Government facility is available at a cheaper 
rate than a commercial facility;
    (d) Consider alternatives to a conference, e.g. teleconferencing; 
and

[[Page 86]]

    (e) Maintain written documentation of the alternatives considered 
and the selection rationale used.


<R05>
Sec. 301-74.4  What should cost comparisons include?

    Cost comparisons should include, but not be limited to, a 
determination of adequacy of lodging rooms at the established per diem 
rates, overall convenience of the conference location, fees, 
availability of meeting space, equipment, and supplies, and commuting or 
travel distance of attendees. (See Appendix E to Chapter 301, Guidance 
for Conference Planning.)


<R05>
Sec. 301-74.5  How should we select a location and a facility?

    Site selection is a final decision as to where to hold your 
conference. The term ``site'' refers to both the geographical location 
and the specific facility(ies) selected. In determining the best site in 
the interest of the Government, you should exercise strict fiscal 
responsibility to minimize costs. The actions in Sec. 301-74.3 must be 
followed. Cost comparisons must cover factors such as those listed in 
Sec. 301-74.4. As part of the cost comparison, you must use the 
established per diem rate for the locations for which you are comparing 
costs.


<R05>
Sec. 301-74.6  What can we do if we cannot find an appropriate conference 
facility at the chosen locality per diem rate?

    While it is always desirable to obtain lodging facilities within the 
established lodging portion of the per diem rate for the chosen 
locality, it may not always be possible. In negotiating lodging rates 
with the properties in the chosen location, you may exceed the 
established lodging portion of the per diem rate by up to 25 percent 
under Secs. 301-74.8 and 301-74.9, if necessary. This will provide 
flexibility in selecting an appropriate property at the most 
advantageous location. It will also permit agencies to reimburse their 
employees' subsistence expenses by using the conference lodging 
allowance method as prescribed in Sec. 301-74.8 for a Government 
sponsored conference and in Sec. 301-74.9 for non-Government sponsored 
conferences, rather than the actual expense method prescribed in subpart 
D of part 301-11 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 301-74.7  What is the conference lodging allowance?

    The conference lodging allowance is a pre-determined maximum 
allowance of up to 25 percent greater than the applicable locality 
lodging portion of the per diem rate. Under this reimbursement method, 
employees will be reimbursed the actual amount incurred for lodging up 
to the conference lodging allowance.


<R05>
Sec. 301-74.8  Who may authorize reimbursement of the conference lodging 
allowance for a Government sponsored conference?

    The approval authority for the conference lodging allowance is the 
Government agency sponsoring the conference. The sponsoring agency will 
determine the appropriate conference lodging allowance, up to 25 percent 
above the established lodging allowance for the chosen location, and 
that rate shall be allowable for all employees of any agency authorized 
to attend the conference. The determination must be made by a senior 
agency official at the sponsoring agency.


<R05>
Sec. 301.74.9  Who may authorize reimbursement of the conference lodging 
allowance for a non-Government sponsored conference?

    The travel approving official of a Government employee authorized to 
attend a non-Government sponsored conference may authorize the employee 
to be reimbursed for lodging expenses incurred up to the conference 
lodging allowance rate.


<R05>
Sec. 301-74.10  May the conference lodging allowance ever exceed 25 percent 
above the lodging per diem rate?

    No, the conference lodging allowance may not exceed 25 percent above 
the applicable locality lodging per diem rate.


<R05>
Sec. 301-74.11  May we provide light refreshments at an official conference?

    Yes. Agencies sponsoring a conference may provide light refreshments 
to agency employees attending an official conference. Light refreshments 
for

[[Page 87]]

morning, afternoon or evening breaks are defined to include, but not be 
limited to, coffee, tea, milk, juice, soft drinks, donuts, bagels, 
fruit, pretzels, cookies, chips, or muffins.


<R05>
Sec. 301-74.12  May we use both the conference lodging allowance method and 
the actual expense method of reimbursement concurrently?

    No. You must only use one reimbursement method per day in accordance 
with Sec. 301-11.4 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 301-74.13  May we include conference administrative costs in an employee's 
per diem allowance payment for attendance at a conference?

    No. Per diem is intended only to reimburse the attendee's 
subsistence expenses. You must pay conference registration fees 
separately, either directly or by reimbursing employees who pay such 
expenses and submit travel claims.


<R05>
Sec. 301-74.14  Are there any special requirements for sponsoring or funding 
a conference at a hotel, motel or other place of public accommodation?

    Yes. When you sponsor or fund (see 15 U.S.C. 2225a), in whole or in 
part, a conference at a place of public accommodation in the United 
States, you must use an approved accommodation (see Sec. 300-3.1 of this 
title), except as provided in Sec. 301-74.15. This provision also 
applies to the government of the District of Columbia when it expends 
Federal funds for a conference and any non-Federal entity which uses 
Government funds to sponsor or fund a conference.


<R05>
Sec. 301-74.15  May we waive the requirement in Sec. 301-74.14?

    Yes, if the head of your agency makes a written determination on an 
individual case basis that waiver of the requirement to use approved 
accommodations is necessary in the public interest for a particular 
event. Your agency head may delegate this waiver authority to a senior 
agency official or employee who is given waiver authority with respect 
to all conferences sponsored or funded, in whole or in part, by your 
agency.


<R05>
Sec. 301-74.16  What must be included in any advertisement or application 
form relating to conference attendance?

    (a) Any advertisement or application for attendance at a conference 
described in Sec. 301-74.14 must include:
    (1) Notice of the prohibition against using a non-FEMA approved 
place of public accommodation for conferences; and
    (2) Notice that the conference lodging allowance applies to Federal 
attendees, if applicable.
    (b) In addition, any executive agency, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105, 
shall notify all non-Federal entities to which it provides Federal funds 
of this prohibition.


<R05>
Sec. 301-74.17  What special rules apply when a conference is held in the 
District of Columbia?

    In addition to the general rules provided in this part, the 
following special rules apply:
    (a) You may not directly procure lodging facilities in the District 
of Columbia without specific authorization and appropriation from 
Congress (see 40 U.S.C. 34); and
    (b) It is no longer mandatory that you contact GSA for meeting or 
conference facilities in the District of Columbia. However, you are 
encouraged to contact the GSA Public Buildings Service (PBS) of the 
National Capital Region to inquire about the availability of short-term 
conference and meeting facilities in the District of Columbia. For 
additional information see the Customer Desk Guide for Real Property 
Management, Chapter 1. The Customer Desk Guide can be found on the 
worldwide web at http://www.gsa.gov/attachments/GSA--PUBLICATIONS/pub/

    Note to Sec. 301-74.17(a): This provision does not prohibit payment 
of per diem to an employee authorized to obtain lodging in the District 
of Columbia while performing official business travel.

[[Page 88]]


<R05>
Sec. 301-74.18  What policies and procedures must we establish to govern 
the selection of conference attendees?

    You must establish policies that reduce the overall cost of 
conference attendance. The policies and procedures must:
    (a) Limit your agency's representation to the minimum number of 
attendees determined by a senior official necessary to accomplish your 
agency's mission; and
    (b) Provide for the consideration of travel expenses when selecting 
attendees.


<R05>
Sec. 301-74.19  What records must we maintain to document the selection of 
a conference site?

    For each conference you sponsor or fund, in whole or in part for 30 
or more attendees, you must maintain a record of the cost of each 
alternative conference site considered. You must consider at least three 
sites. You must make these records available for inspection by your 
Office of the Inspector General or other interested parties.

Sec. 301-74.21  What is the applicable M&IE rate when meals or light 
refreshments are furnished at nominal or no cost by the Government or are 
included in the 
          registration fee?

    When meals or light refreshments are furnished at nominal or no cost 
by the Government or are included in the registration fee the applicable 
M&IE will be calculated as follows:
    (a) If meals are furnished, the appropriate deduction from the M&IE 
rate must be made (see Sec. 301-11.18 of this chapter).
    (b) If light refreshments are furnished, no deduction of the M&IE 
allowance is required.


<R05>
Sec. 301-74.22  When may an employee, attending a conference, be authorized 
the conference lodging allowance?

the conference lodging allowance as prescribed in Secs. 301-74.8 and 
301-74.9.


<R05>
Sec. 301-74.23  Is the conference lodging allowance an actual expense 
reimbursement?

    No. The conference lodging allowance is a separate method of 
reimbursement for lodgings expenses.


<R05>
Sec. 301-74.24  When should actual expense reimbursement be authorized 
for conference attendees?

    If the conference lodging allowance still is inadequate, you may 
authorize actual expense reimbursement under Sec. 301-11.300 of this 
chapter in lieu of the conference lodging allowance method.

  Appendix E to Chapter 301--Suggested Guidance for Conference Planning

                                  Terms

    Conference: A meeting, retreat, seminar, symposium or event that 
involves attendee travel. The term ``conference'' also applies to 
training activities that are considered to be conferences under 5 CFR 
410.404.
    Conference lodging allowance: The rate that is up to 25 percent 
above the established lodging per diem rate.
    Milestone schedule: Deadlines, which need to be reached in a 
progressive and orderly manner.
    Planner: The person designated to oversee the conference.
    Planning committee: Operational group significantly contributing to 
a conference's overall success and able to fully reflect the needs of 
both the agency and the attendees.

                             Getting Started

    Depending on the size, type, and intended effect of the conference, 
start planning a minimum of one year in advance. Designate a planner and 
a planning committee.

                           Planning Committee

    Functions typically include, but are not limited to:
    [bull] Establishing a set of objectives.
    [bull] Developing a theme.
    [bull] Making recommendations for location, agenda, dates, and 
logistics, e.g., schedule, exhibits, speaker.
    [bull] Making suggestions as to who should attend.
    [bull] Serving as communications link between planners and 
participants.
    [bull] Evaluation and follow-up.

                           Milestone Schedule

    (a) Develop a milestone schedule, which is essential to conference 
planning, by working backward from the beginning date of the conference 
to include each major step. Examples include:
    [bull] Planning committee meetings.
    [bull] Preparation of mailing lists.
    [bull] Letters of invitation.
    [bull] Designation of speakers.
    [bull] Confirmation letters to speakers.
    [bull] Confirmation with site selection official.
    [bull] Preparation of agenda.
    [bull] Preparation of specification sheet.
    [bull] Location and date selection.
    [bull] Exhibits.
    [bull] Budget.
    [bull] Printing requirements.

[[Page 97]]

    [bull] Signage.
    [bull] Conference information packages.
    [bull] Scheduling photographer (if planned).
    [bull] Use of agency seal and conference logo.
    [bull] Handicapped requirements.
    [bull] Planning of meals and refreshments, if appropriate.
    (b) Establish completion dates for each major step.
    (c) Update and revise the schedule as needed.

                           Specification Sheet

    A detailed specification sheet is necessary to:
    (a) Identify essential elements of a conference which typically 
include, but are not limited to:
    [bull] Sleeping rooms and on-site food services. It is generally 
best to estimate on the low side for the number of sleeping rooms and 
meals to be prepared. Facilities, unless there is only limited available 
space, are usually prepared to increase the number of sleeping rooms and 
meals; however, they discourage--and in some cases penalize--you if the 
sleeping room and meal guarantees are not met.
    [bull] Meeting rooms.
    [bull] Exhibit facilities.
    [bull] Audio-visual equipment and support services.
    [bull] Miscellaneous support services.
    [bull] Sleeping rooms with amenities, e.g., Internet access, data 
ports, conference call, and voice mail.
    (b) Determine costs:
    [bull] Procurement. All agreements and decisions should be written 
and agreed to by the agency-contracting officer before being sent to the 
facility. Bring contracting officer into the process early.
    [bull] Government per diem rates. The Government per diem rate 
applies to Federal attendees. Application of it to non-Federal attendees 
is at the discretion of the property and conference negotiator.
    [bull] Registration fee. Generally, the registration fee covers all 
direct expenditures of agency funds for planning and organization of a 
conference, e.g., meeting room accommodations, meals, light refreshments 
(if appropriate), speaker fees, publications, and materials. Anything 
directly relating to the conference, except liquor, can be included in 
the fee. To estimate the registration fee, divide the proposed budget by 
the estimated number of attendees.

                                Budgeting

    Decide how the conference expenses (other than sleeping room 
accommodations and individual meals) will be paid, i.e., by the attendee 
from a training or registration fee, or directly by the agency.

                        Conference Site Selection

    Minimize total costs, all factors considered.

                           Geographic Location

    In determining where to locate the conference, consider:
    [bull] Targeted audience.
    [bull] Total costs, including per diem, transportation, and other.
    [bull] Accessibility by car or air.
    [bull] Whether recreational activities are necessary.
    [bull] The expense of desired facility (significant savings can be 
achieved in off-season periods).

                           Types of Facilities

    [bull] Federal Government. Use Government-owned or Government-
provided conference facilities to the maximum extent possible.
    [bull] Convention centers. Excellent for very large meetings, trade 
shows and exhibits; usually located near a large number of hotels.
    [bull] Colleges and universities. Many have good meeting facilities 
and can offer sleeping accommodations when school is not in session.
    [bull] Hotels. Commercial facilities that may be used to meet all 
conference needs or just the room night needs.
    [bull] Conference centers. Dedicated meeting facilities; good for 
smaller meetings when numerous breakout sessions are planned.

                             Date Selection

    For availability and economical reasons, the best months are April, 
May, September, October, and November. You should book the facility as 
early as possible to increase the chances of getting the date you want. 
However, pay particular attention to commitments for September or 
October due to fiscal year budget considerations.

                   Considerations When Choosing a Site

    (a) Is the facility:
    [bull] Cost effective, e.g., are Government rates honored?
    [bull] Safe, e.g., FEMA-approved?
    [bull] Is there on-site security personnel?
    [bull] Easily reached from an airport or by car?
    [bull] Clean?
    [bull] Well run, e.g., does the staff seem to be competent and 
responsive?
    [bull] Laid out in a functional way?
    [bull] Large enough to supply the number of sleeping rooms required?
    [bull] Set up to provide necessary conference registration 
equipment?
    [bull] Handicapped accessible?
    (b) Parking:
    [bull] Is it adequate?
    [bull] How close to the facility is it?
    [bull] Is it secure and safe?

[[Page 98]]

    [bull] Is the cost separate?
    (c) Sleeping rooms:
    [bull] Will the facility make the reservations, or are you 
responsible for making the reservations for participants?
    [bull] What are the facility's registration rules?
    [bull] What are departure rules?
    (d) Functionality of meeting rooms:
    [bull] Is appropriate space available?
    [bull] What costs are involved?
    [bull] Is needed equipment available (i.e., for conference 
registration, faxes, phones, computers, copiers)? Do not rent equipment 
unless it is absolutely unrealistic to bring your own.
    [bull] Are rooms designated for agency use for the duration of the 
conference?
    [bull] Are there columns that can block views?
    [bull] Are ceilings high enough for audio-video equipment?
    [bull] Are rooms suitable for both classroom and/or theatre setups?
    [bull] Are there windows? Shades?
    [bull] Are there manually-controlled thermostats?
    [bull] Are rooms handicapped accessible?
    [bull] Where are electrical outlets?
    [bull] Can the rooms be darkened?
    [bull] Would it be more economical to bring audio-visual equipment?
    [bull] Does the facility want meeting schedules and room layouts in 
writing in advance of the conference?
    [bull] If necessary, can the rooms be entered the evening before for 
an early setup?
    [bull] Will the facility arrange for room setup if given a layout?
    [bull] What set-up costs are included?
    [bull] What are departure rules?
    (e) Exhibits:
    [bull] If exhibits are planned, is suitable exhibit space available?
    [bull] Are easels available at no cost?
    [bull] What are the put-up and takedown times?
    [bull] What costs are involved?
    [bull] What about pre-delivery and after-conference arrangements?
    [bull] If exhibits are shipped, know where and to whom they are to 
be sent.
    [bull] If you are bringing large exhibits, determine location of 
loading dock, appropriate entrances and elevators.
    [bull] Are there additional handling fees?
    [bull] Check hotel policy on posting, size and appearance of signs.

                             Food and Drink

                                  Meals

    [bull] You can not generally use appropriated funds to pay for meals 
for employees at their official duty stations.
    [bull] Employees on TDY travel may be served meals but cannot be 
reimbursed for those provided at Government expense.
    [bull] You should clarify in advance the appropriate per diem 
reduction(s) of meal(s) allowance(s) for TDY travel.
    [bull] You may pay, or reimburse an employee for meals as necessary 
expenses incident to an authorized training program (under the 
Government Employees Training Act (GETA) at 5 U.S.C. 4104(4)), if a 
determination has been made that essential training will be conducted 
during the meal.
    [bull] Work closely with the hotel to plan quality menus that fit 
within authorized per diem rates.
    [bull] Clarify and agree in advance to the number of meal 
guarantees.
    [bull] Ensure that gratuities and service charges are added to the 
cost of each meal, and determine the method of billing to be used (e.g., 
signed guarantee, collected meal tickets, or actual quantities 
consumed).
    [bull] Confirm menus.

                         Breaks and Refreshments

    Breaks should last no longer than 30 minutes and take place between 
meeting sessions. The following should also be considered when planning 
for refreshments:
    [bull] Keep in mind that everyone does not drink coffee or tea.
    [bull] You should clarify and agree in advance that coffee and 
pastries, if appropriate, are purchased by the gallon and dozen.
    [bull] Try to avoid a per person charge.
    [bull] Negotiate the cost into the contract.
    [bull] Be conservative in your estimates. There are seldom 100 
percent of the conference participants attending any one function.
    [bull] If coffee, soft drinks, and water are not included in the 
fee, are they available ``at cost'' to the attendee?

                         Account Reconciliation

    It is important to request that the hotel bill be prepared in a 
logical and chronological sequence, and that backup data accompany the 
bill. Generally, the hotel will complete its accounting of the 
conference within two weeks of the conclusion.

                              Notification

                     Announcement and/or Invitations

    Announcement of the planned conference should be made as early as 
possible, even one year in advance; invitation letters, 8 weeks in 
advance. They should include, but are not limited to:
    [bull] Point of contact name and telephone number.
    [bull] Registration form, card, or Internet address (include space 
for identifying handicapped requirements).
    [bull] Registration instructions.
    [bull] Registration deadline date.
    [bull] Detailed area map and driving instructions.

[[Page 99]]

    [bull] Information on traffic patterns to avoid rush hour delays.
    [bull] Promotional brochures from the facility.
    [bull] Layout of facility including telephone numbers.
    [bull] Breakdown of costs showing any difference from travel versus 
training object classes, particularly meal costs, so that proper 
reimbursement can be made.
    [bull] Agenda with a list of speakers and topics.
    [bull] Activity schedule for spouses and guests (all charges or 
costs attributed to spouses or guests must be borne by the individual 
attendee (not reimbursable by the Government)).
    [bull] Provide a sample travel voucher.
    [bull] Notice that conference lodging allowance applies if 
applicable.

                              Confirmations

    You should:
    [bull] Decide on the speaker(s) and the message you wish to be 
conveyed and obtain early commitment(s) in writing.
    [bull] Confirm conference dates/times/topics/arrival and departure 
times with speaker(s) and any other special guests at least 30 days in 
advance.
    [bull] Conduct a final planning committee meeting to confirm all 
plans.
    [bull] Confirm photographer's schedule.
    [bull] Confirm hotel plans at least one day in advance.

                            Facility Process

                            Check-In and -Out

    Streamline the process:
    [bull] Will the facility need additional personnel?
    [bull] Is electronic one-stop processing available?
    [bull] Is luggage storage and shuttle service available?
    [bull] Arrange parking for any special guests.
    [bull] Provide signage.

                          Registration Process

    Registration is generally the attendees' introduction to the 
conference. Give it special attention by:
    [bull] Using directional signs.
    [bull] Placing especially attractive or important exhibits nearby.
    [bull] Planning for late arrivals.
    [bull] Using state-of-the-art processing.
    [bull] Checking out the registration capabilities of using GSA's 
electronic SmartPay System.
    [bull] Providing for handicapped attendees.

                     Conference Information Package

    Each registrant should be given a conference information package. 
Used regularly during the conference, the conference information package 
should be accurate, beneficial, and reflect detailed information on a 
daily/hourly basis. If time allows, you may want to finalize the package 
and send it to the printer at least 4 weeks in advance of the starting 
date. The program will be widely used, so you may want to print twice as 
many copies of the program as you have expected attendees. The 
information package, for example, may contain:
    [bull] A list of everything in the package.
    [bull] A ``welcome'' letter.
    [bull] A schedule.
    [bull] Workshop agendas.
    [bull] Discussion of exhibits.
    [bull] Panelists' information.
    [bull] Photos and biographies of speakers/special guests.
    [bull] Facility layout and list of services available.
    [bull] Identify designated smoking areas.
    [bull] Special events.
    [bull] Message center information.
    [bull] Area map.
    [bull] Other pertinent material.

    Note: Use of agency seal and conference logo may be considered for 
the conference package. However, the decision to use such items is 
strictly the judgment of agency officials.

                              Miscellaneous

                       Suggested Room Coordination

    Plan ahead to setup:
    [bull] Staff room to handle core of activities;
    [bull] Meal functions;
    [bull] Exhibit rooms, and
    [bull] Meeting rooms--
    Theatre or auditorium for lectures; Facing speaker when note taking 
is important; Square or U-shaped style for discussion/interaction; and 
Banquet or roundtable for discussion.

                            Keeping in Touch

    Plan for:
    [bull] A message center to be set up in a central location for 
special announcements and telephone messages.
    [bull] How to reach whomever at all times--use beepers and walkie-
talkies.
    [bull] Clear identification of conference staff.
    [bull] Accommodation of physically impaired attendees with sign 
language or other special needs.

                                Mementos

    Appropriations are not available to purchase memento items for 
distribution to conference attendees as a remembrance of an event. Two 
notable exceptions to the memento or gift prohibition are under training 
and awards. Work closely with appropriate agency officials to make final 
determinations.

                   Subpart F--Agency Responsibilities

    Note to subpart F: Use of pronouns ``we'', ``you'', and their 
variants throughout this subpart refers to the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 302-3.500  What governing policies and procedures must we establish 
for paying a relocation allowance under this part 302-3?

    You must establish how you will implement policies that are required 
for this part, which include;
    (a) When you will pay relocation expenses if an employee violates 
his/her service agreement;
    (b) When you will authorize separate relocation allowances to an 
employee and an employee's immediate family member that are both 
transferring to the same official station;
    (c) When you will grant an employee and/or the employee's immediate 
family member(s) an extension on beginning separation travel;
    (d) When you will allow an employee to arrange his/her own 
relocation upon separation;
    (e) When you will authorize a temporary change of station (TCS);
    (f) When you will define an area not to reimburse for a TCS;
    (g) When you will pay extended storage of household goods for TCS; 
and
    (h) What relocation allowances you will and will not pay when an 
employee is permanently assigned to a temporary official station.


<R05>
Sec. 302-3.501  Must we establish any specific procedures for paying a 
relocation allowance to new appointees?

    Yes, you must establish specific guidelines for paying a relocation 
allowance to new appointees. These guidelines must establish the:
    (a) Criteria in accordance with 5 CFR part 572 on how you will 
determine if a new appointee is eligible for the relocation allowances 
authorized therein; and
    (b) Procedures which will provide new appointees with information 
surrounding his/her benefits.


<R05>
Sec. 302-3.502  What factors should we consider in determining whether to 
authorize a TCS for a long-term assignment?

    You should consider the following factors in determining whether to 
authorize a TCS:
    (a) Cost considerations. You should consider the cost of each 
alternative. A long-term temporary duty travel assignment requires the 
payment of either per diem or actual subsistence expenses for the entire 
period of the assignment. This could be very costly to the agency over 
an extended period. A TCS will require fairly substantial relocation 
allowance payments at the beginning and end of the assignment, and less 
substantial payments for extended storage and property management 
services, when authorized, during the period of the assignment. Agencies 
should estimate the total cost of each alternative and authorize the one 
that is most advantageous for the agency, cost and other factors 
considered;
    (b) Tax considerations. An employee who performs a temporary duty 
travel assignment exceeding one year at a single location is subject to 
income taxation of his/her travel expense reimbursements. The Income Tax 
Reimbursement Allowance (ITRA) allows for the reimbursement of Federal, 
State and local income taxes incurred as a result of an extended 
temporary duty

[[Page 127]]

assignment (see Secs. 301-11.501 through 301-11.640 of this title). An 
employee who is authorized and performs a TCS also will be subject to 
income taxation of some, but not all, of his/her TCS expenses. You will 
pay an offsetting Relocation Income Tax (RIT) allowance on an employee's 
TCS expense reimbursements; and
    (c) Employee concerns. The long-term assignment of an employee away 
from his/her official station and immediate family may negatively affect 
the employee's morale and job performance. Such negative effects may be 
alleviated by authorizing a TCS so the employee can transport his/her 
immediate family and/or household goods at Government expense to the 
location where he/she will perform the long-term assignment. You should 
consider the effects of a long-term temporary duty travel assignment on 
an employee when deciding whether to authorize a TCS.

<R05>
Sec. 302-3.503  Must we require employees to sign a service agreement?

agreement:
    (a) Within the continental United States for a period of service of 
not less than 12 months following the effective date of your transfer;
    (b) Outside the continental United States for an agreed upon period 
of service of not more than 36 months or less than 12 months following 
the effective date of transfer;
    (c) Department of Defense Overseas Dependent School System teachers 
for a period of not less than one school year as determined under 
chapter 25 of Title 20, United States Code; and
    (d) Renewal agreement travel for a period of not less than 12 months 
from the date of return to the same or different overseas duty station.


<R05>
Sec. 302-3.506  May we pay relocation expenses if the employee violates 
his/her service agreement?

    If an employee does not fulfill the terms of the service agreement, 
the employee is indebted to the Government for all relocation expenses 
that have been reimbursed to the employee or that have been paid 
directly by the Government. However, if the reasons for not fulfilling 
the terms of the service agreement are beyond the employee's control and 
acceptable to the agency, you may release the employee from the service 
agreement and waive any indebtedness.

of appointment and state it in his/her service agreement;
    (b) Use guidance in 8 U.S.C. 1101(33) which states that ``The term 
residence means the place of general abode; the place of general abode 
of a person means his principal, actual dwelling place in fact, without 
regard to intent'', for establishing places of residence; and
    (c) Require the employee to sign the service agreement prior to his/
her relocation.

                      Overseas Tour Renewal Travel


<R05>

travel?

    No, you cannot allow a travel advance for tour renewal agreement 
travel.


<R05>
Sec. 302-3.514  Under what conditions must we pay for tour renewal 
agreement travel?

    You must pay tour renewal agreement travel when:

<R04>
     Subpart A--Employee's Allowance For Househunting Trip Expenses

    Note to subpart A: Use of the pronouns ``I'' and ``you'' throughout 
this subpart refers to the employee.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.1  What is a ``househunting trip''?

    The term ``househunting trip'' refers to a trip made by the employee 
and/or spouse to your new official station locality to find permanent 
living quarters to rent or purchase. The term ``living quarters'' in 
this part includes apartments, condominiums, and cooperatives in 
addition to townhouses and single family homes.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.2  What is the purpose of the househunting trip expenses 
allowance?

    The allowance for househunting trip expenses is intended to 
facilitate and expedite the employee's move from your old official 
station to your new official station and to lower the Government's 
overall cost for the employee's relocation by reducing the amount of 
time an employee must occupy temporary quarters. The allowance for 
househunting trip expenses provides the employee and/or spouse a period 
of time to concentrate on finding a suitable permanent residence at the 
new official station and thereby expedites the employee's relocation.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.3  Am I eligible for a househunting trip expenses allowance?

    You are eligible for a househunting trip expenses allowance if you 
are an employee who is authorized to transfer, and in addition:
    (a) Both your old and new official stations are located within the 
United States;

[[Page 135]]

    (b) You are not assigned to Government or other prearranged housing 
at your new official station; and
    (c) Your old and new official stations are 75 or more miles apart 
(as measured by map distance) via a usually traveled surface route.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.4  Who is not eligible for a househunting trip expenses allowance?

    New appointees and employees assigned under the Government Employees 
Training Act (5 U.S.C. 4109) are not eligible for a househunting trip 
expenses allowance.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.5  Must my agency authorize payment of a househunting trip 
expenses allowance?

    No, your agency determines when it is in the Government's interest 
to authorize you a househunting trip and the procedures you must follow 
if it is authorized.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.6  Under what circumstances will I receive a househunting trip 
expenses allowance?

    You will receive a househunting trip expenses allowance if:
    (a) Your agency authorized you to perform a househunting trip in 
advance of the travel (the agency authorization must specify the mode of 
transportation and the period of time allowed for the trip);
    (b) You have signed a service agreement;
    (c) Your agency has established, and informed you of, the date you 
are to report to your new official station; and
    (d) You meet any additional conditions your agency has established.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.7  Who may travel on a househunting trip at Government expense?

    Only you and/or your spouse may travel on a househunting trip at 
Government expense.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.8  How many househunting trips may my agency authorize in 
connection with a particular transfer?

    Your agency may authorize only one round trip for you and/or your 
spouse in connection with a particular transfer.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.9  May my spouse and I perform separate househunting trips at 
Government expense?

    Yes, however, your reimbursement will be limited to the cost that 
would have been incurred if you and your spouse had traveled together on 
one round trip.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.10  How soon may I and/or my spouse begin a househunting trip?

    You may begin your househunting trip as soon as your agency has 
notified you of your transfer and issued a travel authorization for a 
househunting trip. To take maximum advantage of your trip, however, it 
is very important that you become familiar as quickly as you can with 
your new official station area (e.g., housing market conditions, school 
locations, etc.). If you are selling your residence at your old official 
station, you should not begin your househunting trip until you have a 
current appraisal of the value of the residence so that you can more 
accurately determine the appropriate price range of residences to 
consider during your househunting trip.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.11  Is there a time limit on the duration of a househunting trip?

    A househunting trip should be for a reasonable period, not to exceed 
10 calendar days, as authorized by your agency under Sec. 302-5.101(d).


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.12  When must my househunting trip be completed?

    You and/or your spouse must complete your househunting trip as 
indicated in the following table:

                                         (b) The day before the maximum
                                          time for beginning allowable

<R05>
Sec. 302-5.14  What transportation expenses will my agency pay?

    Your agency will authorize you to travel by the transportation 
mode(s) (e.g., airline, train, or privately owned automobile) it 
determines to be advantageous to the Government. Your agency will pay 
for your transportation expenses by the authorized mode(s). If you

expenses not to exceed the cost of transportation by the authorized 
mode(s).


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.15  Must I document my househunting trip expenses to receive

chapter 301. For fixed amount househunting trip subsistence 
reimbursement, you do not need to document your subsistence expenses. 
For per diem househunting trip subsistence expense reimbursement, you 
must itemize your lodging expenses and you must provide receipts as 
required by Secs. 301-7.9(b), 301-11.25, 301-11.306 and 301-52.4(b) of 
chapter 301.

<R05>
Sec. 302-5.16  May I receive an advance of funds for househunting trip 
expenses?

    Your agency may authorize an advance of funds, in accordance with 
Sec. 302-2.20 of this chapter, for your househunting trip expenses. Your 
agency may not advance you funds in excess of the sum of your 
anticipated transportation costs and either the maximum per diem 
allowable under part 302-4 of this chapter for the location and duration 
of your househunting trip or your fixed amount househunting trip 
subsistence expenses payment, whichever applies.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.17  Am I in a duty status when I perform a househunting trip?

    Yes, you are in a duty status when you perform a househunting trip.


<R05>

Sec. 302-5.18  May I retain any balance left over from my househunting 
reimbursement if my fixed amount is more than adequate to cover my

    Yes, if your fixed househunting amount is more than adequate to 
cover your househunting expenses any balance belongs to you.


<R04>
                   Subpart B--Agency Responsibilities

    Note to subpart B: Use of pronouns ``we'', ``you'', and their 
variants throughout this subpart refers to the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.100  How should we administer the househunting trip expenses 
allowance?

    You should administer the househunting trip expenses allowance to 
minimize or avoid its use when other satisfactory and more economical 
arrangement are available.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.101  What governing policies must we establish for the 
househunting trip expenses allowance?

    You must establish policies and procedures governing:

[[Page 137]]

    (a) When you will authorize a househunting trip for an employee;
    (b) Who will determine if a househunting trip is appropriate in each 
situation;
    (c) If and when you will authorize the fixed amount option for 
househunting trip subsistence expenses reimbursement;
    (d) Who will determine the appropriate duration of a househunting 
trip for an employee who selects a per diem allowance under part 302-4 
of this chapter to reimburse househunting trip subsistence expenses; and
    (e) Who will determine the mode(s) of transportation to be used.


<R05>
Sec. 302-5.102  Under what circumstances may we authorize a househunting trip?

    You may authorize a househunting trip on an individual-case basis 
when the employee has accepted the transfer and his/her circumstances 
indicate that a househunting trip actually is needed. You may not 
authorize a househunting trip when the purpose of the trip is to assist 
the employee in deciding whether he or she will accept the transfer.


<R05>

Sec. 302-5.103  What factors must we consider in determining whether to 
offer an employee the fixed amount househunting trip subsistence expense 
reimbursement 
          option?

    You must consider the following factors:
    (a) Ease of administration. Payment of a per diem allowance under 
part 302-4 of this chapter requires you to review claims for the 
validity, accuracy, and reasonableness of each expense amount, except 
for meals and incidental expenses. Fixed amount househunting trip 
subsistence expenses reimbursement is easier to administer because you 
do not have to review expense amounts.
    (b) Cost considerations. You must weigh the cost of each 
reimbursement option on a case-by-case basis.
    (c) Treatment of employees. The employee is allowed to choose 
between a per diem allowance under part 302-4 of this chapter and fixed 
amount househunting trip subsistence expenses reimbursement when you 
offer the fixed amount reimbursement method. You therefore should weigh 
employee morale and productivity considerations against actual cost 
considerations in determining which method to offer.

purpose of temporary occupancy from a private or commercial source.


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.2  What are ``temporary quarters subsistence expenses (TQSE)''?

    ``Temporary quarters subsistence expenses'' or ``TQSE'' are 
subsistence expenses incurred by an employee and/or his/her immediate 
family while occupying temporary quarters. TQSE does not include local 
transportation expenses incurred during occupancy of temporary quarters 
(see Sec. 302-6.18 for details).


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.3  What is the purpose of the TQSE allowance?

    The TQSE allowance is intended to reimburse an employee reasonably 
and equitably for subsistence expenses incurred when it is necessary to 
occupy temporary quarters.


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.4  Am I eligible for a TQSE allowance?

    You are eligible for a TQSE allowance if you are an employee who is 
authorized to transfer; and
    (a) Your new official station is located within the United States; 
and
    (b) Your old and new official stations are 50 miles or more apart 
(as measured by map distance) via a usually traveled surface route.


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.5  Who is not eligible for a TQSE allowance?

    New appointees, employees assigned under the Government Employees 
Training Act (5 U.S.C. 4109), and employees returning from an overseas 
assignment for the purpose of separation are not eligible for a TQSE 
allowance.


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.6  Must my agency authorize payment of a TQSE allowance?

    No, your agency determines whether it is in the Government's 
interest to pay TQSE.

[[Page 139]]


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.7  Under what circumstances will I receive a TQSE allowance?

    You will receive a TQSE allowance if:
    (a) Your agency authorizes it before you occupy the temporary 
quarters (the agency authorization must specify the period of time 
allowed for you to occupy temporary quarters);
    (b) You have signed a service agreement; and
    (c) You meet any additional conditions your agency has established.


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.8  Who may occupy temporary quarters at Government expense?

    Only you and/or your immediate family may occupy temporary quarters 
at Government expense.


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.9  Where may I/we occupy temporary quarters at Government 
expense?

    You and/or your immediate family may occupy temporary quarters at 
Government expense within reasonable proximity of your old and/or new 
official stations. Neither you nor your immediate family may be 
reimbursed for occupying temporary quarters at any other location, 
unless justified by special circumstances that are reasonably related to 
your transfer.


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.10  May my immediate family and I occupy temporary quarters at 
different locations?

    Yes. For example, if you must vacate your home at the old official 
station and report to the new official station and your family remains 
behind until the end of the school year, you may need to occupy 
temporary quarters at the new official station while your family 
occupies temporary quarters at the old official station.


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.11  What methods may my agency use to reimburse me for TQSE?

    Your agency will reimburse you for TQSE under the actual expense 
method unless it permits the ``fixed amount'' reimbursement method as an 
alternative. If your agency makes both methods available to you, you may 
select the one you prefer.


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.12  Must I document my TQSE to receive reimbursement?

    For fixed amount TQSE reimbursement, you do not document your TQSE. 
For actual TQSE reimbursement, you must document your TQSE by itemizing 
each expense and providing receipts as required by Secs. 301-11.25, 301-
11.306 and 301-52.4(b) of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.13  How soon may I/we begin occupying temporary quarters at 
Government expense?

    As soon as your agency has authorized you to receive a TQSE 
allowance and you have signed a service agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.14  How is my TQSE allowance affected if my temporary quarters 
become my permanent residence quarters?

    If your temporary quarters become your permanent residence quarters, 
you may receive a TQSE allowance only if you show in a manner 
satisfactory to your agency that you initially intended to occupy the 
quarters temporarily.


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.15  May I receive an advance of funds for TQSE?

    Yes, if authorized in accordance with Sec. 302-2.20 of this chapter, 
your agency may advance the amount of funds necessary to cover your 
estimated TQSE expenses for up to 30 days. Your agency subsequently may 
advance additional funds for periods up to 30 days.


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.16  May I receive a TQSE allowance if I am receiving another 
subsistence expenses allowance?

    No, with one exception. You may receive a cost-of-living allowance 
payable under 5 U.S.C. 5941 in addition to a TQSE allowance.


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.17  Am I eligible for a TQSE allowance if I transfer to a foreign area?

    No, you may not receive a TQSE allowance under this part when you 
transfer to an area outside the United States. However, you may qualify 
for a

[[Page 140]]

comparable allowance under the Standardized Regulations (Government 
Civilians, Foreign Areas) prescribed by the Department of State.


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.18  May I be reimbursed for local transportation expenses 
incurred while I am occupying temporary quarters?

    Generally no; local transportation expenses are not TQSE, and there 
is no authority to pay such expenses under TQSE. You may, however, be 
reimbursed under part 301-4 of this subtitle for necessary 
transportation expenses if you perform local official business travel 
while you are occupying temporary quarters.


<R04>
             Subpart B--Actual TQSE Method of Reimbursement


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.100  What am I paid under the actual TQSE reimbursement method?

    Your agency will pay your actual TQSE incurred, provided the 
expenses are reasonable and do not exceed the maximum allowable amount. 
The ``maximum allowable amount'' is the ``maximum daily amount'' 
multiplied by the number of days you actually incur TQSE not to exceed 
the number of days authorized, taking into account that the rates change 
after 30 days in temporary quarters. The ``maximum daily amount'' is 
determined by adding the rates in the following table for you and each 
member of your immediate family authorized to occupy temporary quarters:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                       The ``maximum daily amount'' of TQSE under the actual expense method that
                                      --------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                Your accompanied spouse

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ (That is, when the spouse necessarily occupies temporary quarters in lieu of the employee or in a location
  separate from the employee.)


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.101  May my agency reduce my TQSE allowance below the ``maximum 
allowable amount''?

    Yes, if the estimated daily amount of your TQSE is determined in 
advance to be lower than the maximum daily amount, your agency may 
reduce the maximum allowable amount to your expected expenses.


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.102  What is the ``applicable per diem rate'' under the actual 
TQSE reimbursement method?

    The ``applicable per diem rate'' under the actual TQSE reimbursement 
method is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                            The applicable per diem rate
     For temporary quarters located in                   is
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The continental United States (CONUS).....  The standard CONUS rate.
Outside the Continental United States       The locality rate
 (OCONUS).                                   established by the
                                             Secretary of Defense or the
                                             Secretary of State under
                                             Sec.  301-11.6 of this
                                             title.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.103  What is the latest period for which actual TQSE reimbursement 
may begin?

    The period must begin before the maximum time for beginning 
allowable travel and transportation under Sec. 302-2.8.


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.104  How long may I be authorized to claim actual TQSE reimbursement?

    Your agency may authorize you to claim actual TQSE in increments of 
30-days or less, not to exceed 60 consecutive days. However, if your 
agency determines that there is a compelling

[[Page 141]]

reason for you to continue occupying temporary quarters after 60 
consecutive days, it may authorize an extension of up to 60 additional 
consecutive days. Under no circumstances may you be authorized 
reimbursement for actual TQSE for more than a total of 120 consecutive 
days.


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.105  What is a ``compelling reason'' warranting extension of my 
authorized period for claiming an actual TQSE reimbursement?

    A ``compelling reason'' is an event that is beyond your control and 
is acceptable to your agency. Examples include, but are not limited to 
when:
    (a) Delivery of your household goods to your new residence is 
delayed due to strikes, customs clearance, hazardous weather, fires, 
floods or other acts of God, or similar events.
    (b) You cannot occupy your new permanent residence because of 
unanticipated problems (e.g., delay in settlement on the new residence, 
or short-term delay in construction of the residence).
    (c) You are unable to locate a permanent residence which is adequate 
for your family's needs because of housing conditions at your new 
official station.
    (d) Sudden illness, injury, your death or the death of your 
immediate family member; or
    (e) Similar reasons.


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.106  May I interrupt occupancy of temporary quarters?

    Yes, your authorized period for claiming actual TQSE reimbursement 
is measured on consecutive days, and once begun, normally continues to 
run whether or not you occupy temporary quarters. You may, however, 
interrupt your authorized period for claiming actual TQSE reimbursement 
in the following instances:
    (a) For the time allowed for en route travel between the old and new 
official stations;
    (b) For circumstances attributable to official necessity such as an 
intervening temporary duty assignment or military duty; or
    (c) For a non-official necessary interruption such as 
hospitalization, approved sick leave, or other reason beyond your 
control and acceptable to your agency.


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.107  What effect do partial days of temporary quarters occupancy 
have on my authorized period for claiming actual TQSE reimbursement?

    Occupancy of temporary quarters for less than a whole day 
constitutes one full day of your authorized period. (However, see 
Sec. 302-6.110 regarding en route travel.)


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.108  When does my authorized period for claiming actual TQSE 
reimbursement end?

    The period ends at midnight on the earlier of:
    (a) The day preceding the day you and/or any member of your 
immediate family occupies permanent residence quarters.
    (b) The day your authorized period for claiming actual TQSE 
reimbursement expires.


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.109  May the period for which I am authorized to claim actual 
TQSE reimbursement for myself be different from that of my immediate family?

    No, the eligibility period for which you are authorized to claim 
actual TQSE reimbursement for yourself and for each member of your 
immediate family must run concurrently.


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.110  What effect do partial days have on my actual TQSE 
reimbursement?

    You may not receive reimbursement under both the actual TQSE 
allowance and another subsistence expenses allowance within the same 
day, with one exception. If you claim TQSE reimbursement on the same day 
that en route travel per diem ends, your en route travel per diem will 
be computed under applicable partial day rules and you also may be 
reimbursed for actual TQSE you incur after 6 p.m. of that day.

[[Page 142]]


<R05>

Sec. 302-6.111  May I and/or my immediate family occupy temporary quarters 
longer than the period for which I am authorized to claim actual TQSE 
reimbursement?

    Yes, but you will not be reimbursed for any of the expenses you 
incur during the unauthorized period.


<R04>
                  Subpart C--Fixed Amount Reimbursement


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.200  What am I paid under the fixed amount reimbursement method?

    If your agency offers and you select the fixed amount TQSE 
reimbursement method, you are paid a fixed amount for up to 30 days. No 
extensions are allowed under the fixed amount method.


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.201  How do I determine the amount of my payment under the fixed 
amount reimbursement method?

    Multiply the number of days your agency authorizes TQSE by .75 times 
the maximum per diem rate (i.e., lodging plus meals and incidental 
expenses) prescribed in chapter 301 of this subtitle for the locality of 
the new official station. Then for each member of your immediate family, 
multiply the same number of days by .25 times the same per diem rate. 
Your payment will be the sum of this calculation.


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.202  Will I receive additional TQSE reimbursement if my fixed 
amount is not adequate to cover my TQSE?

    No, you will not receive additional TQSE reimbursement if the fixed 
amount is not adequate to cover your TQSE.


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.203  May I retain any balance left over from my TQSE reimbursement 
if my fixed amount is more than adequate?

    Yes, if your fixed TQSE amount is more than adequate to cover your 
TQSE expenses any balance belongs to you.


<R04>
                   Subpart D--Agency Responsibilities

    Note to subpart D: Use of pronouns ``we'', ``you'', and their 
variants throughout this subpart refers to the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.300  How should we administer the TQSE allowance?

    Temporary quarters should be used only if, and only for as long as, 
necessary until the employee and/or his/her immediate family can move 
into permanent residence quarters. You must administer the TQSE 
allowance to minimize or avoid other relocation expenses.


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.301  What governing policies must we establish for the TQSE allowance?

    You must establish policies and procedures governing:
    (a) When you will authorize temporary quarters for employees;
    (b) Who will determine if temporary quarters is appropriate in each 
situation;
    (c) If and when you will authorize the fixed amount option for TQSE 
reimbursement;
    (d) Who will determine the appropriate period of time for which TQSE 
reimbursement will be authorized, including approval of extensions and 
interruptions of temporary quarters occupancy; and
    (e) Who will determine whether quarters were indeed temporary, if 
there is any doubt.


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.302  Under what circumstances may we authorize the TQSE allowance?

    You may authorize a TQSE allowance on an individual-case basis when 
use of temporary quarters is justified in connection with an employee's 
transfer to a new official station. You may not authorize a TQSE 
allowance for vacation purposes or other reasons unrelated to the 
transfer.


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.303  What factors should we consider in determining whether the 
TQSE allowance is actually necessary?

    The factors you should consider include:

[[Page 143]]

    (a) The length of time the employee should reasonably be expected to 
occupy his/her residence at the old official station prior to reporting 
for duty at the new official station. An employee and his/her immediate 
family should continue to occupy the residence at the old official 
station for as long as practicable to avoid the necessity for temporary 
quarters.
    (b) The existence of less expensive alternatives. If a less 
expensive alternative to the TQSE allowance exists that will enable the 
employee to find permanent quarters at the new official station, you 
should consider such an alternative. For example, authorize a 
househunting trip instead of temporary quarters if it would cost less 
overall.
    (c) The existence of other opportunities to arrange for permanent 
quarters. Consider whether the employee had other adequate opportunity 
to arrange for permanent quarters. For example, you should not authorize 
temporary quarters if the employee had adequate opportunity during an 
extended temporary duty assignment to arrange for permanent quarters.


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.304  What factors should we consider in determining whether to 
offer an employee the fixed amount TQSE reimbursement option?

    The factors you should consider include:
    (a) Ease of administration. Actual TQSE reimbursement requires an 
agency to review claims for the validity, accuracy, and reasonableness 
of each expense amount. Fixed amount TQSE reimbursement does not require 
review of expense amounts and is therefore easier to administer.
    (b) Cost considerations. You must weigh the cost of each 
alternative. Actual TQSE reimbursement may extend up to 120 consecutive 
days, while fixed amount TQSE reimbursement is limited to 30 days. 
Actual TQSE reimbursement may be less expensive, since its ceiling is 
based on the standard CONUS rate, while fixed amount TQSE reimbursement 
is based on the locality per diem rate. However, fixed amount TQSE 
reimbursement may be less expensive because the maximum daily rate under 
actual TQSE reimbursement is a higher percentage of the applicable per 
diem rate than fixed amount TQSE reimbursement.
    (c) Treatment of employee. The employee is allowed to choose between 
actual TQSE reimbursement and fixed amount TQSE reimbursement when you 
offer the fixed amount TQSE reimbursement method. You therefore should 
weigh employee morale and productivity considerations against actual 
cost considerations in determining which method to offer.


<R05>
Sec. 302-6.305  What factors should we consider in determining whether 
quarters are temporary?

    In determining whether quarters are ``temporary'', you should 
consider factors such as the duration of the lease, movement of 
household effects into the quarters, the type of quarters, the 
employee's expressions of intent, attempts to secure a permanent 
dwelling, and the length of time the employee occupies the quarters.

storage of household goods (HHG) at Government expense when a relocation 
has been determined to be in the interest of the Government:
    (a) An employee transferred between official duty stations, within 
or outside the continental United States (CONUS);
    (b) A new appointee to his/her first official duty station within or

<R05>
Sec. 302-7.2  What is the maximum weight of HHG that may be transported or 
stored at Government expense?

    The maximum weight allowance of HHG that may be shipped or stored at 
Government expense is 18,000 pounds net weight.


<R05>
Sec. 302-7.3  May HHG be transported or stored in more than one lot?

    Household goods may be transported and stored in multiple lots,

<R05>
Sec. 302-7.4  Does the weight of any professional books, papers and equipment 
(PBP&E) count against the 18,000 pound HHG weight limitation?

    Yes, the weight on any PBP&E is generally part of and not in 
addition to the 18,000 pound HHG weight limitation. However, if the 
weight of any PBP&E causes the lot to exceed 18,000 pounds, the PBP&E

<R05>
Sec. 302-7.12  What are the various methods of shipping HHG and how is the 
weight determined for each type of shipment?

    HHG should be shipped by the most economical method available. The 
various methods of shipment and weight calculations include the 
following:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Method of shipment          How weight of shipment is determined
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) Uncrated (shipped in HHG        The net weight will be shown on the
 movers van or similar conveyance).  bill of lading or weight
                                     certificate attached and includes
                                     the weight of barrels, boxes,
                                     cartons, and similar material used
                                     in packing, but does not include
                                     pads, chains, dollies and other
                                     equipment to load and secure the
                                     shipment.
(b) Crated shipments..............  When crated the net weight will not
                                     include the weight of the crating
                                     material. The net weight will be
                                     computed as being 60 percent of the
                                     gross weight. However, if the net
                                     weight computed in this manner
                                     exceeds the applicable weight
                                     limitation and if it is determined
                                     that, for reasons beyond the
                                     employee's control, unusually heavy
                                     crating and packing materials were
                                     necessarily used, the net weight
                                     may be computed at less than 60
                                     percent of the gross weight.
(c) Containerized shipments         When the known tare weight does not
 (Special containers designed,       include the weight of interior
 e.g., lift vans, CONEX              bracing and padding materials but
 transporters, HHG shipping boxes,   only the weight of the container,
 for repeated use).                  the net weight will be 85 percent
                                     of the gross weight less the weight
                                     of the container. If the known tare
                                     weight includes such material, so
                                     that the net weight is the same as
                                     it would be for uncrated shipments
                                     in interstate commerce, the net
                                     weight will not be subject to
                                     reduction.

[[Page 147]]

 
(d) Constructive weight...........  If adequate scales are not available
                                     at origin, en route or at
                                     destination, a constructive weight
                                     based on 7 pounds per cubic foot of
                                     properly loaded van space may be
                                     used. Such weight may be used for a
                                     part-load when its weight could not
                                     be obtained, without first
                                     unloading it or other part-loads
                                     being carried in the same vehicle
                                     or when the HHG are not weighed
                                     because the carrier's charges for
                                     local or metropolitan area moves
                                     are properly computed on the basis
                                     other than weight or volume of the
                                     shipment (as when payment is based
                                     on an hourly rate and distance
                                     involved). In such instances a
                                     statement from the carrier showing
                                     the properly loaded van space
                                     required for the shipment should be
                                     obtained with respect to proof of
                                     entitlement to a commuted rate
                                     payment when net weight cannot be
                                     shown.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 302-7.13  What methods of transporting and paying for the movement of 
HHG, PBP&E and temporary storage are authorized?

    There are two authorized methods of transporting and paying for the 
movement of HHG, PBP&E and temporary storage. Your agency will determine 
which of the following methods will be authorized.
    (a) Commuted rate system. Under the commuted rate system you assume 
total responsibility for arranging and paying for, at least the 
following services: packing/unpacking, crating/uncrating, pickup/
deliver, weighing, line-haul, drayage, and temporary storage of your HHG 
and PBP&E with a commercial HHG carrier or by renting self drive 
equipment for a do-it-yourself move. When any PBP&E is transported as an 
administrative expense of your agency, all arrangements (e.g., packing/
unpacking, pickup/delivery, weighing, temporary storage, etc.) will be 
handled and paid for by your agency.
    (b) Actual expense method. Under the actual expense method, your 
agency assumes the responsibility for arranging and paying for all 
aspects (e.g., packing/unpacking, pickup/delivery, weighing, line-haul, 
drayage, temporary storage, etc.), of transporting your HHG and PBP&E 
with a commercial HHG carrier.


<R05>
Sec. 302-7.14  Are there any disadvantages to using the commuted rate method 
for transporting HHG, PBP&E and temporary storage?

    Yes. The disadvantages to using the commuted rate method for 
transporting HHG, PBP&E and temporary storage are that the:
    (a) Government cannot take advantage of any special rates that may 
be offered only to Government shipments;
    (b) Commuted rate method does not apply to intrastate moves; and
    (c) Commuted rate method may not fully reimburse your out-of-pocket 
expenses.


<R05>
Sec. 302-7.15  Must I use the method selected by my agency for transporting 
my HHG, PBP&E and temporary storage?

    No, you do not have to use the method selected (Sec. 302-7.301) by 
your agency, and you may pursue other methods, however, your 
reimbursement is limited to the actual cost incurred, not to exceed what 
the Government would have incurred under the commuted rate system within 
CONUS and the actual expense method OCONUS.


<R05>

Sec. 302-7.16  Is the maximum weight allowance for HHG and temporary storage 
limited when quarters are furnished or partly furnished by the Government 
OCONUS or 
          upon return to CONUS?

    When quarters are furnished or partly furnished by the Government 
OCONUS, your agency may limit the weight of HHG and temporary storage 
that can be transported to that location. Only the authorized weight 
allowance that was shipped to the OCONUS location may be returned to 
CONUS upon completion of the tour of duty, unless the agency makes an 
exception under conditions specified in agency internal regulations.


<R05>

Sec. 302-7.17  May PBP&E be transported at Government expense upon 
returning to CONUS for separation from Government service, after completion of an OCONUS 
          assignment?

    Any PBP&E that was transported as an administrative expense of the 
Government to the OCONUS assignment

[[Page 148]]

will be returned as an administrative expense of the Government to the 
place of actual residence or any other location, not to exceed the cost 
to the authorized destination.


<R05>
Sec. 302-7.18  Who is liable for any loss or damage to HHG incident to an 
authorized relocation?

    When transporting HHG under the commuted rate or actual expense 
method and a commercial HHG carrier is used, the carrier accepts limited 
liability for any loss or damage in accordance with HHG carrier tariffs. 
For transporting HHG by self drive equipment for a do-it-yourself-move 
and for any loss or damage not covered by the HHG carrier, see part 302-
11 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 302-7.19  Should I include items that are irreplaceable or of extremely 
high monetary or sentimental value in my HHG shipment?

    Generally no; items that are irreplaceable or of extremely high 
monetary or sentimental value should not be included in your HHG 
shipment. Additional insurance may be purchased, at your expense, to 
cover any loss or damage, however, such items are not necessarily 
provided special security. Accordingly, it is advisable that you or an 
immediate family member(s) transport such items personally.


<R05>

Sec. 302-7.20  If my HHG shipment includes an item (e.g. boat, trailer, 
ultralight vehicle) for which a weight additive is assessed by the HHG 
carrier, am I 
          responsible for payment?

    If your HHG shipment includes an item (e.g. boat or trailer of 
reasonable size) for which a weight additive is assessed by the HHG 
carrier (as prescribed in applicable tariffs), and your shipment exceeds 
the maximum weight prescribed in Sec. 302-7.2, you are responsible for 
all excess charges and any special packing, crating, and handling of the 
weight additive item. See Sec. 302-7.200 on how charges are paid and who 
makes the shipping arrangements.

<R04>
                        Subpart B--Commuted Rate


<R05>
Sec. 302-7.100  How are the charges of transporting HHG, and temporary 
storage calculated?

    The charges for transporting HHG, and temporary storage are computed 
by multiplying the number of pounds shipped divided by 100 (within the 
18,000 maximum limitation) by the applicable rate per one-hundred pounds 
for the distance transported. This includes, but is not limited to 
packing/unpacking, crating/uncrating, drayage, weighing, pickup/
delivery, line-haul, accessorial charges, and temporary storage charges, 
including but not limited to handling in/out, etc. However, your 
reimbursement may not fully cover your total out-of-pocket expenses. In 
determining the distance shipped you may use the Household Goods 
Carriers Mileage Guide (issued by the Household Goods Carriers' Bureau, 
1611 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA 22314-3482), tariffs filed with GSA 
travel management centers, or any other mileage guide authorized by your 
agency. If the exact mileage is not shown, the next higher mileage 
distance applies. If there is a minimum weight charge above the actual 
weight under applicable tariffs, reimbursement will be based on the 
minimum weight charge instead of the actual weight.


<R05>
Sec. 302-7.101  Where can the commuted rate schedules for the transportation 
of HHG, and temporary storage be found?

    The charges for the line-haul transportation, packing, crating, 
unpacking, drayage incident to transportation, and other accessorial 
charges for HHG, and temporary storage can be found in the Household 
Goods Carrier Bureau tariff (issued by the Household Goods Carriers' 
Bureau, 1611 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA 22314-3482) or by contacting 
the GSA travel management center or the appropriate office designated in 
your agency.


<R05>
Sec. 302-7.102  How is the mileage distance determined under the commuted 
rate method?

    To determine the distance from the authorized origin to the 
authorized

[[Page 149]]

destination, the Household Goods Carriers Standard Mileage Guide, or a 
standard road atlas issued by The Household Goods Carrier's Bureau, or 
any other mileage guide authorized by your agency.
    Note to Secs. 302-7.100 and 302-7.102. Any substantial deviation 
from the distances shown in the authorized mileage guides must be 
explained on the travel claim.


<R05>

Sec. 302-7.103  How are the charges calculated when a carrier charges a 
minimum weight, but the actual weight of HHG, PBP&E and temporary storage 
is less than 
          the minimum weight charged?

    Charges for HHG, PBP&E and temporary storage are calculated based on 
the minimum weight charged by the carrier, but not to exceed 18,000 
pounds.


<R05>
Sec. 302-7.104  What documentation must be provided for reimbursement?

    When claiming reimbursement under the commuted rate, you must 
provide:
    (a) A receipted copy of the bill of lading (reproduced copies are 
acceptable) including any attached weight certificate copies if issued; 
or
    (b) Other evidence showing points of origin and destination and the 
weight of your HHG, if no bill of lading was issued, or
    (c) If a commercial HHG carrier is not used, you are responsible for 
establishing the weight of the HHG, and temporary storage by obtaining 
proper certified weight certificates. Certified weight certificates 
include the gross and tare weights. This is required because payment at 
commuted rates on the basis of constructive weight usually is not 
possible.


<R05>
Sec. 302-7.105  May an advance of funds be authorized for transporting HHG 
and temporary storage?

    An advance of funds may be authorized when the transportation of HHG 
and temporary storage is authorized under the commuted rate method.


<R05>
Sec. 302-7.106  What documentation is required to receive an advance under 
the commuted rate method?

    To receive an advance under the commuted rate method, you must 
provide a copy of an estimate of costs from a commercial HHG carrier or 
a written statement that includes:
    (a) Origin and destination;
    (b) A signed copy of a commercial bill of lading annotated with 
actual weight (or other evidence of actual weight) or a reasonable 
estimate acceptable to your agency; and
    (c) Anticipated temporary storage period (not to exceed 90 days) at 
Government expense.


<R05>
Sec. 302-7.107  May my HHG be temporarily stored at Government expense?

    Yes, HHG may be stored at Government expense incident to the 
transporting of such goods either at the HHG carrier storage facility or 
a self storage facility. Storage may be at any combination of origin, en 
route locations or destination.


<R05>
Sec. 302-7.108  What temporary storage expenses will be reimbursed?

    The following will be reimbursed:
    (a) Reimbursable temporary storage cost incident to storage at the 
HHG carriers facility are:
    (1) Handling in;
    (2) Daily storage;
    (3) Handling out; and
    (4) Drayage to residence.
    (b) Reimbursable cost of storage at a self storage facility. This is 
the cost of the storage space that will reasonably accommodate the HHG 
transported.


<R05>
Sec. 302-7.109  Are receipts required?

    Yes, under the commuted rate system, a receipted copy of the 
warehouse or other bill for storage is required to support 
reimbursement.


<R05>
Sec. 302-7.110  Is there a reimbursement limit?

    Yes, reimbursement must not exceed the rates published in the 
Nationwide Household Goods Commercial Relocation Tariff (issued by the 
Household Goods Carriers' Bureau, 1611 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA 
22314-3482), supplements thereto and reissues thereof.

                    Subpart C--Actual Expense Method


<R05>

Sec. 302-7.200  How are charges paid and who makes the arrangements for 
transporting HHG, PBP&E and temporary storage under the actual expense 
method?

    Your agency is responsible for making all the necessary arrangements 
for transporting HHG, PBP&E, and temporary storage, including but not 
limited to packing/unpacking, crating/uncrating, pickup/delivery, 
weighing, line-haul, etc., under the actual expense method. Your agency 
will issue a Bill of Lading or any other shipping document with all 
charges billed directly to the agency. Any cost or weight in excess of 
18,000 pounds will be at your expense. If the shipment exceeds the 
maximum weight prescribed in Sec. 302-7.2, the Government will pay the 
total charges and the employee will reimburse the Government for the 
cost of transportation and other charges applicable to the excess 
weight.

    Note to subpart D: Use of pronouns ``we'', ``you'', and their 
variants throughout this subpart refers to the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 302-7.300  What policies and procedures must we establish for this part?

    You must establish policies and procedures as required for this 
part, including who will:
    (a) Administer your household goods program;
    (b) Authorize PBP&E to be transported as an agency administrative 
expense;
    (c) Authorize temporary storage in excess of the initial 90-day 
limit;
    (d) Collect any excess cost or charges;
    (e) Advise the employee on the Government's liability for any loss 
and damage claims under 31 U.S.C. 3721-3723; and
    (f) Ensure that international HHG shipments by water are made on 
ships registered under the laws of the United States whenever such ships 
are available.


<R05>
Sec. 302-7.301  What method of transporting HHG should we authorize?

    You should authorize one of the following methods, of transporting 
an employee's HHG, PBP&E and temporary storage. The selected method 
should be stated on the relocation travel authorization.
    (a) Commuted rate system. For relocation or first duty station 
assignment within CONUS. This method will be used without regard to the 
actual expense method, unless that method is more economical to the 
Government and results in a savings of $100 or more. Under this system 
the employee assumes total responsibility for arranging and paying for, 
at least the following services: Packing/unpacking, crating/uncrating, 
pickup/deliver, weighing, line-haul, drayage, and temporary storage of 
your HHG and PBP&E with a commercial HHG carrier or by renting self 
drive equipment for a do-it-yourself move. When any PBP&E is transported 
as an administrative expense of the agency, all arrangements (e.g., 
packing/unpacking, pickup/delivery, weighing, temporary storage, etc.) 
will be handled and paid for by you the agency.
    (b) Actual expense method. For all shipments OCONUS and where deemed 
economical to the Government within CONUS. Under the actual expense 
method, the Government assumes the responsibility for arranging and 
paying for all aspects (e.g., packing/unpacking, pickup/delivery, 
weighing, line-haul, drayage, temporary storage, etc.,) of transporting 
the employee's HHG, PBP&E.

[[Page 151]]


<R05>
Sec. 302-7.302  What method of transporting should we authorize for PBP&E?

    You should authorize the actual expense method for transporting an 
employee's PBP&E only when the weight of the PBP&E causes the employee's 
shipment to exceed the maximum 18,000 pound HHG weight limitation. PBP&E 
should be weighed prior to shipment, if necessary, so the weight can 
easily be deducted from the 18,000 pound weight allowance. The PBP&E 
shipment should then be made separately from the HHG shipment and is an 
administrative expense to your agency.


<R05>
Sec. 302-7.303  What guidelines must we follow when authorizing 
transportation of PBP&E as an administrative expense?

    You have the sole discretion to authorize transportation of PBP&E 
provided that:
    (a) An itemized inventory of PBP&E is provided for review by the 
authorizing official at the new official station;
    (b) The authorizing official has certified that the PBP&E are 
necessary for performance of the employee's duties at the new duty 
station, and if these items were not transported, the same or similar 
items would have to be obtained at Government expense for the employee's 
use at the new official station; and
    (c) You have acquired evidence that transporting the PBP&E would 
cause the employee's HHG to exceed 18,000 pound maximum weight 
allowances.
    Note to Sec. 302-7.303: PBP&E transported as an agency 
administrative expense to an OCONUS location may be returned to CONUS as 
an agency administrative expense for an employee separating from 
Government service.


<R05>

Sec. 302-7.304  When HHG are shipped under the actual expense method, and 
PBP&E as an administrative expense, in the same lot, are separate weight 
certificates 
          required?

    Yes, the weight of the PBP&E and the administrative appropriation 
chargeable must be listed as separate items on the bill of lading or 
other shipping document.

    Your agency may authorize extended storage of HHG under the 
following circumstances:
    (a) Extended storage of HHG may be authorized in lieu of shipment 
when:
    (1) You are assigned to an isolated duty station within CONUS (see 
subpart B of this part);
    (2) You are assigned to an overseas official station where your 
agency limits the amount of HHG you may transport to that location;
    (3) You are assigned to an OCONUS official station and your agency

to do so; or
    (4) It is necessary for a temporary change of station (TCS).
    (b) Extended storage of HHG is not permitted for a career SES 
employee eligible for last move home benefits.


<R05>
Sec. 302-8.2  What is the purpose of extended storage?

3.400 of this chapter;
    (b) Assigned to isolated locations in CONUS to which the employee 
cannot take or at which the employee is unable to use his/her HHG and 
personal effects because of the absence of residence quarters at that 
location,
    (c) Assigned OCONUS when:
    (1) The official station is one to which you cannot take or at which 
you are unable to use your HHG and your personal effects; or

<R05>
Sec. 302-8.100  What is the policy for extended storage of HHG during 
assignment to isolated locations in CONUS?

    Extended storage of HHG belonging to an employee transferred or a 
new appointee assigned to an official station at an isolated location in

[[Page 153]]


<R05>
Sec. 302-8.101  What are the criteria for determining whether an official 
station is an isolated official station for purposes of this part?

    (a) As determined by your agency, an official station at an isolated 
location is a place of permanent duty assignment in CONUS at which you 
have no alternative except to live where you are unable to use your HHG 
because:
    (1) The type of quarters you are required to occupy at the isolated 
official station will not accommodate your HHG; or
    (2) Residence quarters which would accommodate your HHG are not 
available within reasonable daily commuting distance of the official 
station.
    (b) The designation of an official station as isolated in accordance 
with paragraph (a) of this section shall not preclude a determination in 
individual instances that adequate housing is available for some 
employees stationed there based on housing which may be available within 
daily commuting distance and the size and other characteristics of each 
employee's immediate family. In such instances the station shall not be 
considered isolated with regard to you if your agency determines 
adequate family housing is available for you.
    Note to Sec. 302-8.101: Heads of agencies concerned are responsible 
for designating the isolated official station at which conditions exist 
for allowing extended storage of HHG at Government expense for some or 
all employees.


<R05>
Sec. 302-8.102  Am I eligible for extended storage of HHG and personal 
effects?

effects if:
    (a) You are stationed at an isolated official station which your 
agency determines meets the criteria in Sec. 302-8.101;
    (b) You performed relocation travel or travel as a new appointee; 
and
    (c) Your agency authorizes payment for extended storage of your HHG.


<R05>
Sec. 302-8.103  Where may my HHG be stored?

    Your HHG may be stored either in:
    (a) Available Government-owned storage space; or
    (b) Suitable commercial storage space obtained by the Government if:
    (1) Government-owned space is not available, or
    (2) Commercial storage space is more economical or suitable because 
of location, transportation costs, or for other reasons.


<R05>
Sec. 302-8.104  What are the allowable costs for storage?

    Allowable costs for storage include the cost of:
    (a) Necessary packing;

storage at Government expense, if authorized by your agency.


<R05>
Sec. 302-8.108  What is the authorized time period for extended storage of 
my HHG?

    The authorized time period for extended storage of your HHG is for 
the duration of the assignment not to exceed 3-years. However:
    (a) Your agency will conduct periodic reviews to determine whether 
current

[[Page 154]]

housing conditions at your isolated official station warrant 
continuation of storage;
    (b) Eligibility for extended storage at Government expense will 
terminate on your last day of active duty at the isolated official 
station. However your HHG may remain in temporary storage for an 
additional period of time not to exceed 90 days, if approved by your 
agency.
    (c) When eligibility ceases, storage at Government expense may 
continue until the beginning of the second month after the month in 
which your tour at the official station OCONUS terminates, unless to

less than the cost of round-trip transportation (including temporary 
storage) of the HHG to your new official station.


<R05>
Sec. 302-8.201  Am I entitled to reimbursement for extended storage of HHG?

    No, your agency will determine when it is in the Government's 
interest to reimburse you for extended storage of HHG OCONUS.

    (c) Meet any specific conditions your agency has established.

[[Page 179]]


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.4  For what relocation services expenses will my agency pay?

    Your agency will pay the relocation services company's fees/expenses 
for the services you are authorized to use. If your agency pays the 
relocation services company for actual expenses the company incurs on 
your behalf, payment to the company is limited to what you would have 
received under the direct reimbursement provisions of this chapter.


<R05>

substitute for reimbursable relocation allowance, will I be reimbursed for 
the relocation 
          allowance as well?

    No, if you use a contracted-for relocation service that is a 
substitute for reimbursable relocation allowance, you will not be

<R05>

Sec. 302-12.6  What expenses will my agency pay if I use a relocation 
services company to ship household goods in excess of the maximum weight 
allowance?

Sec. 302-12.7  What expenses will my agency pay if I use a relocation 
services company to sell or purchase a residence for which I and/or a 
member(s) of my 
          immediate family do not have full title?

    If you use a relocation services company to sell or purchase a 
residence for which you and/or a member(s) of your immediate family do 
not have full title, your agency will pay the portion of the relocation 
services company's fee attributable to your pro rata share of the

<R05>
Sec. 302-12.8  If my agency authorizes me to enter a homesale program, must 
I accept a buyout offer from the relocation services company?

(as compensation for services) any amount received or accrued, directly 
or indirectly, by an individual as a payment for or reimbursement of 
expenses of moving from one residence to another residence which is 
attributable to employment. You will receive a relocation income tax 
(RIT) allowance if your agency determines that such expenses are 
taxable. The Government does not assume responsibility for payment of 
your taxes, however, and you may wish to consult a tax professional on 
income tax reporting.


<R04>
        Subpart B--Agency's Use of a Relocation Services Company

    Note to subpart B: Use of pronouns ``we'', ``you'', and their 
variants throughout this subpart refers to the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.100  What are ``relocation services''?

    ``Relocation services'' are services provided by a private company 
under a contract with an agency to assist a transferred employee in 
relocating to the new official station. Examples include homesale 
programs, home marketing assistance, home finding assistance, and 
property management services.

[[Page 180]]


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.101  May we enter into a contract with a relocation services 
company for the company to provide relocation services?

    Yes, you may enter into a contract with a relocation services 
company for the company to provide relocation services.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.102  What contracted relocation services may we provide at 
Government expense?

    You may pay for contracted relocation services that are substitutes 
for reimbursable relocation allowances authorized throughout this

for residence sale expenses, or household goods management services as a 
substitute for transportation of household goods.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.103  May we separately contract for each type of relocation 
service?

    Yes, you may separately contract for each type of relocation service 
or you may combine several types of relocation services in a single 
contract.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.104  What is the purpose of contracting for relocation services?

    The purpose of contracting for relocation services is to improve the 
treatment of employees who are directed to relocate to facilitate the 
retention of a well-qualified workforce.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.105  How must we administer a relocation services contract?

    You must balance the positive effects that availability of 
relocation services has on employee mobility and morale with any 
increased costs your agency may experience as a result of providing 
relocation services.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.106  What policies must we establish when offering our employees 
the services of a relocation services company?

    When offering your employees the services of a relocation services 
company, you must establish policies governing:
    (a) The conditions under which you will authorize an employee to use 
a relocation services company;
    (b) Which employees you will allow to use a relocation services 
company;
    (c) What relocation services you will offer an employee; and
    (d) Who will determine in each case if an employee may use a 
relocation services company and what services will be offered.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.107  What rules must we follow when contracting for relocation 
services?

    You must follow the rules contained in the Federal Acquisition 
Regulations (FAR) (48 CFR) and/or other procurement regulations 
applicable to your agency.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.108  What are the income tax consequences that we must consider 
when offering relocation services?

    Amounts you pay to a relocation services company on behalf of an 
employee may be taxable to the employee. In some cases, such as certain 
homesale programs, the amounts may not be taxable. You must determine 
the taxability of such payments, and pay a relocation income tax (RIT) 
allowance in accordance with part 302-17 of this chapter on payments you 
determine to be taxable to the employee. You may contact the: Assistant 
Chief Counsel (Income Tax & Accounting), Internal Revenue Service, 1111 
Constitution Avenue, NW., Room 5501, Washington, DC 20224, for 
information on the income tax consequences of payments you make to a 
relocation services company.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.109  What must we consider in deciding whether to use the 
fixed-fee or cost-reimbursable contracting method?

    You must consider the following factors in deciding whether to use 
the fixed-fee or cost-reimbursable contracting method:
    (a) Risk of alternative methods. Under a fixed fee contract, the 
relocation services company bears all risks not expressly contained in 
the contract. Under a cost-reimbursable contract, you must assume some 
or all risks and, therefore, must assume some management 
responsibilities under the contract as well. For example, under a fixed 
fee homesale program you are not directly liable for losses incurred if 
a residence does not sell immediately,

[[Page 181]]

while under a cost-reimbursable homesale program you assume some or all 
risks of selling the residence.
    (b) Cost of alternative methods. Under the fixed fee method of 
contracting, the fee includes a cost component for risks assumed by the 
relocation services company. Under the cost-reimbursable method of 
contracting, you are directly responsible for some or all of the costs 
associated with management of the contract. In deciding whether to use 
cost-reimbursable contracting you, therefore, must consider the cost of 
resources you would require (including personnel costs) to manage a 
cost-reimbursable relocation services contract.
    (c) Effect on the obligation of funds. You must obligate funds for a 
relocation in the fiscal year in which the purchase order is awarded 
under the contract. Under the fixed fee contracting method, the amount 
of the relocation services fee is fixed and you have a basis for 
determining the amount of funds to obligate. Under the cost-reimbursable 
contracting method, you must obligate funds based on an estimate of the 
costs that will be incurred. When opting for cost-reimbursable 
contracting you, therefore, should establish a reliable method of 
computing fund obligation estimates.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.110  May we take title to an employee's residence?

    No, you may not take title to an employee's residence except as 
specifically provided by statute. The statutes which form the basis for 
the provisions of this part do not provide such authority.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.111  Under a homesale program, may we establish a maximum home 
value above which we will not pay for homesale services?

    Yes, if a home exceeding the maximum value above which you will not 
pay is sold under your homesale program, the employee will be 
responsible for any additional costs. You must establish a maximum 
amount commensurate with your agency's experience. You may consider, 
among other factors, budgetary constraints, the value range of homes in 
areas where you have offices, and the value range of homes previously 
entered in your program.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.112  Under a homesale program, may we pay an employee for losses 
he/she incurs on the sale of a residence?

    No, under a home sale program, you may not pay an employee for 
losses he/she incurs on the sale of a residence, but this does not 
preclude you reimbursing a relocation service's company for losses 
incurred while the contractor holds the property.


<R05>
Sec. 302-12.113  Under a homesale program, may we direct the relocation 
services company to pay an employee more than the fair market value of his/her 
          residence?

    No, under a homesale program, you may not direct the relocation 
services company to pay an employee more than the fair market value (as 
determined by the residence appraisal process) of his/her home.


<R05>

Sec. 302-12.114  May we use a relocation services contract for services 
which we are contractually bound to obtain under another travel services 
contract?

    No, you may not use a relocation services contract to which you are 
contractually bound to obtain the services of another relocation service 
provider or to circumvent the travel and transportation expense payment 
system contract if you are a user of that contract.

             Subpart A--Payment of Incentive to the Employee

    Note to subpart A: Use of pronouns ``I'', ``you'', and their 
variants throughout this subpart refers to the employee.


<R05>
Sec. 302-14.1  What is a ``homesale program'?

    A ``homesale program'' is a program offered by an agency through a 
contractual arrangement with a relocation services company. The 
relocation services company purchases a transferred employee's residence 
at fair market (appraised) value and then independently markets and 
sells the residence.


<R05>
Sec. 302-14.2  What is the purpose of a home marketing incentive payment?

    The purpose of a home marketing incentive payment is to reduce the 
Government's relocation costs by encouraging transferred employees to 
participate in their employing agency's homesale program to 
independently and aggressively market, and find a bona fide buyer for 
their residence. This significantly reduces the fees/expenses their 
agencies must pay to relocation services companies and effectively 
lowers the cost of such programs.


<R05>
Sec. 302-14.3  Am I eligible to receive a home marketing incentive payment?

    Yes, you are eligible to receive a home marketing incentive payment 
if you are an employee who is authorized to transfer and you otherwise 
meet requirements for sale of your residence at Government expense.


<R05>
Sec. 302-14.4  Must my agency pay me a home marketing incentive?

    No, your agency determines when it is in the Government's interest 
to offer you a home marketing incentive.


<R05>
Sec. 302-14.5  Under what circumstances will I receive a home marketing 
incentive payment?

    You will receive a home marketing incentive payment when:
    (a) You enter your residence in your agency's homesale program;
    (b) You independently and aggressively market your residence;
    (c) You find a bona fide buyer for your residence as a result of 
your independent marketing efforts;
    (d) You transfer the residence to the relocation services company;
    (e) Your agency pays a reduced fee/expenses to the relocation 
services company as a result of your independent marketing efforts;
    (f) You meet any additional conditions your agency has established, 
including but not limited to, mandatory marketing periods, list price 
guidelines, closing requirements, and residence value caps; and
    (g) Your agency has established a home marketing incentive program.


<R05>
Sec. 302-14.6  How much may my agency pay me for a home marketing incentive?

    Your agency will determine the amount of your home marketing 
incentive payment. The incentive payment, however, may not exceed the 
lesser of:
    (a) Five percent of the price the relocation services company paid 
when it purchased the residence from you; or
    (b) The savings your agency realized from the reduced fee/expenses 
it paid as a result of you finding a bona fide buyer.

[[Page 183]]


<R05>
Sec. 302-14.7  Are there tax consequences when I receive a home marketing 
incentive payment?

    Yes, the home marketing incentive payment is considered income. 
Consequently, you will be taxed, and your agency will withhold income 
and employment taxes, on the home marketing incentive payment. You will 
not, however, receive a withholding tax allowance (WTA) to offset the 
withholding on your home marketing incentive payment, nor will you 
receive a relocation income tax (RIT) allowance payment for 
substantially all of your Federal, state and local income taxes on the 
incentive payment.

Sec. 302-14.100  How should we administer our home marketing incentive payment 
program?

    Your goal in using an incentive payment program is to reduce your 
overall relocation costs. You must not make a home marketing incentive 
payment that exceeds the savings you realize from the reduced fees/
expenses you pay the relocation services company.


<R05>
Sec. 302-14.101  What policies must we establish to govern our home marketing 
incentive payment program?

    You must establish policies to govern:
    (a) The conditions under which you will authorize a home marketing 
incentive payment for an employee;
    (b) The amount of the home marketing incentive payment(s) you will 
offer (or) the method you will use to compute your home marketing 
incentive payments); and
    (c) Who will determine in each case whether a home marketing 
incentive payment is authorized.


<R05>
Sec. 302-14.102  What factors should we consider in determining whether 
to establish a home marketing incentive payment program?

    In determining whether to establish a home marketing incentive 
payment program, you should consider:
    (a) Whether the program will increase the percentage of residences 
sold for which employees find a bona fide buyer. You should establish a 
benchmark for the percentage of residences for which you expect 
employees to find a bona fide buyer resulting in lower homesale costs to 
you. If your historical percentage of employee-generated sales is below 
your benchmark, a home marketing incentive payment program may benefit 
you; and
    (b) The expected net savings from a home marketing incentive payment 
program.


<R05>
Sec. 302-14.103  What factors should we consider in determining the amount 
of a home marketing incentive payment?

    In determining the amount of a home marketing incentive payment, you 
should consider the:
    (a) Amount of savings from reduced fee/expenses paid to the 
relocation services company. The home marketing incentive payment 
program is intended to reduce your relocation costs. The amount of each 
home marketing incentive payment you make, therefore, must not exceed 
the savings you realize from the reduced fee you pay to the relocation 
services company; and
    (b) Employee's efforts in marketing the residence. The purpose of a 
home marketing incentive payment program is to encourage a transferred 
employee who participates in a homesale program to independently and 
aggressively market his/her residence and find a bona fide buyer.

<R05>
Sec. 302-17.1  Authority.

    Payment of a relocation income tax (RIT) allowance is authorized to 
reimburse eligible transferred employees for substantially all of the 
additional Federal, State, and local income taxes incurred by the 
employee, or by the employee and spouse if a joint tax return is filed, 
as a result of certain travel and transportation expense and relocation 
allowances which are furnished in kind, or for which reimbursement or an 
allowance is provided by the Government. Payment of the RIT allowance 
also is authorized for income taxes paid to the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. 
possessions in accordance with a decision of the Comptroller General of 
the United States (67 Comp. Gen. 135 (1987)). The RIT allowance shall be 
calculated and paid as provided in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 302-17.2  Coverage.

    (a) Eligible employees. Payment of a RIT allowance is authorized for 
employees transferred on or after November 14, 1983, in the interest of 
the Government from one official station to another for permanent duty. 
The effective date of an employee's transfer is the date the employee 
reports for duty at the new official station as provided in part 300.3 
of this title.
    (b) Individuals not covered. The provisions of this part are not 
applicable to the following individuals or employees:
    (1) New appointees;
    (2) Employees assigned under the Government Employees Training Act 
(see 5 U.S.C. 4109); or
    (3) Employees returning from overseas assignments for the purpose of 
separation.


<R05>
Sec. 302-17.3  Types of moving expenses or allowances covered and general 
limitations.

    The RIT allowance is limited by law as to the types of moving 
expenses that can be covered. The law authorizes reimbursement of 
additional income taxes resulting from certain moving expenses furnished 
in kind or for which reimbursement or an allowance is provided to the 
transferred employee by the Government. However, such moving expenses 
are covered by the RIT allowance only to the extent that they are 
actually paid or incurred, and are not allowable as a moving expense 
deduction for tax purposes. The types of expenses or allowances listed 
in paragraphs (a) through (i) of this section, are covered by the RIT 
allowance within the limitations discussed.
    (a) En route travel. Travel (including per diem) and transportation 
expenses of the transferred employee and immediate family for en route 
travel from the old official station to the new official station. (See 
part 302-4 of this chapter.)
    (b) Household goods shipment. Transportation (including temporary 
storage) expenses for movement of household goods from the old official 
station to the new official station. (See part 302-7 of this chapter.)
    (c) Extended storage expenses. Allowable expenses for extended 
storage of

[[Page 191]]

household goods belonging to an employee transferred on or after 
November 14, 1983, through October 11, 1984, to an isolated location in 
the continental United States. (See part 302-8, of this chapter extended 
storage expenses are not covered by the RIT allowance for transfers on 
or after October 12, 1984.) (See Sec. 302-17.4(c) of this chapter.)
    (d) Mobile home movement. Expenses for the movement of a mobile home 
for use as a residence when movement is authorized instead of shipment 
and temporary storage of household goods. (See part 302-10 of this 
chapter.)
    (e) Househunting trip. Travel (including per diem) and 
transportation expenses of the employee and spouse for one round trip to 
the new official station to seek permanent residence quarters. (See part 
302-5 of this chapter.)
    (f) Temporary quarters. Subsistence expenses of the employee and 
immediate family during occupancy of temporary quarters. (See part 302-6 
of this chapter.)
    (g) Real estate expenses. Allowable expenses for the sale of the 
residence (or expenses of settlement of an unexpired lease) at the old 
official station and for purchase of a home at the new official station 
for which reimbursement is received by the employee. (See part 302-11 of 
this chapter.)
    (h) Miscellaneous expense allowance. A miscellaneous expense 
allowance for the purpose of defraying certain expenses associated with 
discontinuing a residence at one location and establishing a residence 
at the new location in connection with an authorized or approved 
permanent change of station. (See part 302-16 of this chapter.)
    (i) Relocation services. Payments, or portions thereof, made to a 
relocation service company for services provided to a transferred 
employee (see part 302-12 of this chapter), subject to the conditions 
stated in this paragraph and within the general limitations of this 
section applicable to other covered expenses.
    (1) For employees transferred on or after November 14, 1983, through 
October 11, 1984. The amount of a broker's fee or real estate 
commission, or other real estate sales transaction expenses which 
normally are reimbursable to the employee under Sec. 302-11.200 of this 
chapter, but have been paid by a relocation service company incident to 
an assigned sale from the employee, provided that such payments 
constitute income to the employee. For the purposes of this regulation, 
an assigned sale occurs when an employee obtains a binding agreement for 
the sale of his/her residence and assigns the inherent rights and 
obligations of that agreement to a relocation company that is providing 
services under contract with the employing agency. For example, if the 
employee incurs an obligation to pay a specified broker's fee or real 
estate commission under the terms of the sales agreement, this 
obligation along with the sales agreement is assigned to the relocation 
company and may, upon payment of the obligation by the relocation 
company, constitute income to the employee. (See Sec. 302-12.7 of this 
chapter entitled ``Income tax consequences of using relocation 
companies.'')
    (2) For employees transferred on or after October 12, 1984. Expenses 
paid by a relocation company providing relocation services to the 
transferred employee pursuant to a contract with the employing agency to 
the extent such payments constitute income to the employee. (See 
Sec. 302-12.7 of this chapter.)
    Note: See reference shown in parentheses for reimbursement 
provisions for each allowance listed in paragraphs (a) through (i) of 
this section. See section 217 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Publication 521 entitled ``Moving 
Expenses'' and appropriate State and local tax authority publications 
for additional information on the taxability of moving expense 
reimbursements and the allowable tax deductions for moving expenses.


<R05>
Sec. 302-17.4  Exclusions from coverage.

    The provisions of this part are not applicable to the following:
    (a) Any tax liability that may result from payments by the 
Government to relocation companies on behalf of employees transferred on 
or after November 14, 1983, through October 11, 1984, other than the 
payments for those expenses specified in Sec. 302-17.3(i)(1).
    (b) Any tax liability incurred for local income taxes other than 
city income tax as a result of moving expense reimbursements for 
employees transferred on or after November 14, 1983,

[[Page 192]]

through October 11, 1984. (See definition in Sec. 302-17.5(b).)
    (c) Any tax liability resulting from reimbursed expenses for any 
extended storage of household goods except as specifically provided for 
in Sec. 302-17.3(c).
    (d) Any tax liability resulting from paid or reimbursed expenses for 
shipment of a privately owned automobile.
    (e) Any tax liability resulting from an excess of reimbursed amounts 
over the actual expense paid or incurred. For instance, if an employee's 
reimbursement for the movement of household goods is based on the 
commuted rate schedule and his/her actual moving expenses are less than 
the reimbursement, the tax liability resulting from the difference is 
not covered by the RIT allowance. (See Sec. 302-17.8(c)(2)(i).)
    (f) Any tax liability resulting from an employee's decision not to 
deduct moving expenses for which a tax deduction is allowable under the 
Internal Revenue Code or appropriate State and local tax codes. (See 
Secs. 302-17.8(b)(1) and 302-17.8(c)(2).)
    (g) Any tax liability resulting from the payment of recruitment, 
retention, or relocation bonuses authorized by the Office of Personnel 
Management pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5753 and 5754, or any other provisions 
which allow relocation payments that are not reimbursements for travel, 
transportation, and other expenses incurred in relocation.


<R05>
Sec. 302-17.5  Definitions and discussion of terms.

    For purposes of this part, the following definitions will apply:
    (a) State income tax. A tax, imposed by a State tax authority, that 
is deductible for Federal income tax purposes as a State income tax 
under section 164(a)(3) of the IRC. ``State'' means any one of the 
several States of the United States and the District of Columbia.
    (b) Local income tax. A tax, imposed by a recognized city or county 
tax authority, that is deductible for Federal income tax purposes as a 
local (city or county) income tax under section 164(a)(3) of the IRC; 
except, that for employees transferred on or after November 14, 1983, 
through October 11, 1984, local income tax shall be construed to mean 
only city income tax. For purposes of this regulation:
    (1) City means any unit of general local government which is 
classified as a municipality by the Bureau of the Census, or which is a 
town or township that in the determination of the Secretary of the 
Treasury possesses powers and performs functions comparable to those 
associated with municipalities, is closely settled, and contains within 
its boundaries no incorporated places as defined by the Bureau of the 
Census (31 CFR 215.2(b)(1)).
    (2) County means any unit of local general government which is 
classified as a county by the Bureau of the Census (31 CFR 215.2(e)).
    (c) Covered moving expense reimbursements or covered reimbursements. 
As used herein, these terms include those moving expenses listed in 
Sec. 302-17.3 as being covered by the RIT allowance and which may be 
furnished in kind, or for which reimbursement or an allowance is 
provided by the Government.
    (d) Covered taxable reimbursements. Covered moving expense 
reimbursements minus the tax deductions allowable under the IRC and IRS 
regulations for moving expenses. (See determination in Sec. 302-
17.8(c).)
    (e) Year 1 or reimbursement year. The calendar year in which 
reimbursement or payment for moving expenses is made to, or for, the 
employee under the provisions of this part. All or part of these 
reimbursements (see Sec. 302-17.6) are reported to the IRS as income 
(wages, salary, or other compensation) to the employee for that tax year 
under the provisions of the IRC and IRS regulations, and are subject to 
Federal tax withholding. The withholding tax allowance (WTA) (see 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section) is calculated in Year 1, to cover the 
employee's Federal tax withholding obligations each time covered moving 
expense reimbursements are made that result in a Federal tax withholding 
obligation. For purposes of this part, an advance of funds for any of 
the covered moving expenses is not considered to be a reimbursement or a 
payment until the travel voucher settlement for such expenses takes 
place. If an employee's reimbursement for moving expenses is

[[Page 193]]

spread over more than one year, he/she will have more than one Year 1.
    (f) Year 2. The calendar year in which a claim for the RIT allowance 
is paid.
    (1) Generally, Year 2 will be the calendar year immediately 
following Year 1 and in which the employee files a tax return reflecting 
his/her tax liability for income received in Year 1. However, there may 
be instances where the employee's claims submission and/or payment of 
the RIT allowance is delayed beyond the calendar year immediately 
following Year 1. (Year 1 will always be the calendar year that 
reimbursements are received; see paragraph (e) of this section.) Year 2 
will be the calendar year in which the RIT allowance is actually paid.
    (2) The RIT allowance is calculated in Year 2 and paid to cover the 
additional tax liability (resulting from moving expense reimbursements 
received in Year 1) not covered by the WTA paid in Year 1. If an 
employee's covered taxable reimbursements are spread over more than one 
year, he/she will have more than one Year 2.
    (g) Federal withholding tax rate (FWTR). The tax rate applied to 
incremental income to determine the amount to be withheld for Federal 
income tax from salary or other compensation such as moving expense 
reimbursements. Because moving expense reimbursements constitute 
supplemental wages for Federal income tax purposes, the 20 percent flat 
rate of withholding is generally applicable to such reimbursements. (See 
Sec. 302-17.7(c).) Agencies should refer to the Treasury Financial 
Manual, TFM 3-5000, and applicable IRS regulations for complete and up-
to-date information on this subject.
    (h) Earned income. For purposes of the RIT allowance, ``earned 
income'' shall include only the gross compensation (salary, wages, or 
other compensation such as reimbursement for moving expenses and the 
related WTA (see paragraph (n) of this section) and any RIT allowance 
(see paragraph (m) of this section) paid for moving expense 
reimbursement in a prior year) that is reported as income on IRS Form W-
2 for the employee (employee and spouse, if filing jointly), and if 
applicable, the net earnings (or loss) for self-employment income shown 
on Schedule SE of the IRS Form 1040. Earned income may be from more than 
one source. (See Sec. 302-17.8(d).)
    (i) Marginal tax rate (MTR). The tax rate (for example, 33 percent) 
applicable to a specific increment of income. The Federal, Puerto Rico, 
and State marginal tax rates to be used in calculating the RIT allowance 
are provided in appendices A through D of this part. (See Sec. 302-
17.8(e)(3) for instructions on local marginal tax rate determinations.)
    (j) Combined marginal tax rate (CMTR). A single rate determined by 
combining the applicable marginal tax rates for Federal (or Puerto Rico, 
when applicable), State, and local income taxes, using formulas provided 
in Sec. 302-17.8(e)(5).
    (k) Gross-up. Payment for the estimated additional income tax 
liability incurred by an employee as a result of reimbursements or 
payments by the Government for the covered moving expenses listed in 
Sec. 302-17.3.
    (l) Gross-up formulas. The formulas used to determine the amount of 
the gross-up for the WTA and the RIT allowance. The gross-up formulas 
used herein compensate the employee for the initial tax, the tax on tax, 
etc. Note that the WTA gross-up formula in Sec. 302-17.7(d) is different 
than the RIT gross-up formula prescribed in Sec. 302-17.8(f).
    (m) RIT allowance. The amount of payment computed and paid in Year 2 
to cover substantially all of the estimated additional tax liability 
incurred as a result of the covered moving expense reimbursements 
received in Year 1.
    (n) Withholding tax allowance (WTA). The withholding tax allowance 
(WTA), paid in Year 1, covers the employee's Federal income tax 
withholding liability on covered taxable reimbursements received in Year 
1. The amount is computed by applying the withholding gross-up formula 
prescribed in Sec. 302-17.7(d) (using the Federal withholding tax rate) 
each time that a Federal withholding obligation is incurred on covered 
moving expense reimbursements received in Year 1. Grossing-up the 
Federal withholding amount protects the employee from using part of

[[Page 194]]

his/her moving expense reimbursement to pay Federal withholding taxes. 
(See Sec. 302-17.7.)
    (o) State gross-up. Payment for the estimated additional State 
income tax liability incurred by an employee as a result of 
reimbursements or payments by the Government for the covered moving 
expenses listed in Sec. 302-17.3 that are deductible for Federal income 
tax but not for State income tax purposes.
    (p) State gross-up formula. The formula prescribed in Sec. 302-
17.8(f)(3) to be used in determining the amount to be included in the 
RIT allowance to compensate an employee for the additional State income 
tax incurred in States that do not allow the deduction of moving 
expenses.


<R05>
Sec. 302-17.6  Procedures in general.

    (a) This regulation sets forth procedures for the computation and 
payment of the RIT allowance and defines agency and employee 
responsibilities. This part does not require changes to those internal 
fiscal procedures established by the individual agencies pursuant to IRS 
regulations, or the Treasury Financial Manual, provided that the intent 
of the statute authorizing the RIT allowance and this part are not 
disturbed.
    (b) The total amount reimbursed or paid to the employee, or on his/
her behalf, for travel, transportation, and other relocation expenses 
and allowances is includable in the employee's gross income pursuant to 
the IRC and certain State or local government tax codes. Some moving 
expenses for which reimbursements are received may be deducted from 
income by the employee as moving expense deductions, subject to certain 
limitations prescribed by the IRS or pertinent State or local tax 
authorities. Reimbursements for nondeductible moving expenses are 
subject to income tax. (See IRS Publication 521 entitled ``Moving 
Expenses'' and the appropriate State and local tax codes for detailed 
information.)
    (c) Usually, if the employee is reimbursed for nondeductible moving 
expenses, the amount of these reimbursements is subject to withholding 
of Federal income tax in accordance with IRS regulations at the time of 
reimbursement. Under existing fiscal procedures, the amount of the 
employee's withholding obligation is usually deducted either from 
reimbursements for the moving expenses at the time of reimbursement or 
from the employee's salary. (See Treasury Financial Manual.)
    (d) Payment of a WTA established herein will offset deductions for 
the Federal income tax withholding on moving expense reimbursements, and 
on the WTA itself, from the employee's moving expense reimbursements or 
from salary.
    (e) The total amount of the RIT allowance can be computed after the 
end of Year 1 as soon as the earned income level, income tax filing 
status, total covered taxable reimbursements, and the applicable 
marginal tax rates can be determined. Employee claims for the RIT 
allowance should be submitted in accordance with this part and the 
employing agency's procedures.
    (f) Procedures are prescribed in Secs. 302-17.7 and 302-17.8 for 
computation and payment of the WTA and the RIT allowance. These 
procedures are built on existing fiscal procedures and IRS regulations 
regarding reporting of employee income from reimbursements and 
withholding of taxes on supplemental wages.


<R05>
Sec. 302-17.7  Procedures for determining the WTA in Year 1.

    (a) General rules. The WTA is designed to cover only the employee's 
withholding tax obligation for Federal income taxes on income resulting 
from covered moving expense reimbursements. (See definition in Sec. 302-
17.5(c).) Other withholding tax obligations, if any, such as for social 
security taxes or for State and/or local income taxes on income 
resulting from moving expense reimbursements shall not be included in 
the calculation of the WTA payment. The amount of the WTA is equal to 
the Federal income tax withholding obligation incurred by the employee 
on covered moving expense reimbursements (which are not offset by 
deductible moving expenses) and on the WTA itself. Each time covered 
moving expense reimbursements are paid to or on behalf of the employee, 
the WTA shall be calculated, accounted for, and reported as provided in 
paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section.

[[Page 195]]

    (b) Determination of amount of reimbursement subject to withholding. 
Under IRS regulations, income resulting from reimbursements for 
nondeductible moving expenses is subject to withholding of Federal 
income taxes. (See IRS Publication 521, ``Moving Expenses.'') There are 
some moving expenses which may be reimbursed but are not covered taxable 
reimbursements (see definition in Sec. 302-17.5(d)) for purposes of the 
WTA and RIT allowance calculations, such as extended storage of 
household goods. (See exclusions in Sec. 302-17.4.) Therefore, the 
actual amount of the covered taxable reimbursements may be different 
than the amount of nondeductible moving expenses subject to Federal 
income tax withholding. The difference in these amounts should not be 
substantial; therefore, the amount of nondeductible moving expenses 
subject to Federal income tax withholding, as determined by the agency 
pursuant to IRS regulations, may be used in calculating the WTA. (Note 
that the RIT calculation procedure in Sec. 302-17.8 requires 
determination of covered taxable reimbursements.)
    (c) Determination of Federal withholding tax rate (FWTR). Moving 
expense reimbursements constitute supplemental wages for Federal income 
tax purposes. Therefore, an agency must withhold at the withholding rate 
applicable to supplemental wages. Currently, the supplemental wages 
withholding rate is 28 percent. The supplemental wages withholding rate 
should be used in calculating the WTA unless under an agency's 
withholding procedures a different withholding rate is used pursuant to 
IRS tax regulations. In such cases, the applicable withholding rate 
shall be substituted for the supplemental wages withholding rate in the 
calculation shown in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) Calculation of the WTA. The WTA is calculated by substituting 
the amounts determined in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section into 
the following WTA gross-up formula:

Formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR20NO01.000

Where:

Y = WTA
X = FWTR (generally, 28 percent)
N = nondeductible moving expenses/covered taxable reimbursements

Example:
If:

X = 28 percent
N = $20,000

    (e) WTA payment and employee agreement for repayment. (1) The WTA 
may be calculated several times within Year 1 if reimbursements for 
moving expenses are made on more than one travel voucher. Each time an 
employee is reimbursed for moving expenses which are subject to Federal 
tax withholding in accordance with the IRS regulations, the WTA will be 
calculated and paid unless the employee fails to comply with the 
requirements in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (2) The employee shall be required to agree in writing to repay any 
excess amount paid to him/her in Year 1 (see Secs. 302-17.8(f)(5) and 
302-17.9(b)(3)), and submit the required certified tax information and 
claim for his/her RIT allowance within a reasonable length of time (as 
determined by the agency) after the close of Year 1. Failure of the 
employee to comply with this requirement will preclude the agency's 
payment of the WTA. The entire WTA will be considered an excess payment 
if the RIT allowance claim is not submitted in a timely manner to settle 
the RIT allowance account.
    (f) Determination of employee's withholding tax on WTA. Since the 
amount of the WTA is considered income to the employee, it is subject to 
the same tax withholding requirements as all other moving expense 
reimbursements. (See Treasury Financial Manual, Section 4080, Moving 
Expense Reimbursements, for withholding requirements.)
    (g) End of year reporting. At the end of the year, agencies 
generally are required to issue IRS Form(s) W-2 for each employee 
showing total gross

[[Page 196]]

compensation (including moving expense reimbursements) and the 
applicable amount of Federal taxes withheld. For tax reporting purposes, 
the WTA is to be treated as a moving expense reimbursement. The total 
amount of the employee's WTA's paid during the year as well as the 
amount of moving expense reimbursements should be included as income on 
the employee's Form W-2. The Federal tax withholding amount applicable 
to the moving expense reimbursements and the WTA should also be included 
on the employee's Form W-2. The amount of the WTA's also will be 
furnished to the employee along with the amount of moving expense 
reimbursements on IRS Form 4782 or another itemized listing provided for 
the employee's use in preparing his/her tax return (see IRS regulations 
for further guidance) and in claiming the RIT allowance as provided in 
Sec. 302-17.8.


<R05>
Sec. 302-17.8  Rules and procedures for determining the RIT allowance in Year 2.

    (a) Summary/overview of procedures. The RIT allowance will be 
calculated and claimed in Year 2. This can be accomplished as soon as 
the employee can determine earned income (as defined herein), income tax 
filing status, covered taxable reimbursements for Year 1, and the 
applicable marginal tax rates. The RIT allowance is then calculated 
using the gross-up formula under procedures prescribed herein. Since the 
RIT allowance is considered income, appropriate withholding taxes on the 
RIT allowance are deducted and the balance constitutes the net payment 
to the employee. Rules, procedures, and the prescribed tax tables for 
these calculations are provided in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this 
section, and in appendices A, B, and C of this part.
    (b) General rules and assumptions. (1) The procedures prescribed 
herein for calculations and payment of the RIT allowance are based on 
certain assumptions jointly developed by GSA and IRS, and tax tables 
developed by IRS. This approach avoids a potentially controversial and 
administratively burdensome procedure requiring the employee to furnish 
extensive documentation, such as certified copies of actual tax returns 
and reconstructed returns, in support of a claim for a RIT allowance 
payment. Specifically, the following assumptions have been made:
    (i) The employee will claim allowable moving expense deductions for 
the same tax year in which the corresponding moving expense 
reimbursements are included in income;
    (ii) Changes to the IRC, applicable to the 1987 and subsequent tax 
years, require that allowable moving expense deductions must be taken as 
an itemized deduction from gross income rather than as an adjustment to 
gross income as in previous tax years. It is assumed that employees will 
receive the benefit of allowable moving expense deductions to offset 
income either by itemizing their moving expense deductions or through 
the increased standard deductions.
    (iii) Prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986, it was assumed that the 
employee's (and spouse's, if a joint return is filed) earned income, 
filing status, and CMTR determined for Year 1 (and used in determining 
the RIT allowance in Year 2) would remain the same or would not be 
substantially different in the second and subsequent tax years. However, 
the Tax Reform Act of 1986 substantially changed the Federal tax 
structure making it necessary to compute a separate CMTR for Year 1 and 
for Year 2. (See paragraph (e) of this section.) The formula for 
calculating the RIT allowance to be paid in 1988 and subsequent years is 
shown in paragraph (f) of this section. It is assumed that within the 
accuracy of the calculation, the State and local tax rates for Year 1 
and Year 2 will remain the same or will not be substantially different. 
Therefore, the State and local tax rates for Year 1 shall be used in 
calculating the CMTR for Year 2.
    (2) The prescribed procedures, which yield an estimate of an 
employee's additional tax liability due to moving expense 
reimbursements, are to be used uniformly. They are not to be adjusted to 
accommodate an employee's unique circumstance which may differ from the 
assumed circumstances stated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

[[Page 197]]

    (3) An adjustment of the RIT allowance paid in Year 2 for the 
covered taxable reimbursements received in Year 1 is required if the tax 
information certified to on the RIT allowance claim is different than 
that shown on the actual Federal tax return filed with IRS for Year 1 or 
changed for any reason after filing of the tax return, so as to affect 
the CMTR's used in the RIT allowance calculation. (See Sec. 302-17.10 
for claims procedures.)
    (c) Determination of covered taxable reimbursements. (1) Generally, 
the amount of the covered taxable reimbursements is the difference 
between (i) the amount of covered moving expense reimbursements for the 
allowances listed in Sec. 302-17.3 that was included in the employee's 
income in Year 1, and (ii) the maximum amount of allowable moving 
expenses that may be claimed as a moving expense deduction by the 
employee on his/her Federal tax return under IRS tax regulations to 
offset the income resulting from moving expense reimbursements for Year 
1. The covered taxable reimbursements will be determined as if the 
employee had itemized and deducted all allowable moving expense 
deductions. (See assumption made in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this 
section.) If the employee is precluded from claiming moving expense 
deductions because he/she does not meet IRS requirements for the 
distance test, then the amount of covered taxable reimbursements is the 
same as the amount of covered moving expense reimbursements. (See 
Sec. 302-17.5(d).)
    (2) For purposes of calculating the RIT allowance, the following 
special rules apply to the determination of moving expense deductions to 
offset moving expense reimbursements reported as income:
    (i) The total amount of reimbursement (which was reported as income) 
for the expenses of en route travel for the employee and family (see 
Sec. 302-17.3(a)) and transportation (including up to 30 days temporary 
storage) of household goods (see Sec. 302-17.3(b)) to the new official 
station shall be used as a moving expense deduction. (See also Sec. 302-
17.4(e) and (f).)
    (ii) The total amount of reimbursement for a househunting trip, 
temporary quarters (up to 30 days at new station) and real estate 
transaction expenses (see Sec. 302-17.3(e), (f), (g), and (i)), up to 
the maximum allowable deduction under IRS tax regulations, shall be used 
as a moving expense deduction. For example, an employee and spouse 
filing a joint return and residing in the same household at the end of 
the tax year may deduct up to $3,000 for these expenses. (No more than 
$1,500 of the $3,000 may be claimed for a househunting trip and 
temporary quarters expenses combined.) If the employee was reimbursed 
$1,350 for a househunting trip and temporary quarters expenses and 
$9,000 for real estate expenses, the moving expense deductions would be 
$1,350 for the househunting trip and temporary quarters expenses and 
$1,650 for real estate expenses. If the employee's reimbursement was 
$1,850 for the househunting trip and temporary quarters expenses and 
$9,000 for real estate expenses, the moving expense deductions would be 
$1,500 for the househunting trip and temporary quarters expenses and 
$1,500 for real estate expenses. If the employee had no reimbursement 
for a househunting trip and temporary quarters, the full $3,000 would be 
applied to the $9,000 reimbursement for real estate expenses. (See IRS 
Publication 521, ``Moving Expenses,'' for these and other maximums which 
vary by situation and filing status.)
    (3) Procedures and examples are provided herein as if all moving 
expense reimbursements are received in one year with all moving expense 
deductions applied in that same year to arrive at the covered taxable 
reimbursements. However, when reimbursements span more than one year, 
the amount of covered taxable reimbursements must be determined 
separately for each reimbursement year (Year 1). The maximum moving 
expense deductions apply to the entire move. Under IRS tax regulations, 
the employee has some discretion as to when he/she claims these 
deductions (e.g., in the year of the move when the expense was paid or 
in the year of reimbursement, if these actions do not occur in the same 
year). However, for purposes of the RIT allowance procedures, the moving 
expense deductions will be applied in the year that the corresponding 
reimbursement

[[Page 198]]

is made. For example, if an employee incurred and was reimbursed $1,000 
for a househunting trip and temporary quarters in 1989 and an additional 
$1,000 for temporary quarters in 1990, this employee, according to his/
her particular situation and tax filing status, may deduct $1,500 of 
these expenses in moving expense deductions. In calculating the RIT 
allowance for 1989, $1,000 of the $1,500 deduction is used to offset the 
$1,000 reimbursement in 1989 resulting in zero covered taxable 
reimbursements for the househunting trip and temporary quarters for 
1989. The remaining $500 (balance of the $1,500 not used in determining 
covered taxable reimbursements for 1989) will be used to offset the 
$1,000 temporary quarters reimbursement in 1990 (second Year 1), leaving 
$500 of the temporary quarters reimbursement as a covered taxable 
reimbursement for 1990.
    (4) Although the WTA amount is included in income (see Sec. 302-
17.7), it shall not be included in the amount of covered taxable 
reimbursements. Under the procedures and formulas established herein, 
the proper amount of the RIT allowance is calculated using the RIT 
gross-up formula with the WTA and any prior RIT allowance payments 
excluded from covered taxable reimbursements.
    (5) Agencies are cautioned that there may be moving expenses 
reimbursed to the employee that are not covered by the RIT allowance. 
(See exclusions in Sec. 302-17.4; also see discussion in Sec. 302-17.7 
regarding covered taxable reimbursements versus nondeductible expenses.)
    (d) Determination of income level and filing status. In order to 
determine the CMTR's needed to calculate the RIT allowance, the employee 
must determine the appropriate amount of earned income (as prescribed 
herein) that was or will be reported on his/her Federal tax return for 
the tax year in which the covered taxable reimbursements were received 
(Year 1). Such amount will also include the spouse's earned income if a 
joint filing status is claimed. For purposes of this regulation, 
appropriate earned income shall include only the amount of gross 
compensation reported on IRS Form(s) W-2, and, if applicable, the net 
earnings (or loss) from self-employment income as shown on Schedule SE 
of IRS Form 1040. (See Sec. 302-17.5(h).) (Note that moving expense 
reimbursements including the WTA amounts and any RIT allowance paid for 
a prior Year 1 are to be included in earned income and should be shown 
as income on the Form W-2; if they are not, other appropriate 
documentation shall be furnished by the agency.) (See Sec. 302-17.7(g).) 
The amount of earned income as determined under this paragraph and the 
tax filing status (for example, from lines 1 through 5 on the 1987 IRS 
Form 1040) shall be contained in a certified statement on, or attached 
to, the voucher claiming the RIT allowance. (See Sec. 302-17.10.) If a 
joint filing status is claimed and the spouse's earned income is 
included, the spouse must sign the certified statement. If the spouse 
does not sign the statement, earned income will include only the 
employee's earned income and the RIT allowance will be calculated on 
that basis. This condition will not apply if an employee is allowed, 
under IRS rules, to file a joint return as a surviving spouse.
    (e) Determination of the CMTR's. The gross-up formula used to 
calculate the RIT allowance in paragraph (f) of this section, requires 
the use of two CMTR's--one for Year 1 in which reimbursements were 
received and the other for Year 2 in which the RIT allowance is paid. 
CMTR's are single tax rates calculated to represent the Federal, State, 
and/or local income tax rates applicable to the earned income determined 
for Year 1. (See paragraph (d) of this section.) The CMTR's will be 
determined as follows:
    (1) Federal marginal tax rates. The Federal marginal tax rates for 
Year 1 and Year 2 are determined by using the income level and filing 
status determined under paragraph (d) of this section and contained in 
the certified statement by the employee (or employee and spouse) on the 
RIT allowance claim, and applying the prescribed Federal tax tables 
contained in appendices A and C of this part. For example, if the income 
level for the 1989 tax year (Year 1) was $84,100 for a married employee 
filing a Federal joint return, the Federal marginal tax rate would be 33 
percent for Year 1 (1989)

[[Page 199]]

(see appendix A of this part) and 28 percent for Year 2 (1990) (see 
appendix C of this part). These rates would be used regardless of how 
much of the $84,100 was attributable to reimbursement for the employee's 
relocation expenses. (Note that these marginal rates are different from 
the withholding tax rate used for the WTA.) If the employee incurs only 
Federal income tax (i.e., there are no State or local taxes), the 
Federal marginal tax rates determined from appendices A and C of this 
part are the CMTR's to be used in the RIT gross-up formula provided in 
Sec. 302-17.8(f). In such cases, the provisions of paragraphs (e)(2) and 
(3) of this section, do not apply.
    (2) State marginal tax rate. (i) If the employee incurs an 
additional State income tax (see definition in Sec. 302-17.5(a)) 
liability as a result of moving expense reimbursements, the appropriate 
State tax table in appendix B of this part is to be used to determine 
the applicable State marginal tax rate that will be substituted into the 
formula for determining the CMTR for both Year 1 and Year 2. The 
appropriate State tax table will be the one that corresponds to the tax 
year in which the reimbursements are paid to the employee (Year 1). The 
income level determined in paragraph (d) of this section for Federal 
taxes shall be used to identify the appropriate income bracket in the 
State tax table. The applicable State marginal tax rate is obtained from 
the selected income bracket column for the State where the employee is 
required to pay State income tax on moving expense reimbursements. The 
tax rates shown in the table apply to all employees regardless of their 
filing status, except where a separate rate is shown for a single filing 
status.
    (ii) The lowest income bracket shown in the State tax tables in 
appendix B of this part is $20,000-$24,999. In cases where the 
employee's (employee's and spouse's, if filing jointly) earned income as 
determined under paragraph (d) of this section is less than this income 
bracket, an appropriate State marginal tax rate shall be established by 
the employing agency from the applicable State tax code or regulations 
issued pursuant thereto. Such State marginal tax rate shall be 
representative of the earned income level in question but in no case 
more than the marginal tax rate established in appendix B of this part 
for the $20,000-$24,999 income bracket for the particular State in which 
an additional tax obligation has been incurred.
    (iii) The prescribed State marginal tax rates generally are 
expressed as a percent of taxable income. However, if the applicable 
State marginal tax rate is stated as a percentage of the Federal income 
tax liability, the State tax rate must be converted to a percent of 
taxable income to be used in the CMTR formulas in paragraph (e)(5) of 
this section. This is accomplished by multiplying the applicable Federal 
tax rate for Year 1 by the applicable State tax rate. For example, if 
the Federal tax rate is 33 percent for Year 1 and the State tax rate is 
25 percent of the Federal income tax liability, the State tax rate 
stated as a percent of taxable income would be 8.25 percent. The State 
tax rate thus determined for Year 1 will be used in determining the CMTR 
for both Year 1 and Year 2.
    (iv) An employee may incur a State income tax liability on moving 
expense reimbursements in more than one State at the same or different 
marginal tax rates (i.e., double taxation). For example, an employee may 
incur taxes on moving expense reimbursements in one State because of 
residency in that State, and in another State because that particular 
State taxes income earned within its jurisdiction irrespective of 
whether the employee is a resident. In such cases, a single State 
marginal tax rate must be determined for use in the CMTR formulas in 
paragraph (e)(5) of this section. The general rules in paragraph 
(e)(2)(iv) (A) through (C) of this section apply in determining the 
applicable single State marginal tax rate in such cases.
    (A) If two or more States impose an income tax on an employee's 
moving expense reimbursement, but no two States tax the same portion of 
the reimbursement, then the reimbursement is not subject to double 
taxation. In this situation, the average of the applicable State 
marginal tax rates, as determined under paragraphs (e)(2) (i) through 
(iii) of this section, shall be treated as being imposed on the entire

[[Page 200]]

reimbursement, and shall be used in the CMTR formula.
    (B) If two or more States impose an income tax on the moving expense 
reimbursement, and more than one State taxes the same portion of the 
reimbursement, but those States allow an adjustment or credit for income 
taxes paid to the other State(s), then the reimbursement is not subject 
to double taxation. In this situation, the highest of the applicable 
State marginal tax rates, as determined under paragraphs (e)(2) (i) 
through (iii) of this section, shall be used in the CMTR formula.
    (C) If two or more States impose an income tax on the moving expense 
reimbursement, and more than one State taxes the same portion of the 
reimbursement without allowing an adjustment or credit for income taxes 
paid to the other, then the reimbursement is subject to double taxation. 
In this situation, the sum of the applicable State marginal tax rates, 
as determined under paragraphs (e)(2) (i) through (iii) of this section, 
shall be used in the CMTR formula.
    (3) Local marginal tax rate. Because of the impracticality of 
establishing a single marginal tax rate table for local income taxes 
that could be applied uniformly on a nationwide basis, appropriate local 
marginal tax rates shall be determined as provided in paragraphs 
(e)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section.
    (i) If the employee incurs an additional local income tax (see 
definition Sec. 302-17.5(b)) liability as a result of moving expense 
reimbursements, he/she shall certify to such fact when claiming the RIT 
allowance (see certification statement in Sec. 302-17.10) by specifying 
the name of the locality imposing the income tax and the applicable 
marginal tax rate determined from the actual marginal tax rate table or 
schedule prescribed by the taxing locality. The marginal tax rate shall 
be the one applicable to the taxable income portion of the amount of 
earned income determined under paragraph (d) of this section for the 
employee (and spouse, if filing jointly). The same tax rate shall be 
used in calculating the CMTR for both Year 1 and Year 2. The employing 
agency shall establish procedures to determine whether the employee-
certified local marginal tax rate is appropriate for the employee's 
income level and filing status and approve its use in the CMTR formulas. 
(See also Sec. 302-17.10(b)(2).)
    (ii) If the local marginal tax rate is stated as a percentage of 
Federal or State income tax liability, such rate must be converted to a 
percent of taxable income for use in the CMTR formulas. This is 
accomplished by multiplying the applicable Federal or State tax rate for 
Year 1 as determined in paragraph (e) (1) or (2) of this section by the 
applicable local tax rate. For example, if the State tax rate for Year 1 
is 6 percent and the local tax rate is 50 percent of State income tax 
liability, the local tax rate stated as a percentage of taxable income 
would be 3 percent. The local tax rate thus determined for Year 1 will 
be used in determining the CMTR for both Year 1 and Year 2.
    (iii) The situations described in paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this 
section with respect to State income taxes may also be encountered with 
local income taxes. If such situations do occur, the rules prescribed 
for determining the single State marginal tax rate shall also be applied 
to determine the single local marginal tax rate for use in the CMTR 
formulas.
    (4) Marginal tax rates for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. possessions--
(i) The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. A Federal employee who is relocated 
to or from a point, or between points, in the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico may be subject to income tax on the employee's salary (including 
moving expense reimbursements) by both the U.S. Government and the 
government of Puerto Rico. However, under the current law of Puerto 
Rico, such employee receives a credit on his/her Puerto Rico income tax 
for the amount of taxes paid to the United States. The rules in 
paragraphs (e)(4)(i)(A) through (C) apply in determining the marginal 
tax rate applicable for transfers to, from, or between points in Puerto 
Rico.
    (A) The applicable Puerto Rico marginal tax rate shall be determined 
by using the income level determined in paragraph (d) of this section 
for Federal taxes and the employee's filing

[[Page 201]]

status. The Puerto Rico marginal tax rate for Year 1 will be used in 
computing the CMTR for both Year 1 and Year 2. The Puerto Rico tax 
tables are contained in appendix D of this part.
    (B) If the applicable Puerto Rico marginal tax rate is higher than 
the applicable Federal marginal tax rate, then the total amount of taxes 
paid by the employee to both jurisdictions is equal to the employee's 
total income tax liability to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico before any 
credit is given for taxes paid to the United States. The Federal 
marginal tax rate, therefore, is of no consequence and will be 
disregarded. In such cases, the formula in paragraph (e)(5)(iii) of this 
section will be used to compute the CMTR. The CMTR formula shall include 
only the Puerto Rico marginal tax rate, the State marginal tax rate as 
determined under paragraph (e)(2) of this section (when applicable), and 
the local marginal tax rate as determined under paragraph (e)(3) of this 
section. For purposes of applying the Puerto Rico CMTR formula in 
paragraph (e)(5)(iii) of this section, the State marginal tax rate will 
be applicable if both Puerto Rico and one or more of the States impose 
an income tax on the moving expense reimbursement, and more than one of 
these entities taxes the same portion of the reimbursement without 
allowing an adjustment or credit for income taxes paid to the other. In 
this situation, the S component of the CMTR formula will be the 
applicable State marginal tax rate as determined under paragraph (e)(2) 
of this section.
    (C) If the applicable Puerto Rico marginal tax rate is equal to or 
lower than the applicable Federal marginal tax rate, then the total 
amount of taxes paid by the employee to both jurisdictions is equal to 
the employee's total Federal income tax liability. The Puerto Rico 
marginal tax rate, therefore, is of no consequence in such cases and 
will be disregarded. The CMTR will be computed using the formula in 
paragraphs (e)(5) (i) and (ii) of this section. This formula will 
include the Federal marginal tax rate as determined under paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section, the State marginal tax rate as determined under 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section (when applicable), and the local 
marginal tax rate as determined under paragraph (e)(3) of this section. 
The State marginal tax rate will be applicable if one or more States 
impose tax on the moving expense reimbursement.
    (ii) The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. 
possessions. A Federal employee who is relocated to or from a point, or 
between points, in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or 
the U.S. possessions (Guam, American Samoa, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) 
is subject to both Federal income tax and income tax assessed by the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or the U.S. possession, as 
applicable. However, the income tax system and rates for the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and for the U.S. 
possessions are identical to the U.S. Federal income tax system and 
rates. This constitutes a ``mirror tax'' system. A tax credit or 
exclusion is provided by one of the taxing jurisdictions (either the 
U.S., the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the U.S. 
possession, as appropriate) to prevent double taxation. The marginal tax 
rate for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or the U.S. 
possession, therefore, is of no consequence since it is identical to the 
Federal marginal income tax rate and is completely offset by a 
corresponding credit or exclusion. Thus, the Commonwealth's or the 
possession's tax rate will not be factored into the CMTR formula. The 
CMTR will be computed as provided in paragraphs (e)(5) (i) and (ii) 
based solely on the Federal marginal tax rate; when applicable, the 
State(s) marginal tax rate; and the local marginal tax rate.
    (5) Calculation of the CMTR's. As stated above, the gross-up formula 
for calculating the RIT allowance requires the use of two CMTR's. 
However, the required CMTR's cannot be calculated by merely adding the 
Federal, State, and local marginal tax rates together because of the 
deductibility of State and local income taxes from income for Federal 
income tax purposes. The State tax tables prescribed in appendix B of 
this part are designed to use the same income amount as that determined 
for the Federal taxes, which reflects, among other things, State and

[[Page 202]]

local tax deductions. The formulas prescribed below for calculating the 
CMTR's are designed to adjust the State and local tax rates to 
compensate for their deductibility from income for Federal tax purposes.
    (i) Calculation of the CMTR for Year 1. The following formula shall 
be used to calculate the CMTR for Year 1.

CMTR Formula: X = F + (1-F)S + (1-F)L

Where:

X = CMTR for Year 1
F = Federal tax rate for Year 1
S = State tax rate for Year 1
L = local tax rate for Year 1

    (A) Federal, State, and local taxes incurred. If the employee incurs 
Federal, State, and local income taxes on moving expense reimbursements, 
the CMTR formula may be solved as follows:

Example:
If:

F = 33 percent of income
S = 6 percent of income
L = 3 percent of income

Then:

X = .33 + (1.00-.33).06 + (1.00-.33).03
X = .3903

    (B) Federal and State income taxes only. If the employee incurs tax 
liability on moving expense reimbursements for Federal and State income 
taxes but none for local income tax, the value of ``L'' is zero and the 
CMTR formula may be solved as follows:

Example:
If:

F = 33 percent of income
S = 6 percent of income
L = Zero

Then:

X = .33 + (1.00-.33).06
X = .3702

    (C) Federal and local income taxes only. If the employee incurs a 
tax liability on moving expense reimbursements for Federal and local 
income taxes but none for State income tax, the value of ``S'' is zero 
and the CMTR formula may be solved as follows:

Example:
If:

F = 33 percent of income
S = Zero
L = 3 percent of income

Then:

X = .33 + (1.00-.33).03
X = .3501

    (ii) Calculation of the CMTR for Year 2. The calculation of the CMTR 
for Year 2 is the same as described for Year 1, except that the Federal 
tax rate for Year 2 is used in place of the Federal tax rate for Year 1. 
State and local tax rates remain the same as for Year 1. The following 
formula shall be used to determine the CMTR for Year 2:

CMTR Formula: W = F + (1-F)S + (1-F)L

Where:

W = CMTR for Year 2
F = Federal tax rate for Year 2
S = State tax rate for Year 1
L = local tax rate for Year 1

    (iii) Calculation of CMTR's for Puerto Rico. The following formula 
shall be used to calculate the CMTR for transfers to, from, or between 
points in Puerto Rico. (This formula is different from the formulas 
provided in paragraphs (e)(5) (i) and (ii) of this section since the 
Federal marginal tax rate is disregarded.)

CMTR Formula: X = P + S + L

Where:

X = CMTR for Year 1 and Year 2
P = Puerto Rico tax rate for Year 1
S = State tax rate for Year 1, when applicable (See Sec. 302-
17.8(e)(4)(i)(B).)
L = Local tax rate for Year 1

    (f) Determination of the RIT allowance. The RIT allowance to cover 
the tax liability on additional income resulting from the covered 
taxable reimbursements received in Year 1 is calculated in Year 2 as 
provided below:
    (1) The RIT allowance is calculated by substituting the amount of 
covered taxable reimbursements for Year 1, the CMTR's for Year 1 and 
Year 2, and the total amount of the WTA's paid in Year 1 into the gross-
up formula as follows:
Formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR20NO01.002

Where:

Z = RIT allowance payable in Year 2
X = CMTR for Year 1

[[Page 203]]

W = CMTR for Year 2
R = covered taxable reimbursements
Y = total WTA's paid in Year 1

Example:
If:

X = .3903
W = .3448
R = $21,800
Y = $5,450

Then:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TN27FE02.000

Z = .5957($21,800)-.9306($5,450)
Z = $12,986.26-$5,071.77
Z = $7,914.49''

    (2) There may be instances when a WTA was not paid in Year 1 at the 
time moving expense reimbursements were made. In cases where there is no 
WTA to be deducted, the value of ``Y'' is zero and the formula stated in 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section, for calculating the amount of the RIT 
allowance (Z) due the employee in Year 2 may be solved as shown in the 
following example:
Example:
If:
X = .3903
W = .3448
R = $21,800
Y = Zero

Then:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR20NO01.004

Z = .5957 ($21,800)
Z = $12,986.26

    (3) Certain States do not allow the deduction of all or part of the 
covered moving expenses that are deductible for Federal income tax 
purposes. The State gross-up to cover the additional State income tax 
liability resulting from the covered moving expense reimbursements 
received in Year 1 that are deductible for Federal income tax purposes 
but not for State income tax purposes is calculated in Year 2 as 
follows:
    (i) The State gross-up is calculated by substituting the amount of 
covered moving expense reimbursements that are deductible for Federal 
income tax purposes but not for State income tax purposes, the Federal 
tax rate for Year 1, the State tax rate for Year 1, and the combined 
marginal tax rate for Year 2 into the State gross-up formula as follows:

Formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR20NO01.005

Where:

A = State gross-up
F = Federal tax rate for Year 1
S = State tax rate for Year 1
W = CMTR for Year 2
N = covered moving expense reimbursements that are deductible for 
Federal income tax purposes but not for State income tax purposes

Example:
If:

F = .33
S = .06
W = .3448
N = $9,250

Then:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR20NO01.006

A = .0614 ($9,250)
A = $567.95

    (ii) Add the State gross-up to the RIT allowance as calculated using 
the formula in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. The result is the RIT 
allowance adjusted for those States that do not allow moving expense 
deductions. Example:

RIT allowance payable in Year..............................    $7,914.49
Plus adjustment factor.....................................      +567.95
                                                            ------------
  Total....................................................    $8,482.44
 

    (4) If the amount of the RIT allowance is greater than zero, it is 
payable to the employee on the travel voucher as a relocation or moving 
expense allowance. The RIT allowance amount is included in the 
employee's gross income for Year 2 and, therefore, subject to 
appropriate withholding taxes. (See net payment to employee in paragraph

[[Page 204]]

(g) of this section.) The RIT allowance amount will be reported on IRS 
Form W-2 for Year 2 (including applicable income tax withholding 
amounts) and on IRS Form 4782 for the employee's information.
    (5) If the calculation of the RIT allowance results in a negative 
amount, the employee is obligated to repay this amount as a debt due the 
Government. (See Secs. 302-17.7(e)(2) and 302-17.9(b).)
    (6) Any changes to the employee's income level or filing status for 
Year 1 that would affect the marginal tax rates (Federal, State, or 
local) used in calculating the RIT allowance must be reported to the 
agency by the employee as provided in Sec. 302-17.9(b)(2). (See also 
Sec. 302-17.10 for certified statement regarding these changes.)
    (g) Determination of the net payment due employee in Year 2. Since 
the amount of the RIT allowance is income to the employee in Year 2, it 
is subject to the same tax withholding requirements as all other moving 
expense reimbursements. Agencies should determine the appropriate 
amounts for withholding taxes under their internal tax withholding 
procedures. The amount of withholding taxes is deducted from the RIT 
allowance to arrive at the net payment to the employee.

<R05>
Sec. 302-17.9  Responsibilities.

    (a) Agency. Finance offices will calculate the amount of the gross-
up for the WTA in Year 1 in accordance with procedures outlined herein 
and credit this amount to the employee at the time of reimbursement as 
provided in Sec. 302-17.7(e). The WTA will be reflected on the 
employee's Form W-2 for Year 1. The RIT allowance may be calculated in 
Year 2 either by the employee or by the agency finance office based on 
information provided by the employee on the voucher, as directed by the 
agency's implementing policies and procedures. In addition, agencies 
shall prescribe appropriate and necessary implementing procedures as 
provided elsewhere in this part.
    (b) Employee. (1) The employee is required to submit a claim for the 
RIT allowance and to file the tax information for Year 1 specified in 
Sec. 302-17.10 with his/her agency in Year 2, regardless of whether any 
additional reimbursement for the RIT allowance is owed the employee. 
(See Sec. 302-17.7(e) for employee agreement.)
    (2) If any action occurs (i.e., amended tax return, tax audit, etc.) 
that would change the information provided in Year 2 by the employee to 
his/her agency for use in calculating the RIT allowance due the employee 
for Year 1 taxes, this information must be provided by the employee to 
his/her agency under procedures prescribed by the agency. (See Sec. 302-
17.10.)
    (3) If the calculation of the RIT allowance results in a negative 
amount, the employee is obligated to repay this amount as a debt due the 
Government. (See Secs. 302-17.7(e)(2) and 302-17.8(f)(5).)


<R05>
Sec. 302-17.10  Claims for payment and supporting documentation and verification.

    (a) Claims forms. Claims for payment of the RIT allowance shall be 
submitted by the employee in Year 2 on SF 1012 (Travel Voucher) or other 
authorized travel voucher form. When claiming payment for the RIT 
allowance, the employee shall furnish and certify to certain tax 
information that has been or will be shown on his/her actually prepared 
tax returns. The spouse must also sign statement if joint filing status 
is claimed and spouse's income is included on statement. This 
information shall be contained in a certified statement on, or attached 
to, the SF 1012 reading essentially as follows:

                           Certified Statement

    I certify that the following information, which is to be used in 
calculating the RIT allowance to which I am entitled, has been (or will 
be) shown on the income tax returns filed (or to be filed) by me (or by 
my spouse and me) with the applicable Federal, State, and local (specify 
which) tax authorities for the 19----tax year.

--Filing status: ------------ (Specify one of the filing status items 
that was (or will be) claimed on IRS Form 1040.)
--Marginal tax rates from appendices A, B, and C of 41 CFR part 302-17

    The above information is true and accurate to the best of my 
knowledge. I (we) agree to notify the appropriate agency official of any 
changes to the above (i.e., from amended tax returns, tax audit, etc.) 
so that appropriate adjustments to the RIT allowance can be made. The 
required supporting documents are attached. Additional documentation 
will be furnished if requested.
    I (we) further agree that if the 12-month service agreement required 
by 41 CFR 302-2.13 is violated, the total amount of the RIT allowance 
will become a debt due the United States Government and will be repaid 
according to agency procedures.

    \1\ If a joint filing status is claimed and spouse's income is 
included, the spouse must sign the statement. If the spouse does not 
sign the document, earned income will include only the employee's earned 
income as provided in 41 CFR 302-17.8(d). This condition will not apply 
if an employee is allowed, under IRS rules, to file a joint return as a 
surviving spouse.

    (b) Supporting documentation/verification. The claim for the RIT 
allowance shall be supported by documentation attached to the voucher 
and by verification of State and local tax obligations as provided 
below:
    (1) Copies of the appropriate IRS Forms W-2 and, if applicable, the 
completed IRS Schedule SE (Form 1040) shall be attached to the voucher 
to substantiate the income amounts shown in the certified statement. 
Employee (and spouse, if filing jointly) must agree to provide 
additional documentation to verify income amounts, filing status, and 
State and local income tax obligations if requested by the agency.
    (2) In order to determine or verify whether a particular State or 
local tax authority imposes a tax on moving expense reimbursements, it 
is incumbent upon the appropriate agency officials to become familiar 
with the State and local tax laws that affect their transferring 
employees. In cases where the taxability of moving expense 
reimbursements is not clear, an agency may pay a RIT allowance which 
reflects only those State and local tax obligations that are clearly 
imposed under State and local tax law. Once the questionable State or 
local tax obligations are resolved, agencies may recompute the RIT 
allowance and make appropriate payment adjustments.
    (c) Fraudulent claims. A claim against the United States is 
forfeited if the claimant defrauds or attempts to defraud the Government 
in connection therewith (28 U.S.C. 2514). In addition, there are two 
criminal provisions under which severe penalties may be imposed on an 
employee who knowingly presents a false, fictitious, or fraudulent claim 
against the United States (18 U.S.C. 287 and 1001). The employee's claim 
for payment of the RIT allowance shall accurately reflect the facts 
involved in every instance so that any violation of these provisions 
will be avoided.


<R05>
Sec. 302-17.11  Violation of service agreement.

    In the event the employee violates the terms of the service 
agreement required under Sec. 302-2.13, no part of the RIT allowance or 
the WTA will be paid, and any amounts paid prior to such violation shall 
be a debt due the United States until they are repaid by the employee.


<R05>
Sec. 302-17.12  Advance of funds.

    No advance of funds is authorized in connection with the allowance 
provided in this part.

    Under the authority of this part and 31 U.S.C. 1353, you may accept

agency, but not on behalf of yourself, when specifically authorized to 
do so by your agency and only for official travel to a meeting. Except 
as provided in Sec. 304-3.13 of this subchapter, your agency must 
approve acceptance of such payments in advance of your travel.


<R03>
PART 304-2--DEFINITIONS--Table of Contents

<R05>


    Authority: 5 U.S.C. 5707; 31 U.S.C. 1353.


<R05>
Sec. 304-2.1  What definitions apply to this chapter?

    The following definitions apply to this chapter:
    Employee means an appointed officer or employee of an executive 
agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105, including a special Government 
employee as defined in 18 U.S.C. 202, or an expert or consultant 
appointed under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 3109.
    Meeting(s) or similar functions (meeting) means a conference, 
seminar, speaking engagement, symposium, training course, or similar 
event that takes place away from the employee's official station. 
``Meeting'' as defined in this chapter does not include a meeting or 
other event required to carry out an agency's statutory or regulatory 
functions (i.e., a function that is essential to an agency's mission) 
such as investigations, inspections, audits, site visits, negotiations 
or litigation. ``Meeting'' also does not include promotional vendor 
training or other meetings held for the primary purpose of marketing the 
non-Federal sources products or services, or long term TDY or training 
travel. A meeting need not be widely attended for purposes of this 
definition and includes but is not limited to the following:
    (1) An event where the employee will participate as a speaker or 
panel participant focusing on his/her official duties or on the 
policies, programs or operations of the agency.
    (2) A conference, convention, seminar, symposium or similar event 
where the primary purpose is to receive training other than promotional 
vendor training, or to present or exchange substantive information of 
mutual interest to a number of parties.
    (3) An event where the employee will receive an award or honorary 
degree, which is in recognition of meritorious public service that is 
related to the employee's official duties, and which may be accepted by 
the employee consistent with the applicable standards of conduct 
regulations.
    Non-Federal source means any person or entity other than the 
Government of the United States. The term includes any individual, 
private or commercial entity, nonprofit organization or association, 
international or multinational organization (irrespective of whether an 
agency holds membership in the organization or association), or foreign, 
State or local government (including the government of the District of 
Columbia).
    Payment means a monetary payment from a non-Federal source to a 
Federal agency for travel, subsistence, related expenses by check or 
other monetary

[[Page 218]]

instrument payable to the Federal agency (i.e., electronic fund transfer 
(EFT), money order, charge card, etc.) or payment in kind.
    Payment in kind means transportation, food, lodging, or other 
travel-related services provided by a non-Federal source instead of 
monetary payments to the Federal agency for these services. Payment in 
kind also includes waiver of any fees that a non-Federal source normally 
collects from meeting attendees (e.g., registration fees).
    Travel, subsistence, and related expenses (travel expenses) means 
the same types of expenses payable under chapter 301 of this title, the 
Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM), and the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR) for 
transportation, food, lodging or other travel-related services for 
official travel (e.g., baggage expenses, services of guides, drivers, 
interpreters, communication services, hire of conference rooms, lodging 
taxes, laundry/dry cleaning, taxi fares, etc). These expenses also 
include conference or training fees (in whole or in part), as well as 
benefits that cannot be paid under the applicable travel regulations, 
but which are incident to the meeting, provided in kind, and made 
available by the meeting sponsor(s) to all attendees. For example, this 
definition as applied to this chapter would allow an employee or spouse 
to attend a sporting event hosted by the sponsor(s) in connection with 
the meeting that is available to all participants. However, it would not 
allow the employee to accept tickets to a professional sporting event, 
concert or similar event, for use at a later date even if such tickets 
were given to all other participants. The Foreign Affairs Manual is 
obtainable from: Bureau of Administration, A/IM/CST/MMS/DIR, Room 264, 
U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC 20520; (202) 647-3602. The

Sec. 304-3.12  Must I receive advance approval from my agency before I 
perform travel paid by a non-Federal source to attend a meeting?

    Yes, you must receive advance approval from your agency before 
performing travel paid by a non-Federal source to attend a meeting 
except as provided in Sec. 304-3.13.


<R05>

non-Federal source offers to pay for one or more of my travel expenses 
without my or my 
          agency's prior knowledge?

    (a) If your agency has already authorized acceptance of payment for 
some of your travel expenses for that meeting from a non-Federal source, 
then you may accept on behalf of your agency, payment for any of your 
additional travel expenses from the same non-Federal source as long as--
    (1) The expenses paid or provided in kind are comparable in value to 
those offered to or purchased by other similarly situated meeting 
attendees; and
    (2) Your agency did not decline to accept payment for those 
particular expenses in advance of your travel.
    (b) If your agency did not authorize acceptance of any payment from 
a non-Federal source prior to your travel, then--
    (1) You may accept, on behalf of your agency, payment from a non-
Federal source as authorized in this section--
    (i) Only the types of travel expenses that are authorized by your 
travel authorization (i.e., meals, lodging, transportation, but not 
recreation or other personal expenses); and
    (ii) Only travel expenses that are within the maximum allowances 
stated on your travel authorization (e.g., if your travel authorization 
states that you are authorized to incur lodging expenses up to $100 per 
night, you may

[[Page 221]]

not accept payment from the non-Federal source for a $200 per night 
hotel room);
    (2) You must request your agency's authorization for acceptance from 
the non-Federal source within 7 working days after your trip ends; and
    (3) If your agency does not authorize acceptance from the non-
Federal source, your agency must either--
    (i) Reimburse the non-Federal source for the reasonable 
approximation of the market value of the benefit provided, not to exceed 
the maximum allowance stated on your travel authorization; or
    (ii) Require you to reimburse the non-Federal source that amount and 
allow you to claim that amount on your travel claim for the trip.
    (c) If you accept payment from a non-Federal source for travel 
expenses in violation of paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of this section, 
you may be subject to the penalties specified in Sec. 304-3.18.


<R05>
Sec. 304-3.14  May a non-Federal source pay for my spouse to accompany me 
to a meeting?

    Yes, a non-Federal source may pay for your spouse to accompany you 
when it is in the interest of and authorized in advance by your agency. 
All limitations and requirements of this part apply to the acceptance of 
payment from a non-Federal source for travel expenses and/or agency 
reimbursement of travel expenses for your accompanying spouse. Your 
agency may determine that your spouse's presence at an event is in the 
interest of the agency if your spouse will--
    (a) Support the mission of your agency or substantially assist you 
in carrying out your official duties;
    (b) Attend a ceremony at which you will receive an award or honorary 
degree; or
    (c) Participate in substantive programs related to the agency's 
programs or operations.


<R05>

I receive on its behalf?

    Yes. Your agency must submit to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics 
(OGE) a semiannual report (SF 326) of all payments it accepts under this 
part. You must be prepared to give your agency the information it needs 
in order to submit its report.


<R04>
                     Subpart B--Reimbursement Claims


<R05>

Sec. 304-3.16  What must I submit to my agency for reimbursement when a 
non-Federal source pays all or part of my travel expenses to attend a 
meeting?

    You must submit a travel claim listing all allowable travel expenses 
that you incurred which were not paid in kind by a non-Federal source. 
Do not claim travel expenses that were furnished in kind by a non-
Federal source. Your reimbursement is limited to the types of expenses 
authorized in Chapter 301 of this title or analogous provisions of the 
Joint Travel Regulations or Foreign Affairs Manual. Reimbursement from 
your agency for expenses will not in any case exceed the amount of the 
expenses you incur. Such reimbursement will also adhere to established 
regulatory limitations except where your agency accepts payments under 
Secs. 304-5.4, 304-5.5 or 304-5.6 of this chapter.


<R04>
                           Subpart C--Reports


<R05>

Sec. 304-3.17  If I am required to file a confidential or public financial 
disclosure report, must I report travel payments I receive from a non-Federal 
source 
          on that report?

    Generally, no. As long as payments you receive from a non-Federal 
source are made to or on behalf of your agency, you are not required to 
report them as gifts on any confidential or public disclosure report you 
are personally required to file pursuant to law or Office of Government 
Ethics (OGE) regulations (5 CFR part 2634). However, you may be required 
to report any such payments that you and/or your accompanying spouse 
receive on your own behalf, rather than on the agency's behalf, pursuant 
to other reporting requirements (e.g., those required by the Ethics in 
Government Act of 1978).
    Note: The confidential financial disclosure report is OGE Form 450 
and the public financial disclosure report is SF 278.

source that is in violation of this part?

    If you accept payment from a non-Federal source in violation of this 
part--
    (a) You may be required, in addition to any other penalty provided 
by law and applicable regulations, to pay the general fund of the 
Treasury, an amount equal to any payment you accepted; and
    (b) In the case of reimbursement under paragraph (a) of this 
section, you will not be entitled to any reimbursement from the 
Government for your travel expenses that the payment was intended to 
cover.


<R04>
                Subpart E--Relation to Other Authorities


<R05>
Sec. 304-3.19  Are there other situations when I may accept payment from a 
non-Federal source for my travel expenses?

    Yes, you may also accept payment of travel expenses from a non-
Federal source under the following authorities, in addition to this 
part:

304-4.1  To whom do the pronouns ``we'', ``you'', and their variants 
          refer throughout this part?
304-4.2  What is the purpose of this part?
304-4.3  Under what other authority may we accept payment for travel 
          expenses from a non-Federal source?

    Authority: 5 U.S.C. 5707; 31 U.S.C. 1353.

    Source: FTR Amdt. 2003-02, 68 FR 12604, Mar. 17, 2003, unless 
otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 304-4.1  To whom do the pronouns ``we'', ``you'', and their variants 
refer throughout this part?

    Use of pronouns ``we'', ``you'', and their variants throughout this 
part refers to the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 304-4.2  What is the purpose of this part?

    The purpose of this part is to establish Governmentwide policy and 
guidance for acceptance by a Federal agency of payment for travel 
expenses from a non-Federal source for employees to attend meetings 
under 31 U.S.C. 1353. It prescribes how such payments may be accepted.


<R05>
Sec. 304-4.3  Under what other authority may we accept payment for travel 
expenses from a non-Federal source?

    You may accept payment for travel expenses to events other than 
meetings from a non-Federal source pursuant to an agency gift statute or 
similar statutory authority. However, this part 304 is the only 
authority you may use to accept (or authorize your employee to accept on 
your behalf) payment for travel expenses from a non-Federal source to 
attend a meeting. For example, you could not pay the travel expenses for 
an employee to attend a meeting and then authorize the employee to use 
the widely attended gathering exception in 5 CFR 2635.204(g)(2) to 
accept free attendance at that same meeting. You would only be able to 
accept payment for the employee's attendance at that meeting under this 
part 304.
    Note: Employees may also be able to accept payment for travel 
expenses from non-Federal sources in their individual capacities under 
the authorities referenced in Sec. 304-3.19.

<R05>

Sec. 304-5.1  When may we accept payment from a non-Federal source for 
travel to a meeting or authorize an employee to accept payment on our 
behalf?

    You may accept payment from a non-Federal source or authorize an 
employee and/or the employee's spouse to accept payment on your behalf 
only when-
    (a) You have issued the employee (and/or the employee's spouse, when 
applicable) a travel authorization before the travel begins;

[[Page 224]]

    (b) You have determined that the travel is in the interest of the 
Government;
    (c) The travel relates to the employee's official duties; and
    (d) The non-Federal source is not disqualified due to a conflict of 
interest under Sec. 304-5.3.


<R05>
Sec. 304-5.2  Who must approve acceptance of payment from a non-Federal 
source for travel expenses to a meeting?

    An official at the highest practical administrative level who can 
evaluate the requirements in Sec. 304-5.3, must approve acceptance of

<R05>

Sec. 304-5.3  What does our approving official need to consider before 
authorizing acceptance of payment from a non-Federal source for travel 
expenses for a 
          meeting?

    (a) The approving official must not authorize acceptance of the 
payment if he/she determines that acceptance of the payment under the 
circumstances would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of all the 
facts relevant to a particular case to question the integrity of agency 
programs or operations. The approving official must be guided by all 
relevant considerations, including but not limited to the--
    (1) Identity of the non-Federal source;
    (2) Purpose of the meeting;
    (3) Identity of other expected participants;
    (4) Nature and sensitivity of any matter pending at the agency which 
may affect the interest of the non-Federal source;
    (5) Significance of the employee's role in any such matter; and
    (6) Monetary value and character of the travel benefits offered by 
the non-Federal source.
    (b) The agency official may find that, while acceptance from the 
non-Federal source is permissible, it is in the interest of the agency 
to qualify acceptance of the offered payment by, for example, 
authorizing attendance at only a portion of the event or limiting the 
type or character of benefits that may be accepted.


<R05>

Sec. 304-5.4  May we authorize an employee to exceed the maximum subsistence 
allowances (per diem, actual expense, or conference lodging) prescribed in 
          applicable travel regulations where we have authorized 
          acceptance of payment from a non-Federal source for such 
          allowances?

    (a) Generally, yes. Subsistence allowances are usually limited to 
the maximum subsistence allowances (per diem, actual expense, or 
conference lodging) prescribed in chapter 301 of this title for travel 
in CONUS, by the Secretary of Defense for travel in non-foreign areas, 
and by the Secretary of State for travel in foreign areas. However, the 
maximum subsistence allowances established by this title and by the 
Secretary of Defense may be exceeded as long as--
    (1) The non-Federal source pays the full amount of the subsistence 
expenses, at issue; and
    (2) The subsistence expense paid by the non-Federal source is 
comparable in value to that offered to or purchased by meeting 
attendees.
    (b) The maximum subsistence allowances prescribed by the Secretary 
of State for travel to foreign areas may not be exceeded.

Sec. 304-5.5  May we authorize an employee to travel by premium other than 
first-class common carrier accommodations if we accept payment in full from a non-
          Federal source for such transportation expenses?

first-class common carrier accommodations as long as the--
    (a) Non-Federal source makes full payment for such transportation 
services in advance of travel; and
    (b) Transportation accommodations furnished are comparable in value 
to those offered to, or purchased by, other similarly situated meeting 
attendees.

first-

[[Page 225]]

<R05>

Sec. 304-6.1  May we accept a monetary payment in the form of cash from a 
non-Federal source?

<R05>
Sec. 304-6.2  What should we do if a non-Federal source does not pay the 
full cost for expenses that an employee will incur during travel?

    If you determine in advance of the employee's travel that payment 
from a non-Federal source will cover some but not all of the employee's 
allowable travel and subsistence expenses you should state on the 
employee's travel authorization that the employee will be reimbursed the 
difference between the full allowances and the payment from the non-
Federal source. See chapter 301 of this Title, 6 Foreign Affairs Manual,

Semiannual Report of Payments Accepted

[[Page 226]]

From a Non-Federal Source (fully completed) to report payments received 
from non-Federal sources. This applies to all payments that are more 
than $250 per event for an employee and accompanying spouse. For 
purposes of the $250 threshold, payments for an employee and 
accompanying spouse shall be aggregated. If you wish to use a form other 
than SF 326 to report such payments, you may seek permission to do so by 
contacting the Office of Government Ethics at United States Office of 
Government Ethics, 1201 New York Avenue, NW., Suite 500, Washington, DC 
20005-3917.

                          Subpart C--Valuation


<R05>
Sec. 304-6.6  How do we determine the value of payments in kind that are 
to be reported on Standard Form (SF) 326?

    The following should be used in the determination of the value of 
payments in kind for reporting on SF 326:
    (a) For conference, training, or similar fees waived or paid by a 
non-Federal source, you must report the amount charged other 
participants.
    (b) For transportation or lodging, you must report the cost that the 
non-Federal source paid or usually would have been charged for such 
event.
    (c) For meals or other benefits that are not provided as part of the 
transportation, lodging, or a conference, training or similar fee, you 
must report the cost to the non-Federal source or provide a reasonable 
approximation of the market value of the benefit.
    (d) For chartered, corporate or other private aircraft--
    (1) When common carrier is available, you must report the first-
class rate that would have been charged by a commercial air carrier at 
the time the event took place.
    (2) When a common carrier is not available, you must report the cost 
of chartering a similar aircraft using a commercially available service.
    (e) Lodging where no commercial rate is available: You must report 
the maximum lodging rate established by GSA for CONUS, Department of 
Defense for non-foreign areas and the Secretary of State for foreign 
areas. These rates are available on the Internet at the GSA Web site 
http://www.gsa.gov/perdiem, with links to the non-foreign and foreign 
area rates.


<R05>
Sec. 304-6.7  Must we report on the Standard Form (SF) 326 any information 
that is protected from disclosure by statute?

    No. Information that is protected by statute from disclosure to the 
public should not be reported on the SF 326. However, if you omit 
otherwise reportable information from the SF 326 because the information 
may not be disclosed, you must notify OGE unless otherwise prohibited by 
law and, if requested by the Director of OGE, make the information 
available for inspection by an OGE employee with the requisite 
clearance.


<R05>
Sec. 304-6.8  Will the reports be made available for public inspection?

    Yes, OGE must make any report filed by an agency under this part 
(that is not protected from disclosure by statute) available for public 
inspection and copying on the later of the following two dates:
    (a) Within 30 days after the applicable due date.
    (b) Within 30 days after the date OGE actually receives the report.

[[Page 227]]


<R05>

Sec. 304-6.9  Does acceptance by OGE of the Standard Form (SF) 326 constitute 
a determination by OGE that the data submitted is adequate or a concurrence 
by OGE 
          in the agency's conflict of interest analysis?

    No. OGE is responsible for making the information provided by the 
agencies available to the public. It is each agency's responsibility to
