                     Cite this Code: CFR
                     To cite the regulations in 
                       this volume use title, 
                       part and section number. 
                       Thus, 41 CFR 102-2.5 
                       refers to title 41, part 
                       102-2, section 5.

                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2007), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vii]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of textual material 
appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

                       Subpart A_Regulation System

                                 General


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.5  What is the Federal Management Regulation (FMR)?

    The Federal Management Regulation (FMR) is the successor regulation 
to the Federal Property Management Regulations (FPMR). It contains 
updated regulatory policies originally found in the FPMR. However, it 
does not contain FPMR material that described how to do business with 
the General Services Administration (GSA). ``How to'' materials on this 
and other subjects are available in customer service guides, handbooks, 
brochures and Internet websites provided by GSA. (See Sec. 102-2.125.)


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.10  What is the FMR's purpose?

    The FMR prescribes policies concerning property management and 
related administrative activities. GSA issues the FMR to carry out the 
Administrator of General Services' functional responsibilities, as 
established by statutes, Executive orders, Presidential memoranda, 
Circulars and bulletins issued by the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB), and other policy directives.

[[Page 8]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.15  What is the authority for the FMR system?

    The Administrator of General Services prescribes and issues the FMR 
under the authority of the Federal Property and Administrative Services 
Act of 1949, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 486(c), as well as other applicable 
Federal laws and authorities.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.20  Which agencies are subject to the FMR?

    The FMR applies to executive agencies unless otherwise extended to 
Federal agencies in various parts of this chapter. The difference 
between the two terms is that Federal agencies include executive 
agencies plus establishments in the legislative or judicial branch of 
the Government. See paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section for the 
definitions of each term.
    (a) What is an executive agency? An executive agency is any 
executive department or independent establishment in the executive 
branch of the Government, including any wholly-owned Government 
corporation. (See 40 U.S.C. 472(a).)
    (b) What is a Federal agency? A Federal agency is any executive 
agency or any establishment in the legislative or judicial branch of the 
Government (except the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the 
Architect of the Capitol and any activities under that person's 
direction). (See 40 U.S.C. 472(b).)


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.25  When are other agencies involved in developing the FMR?

    Normally, GSA will ask agencies to collaborate in developing parts 
of the FMR.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.30  Where and in what formats is the FMR published?

    Proposed rules are published in the Federal Register. FMR bulletins 
are published in looseleaf format. FMR interim and final rules are 
published in the following formats--
    (a) Federal Register under the ``Rules and Regulations'' section.
    (b) Loose-leaf. (See Sec. 102-2.35.)
    (c) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), which is an annual 
codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal 
Register. The CFR is available on line and in a bound-volume format.
    (d) Electronically on the Internet.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.35  How is the FMR distributed?

    (a) A liaison appointed by each agency provides GSA with their 
agency's distribution requirements of the looseleaf version of the FMR. 
Agencies must submit GSA Form 2053, Agency Consolidated Requirements for 
GSA Regulations and Other External Issuances, to--General Services 
Administration, Office of Communications (X), 1800 F Street, NW, 
Washington, DC 20405.
    (b) Order Federal Register and Code of Federal Regulations copies of 
FMR material through your agency's authorizing officer.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.40  May an agency issue implementing and supplementing

regulations for the FMR?

    Yes, an agency may issue implementing regulations (see Sec. 102-
2.50) to expand upon related FMR material and supplementing regulations 
(see Sec. 102-2.55) to address subject material not covered in the FMR. 
The Office of the Federal Register assigns chapters in Title 41 of the 
Code of Federal Regulations for agency publication of implementing and 
supplementing regulations.

                                Numbering


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.45  How is the FMR numbered?

    (a) All FMR sections are designated by three numbers. The following 
example illustrates the chapter (it's always 102), part, and section 
designations:

[[Page 9]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR21JY99.001

    (b) In the looseleaf version, the month, year, and number of FMR 
amendments appear at the bottom of each page.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.50  How do I number my agency's implementing regulations?

    The first three-digit number represents the chapter number assigned 
to your agency in Title 41 of the CFR. The part and section numbers 
correspond to FMR material. For example, if your agency is assigned 
Chapter 130 in Title 41 of the CFR and you are implementing Sec. 102-
2.60 of the FMR, your implementing section would be numbered Sec. 130-
2.60.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.55  How do I number my agency's supplementing regulations?

    Since there is no corresponding FMR material, number the 
supplementing material ``601'' or higher. For example, your agency's 
supplementing regulations governing special services to states might 
start with Sec. 130-601.5.

                               Deviations


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.60  What is a deviation from the FMR?

    A deviation from the FMR is an agency action or policy that is 
inconsistent with the regulation. (The deviation policy for the FPMR is 
in 41 CFR part 101-1.)


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.65  When may agencies deviate from the FMR?

    Because, it consists primarily of set policies and mandatory 
requirements, deviation from the FMR should occur infrequently. However, 
to address unique circumstances or to test the effectiveness of 
potential policy changes, agencies may be able to deviate from the FMR 
after following the steps described in Sec. 102-2.80.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.70  What are individual and class deviations?

    An individual deviation is intended to affect only one action. A 
class deviation is intended to affect more than one action (e.g., 
multiple actions, the actions of more than one agency, or individual 
agency actions that are expected to recur).


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.75  What timeframes apply to deviations?

    Timeframes vary based on the nature of the deviation. However, 
deviations cannot be open-ended. When consulting with GSA about using an 
individual or class deviation, you must set a timeframe for the 
deviation's duration.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.80  What steps must an agency take to deviate from the FMR?

    (a) Consult informally with appropriate GSA program personnel to 
learn more about how your agency can work within the FMR's requirements 
instead of deviating from them. The consultation process may also 
highlight reasons why an agency would not be permitted to deviate from 
the FMR; e.g., statutory constraints.
    (b) Formally request a deviation, if consultations indicate that 
your agency needs one. The head of your agency or a designated official 
should write to GSA's Regulatory Secretariat to the attention of a GSA 
official in the program office that is likely to consider the deviation. 
(See the FMR bulletin that lists contacts in GSA's program offices and 
Sec. 102-2.90.) The written request must fully explain the reasons for 
the deviation, including the benefits that the agency expects to 
achieve.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.85  What are the reasons for writing to GSA about FMR 

deviations?

    The reasons for writing are to:

[[Page 10]]

    (a) Explain your agency's rationale for the deviation. Before it can 
adequately comment on a potential deviation from the FMR, GSA must know 
why it is needed. GSA will compare your need against the applicable 
policies and regulations.
    (b) Obtain clarification from GSA as to whether statutes, Executive 
orders, or other controlling policies, which may not be evident in the 
regulation, preclude deviating from the FMR for the reasons stated.
    (c) Establish a timeframe for using a deviation.
    (d) Identify potential changes to the FMR.
    (e) Identify the benefits and other results that the agency expects 
to achieve.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.90  Where should my agency send its correspondence on an 

FMR deviation?

    Send correspondence to: General Services Administration, Regulatory 
Secretariat (MVRS), Office of Governmentwide Policy, 1800 F Street, NW, 
Washington, DC 20405.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.95  What information must agencies include in their 

deviation letters to GSA?

    Agencies must include:
    (a) The title and citation of the FMR provision from which the 
agency wishes to deviate;
    (b) The name and telephone number of an agency contact who can 
discuss the reason for the deviation;
    (c) The reason for the deviation;
    (d) A statement about the expected benefits of using the deviation 
(to the extent possible, expected benefits should be stated in 
measurable terms);
    (e) A statement about possible use of the deviation in other 
agencies or Governmentwide; and
    (f) The duration of the deviation.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.100  Must agencies provide GSA with a follow-up analysis 

of their experience in deviating from the FMR?

    Yes, agencies that deviate from the FMR must also write to the 
relevant GSA program office at the Regulatory Secretariat's address (see 
Sec. 102-2.90) to describe their experiences in using a deviation.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.105  What information must agencies include in their 

follow-up analysis?

    In your follow-up analysis, provide information that may include, 
but should not be limited to, specific actions taken or not taken as a 
result of the deviation, outcomes, impacts, anticipated versus actual 
results, and the advantages and disadvantages of taking an alternative 
course of action.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.110  When must agencies provide their follow-up letters?

    (a) For an individual deviation, once the action is complete.
    (b) For a class deviation, at the end of each twelve-month period 
from the time you first took the deviation and at the end of the 
deviation period.

                         Non-Regulatory Material


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.115  What kinds of non-regulatory material does GSA

publish outside of the FMR?

    As GSA converts the FPMR to the FMR, non-regulatory materials in the 
FPMR, such as guidance, procedures, standards, and information, that 
describe how to do business with GSA, will become available in separate 
documents. These documents may include customer service guides, 
handbooks, brochures, Internet websites, and FMR bulletins. GSA will 
eliminate non-regulatory material that is no longer needed.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.120  How do I know whom to contact to discuss the regulatory

requirements of programs addressed in the FMR?

    Periodically, GSA will issue for your reference an FMR bulletin that 
lists program contacts with whom agencies can discuss regulatory 
requirements. At a minimum, the list will contain organization names and 
telephone numbers for each program addressed in the FMR.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.125  What source of information can my agency use to identify

materials that describe how to do business with GSA?

    The FMR establishes policy; it does not specify procedures for the 
acquisition of GSA services. However, as a service to users during the 
transition

[[Page 11]]

from the FPMR to the FMR and as needed thereafter, GSA will issue FMR 
bulletins to identify where to find information on how to do business 
with GSA. References include customer service guides, handbooks, 
brochures, Internet websites, etc.


<R04>
                             Subpart B_Forms


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.130  Where are FMR forms prescribed?

    In any of its parts, the FMR may prescribe forms and the 
requirements for using them.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.135  How do agencies obtain forms prescribed by the FMR?

    For copies of the forms prescribed by in the FMR, do any of the 
following:
    (a) Write to us at: General Services Administration, National Forms 
and Publications Center (7CPN), Warehouse 4, Dock No. 1, 501 West Felix 
Street, Fort Worth, TX 76115.
    (b) Send e-mail messages to: NFPC@gsa-7FDepot.
    (c) Visit our web site at: www.gsa.gov/forms/forms.htm.


<R04>
                Subpart C_Plain Language Regulatory Style


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.140  What elements of plain language appear in the FMR?

    The FMR is written in a ``plain language'' regulatory style. This 
style is easy to read and uses a question and answer format directed at 
the reader, active voice, shorter sentences, and, where appropriate, 
personal pronouns.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.145  To what do pronouns refer when used in the FMR?

    Throughout its text, the FMR may contain pronouns such as, but not 
limited to, we, you, and I. When pronouns are used, each subchapter of 
the FMR will indicate whether they refer to the reader, an agency, GSA, 
or some other entity. In general, pronouns refer to who or what must 
perform a required action.

<R04>
Subpart A_What Policies Apply to Advisory Committees Established Within 
                          the Executive Branch?


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.5  What does this subpart cover and how does it apply?

    This subpart provides the policy framework that must be used by 
agency heads in applying the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), as 
amended (or ``the Act''), 5 U.S.C., App., to advisory committees they 
establish and operate. In addition to listing key definitions underlying 
the interpretation of the Act, this subpart establishes the scope and 
applicability of the Act, and outlines specific exclusions from its 
coverage.


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.10  What is the purpose of the Federal Advisory Committee Act?

    FACA governs the establishment, operation, and termination of 
advisory committees within the executive branch of the Federal 
Government. The Act defines what constitutes a Federal advisory 
committee and provides general procedures for the executive branch to 
follow for the operation of these advisory committees. In addition, the 
Act is designed to assure that the Congress and the public are kept 
informed with respect to the number, purpose, membership, activities, 
and cost of advisory committees.


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.15  Who are the intended users of this part?

    (a) The primary users of this Federal Advisory Committee Management 
part are:
    (1) Executive branch officials and others outside Government 
currently involved with an established advisory committee;
    (2) Executive branch officials who seek to establish or utilize an 
advisory committee;
    (3) Executive branch officials and others outside Government who 
have decided to pursue, or who are already engaged in, a form of public 
involvement or consultation and want to avoid inadvertently violating 
the Act; and
    (4) Field personnel of Federal agencies who are increasingly 
involved with

[[Page 13]]

the public as part of their efforts to increase collaboration and 
improve customer service.
    (b) Other types of end-users of this part include individuals and 
organizations outside of the executive branch who seek to understand and 
interpret the Act, or are seeking additional guidance.


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.20  How does this part meet the needs of its audience?

    This Federal Advisory Committee Management part meets the general 
and specific needs of its audience by addressing the following issues 
and related topics:
    (a) Scope and applicability. This part provides guidance on the 
threshold issue of what constitutes an advisory committee and clarifies 
the limits of coverage by the Act for the benefit of the intended users 
of this part.
    (b) Policies and guidelines. This part defines the policies, 
establishes minimum requirements, and provides guidance to Federal 
officers and agencies for the establishment, operation, administration, 
and duration of advisory committees subject to the Act. This includes 
reporting requirements that keep Congress and the public informed of the 
number, purpose, membership, activities, benefits, and costs of these 
advisory committees. These requirements form the basis for implementing 
the Act at both the agency and Governmentwide levels.
    (c) Examples and principles. This part provides summary-level key 
points and principles at the end of each subpart that provide more 
clarification on the role of Federal advisory committees in the larger 
context of public involvement in Federal decisions and activities. This 
includes a discussion of the applicability of the Act to different 
decisionmaking scenarios.


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.25  What definitions apply to this part?

    The following definitions apply to this Federal Advisory Committee 
Management part:
    Act means the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended, 5 U.S.C., 
App.
    Administrator means the Administrator of General Services.
    Advisory committee subject to the Act, except as specifically 
exempted by the Act or by other statutes, or as not covered by this 
part, means any committee, board, commission, council, conference, 
panel, task force, or other similar group, which is established by 
statute, or established or utilized by the President or by an agency 
official, for the purpose of obtaining advice or recommendations for the 
President or on issues or policies within the scope of an agency 
official's responsibilities.
    Agency has the same meaning as in 5 U.S.C. 551(1).
    Committee Management Officer (``CMO''), means the individual 
designated by the agency head to implement the provisions of section 
8(b) of the Act and any delegated responsibilities of the agency head 
under the Act.
    Committee Management Secretariat (``Secretariat''), means the 
organization established pursuant to section 7(a) of the Act, which is 
responsible for all matters relating to advisory committees, and carries 
out the responsibilities of the Administrator under the Act and 
Executive Order 12024 (3 CFR, 1977 Comp., p. 158).
    Committee meeting means any gathering of advisory committee members 
(whether in person or through electronic means) held with the approval 
of an agency for the purpose of deliberating on the substantive matters 
upon which the advisory committee provides advice or recommendations.
    Committee member means an individual who serves by appointment or 
invitation on an advisory committee or subcommittee.
    Committee staff means any Federal employee, private individual, or 
other party (whether under contract or not) who is not a committee 
member, and who serves in a support capacity to an advisory committee or 
subcommittee.
    Designated Federal Officer (``DFO''), means an individual designated 
by the agency head, for each advisory committee for which the agency 
head is responsible, to implement the provisions of sections 10(e) and 
(f) of the Act and any advisory committee procedures of the agency under 
the control and supervision of the CMO.
    Discretionary advisory committee means any advisory committee that 
is

[[Page 14]]

established under the authority of an agency head or authorized by 
statute. An advisory committee referenced in general (non-specific) 
authorizing language or Congressional committee report language is 
discretionary, and its establishment or termination is within the legal 
discretion of an agency head.
    Independent Presidential advisory committee means any Presidential 
advisory committee not assigned by the Congress in law, or by President 
or the President's delegate, to an agency for administrative and other 
support.
    Non-discretionary advisory committee means any advisory committee 
either required by statute or by Presidential directive. A non-
discretionary advisory committee required by statute generally is 
identified specifically in a statute by name, purpose, or functions, and 
its establishment or termination is beyond the legal discretion of an 
agency head.
    Presidential advisory committee means any advisory committee 
authorized by the Congress or directed by the President to advise the 
President.
    Subcommittee means a group, generally not subject to the Act, that 
reports to an advisory committee and not directly to a Federal officer 
or agency, whether or not its members are drawn in whole or in part from 
the parent advisory committee.
    Utilized for the purposes of the Act, does not have its ordinary 
meaning. A committee that is not established by the Federal Government 
is utilized within the meaning of the Act when the President or a 
Federal office or agency exercises actual management or control over its 
operation.


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.30  What policies govern the use of advisory committees?

    The policies to be followed by Federal departments and agencies in 
establishing and operating advisory committees consistent with the Act 
are as follows:
    (a) Determination of need in the public interest. A discretionary 
advisory committee may be established only when it is essential to the 
conduct of agency business and when the information to be obtained is 
not already available through another advisory committee or source 
within the Federal Government. Reasons for deciding that an advisory 
committee is needed may include whether:
    (1) Advisory committee deliberations will result in the creation or 
elimination of (or change in) regulations, policies, or guidelines 
affecting agency business;
    (2) The advisory committee will make recommendations resulting in 
significant improvements in service or reductions in cost; or
    (3) The advisory committee's recommendations will provide an 
important additional perspective or viewpoint affecting agency 
operations.
    (b) Termination. An advisory committee must be terminated when:
    (1) The stated objectives of the committee have been accomplished;
    (2) The subject matter or work of the committee has become obsolete 
by the passing of time or the assumption of the committee's functions by 
another entity;
    (3) The agency determines that the cost of operation is excessive in 
relation to the benefits accruing to the Federal Government;
    (4) In the case of a discretionary advisory committee, upon the 
expiration of a period not to exceed two years, unless renewed;
    (5) In the case of a non-discretionary advisory committee required 
by Presidential directive, upon the expiration of a period not to exceed 
two years, unless renewed by authority of the President; or
    (6) In the case of a non-discretionary advisory committee required 
by statute, upon the expiration of the time explicitly specified in the 
statute, or implied by operation of the statute.
    (c) Balanced membership. An advisory committee must be fairly 
balanced in its membership in terms of the points of view represented 
and the functions to be performed.
    (d) Open meetings. Advisory committee meetings must be open to the 
public except where a closed or partially-closed meeting has been 
determined proper and consistent with the exemption(s) of the Government 
in the Sunshine Act, 5 U.S.C. 552b(c), as the basis for closure.
    (e) Advisory functions only. The function of advisory committees is 
advisory

[[Page 15]]

only, unless specifically provided by statute or Presidential directive.

Sec. 102-3.35  What policies govern the use of subcommittees?

    (a) In general, the requirements of the Act and the policies of this 
Federal Advisory Committee Management part do not apply to subcommittees 
of advisory committees that report to a parent advisory committee and 
not directly to a Federal officer or agency. However, this section does 
not preclude an agency from applying any provision of the Act and this 
part to any subcommittee of an advisory committee in any particular 
instance.
    (b) The creation and operation of subcommittees must be approved by 
the agency establishing the parent advisory committee.


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.40  What types of committees or groups are not covered by 

the Act and this part?

    The following are examples of committees or groups that are not 
covered by the Act or this Federal Advisory Committee Management part:
    (a) Committees created by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) or 
the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA). Any committee 
created by NAS or NAPA in accordance with section 15 of the Act, except 
as otherwise covered by subpart E of this part;
    (b) Advisory committees of the Central Intelligence Agency and the 
Federal Reserve System. Any advisory committee established or utilized 
by the Central Intelligence Agency or the Federal Reserve System;
    (c) Committees exempted by statute. Any committee specifically 
exempted from the Act by law;
    (d) Committees not actually managed or controlled by the executive 
branch. Any committee or group created by non-Federal entities (such as 
a contractor or private organization), provided that these committees or 
groups are not actually managed or controlled by the executive branch;
    (e) Groups assembled to provide individual advice. Any group that 
meets with a Federal official(s), including a public meeting, where 
advice is sought from the attendees on an individual basis and not from 
the group as a whole;
    (f) Groups assembled to exchange facts or information. Any group 
that meets with a Federal official(s) for the purpose of exchanging 
facts or information;
    (g) Intergovernmental committees. Any committee composed wholly of 
full-time or permanent part-time officers or employees of the Federal 
Government and elected officers of State, local and tribal governments 
(or their designated employees with authority to act on their behalf), 
acting in their official capacities. However, the purpose of such a 
committee must be solely to exchange views, information, or advice 
relating to the management or implementation of Federal programs 
established pursuant to statute, that explicitly or inherently share 
intergovernmental responsibilities or administration (see guidelines 
issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on section 204(b) of 
the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C. 1534(b), OMB 
Memorandum M-95-20, dated September 21, 1995, available from the 
Committee Management Secretariat (MC), General Services Administration, 
1800 F Street, NW., Washington, DC 20405-0002);
    (h) Intragovernmental committees. Any committee composed wholly of 
full-time or permanent part-time officers or employees of the Federal 
Government;
    (i) Local civic groups. Any local civic group whose primary function 
is that of rendering a public service with respect to a Federal program;
    (j) Groups established to advise State or local officials. Any State 
or local committee, council, board, commission, or similar group 
established to advise or make recommendations to State or local 
officials or agencies; and
    (k) Operational committees. Any committee established to perform 
primarily operational as opposed to advisory functions. Operational 
functions are those specifically authorized by statute or Presidential 
directive, such as making or implementing Government decisions or 
policy. A committee designated operational may be covered

[[Page 16]]

by the Act if it becomes primarily advisory in nature. It is the 
responsibility of the administering agency to determine whether a 
committee is primarily operational. If so, it does not fall under the 
requirements of the Act and this part.

      Subpart B_How Are Advisory Committees Established, Renewed, 
                     Reestablished, and Terminated?


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.45  What does this subpart cover and how does it apply?

    Requirements for establishing and terminating advisory committees 
vary depending on the establishing entity and the source of authority 
for the advisory committee. This subpart covers the procedures 
associated with the establishment, renewal, reestablishment, and 
termination of advisory committees. These procedures include consulting 
with the Secretariat, preparing and filing an advisory committee 
charter, publishing notice in the Federal Register, and amending an 
advisory committee charter.


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.50  What are the authorities for establishing advisory 

committees?

    FACA identifies four sources of authority for establishing an 
advisory committee:
    (a) Required by statute. By law where the Congress establishes an 
advisory committee, or specifically directs the President or an agency 
to establish it (non-discretionary);
    (b) Presidential authority. By Executive order of the President or 
other Presidential directive (non-discretionary);
    (c) Authorized by statute. By law where the Congress authorizes, but 
does not direct the President or an agency to establish it 
(discretionary); or
    (d) Agency authority. By an agency under general authority in title 
5 of the United States Code or under other general agency-authorizing 
statutes (discretionary).

Sec. 102-3.55  What rules apply to the duration of an advisory committee?

    (a) An advisory committee automatically terminates two years after 
its date of establishment unless:
    (1) The statutory authority used to establish the advisory committee 
provides a different duration;
    (2) The President or agency head determines that the advisory 
committee has fulfilled the purpose for which it was established and 
terminates the advisory committee earlier;
    (3) The President or agency head determines that the advisory 
committee is no longer carrying out the purpose

[[Page 19]]

for which it was established and terminates the advisory committee 
earlier; or
    (4) The President or agency head renews the committee not later than 
two years after its date of establishment in accordance with Sec. 102-
3.60. If an advisory committee needed by the President or an agency 
terminates because it was not renewed in a timely manner, or if the 
advisory committee has been terminated under the provisions of Sec. 
102-3.30(b), it can be reestablished in accordance with Sec. 102-3.60.
    (b) When an advisory committee terminates, the agency shall notify 
the Secretariat of the effective date of the termination.


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.60  What procedures are required to establish, renew, or

reestablish a discretionary advisory committee?

    (a) Consult with the Secretariat. Before establishing, renewing, or 
reestablishing a discretionary advisory committee and filing the charter 
as addressed later in Sec. 102-3.70, the agency head must consult with 
the Secretariat. As part of this consultation, agency heads are 
encouraged to engage in constructive dialogue with the Secretariat. With 
a full understanding of the background and purpose behind the proposed 
advisory committee, the Secretariat may share its knowledge and 
experience with the agency on how best to make use of the proposed 
advisory committee, suggest alternate methods of attaining its purpose 
that the agency may wish to consider, or inform the agency of a pre-
existing advisory committee performing similar functions.
    (b) Include required information in the consultation. Consultations 
covering the establishment, renewal, and reestablishment of advisory 
committees must, as a minimum, contain the following information:
    (1) Explanation of need. An explanation stating why the advisory 
committee is essential to the conduct of agency business and in the 
public interest;
    (2) Lack of duplication of resources. An explanation stating why the 
advisory committee's functions cannot be performed by the agency, 
another existing committee, or other means such as a public hearing; and
    (3) Fairly balanced membership. A description of the agency's plan 
to attain fairly balanced membership. The plan will ensure that, in the 
selection of members for the advisory committee, the agency will 
consider a cross-section of those directly affected, interested, and 
qualified, as appropriate to the nature and functions of the advisory 
committee. Advisory committees requiring technical expertise should 
include persons with demonstrated professional or personal 
qualifications and experience relevant to the functions and tasks to be 
performed.


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.65  What are the public notification requirements for 

discretionary advisory committees?

    A notice to the public in the Federal Register is required when a 
discretionary advisory committee is established, renewed, or 
reestablished.
    (a) Procedure. Upon receiving notice from the Secretariat that its 
review is complete in accordance with Sec. 102-3.60(a), the agency must 
publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing that the advisory 
committee is being established, renewed, or reestablished. For the 
establishment of a new advisory committee, the notice also must describe 
the nature and purpose of the advisory committee and affirm that the 
advisory committee is necessary and in the public interest.
    (b) Time required for notices. Notices of establishment and 
reestablishment of advisory committees must appear at least 15 calendar 
days before the charter is filed, except that the Secretariat may 
approve less than 15 calendar days when requested by the agency for good 
cause. This requirement for advance notice does not apply to advisory 
committee renewals, notices of which may be published concurrently with 
the filing of the charter.


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.70  What are the charter filing requirements?

    No advisory committee may meet or take any action until a charter 
has been filed by the Committee Management Officer (CMO) designated in 
accordance with section 8(b) of the Act,

[[Page 20]]

or by another agency official designated by the agency head.
    (a) Requirement for discretionary advisory committees. To establish, 
renew, or reestablish a discretionary advisory committee, a charter must 
be filed with:
    (1) The agency head;
    (2) The standing committees of the Senate and the House of 
Representatives having legislative jurisdiction of the agency, the date 
of filing with which constitutes the official date of establishment for 
the advisory committee;
    (3) The Library of Congress, Anglo-American Acquisitions Division, 
Government Documents Section, Federal Advisory Committee Desk, 101 
Independence Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20540-4172; and
    (4) The Secretariat, indicating the date the charter was filed in 
accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (b) Requirement for non-discretionary advisory committees. Charter 
filing requirements for non-discretionary advisory committees are the 
same as those in paragraph (a) of this section, except the date of 
establishment for a Presidential advisory committee is the date the 
charter is filed with the Secretariat.
    (c) Requirement for subcommittees that report directly to the 
Government. Subcommittees that report directly to a Federal officer or 
agency must comply with this subpart and include in a charter the 
information required by Sec. 102-3.75.


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.75  What information must be included in the charter of an

advisory committee?

    (a) Purpose and contents of an advisory committee charter. An 
advisory committee charter is intended to provide a description of an 
advisory committee's mission, goals, and objectives. It also provides a 
basis for evaluating an advisory committee's progress and effectiveness. 
The charter must contain the following information:
    (1) The advisory committee's official designation;
    (2) The objectives and the scope of the advisory committee's 
activity;
    (3) The period of time necessary to carry out the advisory 
committee's purpose(s);
    (4) The agency or Federal officer to whom the advisory committee 
reports;
    (5) The agency responsible for providing the necessary support to 
the advisory committee;
    (6) A description of the duties for which the advisory committee is 
responsible and specification of the authority for any non-advisory 
functions;
    (7) The estimated annual costs to operate the advisory committee in 
dollars and person years;
    (8) The estimated number and frequency of the advisory committee's 
meetings;
    (9) The planned termination date, if less than two years from the 
date of establishment of the advisory committee;
    (10) The name of the President's delegate, agency, or organization 
responsible for fulfilling the reporting requirements of section 6(b) of 
the Act, if appropriate; and
    (11) The date the charter is filed in accordance with Sec. 102-
3.70.
    (b) The provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) through (11) of this section 
apply to all subcommittees that report directly to a Federal officer or 
agency.


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.80  How are minor charter amendments accomplished?

    (a) Responsibility and limitation. The agency head is responsible 
for amending the charter of an advisory committee. Amendments may be 
either minor or major. The procedures for making changes and filing 
amended charters will depend upon the authority basis for the advisory 
committee. Amending any existing advisory committee charter does not 
constitute renewal of the advisory committee under Sec. 102-3.60.
    (b) Procedures for minor amendments. To make a minor amendment to an 
advisory committee charter, such as changing the name of the advisory 
committee or modifying the estimated number or frequency of meetings, 
the following procedures must be followed:
    (1) Non-discretionary advisory committees. The agency head must 
ensure that any minor technical changes made to current charters are 
consistent with

[[Page 21]]

the relevant authority. When the Congress by law, or the President by 
Executive order, changes the authorizing language that has been the 
basis for establishing an advisory committee, the agency head or the 
chairperson of an independent Presidential advisory committee must amend 
those sections of the current charter affected by the new statute or 
Executive order, and file the amended charter as specified in Sec. 102-
3.70.
    (2) Discretionary advisory committees. The charter of a 
discretionary advisory committee may be amended when an agency head 
determines that technical provisions of a filed charter are inaccurate, 
or specific provisions have changed or become obsolete with the passing 
of time, and that these amendments will not alter the advisory 
committee's objectives and scope substantially. The agency must amend 
the charter language as necessary and file the amended charter as 
specified in Sec. 102-3.70.


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.85  How are major charter amendments accomplished?

    Procedures for making major amendments to advisory committee 
charters, such as substantial changes in objectives and scope, duties, 
and estimated costs, are the same as in Sec. 102-3.80, except that for 
discretionary advisory committees an agency must:
    (a) Consult with the Secretariat on the amended language, and 
explain the purpose of the changes and why they are necessary; and
    (b) File the amended charter as specified in Sec. 102-3.70.

             Subpart C_How Are Advisory Committees Managed?


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.90  What does this subpart cover and how does it apply?

    This subpart outlines specific responsibilities and functions to be 
carried out by the General Services Administration (GSA), the agency 
head, the Committee Management Officer (CMO), and the Designated Federal 
Officer (DFO) under the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.95  What principles apply to the management of advisory 

committees?

    Agencies are encouraged to apply the following principles to the 
management of their advisory committees:
    (a) Provide adequate support. Before establishing an advisory 
committee, agencies should identify requirements and assure that 
adequate resources are available to support anticipated activities. 
Considerations related to support include office space, necessary 
supplies and equipment, Federal staff support, and access to key 
decisionmakers.
    (b) Focus on mission. Advisory committee members and staff should be 
fully aware of the advisory committee's mission, limitations, if any, on 
its duties, and the agency's goals and objectives. In general, the more 
specific an advisory committee's tasks and the more focused its 
activities are, the higher the likelihood will be that the advisory 
committee will fulfill its mission.
    (c) Follow plans and procedures. Advisory committee members and 
their agency sponsors should work together to assure that a plan and 
necessary procedures covering implementation are in place to support an 
advisory committee's mission. In particular, agencies should be clear 
regarding what functions an advisory committee can perform legally and 
those that it cannot perform.
    (d) Practice openness. In addition to achieving the minimum 
standards of public access established by the Act and this part, 
agencies should seek to be as inclusive as possible. For example, 
agencies may wish to explore the use of the Internet to post advisory 
committee information and seek broader input from the public.
    (e) Seek feedback. Agencies continually should seek feedback from 
advisory committee members and the public regarding the effectiveness of 
the advisory committee's activities. At regular intervals, agencies 
should communicate to the members how their advice has affected agency 
programs and decisionmaking.

[[Page 23]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.100  What are the responsibilities and functions of GSA?

    (a) Under section 7 of the Act, the General Services Administration 
(GSA) prepares regulations on Federal advisory committees to be 
prescribed by the Administrator of General Services, issues other 
administrative guidelines and management controls for advisory 
committees, and assists other agencies in implementing and interpreting 
the Act. Responsibility for these activities has been delegated by the 
Administrator to the GSA Committee Management Secretariat.
    (b) The Secretariat carries out its responsibilities by:
    (1) Conducting an annual comprehensive review of Governmentwide 
advisory committee accomplishments, costs, benefits, and other 
indicators to measure performance;
    (2) Developing and distributing Governmentwide training regarding 
the Act and related statutes and principles;
    (3) Supporting the Interagency Committee on Federal Advisory 
Committee Management in its efforts to improve compliance with the Act;
    (4) Designing and maintaining a Governmentwide shared Internet-based 
system to facilitate collection and use of information required by the 
Act;
    (5) Identifying performance measures that may be used to evaluate 
advisory committee accomplishments; and
    (6) Providing recommendations for transmittal by the Administrator 
to the Congress and the President regarding proposals to improve 
accomplishment of the objectives of the Act.


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.105  What are the responsibilities of an agency head?

    The head of each agency that establishes or utilizes one or more 
advisory committees must:
    (a) Comply with the Act and this Federal Advisory Committee 
Management part;
    (b) Issue administrative guidelines and management controls that 
apply to all of the agency's advisory committees subject to the Act;
    (c) Designate a Committee Management Officer (CMO);
    (d) Provide a written determination stating the reasons for closing 
any advisory committee meeting to the public, in whole or in part, in 
accordance with the exemption(s) of the Government in the Sunshine Act, 
5 U.S.C. 552b(c), as the basis for closure;
    (e) Review, at least annually, the need to continue each existing 
advisory committee, consistent with the public interest and the purpose 
or functions of each advisory committee;
    (f) Determine that rates of compensation for members (if they are 
paid for their services) and staff of, and experts and consultants to 
advisory committees are justified and that levels of agency support are 
adequate;
    (g) Develop procedures to assure that the advice or recommendations 
of advisory committees will not be inappropriately influenced by the 
appointing authority or by any special interest, but will instead be the 
result of the advisory committee's independent judgment;
    (h) Assure that the interests and affiliations of advisory committee 
members are reviewed for conformance with applicable conflict of 
interest statutes, regulations issued by the U.S. Office of Government 
Ethics (OGE) including any supplemental agency requirements, and other 
Federal ethics rules;
    (i) Designate a Designated Federal Officer (DFO) for each advisory 
committee and its subcommittees; and
    (j) Provide the opportunity for reasonable participation by the 
public in advisory committee activities, subject to Sec. 102-3.140 and 
the agency's guidelines.


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.110  What are the responsibilities of a chairperson of an

independent Presidential advisory committee?

    The chairperson of an independent Presidential advisory committee 
must:
    (a) Comply with the Act and this Federal Advisory Committee 
Management part;
    (b) Consult with the Secretariat concerning the designation of a 
Committee Management Officer (CMO) and Designated Federal Officer (DFO); 
and
    (c) Consult with the Secretariat in advance regarding any proposal 
to close any meeting in whole or in part.

[[Page 24]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.115  What are the responsibilities and functions of an

agency Committee Management Officer (CMO)?

    In addition to implementing the provisions of section 8(b) of the 
Act, the CMO will carry out all responsibilities delegated by the agency 
head. The CMO also should ensure that sections 10(b), 12(a), and 13 of 
the Act are implemented by the agency to provide for appropriate 
recordkeeping. Records to be kept by the CMO include, but are not 
limited to:
    (a) Charter and membership documentation. A set of filed charters 
for each advisory committee and membership lists for each advisory 
committee and subcommittee;
    (b) Annual comprehensive review. Copies of the information provided 
as the agency's portion of the annual comprehensive review of Federal 
advisory committees, prepared according to Sec. 102-3.175(b);
    (c) Agency guidelines. Agency guidelines maintained and updated on 
committee management operations and procedures; and
    (d) Closed meeting determinations. Agency determinations to close or 
partially close advisory committee meetings required by Sec. 102-3.105.


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.120  What are the responsibilities and functions of a

Designated Federal Officer (DFO)?

    The agency head or, in the case of an independent Presidential 
advisory committee, the Secretariat, must designate a Federal officer or 
employee who must be either full-time or permanent part-time, to be the 
DFO for each advisory committee and its subcommittees, who must:
    (a) Approve or call the meeting of the advisory committee or 
subcommittee;
    (b) Approve the agenda, except that this requirement does not apply 
to a Presidential advisory committee;
    (c) Attend the meetings;
    (d) Adjourn any meeting when he or she determines it to be in the 
public interest; and
    (e) Chair the meeting when so directed by the agency head.


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.125  How should agencies consider the roles of advisory

committee members and staff?

    FACA does not assign any specific responsibilities to members of 
advisory committees and staff, although both perform critical roles in 
achieving the goals and objectives assigned to advisory committees. 
Agency heads, Committee Management Officers (CMOs), and Designated 
Federal Officers (DFOs) should consider the distinctions between these 
roles and how they relate to each other in the development of agency 
guidelines implementing the Act and this Federal Advisory Committee 
Management part. In general, these guidelines should reflect:
    (a) Clear operating procedures. Clear operating procedures should 
provide for the conduct of advisory committee meetings and other 
activities, and specify the relationship among the advisory committee 
members, the DFO, and advisory committee or agency staff;
    (b) Agency operating policies. In addition to compliance with the 
Act, advisory committee members and staff may be required to adhere to 
additional agency operating policies; and
    (c) Other applicable statutes. Other agency-specific statutes and 
regulations may affect the agency's advisory committees directly or 
indirectly. Agencies should ensure that advisory committee members and 
staff understand these requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.130  What policies apply to the appointment, and 

compensation or reimbursement of advisory committee members, staff, and
experts and consultants?

    In developing guidelines to implement the Act and this Federal 
Advisory Committee Management part at the agency level, agency heads 
must address the following issues concerning advisory committee member 
and staff appointments, and considerations with respect to uniform fair 
rates of compensation for comparable services, or expense reimbursement 
of members, staff, and experts and consultants:
    (a) Appointment and terms of advisory committee members. Unless 
otherwise provided by statute, Presidential directive, or other 
establishment authority,

[[Page 25]]

advisory committee members serve at the pleasure of the appointing or 
inviting authority. Membership terms are at the sole discretion of the 
appointing or inviting authority.
    (b) Compensation guidelines. Each agency head must establish uniform 
compensation guidelines for members and staff of, and experts and 
consultants to an advisory committee.
    (c) Compensation of advisory committee members not required. Nothing 
in this subpart requires an agency head to provide compensation to any 
member of an advisory committee, unless otherwise required by a specific 
statute.
    (d) Compensation of advisory committee members. When an agency has 
authority to set pay administratively for advisory committee members, it 
may establish appropriate rates of pay (including any applicable 
locality pay authorized by the President's Pay Agent under 5 U.S.C. 
5304(h)), not to exceed the rate for level IV of the Executive Schedule 
under 5 U.S.C. 5315, unless a higher rate expressly is allowed by 
another statute. However, the agency head personally must authorize a 
rate of basic pay in excess of the maximum rate of basic pay established 
for the General Schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5332, or alternative similar 
agency compensation system. This maximum rate includes any applicable 
locality payment under 5 U.S.C. 5304. The agency may pay advisory 
committee members on either an hourly or a daily rate basis. The agency 
may not provide additional compensation in any form, such as bonuses or 
premium pay.
    (e) Compensation of staff. When an agency has authority to set pay 
administratively for advisory committee staff, it may establish 
appropriate rates of pay (including any applicable locality pay 
authorized by the President's Pay Agent under 5 U.S.C. 5304(h)), not to 
exceed the rate for level IV of the Executive Schedule under 5 U.S.C. 
5315, unless a higher rate expressly is allowed by another statute. 
However, the agency head personally must authorize a rate of basic pay 
in excess of the maximum rate of basic pay established for the General 
Schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5332, or alternative similar agency compensation 
system. This maximum rate includes any applicable locality payment under 
5 U.S.C. 5304. The agency must pay advisory committee staff on an hourly 
rate basis. The agency may provide additional compensation, such as 
bonuses or premium pay, so long as aggregate compensation paid in a 
calendar year does not exceed the rate for level IV of the Executive 
Schedule, with appropriate proration for a partial calendar year.
    (f) Other compensation considerations. In establishing rates of pay 
for advisory committee members and staff, the agency must comply with 
any applicable statutes, Executive orders, regulations, or 
administrative guidelines. In determining an appropriate rate of basic 
pay for advisory committee members and staff, an agency must give 
consideration to the significance, scope, and technical complexity of 
the matters with which the advisory committee is concerned, and the 
qualifications required for the work involved. The agency also should 
take into account the rates of pay applicable to Federal employees who 
have duties that are similar in terms of difficulty and responsibility. 
An agency may establish rates of pay for advisory committee staff based 
on the pay these persons would receive if they were covered by the 
General Schedule in 5 U.S.C. Chapter 51 and Chapter 53, subchapter III, 
or by an alternative similar agency compensation system.
    (g) Compensation of experts and consultants. Whether or not an 
agency has other authority to appoint and compensate advisory committee 
members or staff, it also may employ experts and consultants under 5 
U.S.C. 3109 to perform work for an advisory committee. Compensation of 
experts and consultants may not exceed the maximum rate of basic pay 
established for the General Schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5332 (that is, the 
GS-15, step 10 rate, excluding locality pay or any other supplement), 
unless a higher rate expressly is allowed by another statute. The 
appointment and compensation of experts and consultants by an agency 
must be in conformance with applicable regulations issued by the U. S. 
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) (See 5 CFR part 304.).

[[Page 26]]

    (h) Federal employees assigned to an advisory committee. Any 
advisory committee member or staff person who is a Federal employee when 
assigned duties to an advisory committee remains covered during the 
assignment by the compensation system that currently applies to that 
employee, unless that person's current Federal appointment is 
terminated. Any staff person who is a Federal employee must serve with 
the knowledge of the Designated Federal Officer (DFO) for the advisory 
committee to which that person is assigned duties, and the approval of 
the employee's direct supervisor.
    (i) Other appointment considerations. An individual who is appointed 
as an advisory committee member or staff person immediately following 
termination of another Federal appointment with a full-time work 
schedule may receive compensation at the rate applicable to the former 
appointment, if otherwise allowed by applicable law (without regard to 
the limitations on pay established in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this 
section). Any advisory committee staff person who is not a current 
Federal employee serving under an assignment must be appointed in 
accordance with applicable agency procedures, and in consultation with 
the DFO and the members of the advisory committee involved.
    (j) Gratuitous services. In the absence of any special limitations 
applicable to a specific agency, nothing in this subpart prevents an 
agency from accepting the gratuitous services of an advisory committee 
member or staff person who is not a Federal employee, or expert or 
consultant, who agrees in advance and in writing to serve without 
compensation.
    (k) Travel expenses. Advisory committee members and staff, while 
engaged in the performance of their duties away from their homes or 
regular places of business, may be allowed reimbursement for travel 
expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by 5 
U.S.C. 5703, for persons employed intermittently in the Government 
service.
    (l) Services for advisory committee members with disabilities. While 
performing advisory committee duties, an advisory committee member with 
disabilities may be provided services by a personal assistant for 
employees with disabilities, if the member qualifies as an individual 
with disabilities as provided in section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act 
of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 791, and does not otherwise qualify for 
assistance under 5 U.S.C. 3102 by reason of being a Federal employee.

    Subpart D_Advisory Committee Meeting and Recordkeeping Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.135  What does this subpart cover and how does it apply?

    This subpart establishes policies and procedures relating to 
meetings and other activities undertaken by advisory committees and 
their subcommittees. This subpart also outlines what records must be 
kept by Federal agencies and what other documentation, including 
advisory committee minutes and reports, must be prepared and made 
available to the public.


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.140  What policies apply to advisory committee meetings?

    The agency head, or the chairperson of an independent Presidential 
advisory committee, must ensure that:
    (a) Each advisory committee meeting is held at a reasonable time and 
in a manner or place reasonably accessible to the public, to include 
facilities that are readily accessible to and usable by persons with 
disabilities, consistent with the goals of section 504 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 794;
    (b) The meeting room or other forum selected is sufficient to 
accommodate

[[Page 29]]

advisory committee members, advisory committee or agency staff, and a 
reasonable number of interested members of the public;
    (c) Any member of the public is permitted to file a written 
statement with the advisory committee;
    (d) Any member of the public may speak to or otherwise address the 
advisory committee if the agency's guidelines so permit; and
    (e) Any advisory committee meeting conducted in whole or part by a 
teleconference, videoconference, the Internet, or other electronic 
medium meets the requirements of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.145  What policies apply to subcommittee meetings?

    If a subcommittee makes recommendations directly to a Federal 
officer or agency, or if its recommendations will be adopted by the 
parent advisory committee without further deliberations by the parent 
advisory committee, then the subcommittee's meetings must be conducted 
in accordance with all openness requirements of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.150  How are advisory committee meetings announced to the 

public?

    (a) A notice in the Federal Register must be published at least 15 
calendar days prior to an advisory committee meeting, which includes:
    (1) The name of the advisory committee (or subcommittee, if 
applicable);
    (2) The time, date, place, and purpose of the meeting;
    (3) A summary of the agenda, and/or topics to be discussed;
    (4) A statement whether all or part of the meeting is open to the 
public or closed; if the meeting is closed state the reasons why, citing 
the specific exemption(s) of the Government in the Sunshine Act, 5 
U.S.C. 552b(c), as the basis for closure; and
    (5) The name and telephone number of the Designated Federal Officer 
(DFO) or other responsible agency official who may be contacted for 
additional information concerning the meeting.
    (b) In exceptional circumstances, the agency or an independent 
Presidential advisory committee may give less than 15 calendar days 
notice, provided that the reasons for doing so are included in the 
advisory committee meeting notice published in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.155  How are advisory committee meetings closed to the public?

    To close all or part of an advisory committee meeting, the 
Designated Federal Officer (DFO) must:
    (a) Obtain prior approval. Submit a request to the agency head, or 
in the case of an independent Presidential advisory committee, the 
Secretariat, citing the specific exemption(s) of the Government in the 
Sunshine Act, 5 U.S.C. 552b(c), that justify the closure. The request 
must provide the agency head or the Secretariat sufficient time 
(generally, 30 calendar days) to review the matter in order to make a 
determination before publication of the meeting notice required by Sec. 
102-3.150.
    (b) Seek General Counsel review. The General Counsel of the agency 
or, in the case of an independent Presidential advisory committee, the 
General Counsel of GSA should review all requests to close meetings.
    (c) Obtain agency determination. If the agency head, or in the case 
of an independent Presidential advisory committee, the Secretariat, 
finds that the request is consistent with the provisions in the 
Government in the Sunshine Act and FACA, the appropriate agency official 
must issue a determination that all or part of the meeting be closed.
    (d) Assure public access to determination. The agency head or the 
chairperson of an independent Presidential advisory committee must make 
a copy of the determination available to the public upon request.


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.160  What activities of an advisory committee are not 

subject to the notice and open meeting requirements of the Act?

    The following activities of an advisory committee are excluded from 
the procedural requirements contained in this subpart:
    (a) Preparatory work. Meetings of two or more advisory committee or 
subcommittee members convened solely to gather information, conduct 
research,

[[Page 30]]

or analyze relevant issues and facts in preparation for a meeting of the 
advisory committee, or to draft position papers for deliberation by the 
advisory committee; and
    (b) Administrative work. Meetings of two or more advisory committee 
or subcommittee members convened solely to discuss administrative 
matters of the advisory committee or to receive administrative 
information from a Federal officer or agency.


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.165  How are advisory committee meetings documented?

    (a) The agency head or, in the case of an independent Presidential 
advisory committee, the chairperson must ensure that detailed minutes of 
each advisory committee meeting, including one that is closed or 
partially closed to the public, are kept. The chairperson of each 
advisory committee must certify the accuracy of all minutes of advisory 
committee meetings.
    (b) The minutes must include:
    (1) The time, date, and place of the advisory committee meeting;
    (2) A list of the persons who were present at the meeting, including 
advisory committee members and staff, agency employees, and members of 
the public who presented oral or written statements;
    (3) An accurate description of each matter discussed and the 
resolution, if any, made by the advisory committee regarding such 
matter; and
    (4) Copies of each report or other document received, issued, or 
approved by the advisory committee at the meeting.
    (c) The Designated Federal Officer (DFO) must ensure that minutes 
are certified within 90 calendar days of the meeting to which they 
relate.


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.170  How does an interested party obtain access to 

advisory committee records?

    Timely access to advisory committee records is an important element 
of the public access requirements of the Act. Section 10(b) of the Act 
provides for the contemporaneous availability of advisory committee 
records that, when taken in conjunction with the ability to attend 
committee meetings, provide a meaningful opportunity to comprehend fully 
the work undertaken by the advisory committee. Although advisory 
committee records may be withheld under the provisions of the Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA), as amended, if there is a reasonable expectation 
that the records sought fall within the exemptions contained in section 
552(b) of FOIA, agencies may not require members of the public or other 
interested parties to file requests for non-exempt advisory committee 
records under the request and review process established by section 
552(a)(3) of FOIA.


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.175  What are the reporting and recordkeeping requirements 

for an advisory committee?

    (a) Presidential advisory committee follow-up report. Within one 
year after a Presidential advisory committee has submitted a public 
report to the President, a follow-up report required by section 6(b) of 
the Act must be prepared and transmitted to the Congress detailing the 
disposition of the advisory committee's recommendations. The Secretariat 
shall assure that these reports are prepared and transmitted to the 
Congress as directed by the President, either by the President's 
delegate, by the agency responsible for providing support to a 
Presidential advisory committee, or by the responsible agency or 
organization designated in the charter of the Presidential advisory 
committee pursuant to Sec. 102-3.75(a)(10). In performing this 
function, GSA may solicit the assistance of the President's delegate, 
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), or the responsible agency 
Committee Management Officer (CMO), as appropriate. Reports shall be 
consistent with specific guidance provided periodically by the 
Secretariat.
    (b) Annual comprehensive review of Federal advisory committees. To 
conduct an annual comprehensive review of each advisory committee as 
specified in section 7(b) of the Act, GSA requires Federal agencies to 
report information on each advisory committee for which a charter has 
been filed in accordance with Sec. 102-3.70, and which is in existence 
during any part of a Federal fiscal year. Committee Management Officers 
(CMOs), Designated Federal Officers

[[Page 31]]

(DFOs), and other responsible agency officials will provide this 
information by data filed electronically with GSA on a fiscal year 
basis, using a Governmentwide shared Internet-based system that GSA 
maintains. This information shall be consistent with specific guidance 
provided periodically by the Secretariat. The preparation of these 
electronic submissions by agencies has been assigned interagency report 
control number (IRCN) 0304-GSA-AN.
    (c) Annual report of closed or partially-closed meetings. In 
accordance with section 10(d) of the Act, advisory committees holding 
closed or partially-closed meetings must issue reports at least 
annually, setting forth a summary of activities and such related matters 
as would be informative to the public consistent with the policy of 5 
U.S.C. 552(b).
    (d) Advisory committee reports. Subject to 5 U.S.C. 552, 8 copies of 
each report made by an advisory committee, including any report of 
closed or partially-closed meetings as specified in paragraph (c) of 
this section and, where appropriate, background papers prepared by 
experts or consultants, must be filed with the Library of Congress as 
required by section 13 of the Act for public inspection and use at the 
location specified Sec. 102-3.70(a)(3).
    (e) Advisory committee records. Official records generated by or for 
an advisory committee must be retained for the duration of the advisory 
committee. Upon termination of the advisory committee, the records must 
be processed in accordance with the Federal Records Act (FRA), 44 U.S.C. 
Chapters 21, 29-33, and regulations issued by the National Archives and 
Records Administration (NARA) (see 36 CFR parts 1220, 1222, 1228, and 
1234), or in accordance with the Presidential Records Act (PRA), 44 
U.S.C. Chapter 22.

<R04>
   Subpart E_How Does This Subpart Apply to Advice or Recommendations 
Provided to Agencies by the National Academy of Sciences or the National 
                    Academy of Public Administration?


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.180  What does this subpart cover and how does it apply?

    This subpart provides guidance to agencies on compliance with 
section 15 of the Act. Section 15 establishes requirements that apply 
only in connection with a funding or other written agreement involving 
an agency's use of advice or recommendations provided to the agency by 
the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) or the National Academy of Public 
Administration (NAPA), if such advice or recommendations were developed 
by use of a committee created by either academy. For purposes of this 
subpart, NAS also includes the National Academy of Engineering, the 
Institute of Medicine, and the National Research Council. Except with 
respect to NAS committees that were the subject of judicial actions 
filed before December 17, 1997, no part of the Act other than section 15 
applies to any committee created by NAS or NAPA.

[[Page 35]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-3.185  What does this subpart require agencies to do?

    (a) Section 15 requirements. An agency may not use any advice or 
recommendation provided to an agency by the National Academy of Sciences 
(NAS) or the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) under an 
agreement between the agency and an academy, if such advice or 
recommendation was developed by use of a committee created by either 
academy, unless:
    (1) The committee was not subject to any actual management or 
control by an agency or officer of the Federal Government; and
    (2) In the case of NAS, the academy certifies that it has complied 
substantially with the requirements of section 15(b) of the Act; or
    (3) In the case of NAPA, the academy certifies that it has complied 
substantially with the requirements of sections 15(b) (1), (2), and (5) 
of the Act.
    (b) No agency management or control. Agencies must not manage or 
control the specific procedures adopted by each academy to comply with 
the requirements of section 15 of the Act that are applicable to that 
academy. In addition, however, any committee created and used by an 
academy in the development of any advice or recommendation to be 
provided by the academy to an agency must be subject to both actual 
management and control by that academy and not by the agency.
    (c) Funding agreements. Agencies may enter into contracts, grants, 
and cooperative agreements with NAS or NAPA that are consistent with the 
requirements of this subpart to obtain advice or recommendations from 
such academy. These funding agreements require, and agencies may rely 
upon, a written certification by an authorized representative of the 
academy provided to the agency upon delivery to the agency of each 
report containing advice or recommendations required under the agreement 
that:
    (1) The academy has adopted policies and procedures that comply with 
the applicable requirements of section 15 of the Act; and
    (2) To the best of the authorized representative's knowledge and 
belief, these policies and procedures substantially have been complied 
with in performing the work required under the agreement.

<R05>
Sec. 102-5.30  What definitions apply to this part?

    The following definitions apply to this part:
    Agency head means the highest official of a Federal agency.
    Clear and present danger means highly unusual circumstances that 
present a threat to the physical safety of the employee or their 
property when the danger is:
    (1) Real; and
    (2) Immediate or imminent, not merely potential; and
    (3) The use of a Government passenger carrier would provide 
protection not otherwise available.
    Compelling operational considerations means those circumstances 
where home-to-work transportation is essential to the conduct of 
official business or would substantially increase a Federal agency's 
efficiency and economy.
    Emergency means circumstances that exist whenever there is an 
immediate, unforeseeable, temporary need to provide home-to-work 
transportation for those employees necessary to the uninterrupted 
performance of the agency's mission. (An emergency may occur where there 
is a major disruption of available means of transportation to or from a 
work site, an essential Government service must be provided, and there 
is no other way to transport those employees.)
    Employee means a Federal officer or employee of a Federal agency, 
including an officer or enlisted member of the Armed Forces.
    Federal agency means:

limited use beyond the local commuting area, or transportation to remote 
locations that are only accessible by Government-provided transportation 
are examples of field work.)
    Home means the primary place where an employee resides and from 
which the employee commutes to his/her place of work.
    Home-to-work transportation means the use of a Government passenger 
carrier to transport an employee between his/her home and place of work.

    Work means any place within the accepted commuting area, as 
determined by the Federal agency for the locality involved, where an 
employee performs his/her official duties.


<R04>
            Subpart B_Authorizing Home-to-Work Transportation


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.35  Who is authorized home-to-work transportation?

    By statute, certain Federal officials are authorized home-to-work 
transportation, as are employees who meet certain statutory criteria as 
determined by their agency head. The Federal officials authorized by 
statute are the President, the Vice-President, and other principal 
Federal officials and their designees, as provided in 31 U.S.C. 
1344(b)(1) through (b)(7). Those employees engaged in field work, or 
faced with a clear and present danger, an emergency, or a compelling 
operational consideration may be authorized home-to-work transportation 
as determined by their agency head. No other employees are authorized 
home-to-work transportation.


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.40  May the agency head delegate the authority to make 

home-to-work determinations?

    No, the agency head may not delegate the authority to make home-to-
work determinations.


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.45  Should determinations be completed before an employee

is provided with home-to-work transportation?

    Yes, determinations should be completed before an employee is 
provided with home-to-work transportation unless it is impracticable to 
do so.


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.50  May determinations be made in advance for employees 

who respond to unusual circumstances when they arise?

    Yes, determinations may be made in advance when the Federal agency 
wants to have employees ready to respond to:
    (a) A clear and present danger;
    (b) An emergency; or
    (c) A compelling operational consideration.

    Note to Sec. 102-5.50: Implementation of these determinations is 
contingent upon one of the three circumstances occurring. Thus, these 
may be referred to as ``contingency determinations.''


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.55  How do we prepare determinations?

    Determinations must be in writing and include the:
    (a) Name and title of the employee (or other identification, if 
confidential);
    (b) Reason for authorizing home-to-work transportation; and
    (c) Anticipated duration of the authorization.


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.60  How long are initial determinations effective?

    Initial determinations are effective for no longer than:
    (a) Two years for field work, updated as necessary; and
    (b) Fifteen days for other circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.65  What procedures apply when the need for home-to-work

transportation exceeds the initial period?

    The agency head may approve unlimited subsequent determinations, 
when the need for home-to-work transportation exceeds the initial 
period, for no longer than:
    (a) Two years each for field work, updated as necessary; and

[[Page 39]]

    (b) Ninety calendar days each for other circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.70  What considerations apply in making a determination 

to authorize home-to-work transportation for field work?

    Agencies should consider the following when making a determination 
to authorize home-to-work transportation for field work:
    (a) The location of the employee's home in proximity to his/her work 
and to the locations where non-TDY travel is required; and
    (b) The use of home-to-work transportation for field work should be 
authorized only to the extent that such transportation will 
substantially increase the efficiency and economy of the Government.


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.75  What circumstances do not establish a basis for 

authorizing home-to-work transportation for field work?

    The following circumstances do not establish a basis for authorizing 
home-to-work transportation for field work:
    (a) When an employee assigned to field work is not actually 
performing field work.
    (b) When the employee's workday begins at his/her work; or
    (c) When the employee normally commutes to a fixed location, however 
far removed from his/her official duty station (for example, auditors or 
investigators assigned to a defense contractor plant).

    Note to Sec. 102-5.75: For instances where an employee is 
authorized home-to-work transportation under the field work provision, 
but performs field work only on an intermittent basis, the agency shall 
establish procedures to ensure that a Government passenger carrier is 
used only when field work is actually being performed. Although some 
employees' daily work station is not located in a Government office, 
these employees are not performing field work. Like all Government 
employees, employees working in a ``field office'' are responsible for 
their own commuting costs.


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.80  What are some examples of positions that may involve

field work?

    Examples of positions that may involve field work include, but are 
not limited to:
    (a) Quality assurance inspectors;
    (b) Construction inspectors;
    (c) Dairy inspectors;
    (d) Mine inspectors;
    (e) Meat inspectors; and
    (f) Medical officers on outpatient service.

    Note to Sec. 102-5.80: The assignment of an employee to such a 
position does not, of itself, entitle an employee to receive daily home-
to-work transportation.


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.85  What information should our determination for field 

work include if positions are identified rather than named individuals?

    If positions are identified rather than named individuals, your 
determination for field work should include sufficient information to 
satisfy an audit, if necessary. This information should include the job 
title, number, and operational level where the work is to be performed 
(e.g., five recruiter personnel or, positions at the Detroit Army 
Recruiting Battalion).

    Note to Sec. 102-5.85: An agency head may elect to designate 
positions rather than individual names, especially in positions where 
rapid turnover occurs.


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.90  Should an agency consider whether to base a Government

passenger carrier at a Government facility near the employee's home or 
work rather than authorize the employee home-to-work transportation?

    Yes, situations may arise where, for cost or other reasons, it is in 
the Government's interest to base a Government passenger carrier at a 
Government facility located near the employee's home or work rather than 
authorize the employee home-to-work transportation.


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.95  Is the comfort and/or convenience of an employee 

considered sufficient justification to authorize home-to-work 
transportation?

    No, the comfort and/or convenience of an employee is not considered 
sufficient justification to authorize home-to-work transportation.

[[Page 40]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.100  May we use home-to-work transportation for other than

official purposes?

    No, you may not use home-to-work transportation for other than 
official purposes. However, if your agency has prescribed rules for the 
incidental use of Government vehicles (as provided in 31 U.S.C. note), 
you may use the vehicle in accordance with those rules in connection 
with an existing home-to-work authorization.


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.105  May others accompany an employee using home-to-work 

transportation?

    Yes, an employee authorized home-to-work transportation may share 
space in a Government passenger carrier with other individuals, provided 
that the passenger carrier does not travel additional distances as a 
result and such sharing is consistent with his/her Federal agency's 
policy. When a Federal agency establishes its space sharing policy, the 
Federal agency should consider its potential liability for and to those 
individuals. Home-to-work transportation does not extend to the 
employee's spouse, other relatives, or friends unless they travel with 
the employee from the same point of departure to the same destination, 
and this use is consistent with the Federal agency's policy.


<R04>
           Subpart C_Documenting and Reporting Determinations


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.110  Must we report our determinations outside of our agency?

    Yes, you must submit your determinations to the following 
Congressional Committees:
    (a) Chairman, Committee on Governmental Affairs, United States 
Senate, Suite SD-340, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC 
20510-6250; and
    (b) Chairman, Committee on Governmental Reform, United States House 
of Representatives, Suite 2157, Rayburn House Office Building, 
Washington, DC 20515-6143.


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.115  When must we report our determinations?

    You must report your determinations to Congress no later than 60 
calendar days after approval. You may consolidate any subsequent 
determinations into a single report and submit them quarterly.


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.120  What are our responsibilities for documenting use

of home-to-work transportation?

    Your responsibilities for documenting use of home-to-work 
transportation are that you must maintain logs or other records 
necessary to verify that any home-to-work transportation was for 
official purposes. Each agency may decide the organizational level at 
which the logs should be maintained and kept. The logs or other records 
should be easily accessible for audit and should contain:
    (a) Name and title of employee (or other identification, if 
confidential) using the passenger carrier;
    (b) Name and title of person authorizing use;
    (c) Passenger carrier identification;
    (d) Date(s) home-to-work transportation is authorized;
    (e) Location of residence;
    (f) Duration; and
    (g) Circumstances requiring home-to-work transportation.

                     Subpart A_How These Rules Apply

                                 General


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.5  To whom do these rules apply?

    The rules in this part apply to all federally funded aviation 
activities of executive agencies of the U.S. Government, except those 
listed in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section, who use 
Government aircraft to accomplish their official business.
    (a) The Armed Forces are exempt from all but--
    (1) Section 102-33.25(e) and (g), which concern responsibilities 
related to the Interagency Committee for Aviation Policy (ICAP); and
    (2) Subpart D of this part.
    (b) The President or Vice President and their offices are exempt.
    (c) When an executive agency provides Government-furnished avionics 
for commercially owned or privately

[[Page 44]]

owned aircraft for the purpose of technology demonstration or testing, 
those aircraft are exempt.
    (d) Privately owned aircraft that agency personnel use for official 
travel (even though such use is federally funded) are exempt.


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.10  May we request approval to deviate from these rules?

    Yes, see Sec. Sec. 102-2.60 through 102-2.110 of subchapter A of 
this chapter for guidance on requesting a deviation from the 
requirements in this part. GSA may not grant deviations from the 
requirements in OMB Circular A-126, ``Improving the Management of 
Government Aircraft,'' revised May 22, 1992. You should consult with 
GSA's Aircraft Management Policy Division (MTA) before you request a 
deviation. Also, you should fax a copy of your letter of request to MTA 
at 202-501-6742 at the same time you mail it to GSA's Regulatory 
Secretariat (see Sec. 102-2.90 of subchapter A of this chapter). In 
most cases, GSA will respond to your written request within 30 days.


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.15  How does this part relate to the Federal Aviation

Regulations?

    This part does not supersede any of the regulations in 14 CFR 
chapter I (Federal Aviation Regulations).


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.20  What definitions apply to this part?

    The following definitions apply to this part:
    Acquisition date means the date that the acquiring executive agency 
took responsibility for the aircraft, e.g., received title (through 
purchase, exchange, or gift), signed a bailment agreement with the 
Department of Defense (DOD), took physical custody (in the case of 
reassignment or interagency transfer), received a court order (in the 
case of forfeiture), put into operational status an aircraft that is 
newly manufactured by the agency, or otherwise accepted physical 
transfer (for example, in the case of a borrowed aircraft).
    Aircraft Management Policy Division (MTA) is a division in the 
Office of Transportation and Personal Property, Office of Governmentwide 
Policy, GSA. Contact MTA staff at 1800 F Street, NW., Washington, DC 
20405, Room 1221; (202) 501-4866; fax (202) 501-6742; Web site at http:/
/www.gsa.gov/aircraftpolicy.
    Aircraft part means an individual component or an assembly of 
components that is primarily designated for and used on aircraft.
    Armed Forces means the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and 
Coast Guard, including their regular and Reserve components and members 
serving without component status. For purposes of this part, the 
National Guard is also included in the Armed Forces.
    Aviation life support equipment (ALSE) means equipment that protects 
flight crewmembers and others aboard an aircraft, assisting their safe 
escape, survival, and recovery during an accident or other emergency.
    Bailed aircraft means a Federal aircraft that is owned by one 
executive agency, but is in the custody of and operated by another 
executive agency under an agreement that may or may not include cost-
reimbursement. Bailments are executive agency-to-executive agency 
agreements and involve only aircraft, not services.
    Borrowed aircraft means an aircraft owned by a non-executive agency 
and provided to an executive agency for use without compensation. The 
executive agency operates and maintains the aircraft.
    Chartered aircraft means an aircraft that an executive agency hires 
commercially under a contractual agreement specifying performance and 
one-time exclusive use. The commercial source operates and maintains a 
charter aircraft. A charter is one form of a full service contract.
    Commercial aviation services (CAS) include--
    (1) Leasing aircraft for exclusive use or lease-purchasing an 
aircraft with the intent of taking title;
    (2) Chartering or renting aircraft for exclusive use;
    (3) Contracting for full services (i.e., aircraft and related 
aviation services for exclusive use) or obtaining full services through 
an inter-service support agreement (ISSA); or
    (4) Obtaining related aviation services (i.e., services but not 
aircraft) by commercial contract or ISSA, except

[[Page 45]]

those services acquired to support a Federal aircraft.
    Crewmember means a person assigned to operate or assist in operating 
an aircraft during flight time. Crewmembers perform duties directly 
related to the operation of the aircraft (e.g., as pilots, co-pilots, 
flight engineers, navigators) or duties assisting in operation of the 
aircraft (e.g., as flight directors, crew chiefs, electronics 
technicians, mechanics). For related terms, see Qualified non-crewmember 
and Passenger elsewhere in this section.
    Criticality code means a single digit code that DOD assigns to 
military Flight Safety Critical Aircraft Parts (FSCAP) (see Sec. 102-
33.370).
    Data plate means a fireproof plate that is inscribed with certain 
information required by the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 
45) and secured to an aircraft, aircraft engine, propeller, or propeller 
blade. The information must be marked by etching, stamping, engraving, 
or other approved method of fireproof marking. The plate must be 
attached in such a manner that it is not likely to be defaced or removed 
during normal service or lost or destroyed in an accident. Data plates 
are required only on certificated aircraft; however, uncertificated 
aircraft may also have data plates.
    Declassify means to remove a non-operational aircraft from the 
Federal aircraft inventory. Agencies may declassify only non-operational 
aircraft that they will retain for ground use only. Agencies must 
declassify an aircraft following the rules in Sec. Sec. 102-33.415 and 
102-33.420.
    Disposal date means the date that the disposing executive agency 
relinquishes responsibility for an aircraft, for example, when the 
agency transfers title in the case of a sale or exchange; returns the 
aircraft to the lessor or bailer; declassifies it (for FAIRS, 
declassification is considered a ``disposal'' action, even though the 
agency retains the property); or relinquishes custody to another agency 
(i.e., in the case of excess (transferred) or surplus (donated or sold) 
aircraft).
    Donated aircraft means an aircraft disposed of as surplus by GSA 
through donation to a non-federal government, a tax-exempt nonprofit 
entity, or other eligible recipient, following the rules in part 102-37 
of this subchapter. (Some agencies, for example DOD, may have 
independent donation authority.)
    Exclusive use means a condition under which--
    (1) An aircraft is operated for the sole benefit of the U.S. 
Government; and
    (2) The executive agency using the aircraft has operational control 
of the aircraft and the authority to define departure times, origins and 
destinations of flights, and payloads, passengers, and cargo.
    Executive agency means any executive department or independent 
establishment in the executive branch of the United States Government, 
including any wholly owned Government corporation. See 40 U.S.C. 472(a).
    Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR chapter 1, parts 1 through 
53) is a codified regulation of the U.S. Government that provides 
uniform policies and procedures for acquisition of personal property and 
services by executive agencies.
    Federal aircraft means an aircraft that an executive agency owns 
(i.e., holds title to) or borrows for any length of time. When an 
executive agency loans or bails an aircraft that meets the criteria for 
Federal aircraft, that loaned or bailed aircraft is still considered a 
Federal aircraft in the owning agency's inventory except when DOD is the 
owning agency of a bailed aircraft. In that case, the aircraft is 
recorded in the inventory of the bailee.
    Federal Aviation Interactive Reporting System (FAIRS). (See 
Sec. Sec. 102-33.395 through 102-33.440.)
    Federal Aviation Regulation (14 CFR chapter I) is a codified 
publication of the U.S. Government that describes uniform policies and 
procedures for regulating aviation within the national airspace system.
    Federal Supply Service (FSS) is a component of GSA. FSS is organized 
by geographical regions. The FSS Property Management Division in GSA's 
Region 9, 450 Golden Gate Ave., 9FBP, San Francisco, CA 94102-3434, 
(415) 522-3029, has responsibility for disposing of excess and surplus 
aircraft.
    Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) (41 CFR chapters 300-304) is a 
codified publication of the U.S. Government that

[[Page 46]]

describes uniform policies and procedures for managing travel of the 
executive agencies.
    Flight Safety Critical Aircraft Part (FSCAP) means any military 
aircraft part, assembly, or installation containing a critical 
characteristic whose failure, malfunction, or absence could cause a 
catastrophic failure resulting in loss or serious damage to the aircraft 
or an uncommanded engine shut-down resulting in an unsafe condition.
    Forfeited aircraft means an aircraft acquired by the Government 
either by summary process or by order of a court of competent 
jurisdiction pursuant to any law of the United States.
    Full service contract means a contractual agreement through which an 
executive agency acquires an aircraft and related aviation services (for 
example, pilot, crew, maintenance, catering) for exclusive use. Aircraft 
hired under full service contracts are commercial aviation services 
(CAS), not Federal aircraft, regardless of the length of the contract.
    Government aircraft means an aircraft that is operated for the 
exclusive use of an executive agency and is a--
    (1) Federal aircraft, which an executive agency owns, bails, loans, 
or borrows; or
    (2) Commercial aircraft hired as commercial aviation services (CAS), 
which an executive agency--
    (i) Leases or lease-purchases with the intent to take title;
    (ii) Charters or rents; or
    (iii) Hires as part of a full service contract or an inter-service 
support agreement (ISSA).

State.
    (6) Intelligence elements of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine 
Corps, Department of Justice, Department of the Treasury, and Department 
of Energy.
    Inter-service support agreement (ISSA) means any agreement between 
two or more executive agencies (including the Department of Defense) in 
which one agency consents to perform aviation support services (i.e., 
providing an aircraft and other aviation services or providing only 
services) for another agency with or without cost-reimbursement. An 
executive agency-to-executive agency agreement that involves only the 
use of an aircraft, not services, is a bailment, not an ISSA.
    Leased aircraft means an aircraft hired under a commercial 
contractual agreement in which an executive agency has exclusive use of 
the aircraft for an agreed upon period of time. The acquiring executive 
agency operates and maintains the aircraft. Leased aircraft are hired as 
commercial aviation services (CAS).
    Lease-purchase aircraft means a leased aircraft for which the 
leasing executive agency holds an option to purchase.
    Life-limited part means any aircraft part that has an established 
replacement time, inspection interval, or other time-related procedure 
associated with it. For non-military parts, FAA specifies life-limited 
parts' airworthiness limitations in 14 CFR chapter I, Sec. Sec. 21.50, 
23.1529, 25.1529, 27.1529, 29.1529, 31.82, 33.4, and 35.5, and on 
product Type Certificate Data Sheets (TCDS) for products certified 
before airworthiness limitations were added to 14 CFR chapter I. Letters 
authorizing Technical Standards Orders (TSO) must also note or reference 
mandatory replacement or inspection of parts.
    Loaned aircraft means a Federal aircraft owned by an executive 
agency, but in the custody of a non-executive agency under an agreement 
that does not include compensation.
    Military aircraft part means an aircraft part used on an 
uncertificated aircraft that was developed for the Armed Forces.

[[Page 47]]

    Non-operational aircraft means a Federal aircraft that is not safe 
for flight and, in the owning executive agency's determination, cannot 
economically be made safe for flight. This definition refers to the 
aircraft's flight capability, not its mission-support equipment 
capability. An aircraft that is temporarily out of service for 
maintenance or repair and can economically be made safe for flight is 
considered operational.
    Official Government business, in relation to Government aircraft--
    (1) Includes, but is not limited to--
    (i) Carrying crewmembers, qualified non-crewmembers, and cargo 
directly required for or associated with performing Governmental 
functions (including travel-related Governmental functions);
    (ii) Carrying passengers authorized to travel on Government aircraft 
(see OMB Circular A-126); and
    (iii) Training pilots and other aviation personnel.
    (2) Does not include--
    (i) Using Government aircraft for personal or political purposes, 
except for required use travel and space available travel as defined in 
OMB Circular A-126; or
    (ii) Carrying passengers who are not officially authorized to travel 
on Government aircraft.
    Operational aircraft means a Federal aircraft that is safe for 
flight or, in the owning executive agency's determination, can 
economically be made safe for flight. This definition refers to the 
aircraft's flight capability, not its mission-support capability. An 
aircraft temporarily out of service for maintenance or repair is 
considered operational.
    Original equipment manufacturer means the person or company who 
originally designed, engineered, and manufactured, or who currently 
holds the data rights to manufacture, a specific aircraft or aircraft 
part.
    Owned aircraft means an aircraft for which title or rights of title 
are vested in an executive agency. Owned aircraft are considered Federal 
aircraft.
    Passenger means a person flying onboard a Government aircraft who is 
officially authorized to travel and who is not a crewmember or qualified 
non-crewmember.
    Production approval holder means the person or company who holds a 
Production Certificate (PC), Approved Production Inspection System 
(APIS), Parts Manufacturer Approval (PMA), or Technical Standards Order 
(TSO) authorization, issued under provisions of 14 CFR part 21, 
Certification Procedures for Products and Parts, and who controls the 
design and quality of a specific aircraft part.
    Qualified non-crewmember means a person flying onboard a Government 
aircraft whose skills or expertise are required to perform or are 
associated with performing the Governmental function for which the 
aircraft is being operated (qualified non-crewmembers may be 
researchers, law enforcement agents, fire fighters, agricultural 
engineers, biologists, etc.). Qualified non-crewmembers are not 
passengers.
    Registration mark means the unique identification mark that is 
assigned by the Federal Aviation Administration and displayed on 
Government aircraft (including foreign aircraft hired as CAS). Tail 
number is commonly used for registration mark.
    Related aviation services contract means a commercial contractual 
agreement through which an executive agency hires aviation services only 
(not aircraft), e.g., pilot, crew, maintenance, cleaning, dispatching, 
or catering.
    Rental aircraft means an aircraft hired commercially under an 
agreement in which the executive agency has exclusive use of the 
aircraft for an agreed upon period of time. The executive agency 
operates, but does not maintain, a rental aircraft.
    Required use means use of a Government aircraft for the travel of an 
executive agency officer or employee to meet bona fide communications or 
security needs of the agency or to meet exceptional scheduling 
requirements. Required use travel must be approved as described in OMB 
Circular A-126.
    Risk analysis and management means a systematic process for--
    (1) Identifying risks associated with alternative courses of action 
involved in an aviation operation; and

[[Page 48]]

    (2) Choosing from among these alternatives the course(s) of action 
that will promote optimum aviation safety.
    Safe for flight means approved for flight and refers to an aircraft, 
aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, or part that has been inspected 
and certified to meet the requirements of applicable regulations, 
specifications, or standards. When applied to an aircraft that an 
executive agency operates under the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 
chapter I), safe for flight means ``airworthy,'' i.e., the aircraft or 
related parts meet their type designs and are in a condition, relative 
to wear and deterioration, for safe operation. When applied to an 
aircraft that an executive agency uses, but does not operate or require 
to be operated under the Federal Aviation Regulations, safe for flight 
means a state of compliance with military specifications or the 
executive agency's own Flight Program Standards, and as approved, 
inspected, and certified by the agency.
    Senior Aviation Management Official means the person in an executive 
agency who will be the agency's primary member of the Interagency 
Committee for Aviation Policy (ICAP). This person must be of appropriate 
grade and position to represent the agency and promote flight safety and 
adherence to standards.
    Serviceable aircraft part means a part that is safe for flight, can 
fulfill its operational requirements, and is sufficiently documented to 
indicate that the part conforms to applicable standards/specifications.
    Suspected unapproved part means a non-military aircraft part, 
component, or material that any person suspects of not meeting the 
requirements of an ``approved part.'' Approved parts are those that are 
produced in compliance with the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 
part 21), are maintained in compliance with 14 CFR parts 43 and 91, and 
meet applicable design standards. A part, component, or material may be 
suspect because of its questionable finish, size, or color; improper (or 
lack of) identification; incomplete or altered paperwork; or any other 
questionable indication. See detailed guidance in FAA Advisory Circular 
21-29, ``Detecting and Reporting Suspected Unapproved Parts,'' available 
from FAA at http://www.faa.gov.
    Tail number (See registration mark).
    Traceable part means an aircraft part whose original equipment 
manufacturer or production approval holder can be identified by 
documentation, markings/characteristics on the part, or packaging of the 
part. Non-military parts are traceable if you can establish that the 
parts were manufactured under rules in 14 CFR part 21 or were previously 
determined to be airworthy under rules in 14 CFR part 43. Possible 
sources for making a traceability determination could be shipping 
tickets, bar codes, invoices, parts marking (e.g., PMA, TSO), data 
plates, serial/part numbers, manufacturing production numbers, 
maintenance records, work orders, etc.
    Training means instruction for flight program personnel to enable 
them to qualify initially for their positions and to maintain 
qualification for their positions over time.
    Travel Management Policy Division (MTT) means GSA's Office of 
Transportation and Personal Property, Office of Governmentwide Policy. 
MTT is responsible for publishing the Federal Travel Regulation (41 CFR 
chapters 300 through 304), which contains policy for management of 
travel of U.S. Government personnel and certain others. Contact the MTT 
staff at 1800 F Street, NW., Washington, DC 20405, Room G-219; (202) 
501-1538; see their Web site at http://www.gsa.gov/travelpolicy.
    Unsalvageable aircraft part means an aircraft part that cannot be 
restored to a condition that is safe for flight because of its age, its 
physical condition, a non-repairable defect, insufficient documentation, 
or its non-conformance with applicable standards/specifications.

                                Overview


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.45  What is a Government aircraft?

    A Government aircraft is one that is operated for the exclusive use 
of an executive agency and is a--
    (a) Federal aircraft, which an executive agency owns, bails, loans, 
or borrows; or
    (b) Commercial aircraft hired as commercial aviation services (CAS), 
which an executive agency--
    (1) Leases or lease-purchases with the intent to take title;
    (2) Charters or rents; or
    (3) Hires as part of a full service contract or an inter-service 
support agreement (ISSA).


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.50  Under what circumstances may we acquire Government 

aircraft?

    Your agency may acquire Government aircraft when you meet the 
requirements for operating an in-house aviation program contained in OMB 
Circular A-76, ``Performance of Commercial Activities,'' August 4, 1983 
(available from http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb), and when--
    (a) For Federal aircraft--
    (1) Aircraft are the optimum means of supporting your agency's 
official business;
    (2) You do not have aircraft that can support your agency's official 
business safely (i.e., in compliance with applicable safety standards 
and regulations) and cost-effectively;
    (3) No commercial or other Governmental source is available to 
provide aviation services safely (i.e., in compliance with applicable 
safety standards and regulations) and cost-effectively; and
    (4) Congress has specifically authorized your agency to purchase, 
lease, or transfer aircraft and to maintain and operate those aircraft 
(see 31 U.S.C. 1343).
    (b) For commercial aviation services (CAS)--
    (1) Aircraft are the optimum means of supporting your agency's 
official business; and
    (2) Using commercial aircraft and services is safe (i.e., conforms 
to applicable laws, safety standards, and regulations) and is more cost 
effective than using Federal aircraft, aircraft from any other 
Governmental source, or scheduled air carriers.


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.55  Are there restrictions on acquiring Government aircraft?

    Yes, you may not acquire--

your resources consistently with your agency's missions.

                  Establishing Flight Program Standards


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.140  What are Flight Program Standards?

    Flight Program Standards are standards specific to your agency's 
aviation operations, including your commercial aviation services (CAS) 
contracts. Your Flight Program Standards must meet the requirements in 
Sec. Sec. 102-33.155 through 102-33.185, and they must meet or exceed 
applicable civil or military rules. When civil or military rules do not 
apply, you must use risk management techniques to develop Flight Program 
Standards specifically for your program. In your standards, you must 
address all aspects of your program, e.g., uncertificated aircraft, 
high-risk operations, special personnel requirements, that may not be 
addressed under the rules for civil aircraft in the Federal Aviation 
Regulations (14 CFR chapter I). The requirements for Flight Program 
Standards in Sec. Sec. 102-33.155 through 102-33.185 incorporate and

    Yes, in addition to the Armed Forces and intelligence agencies, 
entities outside the executive branch of the Federal Government are 
exempt from establishing Flight Program Standards when using aircraft 
loaned to them by an executive agency (that is, owned by an executive 
agency, but operated by and on behalf of the loanee) unless the loanee--
    (a) Uses the aircraft to conduct official Government business; or

[[Page 54]]

    (b) Is required to follow Sec. Sec. 102-33.140 through 102-33.185 
under a Memorandum of Agreement governing the loan.


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.155  How must we establish Flight Program Standards?

    To establish Flight Program Standards, you must write, publish (as 
appropriate), implement, and comply with detailed, agency-specific 
standards, which establish or require (contractually, where applicable) 
policies and procedures for--
    (a) Management/administration of your flight program (in this part, 
``flight program'' includes CAS contracts);
    (b) Operation of your flight program;
    (c) Maintenance of your Government aircraft;
    (d) Training for your flight program personnel; and
    (e) Safety of your flight program.

                        Management/Administration

                               Operations


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.165  What standards must we establish or require 

(contractually, where applicable) for operation of our flight program?

    For operation of your flight program, you must establish or require 
(contractually, where applicable) the following:
    (a) Basic qualifications and currency requirements for your pilots 
and other crewmembers, maintenance personnel, and other mission-related 
personnel.
    (b) Limitations on duty time and flight time for pilots and other 
crewmembers.
    (c) Compliance with owning-agency or military safety of flight 
notices and operational bulletins.
    (d) Flight-following procedures to notify management and initiate 
search and rescue operations for lost or downed aircraft.
    (e) Dissemination, as your agency determines appropriate, of a 
disclosure statement to all crewmembers and qualified non-crewmembers 
who fly aboard your agency's Government aircraft, as follows:

   Disclosure Statement for Crewmembers and Qualified Non-Crewmembers 
     Flying on Board Government Aircraft Operated as Public Aircraft

    Generally, an aircraft used exclusively for the U.S. Government may 
be considered a ``public aircraft'' as defined in Public Law 106-181, 
provided it is not a Government-owned aircraft transporting passengers 
or operating for commercial purposes. A public aircraft is not subject 
to many Federal Aviation Regulations, including requirements relating to 
aircraft certification, maintenance, and pilot certification. If an 
agency transports passengers on a Government-owned aircraft or uses that 
aircraft for commercial purposes, the agency must comply with all 
Federal Aviation Regulations applicable to civil aircraft. If you have 
any questions concerning whether a particular flight will be a public 
aircraft operation or a civil aircraft operation, you should contact the 
agency sponsor of that flight.
    You have certain rights and benefits in the unlikely event you are 
injured or killed while working aboard a Government-owned or operated 
aircraft. Federal employees and some private citizens are eligible for 
workers' compensation benefits under the Federal Employees' Compensation 
Act (FECA). When FECA applies, it is the sole remedy. For more 
information about FECA and its coverage, consult with your agency's 
benefits

[[Page 55]]

office or contact the Branch of Technical Assistance at the Department 
of Labor's Office of Workers' Compensation Programs at (202) 693-0044.
    State or foreign laws may provide for product liability or ``third 
party'' causes of actions for personal injury or wrongful death. If you 
have questions about a particular case or believe you have a claim, you 
should consult with an attorney.
    Some insurance policies may exclude coverage for injuries or death 
sustained while working or traveling aboard a Government or military 
aircraft or while within a combat area. You may wish to check your 
policy or consult with your insurance provider before your flight. The 
insurance available to Federal employees through the Federal Employees 
Group Life Insurance Program does not contain an exclusion of this type.
    If you are the victim of an air disaster resulting from criminal 
activity, Victim and Witness Specialists from the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) and/or the local U.S. Attorney's Office will keep 
you or your family informed about the status of the criminal 
investigation(s) and provide you or your family with information about 
rights and services, such as crisis intervention, counseling and 
emotional support. State crime victim compensation may be able to cover 
crime-related expenses, such as medical costs, mental health counseling, 
funeral and burial costs, and lost wages or loss of support. The Office 
for Victims of Crime (an agency of the Department of Justice) and the 
U.S. Attorneys Office are authorized by the Antiterrorism Act of 1996 to 
provide emergency financial assistance to State programs for the benefit 
of victims of terrorist acts or mass violence.
    If you are a Federal employee. If you are injured or killed on the 
job during the performance of duty, including while traveling or working 
aboard a Government aircraft or other Government-owned or operated 
conveyance for official Government business purposes, you and your 
family are eligible to collect workers' compensation benefits under 
FECA. You and your family may not file a personal injury or wrongful 
death suit against the United States or its employees. However, you may 
have cause of action against potentially liable third parties.
    You or your qualifying family member must normally also choose 
between FECA disability or death benefits, and those payable under your 
retirement system (either the Civil Service Retirement System or the 
Federal Employees Retirement System). You may choose the benefit that is 
more favorable to you.
    If you are a private citizen not employed by the Federal government. 
Even if the Federal government does not regularly employ you, if you are 
rendering personal service to the Federal government on a voluntary 
basis or for nominal pay, you may be defined as a Federal employee for 
purposes of FECA. If that is the case, you and your family are eligible 
to receive workers' compensation benefits under FECA, but may not 
collect in a personal injury or wrongful death lawsuit against the 
United States or its employees. You and your family may file suit 
against potentially liable third parties. Before you board a Government 
aircraft, you may wish to consult with the department or agency 
sponsoring the flight to clarify whether you are considered a Federal 
employee.
    If the agency determines that you are not a ``Federal employee,'' 
you and your family will not be eligible to receive workers' 
compensation benefits under FECA. If you are onboard the aircraft for 
purposes of official Government business, you may be eligible for 
workman's compensation benefits under state law. If an accident occurs 
within the United States, or its territories, its airspace, or over the 
high seas, you and your family may claim against the United States under 
the Federal Tort Claims Act or Suits in Admiralty Act. If you are killed 
aboard a military aircraft, your family may be eligible to receive 
compensation under the Military Claims Act, or if you are an inhabitant 
of a foreign country, under the Foreign Claims Act.
    Note: This disclosure statement is not all-inclusive. You should 
contact your agency's personnel office, or if you are a private citizen, 
your agency sponsor or point-of-contact for further assistance.
    (f) At the origin of each flight, creation of a manifest containing 
the full names of all persons on board for each leg of flight, a point 
of contact for each person, and phone numbers for the points of contact.
    (g) Documentation of any changes in the manifest by leg, and 
retention of manifests for two years from the time of flight.
    (h) Procedures for reconciling flight manifests with persons 
actually on board and a method to test those procedures periodically.
    (i) At the origin of each flight, preparation of a complete weight 
and balance computation and a cargo-loading manifest, and retention of 
this computation and manifest for 30 days from the time of flight.
    (j) Appropriate emergency procedures and equipment for specific

             Accounting for the Cost of Government Aircraft


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.190  What are the aircraft operations and ownership costs 

for which we must account?

    You must account for the operations and ownership costs of your 
Government aircraft as described in the ``Government Aircraft Cost 
Accounting Guide'' (CAG), which follows OMB Circular A-126 and is 
available from GSA, Aircraft Management Policy Division (MTA), 1800 F 
Street, NW., Washington, DC 20405.


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.195  Do we need an automated system to account for aircraft

costs?

    If you own Federal aircraft or operate bailed Federal aircraft, you 
must maintain an automated system to account for aircraft costs by 
collecting the cost data elements required by the Federal Aviation 
Interactive Reporting System (FAIRS). The functional specifications and 
data definitions for a FAIRS-compliant system are described in the 
``Common Aviation Management Information Standard'' (C-AMIS), which is 
available from GSA, Aircraft Management Policy Division (MTA), 1800 F 
Street, NW., Washington, DC 20405. See Sec. Sec. 102-33.395 and 102-
33.460 for more information on FAIRS and C-AMIS. Agencies who use only 
CAS aircraft and do not have Federal aircraft must keep records adequate 
for reporting information through FAIRS, but are not required to have an 
automated system (see Sec. Sec. 102-33.435 and 102-33.440 for the 
information on CAS that you must report through FAIRS).


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.200  Must we periodically justify owning and operating

Federal 

aircraft?

    Yes, after you have held a Federal aircraft for five years, you must 
justify owning and operating the aircraft by reviewing your operations 
and establishing that you have a continuing need for the aircraft, as 
required in OMB Circular A-76. You must also establish the cost-
effectiveness of all your aircraft operations following OMB-approved 
cost justification methodologies, which are described in OMB Circular A-
76 every five years.


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.205  When we use our aircraft to support other executive 

agencies, must we recover the operating costs?

    (a) Under 31 U.S.C. 1535 and other statutes, you may be required to 
recover the costs of operating aircraft in support of other agencies. 
Depending on the statutory authorities under

[[Page 58]]

which you acquired and operate your aircraft, you will use either of two 
methods for establishing the rates charged for using your aircraft:
    (1) The variable cost recovery rate; or
    (2) The full cost recovery rate.
    (b) See the Government Aircraft CAG, which is available from GSA, 
Aircraft Management Policy Division (MTA), 1800 F Street, NW., 
Washington, DC 20405, for definitions of these terms.

              Accounting for the Use of Government Aircraft


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.210  How do we account for the use of our Government

aircraft?

    To account for the use of Government aircraft, you must document all 
flights and keep this documentation for two years after the date of the 
flight. For each flight, record the--
    (a) Aircraft's registration mark;
    (b) Owner and operator (e.g., the owner may not be the operator, as 
is the case when a CAS aircraft, owned commercially, is operated by U.S. 
Government personnel);
    (c) Purpose of the flight (i.e., the Governmental function that the 
aircraft was dispatched to perform);
    (d) Departure and destination points;
    (e) Flight date(s) and times;
    (f) A manifest (see Sec. Sec. 102-33.165(g) and (h)); and
    (g) Name(s) of the pilot(s) and crewmembers.


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.215  May we use Government aircraft to carry passengers?

    Yes, you may use Government aircraft to carry passengers with the 
following restrictions:
    (a) You may carry passengers only on aircraft that you operate or 
require contractually to be operated according to the rules and 
requirements in Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR chapter I).
    (b) For certain kinds of travel, your agency must justify 
passengers' presence on Government aircraft (see OMB Circular A-126 and 
the Government Aircraft Cost Accounting Guide (CAG) published by GSA for 
complete information on authorizing travel and analyzing costs before 
authorizing travel on Government aircraft).


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.220  What are the responsibilities of an agency's aviation 

program in justifying the use of a Government aircraft to transport 
passengers?

    (a) Upon request from an agency's travel approving authority, the 
agency's aviation program must provide cost estimates to assist in 
determining whether or not use of a Government aircraft to carry 
passengers is justified. See OMB Circular A-126 for more information on 
justifying travel on Government aircraft. See also the Government 
Aircraft Cost Accounting Guide (CAG) published by GSA (defined in Sec. 
102-33.20) for guidance on estimating the cost of using a Government 
aircraft. The cost of using a Government aircraft is--
    (1) The variable cost of using a Federal aircraft;
    (2) The amount your agency will be charged by a CAS provider; or
    (3) The variable cost of using an aircraft owned by another agency 
as reported by the owning agency if you are not charged for the use of 
the aircraft.
    (b) In weighing alternatives for travel on Government aircraft, you 
must also consider the following:
    (1) If no follow-on trip is scheduled, all time required positioning 
the aircraft to begin the trip and to return the aircraft to its normal 
base of operations.
    (2) If a follow-on trip requires repositioning, the cost for the 
repositioning should be charged to the associated follow-on trip.
    (3) If an aircraft supports a multi-leg trip (a series of flights 
scheduled sequentially), the use of the aircraft for the total trip may 
be justified by comparing the total variable cost of the entire trip to 
the commercial aircraft cost (including charter) for all legs of the 
trip.
    (4) The use of foreign aircraft as CAS is authorized when the agency 
has determined that an equivalent level of safety exists as compared to 
U.S. operations of a like kind. The safety of passengers shall be the 
overriding consideration for the selection of travel mode when comparing 
foreign sources of scheduled commercial airlines and CAS.

                         Managing Aircraft Parts


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.225  How must we manage aircraft parts?

    You must manage your aircraft parts by maintaining proper storage, 
protection, maintenance procedures, and records for the parts throughout 
their life cycles.


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.230  May we use military FSCAP on non-military FAA-type 

certificated Government aircraft?

    You may use dual-use military FSCAP on non-military aircraft 
operated under restricted or standard airworthiness certificates if the 
parts are inspected and approved for such installation by the FAA. See 
detailed guidance in FAA Advisory Circular 20-142, ``Eligibility and 
Evaluation of U.S. Military Surplus Flight Safety Critical Aircraft 
Parts, Engines, and Propellers.''


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.235  What documentation must we maintain for life-limited

parts and FSCAP?

    For life-limited parts and FSCAP, you must hold and update the 
documentation that accompanies these parts for as long as you use or 
store them. When you dispose of life-limited parts or FSCAP, the up-to-
date documentation must accompany the parts. (See Sec. 102-33.370.)


<R04>
      Subpart D_Disposing of Government Aircraft and Aircraft Parts

                                Overview


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.240  What must we consider before disposing of aircraft

and aircraft parts?

    Before disposing of aircraft and aircraft parts, you must first 
determine if the aircraft or parts are excess to your agency's mission 
requirements or if you will need replacements (i.e., your aircraft or 
parts are not excess), as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (a) If your aircraft/parts
           are ...                And ...               Then ...

                               your             approval from GSA to
                               mission(s).      deviate from part 102-39
                                                of this subchapter B.
                                                However, exchange/sale
                                                of aircraft parts is
                                                permitted.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.245  May we report as excess, or replace 

(i.e., by exchange/sale), both operational and non-operational 
aircraft?

    Yes, you may report as excess both operational and non-operational 
aircraft by following the rules governing excess property in part 102-36 
of this subchapter B. Exchange or sale of aircraft is prohibited by part 
102-39 of this subchapter B, so you will need approval from GSA to 
deviate from that part to replace operational or non-operational 
aircraft by exchange/sale. (See Sec. 102-33.275 for further guidance on 
this restriction).


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.250  May we report as excess, or replace, declassified 

aircraft?

    Yes, you may report as excess, or replace, a declassified aircraft 
(see Sec. Sec. 102-33.415 through 102-33.420 for information on 
declassifying aircraft). However, a declassified aircraft is no longer 
considered an aircraft, but may be considered as a group of aircraft 
parts or other property for ground use only. You must carry such 
``aircraft parts or other property'' on your property records under the 
appropriate Federal Supply Classification group(s) (e.g., miscellaneous 
property, but not as an

[[Page 60]]

``aircraft''). For disposal of the property remaining after 
declassification of an aircraft, you must follow the property disposal 
regulations in parts 102-36, 102-37, and 102-39 of this subchapter B.


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.255  Must we document FSCAP or life-limited parts 

installed on aircraft that we will report as excess or replace?

    Yes, you must comply with the documentation procedures described in 
Sec. 102-33.370 if your aircraft and/or engines contain FSCAP or life-
limited parts.


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.260  When we report as excess, or replace, an aircraft 

(including a declassified aircraft), must we report the change in 
inventory to the Federal Aviation Interactive Reporting System (FAIRS)?

    (a) Yes, when you report as excess, or replace, an aircraft, you 
must report the change in inventory to the Federal Aviation Interactive 
Reporting System (FAIRS). For complete information, see the ``FAIRS 
User's Manual,'' which is available from GSA, Aircraft Management Policy 
Division (MTA), 1800 F Street, NW., Washington, DC 20405.
    (b) Within 14 calendar days of the date you dispose of the aircraft, 
you must report--
    (1) The disposal method (e.g., reassignment, inter-agency transfer, 
donation, sale as surplus or scrap, declassification, or exchange/sale);
    (2) The disposal date; and
    (3) The identity and type of recipient (e.g., State, educational 
institution, executive agency, commercial vendor).

                  Reporting Excess Government Aircraft


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.265  What are our options if aircraft are excess to our

needs?

    If aircraft are excess to your needs, your options include first 
determining if any of your sub-agencies can use the aircraft. If so, you 
may reassign the aircraft within your agency. If not, you must report 
the aircraft as excess property to GSA (see parts 102-36 and 102-37 of 
this subchapter B). GSA will dispose of the property, giving priority 
first to transferring it to another Federal agency, next to donating it 
as surplus property, and finally to selling it to the public as surplus.


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.270  What is the process for reporting an excess aircraft?

    To report an excess aircraft, you must submit a Standard Form (SF) 
120, Report of Excess Personal Property (see Sec. 102-2.135 of this 
chapter), to GSA (Federal Supply Service (FSS) Region 9, 450 Golden Gate 
Ave., 9FBP, San Francisco, CA 94102-3434, (415) 522-3029). You may also 
report electronically to GSA's Federal Disposal System (FEDS). For 
information on reporting excess property electronically, contact the FSS 
Office of Transportation and Personal Property (FBP), 1941 Jefferson 
Davis Highway, Room 812, Arlington, VA 22202, (703) 305-7240.

               Replacing Aircraft Through Exchange or Sale


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.275  Are there restrictions on replacing aircraft by 

exchange or sale?

    Yes, because aircraft are on GSA's exchange/sale prohibited list 
(see part 102-39 of this subchapter B), you may not exchange or sell 
aircraft unless you obtain approval from GSA to deviate from part 102-39 
of this subchapter B (see Sec. 102-33.10 on how to request a 
deviation). In your letter of request to GSA, you must include the full 
details of your situation and the proposed transaction and certify 
that--
    (a) Your agency's mission is dependent upon receiving a replacement 
aircraft;
    (b) You will be replacing the aircraft with similar-type property 
(see Sec. 102-39.15 of this subchapter B for a definition of 
``similar'');
    (c) Your replacement will be on a one-for-one basis (you must 
request and justify a waiver from GSA, Aircraft Management Policy 
Division (MTA), 1800 F Street, NW., Washington, DC 20405, to deviate 
from the one-for-one rule); and
    (d) The exchange or sale meets all other requirements in part 102-39 
of this subchapter B.

    Note to Sec. 102-33.275: The requirement to get GSA's approval for 
an exchange/sale does not apply if a Federal statute specifically 
authorizes your agency to exchange or sell certain aircraft.

[[Page 61]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.280  What are our options if we need a replacement aircraft?

    If you need to replace an aircraft, and you have GSA's prior written 
approval for a deviation (see Sec. 102-33.275), your options include--
    (a) Negotiating and conducting an exchange transaction directly with 
an aircraft provider and obtaining credit toward the purchase of a 
replacement aircraft, following the procurement rules applicable to your 
agency; or
    (b) Selling the aircraft and using the proceeds to offset the cost 
of purchasing a replacement aircraft, following part 102-39 of this 
subchapter B. The GSA can conduct sales for you; contact GSA (Region 9) 
for more information.


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.285  Do we need to include any special disclaimers in our 

exchange/sale agreements for uncertificated aircraft or aircraft that 
we have operated as public aircraft (i.e., not in compliance with the 
Federal 
          Aviation Regulations, 14 CFR chapter I)?

    Yes, when you exchange or sell uncertificated aircraft or aircraft 
maintained as public aircraft, you must ensure that the exchange or 
sales offerings contain the following statement:

    Warning to purchasers/recipients. The aircraft you have purchased or 
received in an exchange may not be in compliance with applicable FAA 
requirements. You are solely responsible for bringing the aircraft into 
compliance with 14 CFR chapter I, or other applicable standards, by 
obtaining all necessary FAA inspections or modifications.


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.290  What other disclaimers must we include in our 

exchange/sale agreements for aircraft?

    When you exchange or sell aircraft, you must ensure that the 
following disclaimer is signed by the purchaser/recipient and received 
by the Government before releasing the aircraft to the purchaser/
recipient:

    The purchaser/recipient agrees that the Government shall not be 
liable for personal injuries to, disabilities of, or death of the 
purchaser/recipient, the purchaser's/recipient's employees, or to any 
other persons arising from or incident to the purchase of this aircraft, 
its use, or disposition. The purchaser/recipient shall hold the 
Government harmless from any or all debts, liabilities, judgments, 
costs, demands, suits, actions, or claims of any nature arising from or 
incident to purchase, use, or resale of this item.


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.295  May we exchange or sell an aircraft through 

reimbursable transfer to another executive agency?

    Yes, you may exchange or sell aircraft through reimbursable transfer 
to another executive agency if you have prior written approval from GSA 
to deviate from part 102-39 of this subchapter B (see Sec. 102-33.275). 
See part 102-39, subpart B, and part 102-36 of this subchapter B for 
more information on reimbursable transfer of property. Before offering 
to the public an aircraft that is eligible for exchange/sale, you should 
consult with other executive agencies to find out if any agency is 
interested in taking the aircraft for reimbursement in funds or in kind 
(as you are directed in part 102-39 of this subchapter B).

    Note to Sec. 102-33.295: Some agencies may also have special 
congressional authorization to recover costs.

                       Disposing of Aircraft Parts


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.300  What must we consider before disposing of aircraft

parts?

    Before disposing of aircraft parts, you must determine if they are 
excess to your agency's mission requirements or if you will need 
replacements (i.e., they are not excess). The table in Sec. 102-33.240 
shows the differences between excess and replacement parts.


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.305  May we report as excess, or replace, FSCAP and 

life-limited parts?

    Yes, you may report as excess, or replace, FSCAP and life-limited 
parts, but they require special handling. See the tables in Sec. 102-
33.370.


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.310  May we report as excess, or replace, unsalvageable

aircraft parts?

    No, you may not report unsalvageable aircraft parts as excess or 
exchange or sell them for replacements. You must mutilate unsalvageable 
parts. You may sell the mutilated parts only as scrap or report that 
scrap to GSA for sale.

[[Page 62]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.315  What are the procedures for mutilating unsalvageable

aircraft parts?

    To mutilate unsalvageable aircraft parts, you must--
    (a) Destroy the data plates, remove the serial/lot/part numbers, and 
cut, crush, grind, melt, burn, or use other means to prevent the parts 
from being misidentified or used as serviceable aircraft parts. See 
detailed guidance in the FAA's Advisory Circular 21-38, ``Disposition of 
Unsalvageable Aircraft Parts and Materials,'' available from the FAA. 
Call your regional FAA Flight Standards District Office for additional 
guidance;
    (b) Ensure that an authorized official of your agency witnesses and 
documents the mutilation; and
    (c) Retain a signed certification and statement of mutilation.


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.320  What must we do if we are unable to perform required 

mutilation of aircraft parts?

    If you are unable to perform the required mutilation of aircraft 
parts, you must turn in the parts to a Federal or federally approved 
facility for mutilation and proper disposition. Ensure that any 
contractor follows the provisions of Sec. 102-33.315 for mutilating and 
disposing of the parts.


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.325  What documentation must we furnish with excess/surplus

or replaced parts when they are transferred, donated, exchanged, or 
sold?

    When you transfer, donate, exchange, or sell excess/surplus or 
replaced parts, you must--
    (a) Furnish all applicable labels, tags, and historical and 
modification records for serviceable aircraft parts;
    (b) Mark mutilated parts as unsalvageable (mutilated parts may be 
sold only for scrap; see Sec. 102-33.315); and
    (c) Ensure that all available tags, labels, applicable historical 
data, life-histories, and maintenance records accompany FSCAP and life-
limited parts and that FSCAP criticality codes (see Sec. 102-33.375) 
are perpetuated on documentation (see Sec. 102-33.330 for additional 
requirements).

                     Reporting Excess Aircraft Parts


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.330  What must we do with aircraft parts that are excess 

to our needs?

    If you have aircraft parts that are excess to your needs, you must 
first determine if any of your sub-agencies can use the parts. If they 
can, you may reassign them within your agency. If they cannot, then you 
must report the excess parts to the GSA FSS Office in your region, using 
SF 120, Report of Excess Personal Property (see Sec. 102-2.135 of 
subchapter A of this chapter). When reporting excess FSCAP, you must 
include the manufacturer's name, date of manufacture, part number, 
serial number, and the appropriate Criticality Code on the SF 120. You 
may report electronically using the FEDS system. For information on 
reporting excess property electronically, contact the FSS Office of 
Transportation and Personal Property (FBP), 1941 Jefferson Davis 
Highway, Room 812, Arlington, VA 22202, (703) 305-7240. See parts 102-36 
and 102-37 of this subchapter B on disposing of excess property.


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.335  What are the receiving agency's responsibilities in 

the transfer or donation of aircraft parts?

    An agency that receives transferred or donated aircraft parts must:
    (a) Verify that all applicable labels and tags and historical and 
modification records are furnished with serviceable aircraft parts 
(i.e., parts that are intended for flight use). This requirement does 
not apply to parts for ground use only. See the tables at Sec. 102-
33.370.
    (b) Mutilate all transferred or donated parts that you discover to 
be unsalvageable, and dispose of them properly, following the procedures 
in Sec. 102-33.315.


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.340  What are GSA's responsibilities in disposing of 

excess and surplus aircraft parts?

    In disposing of excess aircraft parts, the GSA Federal Supply 
Service office in your region reviews your SF 120, Report of Excess 
Personal Property (see Sec. 102-2.135 of subchapter A of this chapter) 
for completeness and accuracy (of

[[Page 63]]

status, condition, and FSCAP and demilitarization codes if applicable) 
and ensures that the following certification is included on disposal 
documents (e.g., transfer orders or purchasers' receipts):

    Because of the critical nature of aircraft parts' failure and the 
resulting potential safety threat, recipients of aircraft parts must 
ensure that any parts installed on an aircraft meet applicable Federal 
Aviation Regulations and must obtain required certifications. GSA makes 
no representation as to a part's conformance with the Federal Aviation 
Administration's requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.345  What are a State agency's responsibilities in the 

donation of Federal Government aircraft parts?

    When a State agency accepts surplus Federal Government aircraft 
parts for donation, the agency must--
    (a) Review donation and transfer documents for completeness and 
accuracy, and ensure that the certification in Sec. 102-33.340 is 
included;
    (b) Ensure that when the donee determines the part to be 
unsalvageable, the donee mutilates the part following the procedures in 
Sec. 102-33.315; and
    (c) Ensure that the donee retains, maintains, and perpetuates all 
documentation for serviceable parts (i.e., parts intended for flight 
use).

            Replacing Aircraft Parts Through Exchange or Sale


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.350  Do we need approval from GSA to replace aircraft 

parts by exchange or sale?

    No, you don't need approval from GSA to replace parts by exchange or 
sale. However, you must follow the provisions of this subpart and part 
102-39 of this subchapter B. Replacement parts do not have to be for the 
same type or design of aircraft, but you must use the exchange allowance 
or sales proceeds to purchase aircraft parts to support your aviation 
program to meet the ``similarity'' requirement in part 102-39 of this 
subchapter B.


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.355  May we do a reimbursable transfer of parts with 

another executive agency?

    Yes, you may request that the Federal Supply Service office in your 
region approve a reimbursable transfer of aircraft parts under the 
exchange/sale authority in part 102-39 of this subchapter B to another 
executive agency as a way to receive parts in exchange or money to be 
used to purchase replacement parts.


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.360  What is the process for selling or exchanging 

aircraft parts for replacement?

    (a) You or your agent (e.g., another Federal agency or GSA, Federal 
Supply Service (FSS)) may transact an exchange or sale directly with a 
non-federal source or do a reimbursable transfer with another executive 
agency as long as you or your agent--
    (1) Follow the provisions in this part and in part 102-39 of this 
subchapter B.
    (2) Ensure that the applicable labels and tags, historical data and 
modification records accompany the parts at the time of sale, and that 
sales offerings on aircraft parts contain the following statement:

    Warning to purchasers/recipients. The parts you have purchased or 
received in an exchange may not be in compliance with applicable FAA 
requirements. You are solely responsible for bringing the parts into 
compliance with 14 CFR part 21 or other applicable standards, by 
obtaining all necessary FAA inspections or modifications.

    (3) Ensure that the following certification is signed by the 
purchaser/recipient and received by the Government before releasing 
parts to the purchaser/recipient:

    The purchaser/recipient agrees that the Government shall not be 
liable for personal injuries to, disabilities of, or death of the 
purchaser/recipient, the purchaser's/recipient's employees, or to any 
other persons arising from or incident to the purchase of this item, its 
use, or disposition. The purchaser/recipient shall hold the Government 
harmless from any or all debts, liabilities, judgments, costs, demands, 
suits, actions, or claims of any nature arising from or incident to 
purchase, use, or resale of this item.

    (b) GSA, Federal Supply Service (FSS), can conduct sales of aircraft 
parts for you. Contact your GSA Regional Office for more information.


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.365  Must we report exchange or sale of parts to FAIRS?

    No, you don't have to report exchange or sale of parts to FAIRS. 
However, you must keep records of the

[[Page 64]]

transactions, which GSA may request to see.

                         Federal Inventory Data


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.410  What are Federal inventory data?

    Federal inventory data include information on each of the 
operational and non-operational Federal aircraft that you own, bail, 
borrow, or loan. See the ``FAIRS User's Manual,'' published by GSA, 
Aircraft Management Policy Division (MTA), 1800 F Street, NW., 
Washington, DC 20405, for a complete listing and definitions of the 
FAIRS Federal inventory data elements.


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.415  When may we declassify an aircraft and remove it 

from our Federal aircraft inventory?

    When an aircraft is lost or destroyed, or is otherwise non-
operational and you want to retain it, you may declassify it and remove 
it from your Federal aircraft inventory. When you declassify an 
aircraft, you remove the data plate permanently, and the resulting 
``aircraft parts or other property'' are no longer considered an 
aircraft. See Sec. Sec. 102-33.415 through 102-33.420 for rules on 
declassifying aircraft, and see part 102-36 or 102-37 of this subchapter 
B on reporting declassified aircraft as excess.


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.420  How must we declassify an aircraft?

    To declassify an aircraft, you must--
    (a) Send a letter to GSA, Aircraft Management Policy Division (MTA), 
1800 F Street, NW., Washington, DC 20405, requesting approval to 
declassify the aircraft and stating that the aircraft is non-operational 
(which includes lost or destroyed). In this letter, identify the Federal 
Supply Classification (FSC) group(s) that the declassified aircraft/
parts will fall under if applicable, describe the condition of the 
aircraft (crash-damaged, unrecoverable, parts unavailable, etc.), and 
include photographs as appropriate.
    (b) Within 14 calendar days of receiving GSA's approval to 
declassify the aircraft--
    (1) Following applicable Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 
45.13), request approval from your local FAA Flight Standards District 
Office (FSDO) to remove the manufacturer's data plate;
    (2) Within 14 calendar days of receiving approval from FAA to remove 
the data plate, inform GSA (MTA) of FAA's approval, send the data plate 
by courier or registered mail to the FAA, as directed by your FSDO, and 
remove any Certificate of Airworthiness and the aircraft's registration 
form from the aircraft, complete the reverse side of the registration 
form, and send both documents to the FAA.
    (c) Delete the aircraft from your FAIRS inventory records and update 
your personal property records, deleting the declassified aircraft from 
the aircraft category and adding it to another Federal Supply 
Classification group or groups, as appropriate.

               Federal Aircraft Cost and Utilization Data


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.425  What Federal aircraft cost and utilization data must 

we report?

    You must report certain costs for each of your Federal aircraft and 
the number of hours that you flew each aircraft. In reporting the costs 
of your Federal aircraft, you must report both the amounts you paid as 
Federal costs, which are for services the Government provides, and the 
amounts you paid as commercial costs in support of your Federal 
aircraft. For a list and definitions of the Federal aircraft cost and 
utilization data elements, see the ``FAIRS User's Manual,'' which is 
available from GSA, Aircraft Management Policy Division (MTA), 1800 F 
Street, NW., Washington, DC 20405.


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.430  Who must report Federal aircraft cost and utilization

data?

    Executive agencies, except the Armed Forces and U.S. intelligence 
agencies, must report Federal cost and utilization data on all Federal 
aircraft. Agencies should report Federal cost and utilization data for 
loaned aircraft only if Federal money was expended on the aircraft.

      Commercial Aviation Services (CAS) Cost and Utilization Data


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.435  What CAS cost and utilization data must we report?

    You must report the costs and flying hours for each CAS aircraft you 
hire.

[[Page 68]]

You must also report the costs and contractual periods for related 
aviation services that you hire (i.e., by contract or through an inter-
service support agreement (ISSA)). Report related aviation services that 
you hire commercially in support of Federal aircraft as ``paid out'' 
Federal aircraft costs--do not report them as CAS. See the ``FAIRS 
User's Manual,'' available from GSA, Aircraft Management Policy Division 
(MTA), 1800 F Street, NW., Washington, DC 20405 for a complete 
description of the CAS data elements reportable to FAIRS.


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.440  Who must report CAS cost and utilization data?

    Executive agencies, except the Armed Forces and U.S. intelligence 
agencies, must report CAS cost and utilization data. You must report CAS 
cost and utilization data if your agency makes payments to--
    (a) Charter or rent aircraft;
    (b) Lease or lease-purchase aircraft;
    (c) Hire aircraft and related services through an ISSA or a full 
service contract; or
    (d) Obtain related aviation services through an ISSA or by contract 
except when you use the services in support of Federal aircraft.

                       Accident and Incident Data


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.445  What accident and incident data must we report?

    You must report within 14 calendar days to GSA, Aircraft Management 
Policy Division (MTA), 1800 F Street, NW., Washington, DC 20405, all 
aviation accidents and incidents that your agency is required to report 
to the NTSB. You may also report other incident information. The GSA and 
the ICAP will use the collected accident/incident information in 
conjunction with FAIRS' data, such as flying hours and missions, to 
calculate safety statistics for the Federal aviation community and to 
share safety lessons-learned.


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.450  How must we report accident and incident data?

    You must report accident and incident data through the ICAP Aviation 
Accident and Incident Reporting System (AAIRS), which is accessible from 
the Internet. Instructions for using the system and the data elements 
and definitions for accident/incident reporting are available through 
the system or from GSA, Aircraft Management Policy Division (MTA), 1800 
F Street, NW., Washington, DC 20405.

        Common Aviation Management Information Standard (C-AMIS)


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.455  What is C-AMIS?

    Common Aviation Management Information Standard (C-AMIS), jointly 
written by the ICAP and GSA and available from GSA, Aircraft Management 
Policy Division (MTA), 1800 F Street, NW., Washington, DC 20405, is a 
guide to assist agencies in developing or modernizing their internal 
aviation management information systems. C-AMIS includes standard 
specifications and data definitions related to Federal aviation 
operations.


<R05>
Sec. 102-33.460  What is our responsibility in relation to C-AMIS?

    If you use a management information system to provide data to FAIRS 
by batch upload, you are responsible for ensuring that your system is C-
AMIS-compliant. For more information on compliance with C-AMIS, contact 
GSA, Aircraft Management Policy Division (MTA), 1800 F Street, NW.,

[71 FR 27638, May 12, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 102-34.60  How do we calculate the average fuel economy for 

our fleet?

    (a) Due to the variety of motor vehicle configurations, you must 
take an average of all motor vehicles, by category (passenger 
automobiles or light truck) purchased and leased by your agency during 
the fiscal year. This calculation is the sum of passenger automobiles or 
light trucks that your executive agency purchases or leases from 
commercial sources divided by the sum of the fractions representing the 
number of motor vehicles of each category by model divided by the 
unadjusted city/highway mile-per-gallon ratings for that model, 
developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for each fiscal 
year. The EPA mile-per-gallon rating for each motor vehicle make, model, 
and model year may be obtained from the: General Services 
Administration, Attn: FFA, Washington, DC 20406.
    (b) An example follows:

    Light trucks: i. 600 light trucks acquired in a specific year. These 
are broken down into:
    A. 200 Six cylinder automatic transmission pick-up trucks, EPA 
rating: 24.3 mpg, plus
    B. 150 Six cylinder automatic transmission mini-vans, EPA rating 
24.8 mpg, plus
    C. 150 Eight cylinder automatic transmission pick-up trucks, EPA 
rating: 20.4 mpg, plus
    D. 100 Eight cylinder automatic transmission cargo vans, EPA rating: 
22.2 mpg.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR02NO99.009

    ii. Fleet average fuel economy for light trucks in this case is 23.0 
mpg.


<R05>
Sec. 102-34.65  How may we request an exemption from the fuel economy

standards?

    (a) You must submit your reasons for the exemption in a written 
request to the: Administrator of General Services, ATTN: MTV, 
Washington, DC 20405.
    (b) GSA will review the request and advise you of the determination 
within 30 days of receipt. Passenger automobiles and light trucks 
exempted under the provisions of this section

[[Page 74]]

must not be included in calculating your fleet average fuel economy.


<R05>
Sec. 102-34.70  How does GSA monitor the fuel economy of purchased 

and leased motor vehicles?

    (a) Executive agencies report to GSA their leases and purchases of 
passenger automobiles and light trucks. GSA keeps a master record of the 
miles per gallon for passenger automobiles and light trucks acquired by 
each agency during the fiscal year. GSA verifies that each agency's 
passenger automobile and light truck leases and purchases achieve the 
fleet average fuel economy for the applicable fiscal year, as required 
by Executive Order 12375.
    (b) The GSA Federal Vehicle Policy Division (MTV) issues information 
about the EPA miles-per-gallon ratings to executive agencies at the 
beginning of each fiscal year to help agencies with their acquisition 
plans.


<R05>
Sec. 102-34.75  How must we report fuel economy data for passenger 

automobiles and light trucks we purchase or commercially lease?

    (a) You must send copies or synopses of motor vehicle leases and 
purchases to GSA. Use the unadjusted combined city/highway mile-per-
gallon ratings for passenger automobiles and light trucks developed each 
fiscal year by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). All 
submissions for a fiscal year must reach GSA by December 1 of the next 
fiscal year. Submit the information as soon as possible after the 
purchase or effective date of each lease to the: General Services 
Administration, ATTN: MTV, Washington, DC 20405. Email: 
vehicle.policy@gsa.gov.
    (b) Include in your submission to GSA motor vehicles purchased or 
leased by your agency for use in any State, Commonwealth, territory or 
possession of the United States, and the District of Columbia.
    (c) Your submission to GSA must include:
    (1) Number of passenger automobiles and light trucks, by category.
    (2) Year.
    (3) Make.
    (4) Model.
    (5) Transmission type (if manual, number of forward speeds).
    (6) Cubic inch displacement of engine.
    (7) Fuel type (i.e., gasoline, diesel, or type of alternative fuel).
    (8) Monthly lease cost, if applicable.

    Note to Sec. 102-34.75: Do not include passenger automobile and 
light truck lease renewal options as new acquisition motor vehicle 
leases. Do not report passenger automobiles and light trucks exempted 
from fleet average fuel economy standards (see Sec. 102-34.50(b) and 
Sec. 102-34.65).


<R05>
Sec. 102-34.80  Do we report fuel economy data for passenger 

automobiles and light trucks purchased for our agency by the GSA 
Automotive Division?

    No. The GSA Automotive Division provides information for passenger 
automobiles and light trucks it purchases for agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 102-34.85  Do we have to submit a negative report if we don't 

purchase or lease any motor vehicles in a fiscal year?

    Yes, you must submit a negative report if you don't purchase or 
lease any motor vehicles in a fiscal year.


<R05>
Sec. 102-34.90  Are any motor vehicles exempted from these reporting

requirements?

    Yes. You do not need to report passenger automobiles and light 
trucks that are:
    (a) Purchased or leased for use outside any State, Commonwealth, 
territory or possession of the United States, or the District of 
Columbia.
    (b) Designed to perform combat-related missions for the U.S. Armed 
Forces.
    (c) Designed for use in law enforcement or emergency rescue work.


<R05>
Sec. 102-34.95  Does fleet average fuel economy reporting affect our 

acquisition plan?

    It may. If previous motor vehicle purchases and leases have caused 
your fleet to fail to meet the required fuel economy by the end of the 
fiscal year, GSA may encourage you to adjust future requests to meet 
fuel economy requirements.

[[Page 81]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-34.315  What forms do we use to transfer ownership when 

selling a motor vehicle?

    Use the following forms to transfer ownership:
    (a) Standard Form 97, The United States Government Certificate to 
Obtain Title to a Motor Vehicle, if both of the following apply:
    (1) The motor vehicle will be retitled by a State, Commonwealth, 
territory or possession of the United States or the District of 
Columbia; and
    (2) The purchaser intends to operate the motor vehicle on highways.

    Note to Sec. 102-34.315(a)(2): Do not use Standard Form (SF) 97 if 
the Government-owned motor vehicle is either not designed or not legal 
for operation on highways. Examples are construction equipment, farm 
machinery, and certain military-design motor vehicles and motor vehicles 
that are damaged beyond repair in crashes and intended to be sold as 
salvage only. Instead, use an appropriate bill of sale or award 
document. Examples are Optional Form 16, Sales Slip-Sale of Government 
Personal Property, and Standard Form 114, Sale of Government Property--
Bid and Award.

    (b) Standard Form 97 is optional in foreign countries because 
foreign governments may require the use of other forms.

    Note to Sec. 102-34.315: The original Standard Form 97 is printed 
on secure paper to identify readily any attempt to alter the form. The 
form is also pre-numbered to prevent duplicates. State motor vehicle

    (b) A Government agency fueling facility; or
    (c) Personal funds and obtaining reimbursement from your agency.


<R05>
Sec. 102-34.330  What Government-issued charge cards may I use to 

purchase fuel and motor vehicle related services?

    (a) You may use a fleet charge card specifically issued for this 
purpose. These cards are designed to collect motor vehicle data at the 
time of purchase. Where appropriate, State sales and motor fuel taxes 
are deducted from fuel purchases by the fleet charge card services 
contractor before your agency is billed. The GSA contractor issued fleet 
charge card is the only Government-issued charge card that may be used 
for GSA Fleet motor vehicles. For further information on acquiring these 
fleet charge cards and their use, contact the: General Services 
Administration, Attn: FCX, Washington, DC 20406.
    (b) You may use a Government purchase card if you do not have a 
fleet charge card or if the use of such a government purchase card is 
required by your agency mission. However, the Government purchase card 
does not collect motor vehicle data nor does it deduct State sales and 
motor fuel taxes.

    Note to Sec. 102-34.330: OMB Circular A-123, Appendix B, contains 
additional specific guidance on the management, issuance, and usage of 
Government charge cards. The Appendix B guidance consolidates and 
updates current Governmentwide charge card program requirements and 
guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget, General Services 
Administration, Department of the Treasury, and other Federal agencies. 
Appendix B provides a single document to incorporate changes, new 
guidance, or amendments to existing guidance, and establishes minimum 
requirements and suggested best

              Subpart I_Federal Motor Vehicle Fleet Report


<R05>
Sec. 102-34.345  What is the Federal Fleet Report?

    The Federal Fleet Report (FFR) is an annual summary of Federal fleet 
statistics based upon fleet composition at the end of each fiscal year 
and vehicle use and cost during the fiscal year. The FFR is compiled by 
the General Services Administration (GSA) from information submitted by 
Federal agencies. The FFR is designed to provide essential statistical 
data for worldwide Federal motor vehicle fleet operations. Review of the 
report assists Government agencies, including GSA, in evaluating the 
effectiveness of the operation and management of individual fleets to 
determine whether vehicles are being utilized properly and to identify 
high cost areas where fleet expenses can be reduced. The FFR is posted 
on the GSA, Federal Vehicle Policy Division Internet website (http://
www.gsa.gov/vehiclepolicy).

[71 FR 27639, May 12, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 102-34.346  How do I submit information to the General Services

Administration (GSA) for the Federal Fleet Report (FFR)?

    (a) Annually, agencies must submit to the General Services 
Administration (GSA) the information needed to produce the Federal Fleet 
Report (FFR) through the electronic Standard Form (SF) 82, Agency Report 
of Motor Vehicle Data. Agencies must use the Federal Automotive 
Statistical Tool (FAST), an Internet-based reporting tool, to report 
required information to GSA. To find out how to submit motor vehicle 
data to GSA through FAST, go to http://fastweb.inel.gov/.
    (b) Specific reporting categories, by agency, included in the FFR 
are--
    (1) Inventory;
    (2) Acquisitions;
    (3) Operating costs;
    (4) Miles traveled; and
    (5) Fuel used.
    Note to Sec. 102-34.346: The FAST system is also used by agency 
Fleet Managers to provide the Department of Energy with information 
required by the Energy Policy Act and Executive Order 13149. In 
addition, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requires agency 
Fleet Managers and budget officers to submit annual agency motor vehicle 
budgeting information to OMB through FAST. (See OMB Circular A-11, 
Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget.)

[71 FR 27639, May 12, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 102-34.347  Do we need a fleet management information system?

    Yes, you must have a fleet management information system that--
    (a) Identifies and collects accurate inventory, cost, and use data;
    (b) Provides the information necessary to satisfy both internal and 
external reporting requirements;
    (c) Collects all costs incurred in the operation, maintenance, 
acquisition, and disposition of motor vehicles used for official 
purposes; and
    (d) Is capable of providing the data required for external 
reporting, such as FAST (see Sec. 102-34.346).

<R05>
Sec. 102-34.350  What records do we need to keep?

    For owned motor vehicles, you are responsible for developing 
adequate accounting and reporting procedures to ensure accurate 
reporting of inventory, cost, and operational data needed to manage and 
control motor vehicles.


<R05>
Sec. 102-34.355  When and how do we report motor vehicle data?

    (a) Within 75 calendar days after the end of the fiscal year, use 
Standard Form 82, Agency Report of Motor Vehicle Data, to report motor 
vehicle inventory, cost, and operating information. Send the Standard 
Form 82 to the: General Services Administration, Attn: MTV, Washington, 
DC 20405. Email: vehicle.policy@gsa.gov
    (b) Use separate forms to report data for domestic and foreign 
fleets.
    (1) For motor vehicles lent to another agency during the reporting 
period, the owning agency reports all data.
    (2) For motor vehicles transferred from one owning agency to 
another, each agency reports data for the time it retained 
accountability.
    (c) Detailed instructions are included as part of the form. You can 
also complete the Standard Form 82 electronically using a computerized 
input medium. For further information, contact the: General Services

<R05>
Sec. 102-35.5  What is the scope of the General Services 

Administration's regulations on the disposal of personal property?

    The General Services Administration's personal property disposal 
regulations are contained in this part and in parts 102-36 through 102-
42 of this subchapter B as well as in parts 101-42 and 101-45 of the 
Federal Property Management Regulations (FPMR)(41 CFR parts 101-42 and 
101-45). With two exceptions, these regulations cover the disposal of 
personal property under the custody and control of executive agencies 
located in the United States, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, 
Guam, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Federated States of 
Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau. The exceptions to this 
coverage are part 102-39 of this subchapter B, which applies to the 
replacement of all property owned by executive agencies worldwide using 
the exchange/sale authority, and Sec. Sec. 102-36.380 through 102-
36.400, which apply to the disposal of excess property located in 
countries and areas not listed in this subpart, i.e., foreign excess 
personal property. The legislative and judicial branches are encouraged 
to follow these provisions for property in their custody and control.


<R05>
Sec. 102-35.10  How are these regulations for the disposal of

personal property organized?

    The General Services Administration (GSA) has divided its 
regulations for the disposal of personal property into the following 
program areas:
    (a) Disposition of excess personal property (part 102-36 of this 
subchapter B).
    (b) Donation of surplus personal property (part 102-37 of this 
subchapter B).
    (c) Sale of surplus personal property (part 102-38 of this 
subchapter B).

[[Page 84]]

    (d) Replacement of personal property pursuant to the exchange/sale 
authority (part 102-39 of this subchapter B).
    (e) Disposition of seized and forfeited, voluntarily abandoned, and 
unclaimed personal property (part 102-41 of this subchapter B).
    (f) Utilization, donation, and disposal of foreign gifts and 
decorations (part 102-42 of this subchapter B).
    (g) Utilization and disposal of hazardous materials and certain 
categories of property (part 101-42 of the Federal Property Management 
Regulations (FPMR), 41 CFR part 101-42).


<R05>
Sec. 102-35.15  What are the goals of GSA's personal property

regulations?

    The goals of GSA's personal property regulations are to:
    (a) Improve the identification and reporting of excess personal 
property;
    (b) Maximize the use of excess property as the first source of 
supply to minimize expenditures for the purchase of new property, when 
practicable;
    Note to Sec. 102-35.15(b): If there are competing requests among 
Federal agencies for excess property, preference will be given to 
agencies where the transfer will avoid a new Federal procurement. A 
transfer to an agency where the agency will provide the property to a 
non-Federal entity for the non-Federal entity's use will be secondary to 
Federal use.
    (c) Achieve maximum public benefit from the use of Government 
property through the donation of surplus personal property to State and 
local public agencies and other eligible non-Federal recipients;
    (d) Obtain the optimum monetary return to the Government for surplus 
personal property sold and personal property sold under the exchange/
sale authority; and
    (e) Reduce management and inventory costs by appropriate use of the 
abandonment/destruction authority to dispose of unneeded personal 
property that has no commercial value or for which the estimated cost of 
continued care and handling would exceed the estimated sales proceeds 
(see FMR Sec. Sec. 102-36.305 through 102-36.330).


<R05>
Sec. 102-35.20  What definitions apply to GSA's personal property 

regulations?

    The following are definitions of, or cross-references to, some key 
terms that apply to GSA's personal property regulations in the FMR (CFR 
Parts 102-36 through 102-42). Other personal property terms are defined 
in the sections or parts to which they primarily apply.
    Accountable Personal Property includes nonexpendable personal 
property whose expected useful life is two years or longer and whose 
acquisition value, as determined by the agency, warrants tracking in the 
agency's property records, including capitalized and sensitive personal 
property.
    Accountability means the ability to account for personal property by 
providing a complete audit trail for property transactions from receipt 
to final disposition.
    Acquisition cost means the original purchase price of an item.
    Capitalized Personal Property includes property that is entered on 
the agency's general ledger records as a major investment or asset. An 
agency must determine its capitalization thresholds as discussed in 
Financial Accounting Standard Advisory Board (FASAB) Statement of 
Federal Financial Accounting Standards No. 6 Accounting for Property, 
Plant and Equipment, Chapter 1, paragraph 13.
    Control means the ongoing function of maintaining physical oversight 
and surveillance of personal property throughout its complete life cycle 
using various property management tools and techniques taking into 
account the environment in which the property is located and its 
vulnerability to theft, waste, fraud, or abuse.
    Excess personal property (see Sec. 102-36.40 of this subchapter B).
    Exchange/sale (see Sec. 102-39.20 of this subchapter B).
    Executive agency (see Sec. 102-36.40 of this subchapter B).
    Federal agency (see Sec. 102-36.40 of this subchapter B).
    Foreign gifts and decorations (for the definition of relevant terms, 
see Sec. 102-42.10 of this subchapter B).
    Forfeited property (see Sec. 102-41.20 of this subchapter B).

[[Page 85]]

    Inventory includes a formal listing of all accountable property 
items assigned to an agency, along with a formal process to verify the 
condition, location, and quantity of such items. This term may also be 
used as a verb to indicate the actions leading to the development of a 
listing. In this sense, an inventory must be conducted using an actual 
physical count, electronic means, and/or statistical methods.
    National property management officer means an official, designated 
in accordance with Sec. 102-36.45(b) of this subchapter B, who is 
responsible for ensuring effective acquisition, use, and disposal of 
excess property within your agency.
    Personal property (see Sec. 102-36.40 of this subchapter B).
    Property management means the system of acquiring, maintaining, 
using and disposing of the personal property of an organization or 
entity.
    Seized property means personal property that has been confiscated by 
a Federal agency, and whose care and handling will be the responsibility 
of that agency until final ownership is determined by the judicial 
process.
    Sensitive Personal Property includes all items, regardless of value, 
that require special control and accountability due to unusual rates of 
loss, theft or misuse, or due to national security or export control 
considerations. Such property includes weapons, ammunition, explosives, 
information technology equipment with memory capability, cameras, and 
communications equipment. These classifications do not preclude agencies 
from specifying additional personal property classifications to 
effectively manage their programs.
    Surplus personal property (see Sec. 102-37.25 of this subchapter 
B).
    Utilization means the identification, reporting, and transfer of 
excess personal property among Federal agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 102-35.25  What management reports must we provide?

    (a) There are three reports that must be provided. The report 
summarizing the property provided to non-Federal recipients and the 
report summarizing exchange/sale transactions (see Sec. Sec. 102-36.295 
and 102-39.75 respectively of this subchapter B) must be provided every 
year (negative reports are required). In addition, if you conduct 
negotiated sales of surplus personal property valued over $5,000 in any 
year, you must report this transaction in accordance with Sec. 102-
38.115 (negative reports are not required for this report).
    (b) The General Services Administration (GSA) may request other 
reports as authorized by 40 U.S.C. 506(a)(1)(A).


<R05>
Sec. 102-35.30  What actions must I take or am I authorized to take 

regardless of the property disposition method?

    Regardless of the disposition method used:
    (a) You must maintain property in a safe, secure, and cost-effective 
manner until final disposition.
    (b) You have authority to use the abandonment/ destruction 
provisions at any stage of the disposal process (see Sec. Sec. 102-
36.305 through 102-36.330 and Sec. 102-38.70 of this subchapter B).
    (c) You must implement policies and procedures to remove sensitive 
or classified information from property prior to disposal. Agency-
affixed markings should be removed, if at all possible, prior to 
personal property permanently leaving your agency's control.
    (d) Government-owned personal property may only be used as 
authorized by your agency. Title to Government-owned personal property 
cannot be transferred to a non-Federal entity unless through official 
procedures specifically authorized by law.

    Personal property is excess when it is no longer needed by the 
activities

[[Page 89]]

within your agency to carry out the functions of official programs, as 
determined by the agency head or designee.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.35  What is the typical process for disposing of excess

personal property?

    (a) You must ensure personal property not needed by your activity is 
offered for use elsewhere within your agency. If the property is no 
longer needed by any activity within your agency, your agency declares 
the property excess and reports it to GSA for possible transfer to 
eligible recipients, including federal agencies for direct use or for 
use by their contractors, project grantees, or cooperative agreement 
recipients. All executive agencies must, to the maximum extent 
practicable, fill requirements for personal property by using existing 
agency property or by obtaining excess property from other federal 
agencies in lieu of new procurements.
    (b) If GSA determines that there are no federal requirements for 
your excess personal property, it becomes surplus property and is 
available for donation to state and local public agencies and other 
eligible non-federal activities. Title 40 of the United States Code 
requires that surplus personal property be distributed to eligible 
recipients by an agency established by each State for this purpose, the 
State Agency for Surplus Property.
    (c) Surplus personal property not selected for donation is offered 
for sale to the public by competitive offerings such as sealed bid 
sales, spot bid sales, or auctions. You may conduct or contract for the 
sale of your surplus personal property, or have GSA or another executive 
agency conduct the sale on behalf of your agency in accordance with part 
102-38 of this chapter. You must inform GSA at the time the property is 
reported as excess if you do not want GSA to conduct the sale for you.
    (d) If a written determination is made that the property has no 
commercial value or the estimated cost of its continued care and 
handling would exceed the estimated proceeds from its sale, you may 
dispose of the property by abandonment or destruction, or donate it to 
public bodies.

sell or trade for other assets.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.75  Do we pay for excess personal property we acquire from

another federal agency under a transfer?

    (a) No, except for the situations listed in paragraph (b) of this 
section, you do not pay for the property. However, you are responsible 
for shipping and transportation costs. Where applicable, you may also be 
required to pay packing, loading, and any costs directly related to the 
dismantling of the property when required for the purpose of 
transporting the property.
    (b) You may be required to reimburse the holding agency for excess 
personal property transferred to you (i.e., transfer with reimbursement) 
when:
    (1) Reimbursement is directed by GSA.
    (2) The property was originally acquired with funds not appropriated 
from the general fund of the Treasury or appropriated therefrom but by 
law reimbursable from assessment, tax, or other revenue and the holding 
agency requests reimbursement. It is executive branch policy that 
working capital fund property shall be transferred without 
reimbursement.
    (3) The property was acquired with appropriated funds, but 
reimbursement is required or authorized by law.
    (4) You or the holding agency is the U.S. Postal Service (USPS).
    (5) You are acquiring excess personal property for use by a project 
grantee that is a public agency or a nonprofit organization and exempt 
from taxation under 26 U.S.C. 501.
    (6) You or the holding agency is the DC Government.
    (7) You or the holding agency is a wholly owned or mixed-ownership 
government corporation as defined in the Government Corporation Control 
Act (31 U.S.C. 9101-9110).


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.80  How much do we pay for excess personal property on a 

transfer with reimbursement?

    (a) You may be required to reimburse the holding agency the fair 
market value when the transfer involves any of the conditions in Sec. 
102-36.75(b)(1) through (b)(4).
    (b) When acquiring excess personal property for your project 
grantees (Sec. 102-36.75(b)(5)), you are required to deposit into the 
miscellaneous receipts fund of the U.S. Treasury an amount equal to 25 
percent of the original acquisition cost of the property, except for 
transfers under the conditions cited in Sec. 102-36.190.
    (c) When you or the holding agency is the DC Government or a wholly 
owned or mixed-ownership Government corporation (Sec. 102-36.75(b)(6)

agency using fair value reimbursement. Fair value reimbursement is 20 
percent of the original acquisition cost for new or unused property 
(i.e., condition code 1), and zero percent for other personal property. 
Where circumstances warrant, a higher fair value may be used if the 
agencies concerned agree. Due to special circumstances or the unusual 
nature of the property, the holding agency may use other criteria for 
establishing fair value if approved or directed by GSA. You must refer 
any disagreements to the appropriate regional GSA Personal Property 
Management office.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.85  Do we pay for personal property we acquire when it 

is disposed of by another agency under the exchange/sale authority,

<R05>
Sec. 102-36.130  What are our responsibilities in processing transfer

orders of excess personal property?

    Whether the excess is for your use or for use by a non-federal 
recipient that you sponsor, you must:
    (a) Ensure that only authorized federal officials of your agency 
sign the SF 122 prior to submission to GSA for approval.
    (b) Ensure that excess personal property approved for transfer is 
used for authorized official purpose(s).
    (c) Advise GSA of names of agency officials that are authorized to

<R05>
Sec. 102-36.135  How much time do we have to pick up excess personal

property that has been approved for transfer?

    When the holding agency notifies you that the property is ready for 
removal, you normally have 15 calendar days to pick up the property, 
unless otherwise coordinated with the holding agency.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.140  May we arrange to have the excess personal property 

shipped to its final destination?

    Yes, when the holding agency agrees to provide assistance in 
preparing the property for shipping. You may be required to pay the 
holding agency any direct costs in preparing the property for shipment. 
You must provide shipping instructions and the appropriate fund code for 
billing purposes on the SF 122.

                            Direct Transfers


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.145  May we obtain excess personal property directly from

another Federal agency without GSA approval?

    Yes, but only under the following situations:
    (a) You may obtain excess personal property that has not yet been 
reported to GSA, provided the total acquisition cost of the excess 
property does not exceed $10,000 per line item. You must ensure that a 
SF 122 is completed for the direct transfer and that

[[Page 96]]

an authorized official of your agency signs the SF 122. You must provide 
a copy of the SF 122 to the appropriate regional GSA office within 10 
workdays from the date of the transaction.
    (b) You may obtain excess personal property exceeding the $10,000 
per line item limitation, provided you first contact the appropriate

a prearranged transfer. You must annotate the SF 122 with the name of 
the GSA approving official and the date of the verbal approval, and 
provide a copy of the SF 122 to GSA within 10 workdays from the date of 
transaction.
    (c) You are subject to the requirement to pay reimbursement for the 
excess personal property under a direct transfer when any of the

<R04>
 Subpart C_Acquiring Excess Personal Property for Non-Federal Recipients


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.150  For which non-federal activities may we acquire excess

personal property?

    Under the Property Act you may acquire and furnish excess personal 
property for use by your non-appropriated fund activities, contractors, 
cooperatives, and project grantees. You may acquire and furnish excess 
personal property for use by other eligible recipients only when you 
have specific statutory authority to do so.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.155  What are our responsibilities when acquiring excess 

personal property for use by a non-federal recipient?

    When acquiring excess personal property for use by a non-federal 
recipient, your authorized agency official must:
    (a) Ensure the use of excess personal property by the non-federal 
recipient is authorized and complies with applicable federal regulations 
and agency guidelines.
    (b) Determine that the use of excess personal property will reduce 
the costs to the government and/or that it is in the government's best 
interest to furnish excess personal property.
    (c) Review and approve transfer documents for excess personal 
property as the sponsoring Federal agency.
    (d) Ensure the non-federal recipient is aware of his obligations 
under the FMR and your agency regulations regarding the management of 
excess personal property.
    (e) Ensure the non-federal recipient does not stockpile the property 
but places the property into use within a reasonable period of time, and 
has a system to prevent nonuse, improper use, or unauthorized disposal 
or destruction of excess personal property furnished.
    (f) Establish provisions and procedures for property accountability 
and disposition in situations when the government retains title.
    (g) Report annually to GSA excess personal property furnished to 
non-federal recipients during the year (see Sec. 102-36.295).


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.160  What additional information must we provide on the

SF 122 when acquiring excess personal property for non-federal 
recipients?

    Annotate on the SF 122, the name of the non-federal recipient and 
the contract, grant or agreement number, when applicable, and the 
scheduled completion/expiration date of the contract, grant or 
agreement. If the remaining time prior to the expiration date is less 
than 60 calendar days, you must certify that the contract, grant or 
agreement will be extended or renewed or provide other written 
justification for the transfer.

                    Non-appropriated Fund Activities


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.165  Do we retain title to excess personal property 

furnished to a non-appropriated fund activity within our agency?

    Yes, title to excess personal property furnished to a non-
appropriated fund activity remains with the Federal Government and you 
are accountable for establishing controls over the use of such excess 
property in accordance with Sec. 102-36.45(d). When such property

[[Page 97]]

is no longer required by the non-appropriated fund activity, you must 
reuse or dispose of the property in accordance with this part.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.170  May we transfer personal property owned by one of

our non-appropriated fund activities?

    Property purchased by a non-appropriated fund activity is not 
federal property. A non-appropriated fund activity has the option of 
making its privately owned personal property available for transfer to a 
federal agency, usually with reimbursement. If such reimbursable 
personal property is not transferred to another federal agency, it may 
be offered for sale. Such property is not available for donation.

[65 FR 31218, May 16, 2000, as amended at 65 FR 33778, May 25, 2000]

                               Contractors


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.175  Are there restrictions to acquiring excess personal

property for use by our contractors?

    Yes, you may acquire and furnish excess personal property for use by 
your contractors subject to the criteria and restrictions in the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR part 45). When such property is no longer 
needed by your contractors or your agency, you must dispose of the 
excess personal property in accordance with the provisions of this part.

                              Cooperatives


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.180  Is there any limitation/condition to acquiring excess

personal property for use by cooperatives?

    Yes, you must limit the total dollar amount of property transfers 
(in terms of original acquisition cost) to the dollar value of the 
cooperative agreement. For any transfers in excess of such amount, you 
must ensure that an official of your agency at a level higher than the 
officer administering the agreement approves the transfer. The federal 
government retains title to such property, except when provided by 
specific statutory authority.

                            Project Grantees


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.185  What are the requirements for acquiring excess 

personal property for use by our grantees?

    You may furnish excess personal property for use by your grantees 
only when:
    (a) The grantee holds a federally sponsored project grant;
    (b) The grantee is a public agency or a nonprofit tax-exempt 
organization under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 
U.S.C. 501);
    (c) The property is for use in connection with the grant; and
    (d) You pay 25 percent of the original acquisition cost of the 
excess personal property, such funds to be deposited into the 
miscellaneous receipts fund of the U.S. Treasury. Exceptions to paying 
this 25 percent are provided in Sec. 102-36.190. Title to property 
vests in the grantee when your agency pays 25 percent of the original 
acquisition cost.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.190  Must we always pay 25 percent of the original

acquisition cost when furnishing excess personal property to project
grantees?

    No, you may acquire excess personal property for use by a project 
grantee without paying the 25 percent fee when any of the following 
conditions apply:
    (a) The personal property was originally acquired from excess 
sources by your agency and has been placed into official use by your 
agency for at least one year. The federal government retains title to 
such property.
    (b) The property is furnished under section 203 of the Department of 
Agriculture Organic Act of 1944 (16 U.S.C. 580a) through the U.S. Forest 
Service in connection with cooperative state forest fire control 
programs. The federal government retains title to such property.
    (c) The property is furnished by the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
to state or county extension services or agricultural research 
cooperatives under 40 U.S.C. 483(d)(2)(E). The federal government 
retains title to such property.
    (d) The property is not needed for donation under part 102-37 of 
this chapter, and is transferred under section 608 of the Foreign 
Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (22 U.S.C. 2358). Title to

[[Page 98]]

such property transfers to the grantee. (You need not wait until after 
the donation screening period when furnishing excess personal property 
to recipients under the Agency for International Development (AID) 
Development Loan Program.)
    (e) The property is scientific equipment transferred under section 
11(e) of the National Science Foundation (NSF) Act of 1950, as amended 
(42 U.S.C. 1870(e)). GSA will limit such transfers to property within 
Federal Supply Classification (FSC) groups 12, 14, 43, 48, 58, 59, 65, 
66, 67, 68 and 70. GSA may approve transfers without reimbursement for 
property under other FSC groups when NSF certifies the item is a 
component of or related to a piece of scientific equipment or is a 
difficult-to-acquire item needed for scientific research. Regardless of 
FSC, GSA will not approve transfers of common-use or general-purpose 
items without reimbursement. Title to such property transfers to the 
grantee.
    (f) The property is furnished in connection with grants to Indian 
tribes, as defined in section 3(c) of the Indian Financing Act (24 
U.S.C. 1452(c)). Title passage is determined under the authorities of 
the administering agency.

[65 FR 31218, May 16, 2000, as amended at 71 FR 53572, Sept. 12, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.195  What type of excess personal property may we furnish 

to our project grantees?

    You may furnish to your project grantees any property, except for 
consumable items, determined to be necessary and usable for the purpose 
of the grant. Consumable items are generally not transferable to project 
grantees. GSA may approve transfers of excess consumable items when 
adequate justification for the transfer accompanies such requests. For 
the purpose of this section, ``consumable items'' are items which are 
intended for one-time use and are actually consumed in that one time; 
e.g., drugs, medicines, surgical dressings, cleaning and preserving 
materials, and fuels.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.200  May we acquire excess personal property for 

cannibalization purposes by the grantees?

    Yes, subject to GSA approval, you may acquire excess personal 
property for cannibalization purposes. You may be required to provide a 
supporting statement that indicates disassembly of the item for 
secondary use has greater benefit than utilization of the item in its 
existing form and cost savings to the government will result.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.205  Is there a limit to how much excess personal

property we may furnish to our grantees?

    Yes, you must monitor transfers of excess personal property so the 
total dollar amount of property transferred (in original acquisition 
cost) does not exceed the dollar value of the grant. Any transfers above 
the grant amount must be approved by an official at an administrative 
level higher than the officer administering the grant.


<R04>
            Subpart D_Disposition of Excess Personal Property


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.210  Why must we report excess personal property to GSA?

    You must report excess personal property to promote reuse by the 
government to enable federal agencies to benefit from the continued use 
of property already paid for with taxpayers' money, thus minimizing new 
procurement costs. Reporting excess personal property to GSA helps 
assure that the information on available excess personal property is 
accessible and disseminated to the widest range of reuse customers.

                   Reporting Excess Personal Property


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.215  How do we report excess personal property?

    Report excess personal property as follows:

paragraph (b) of this section. Report all excess personal property, 
including excess personal property to which the government holds title 
but is in the custody of your contractors, cooperatives, or project 
grantees.

    (6) Trading stamps and bonus goods.
    (7) Hazardous waste.
    (8) Controlled substances.
    (9) Nuclear Regulatory Commission-controlled materials.
    (10) Property dangerous to public health and safety.
    (11) Classified items or property determined to be sensitive for 
reasons of national security.

of Real Property, GSA, in accordance with part 102-75 of this chapter.

[65 FR 31218, May 16, 2000, as amended at 71 FR 53572, Sept. 12, 2006]


<R05>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

                  Disposing of Excess Personal Property


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.245  Are we accountable for the personal property that has

been reported excess, and who is responsible for the care and handling 
costs?

    Yes, you are accountable for the excess personal property until the 
time it is picked up by the designated recipient or its agent. You are 
responsible for all care and handling charges while the excess personal 
property is going through the screening and disposal process.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.250  Does GSA ever take physical custody of excess 

personal property?

    Generally you retain physical custody of the excess personal 
property prior to its final disposition. Very rarely GSA may consider 
accepting physical custody of excess personal property. Under special 
circumstances, GSA may take custody or may direct the transfer of 
partial or total custody to other executive agencies, with their 
consent.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.255  What options do we have when unusual circumstances 

do not allow adequate time for disposal through GSA?

    Contact your regional GSA Personal Property Management office for 
any existing interagency agreements that would allow you to turn in 
excess personal property to a federal facility. You are responsible for 
any turn in costs and all costs related to transporting the excess 
personal property to these facilities.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.260  How do we promote the expeditious transfer of excess

personal property?

    For expeditious transfer of excess personal property you should:
    (a) Provide complete and accurate property descriptions and 
condition codes on the report of excess to facilitate the selection of 
usable property by potential users.
    (b) Ensure that any available operating manual, parts list, diagram, 
maintenance log, or other instructional publication is made available 
with the property at the time of transfer.
    (c) Advise the designated recipient of any special requirements for 
dismantling, shipping/transportation.
    (d) When the excess personal property is located at a facility due 
to be closed, provide advance notice of the scheduled date of closing, 
and ensure there is sufficient time for screening and removal of 
property.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.265  What if there are competing requests for the same

excess personal property?

    (a) GSA will generally approve transfers on a first-come, first-
served basis. When more than one federal agency requests the same item, 
and the quantity available is not sufficient to meet the demand of all 
interested agencies, GSA will consider factors such as national defense 
requirements, emergency needs, avoiding the necessity of a new 
procurement, energy conservation, transportation costs, and retention of 
title in the government. GSA will normally give preference to the agency 
that will retain title in the Government.
    (b) Requests for property for the purpose of cannibalization will 
normally be subordinate to requests for use of the property in its 
existing form.

[[Page 101]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.270  What if a federal agency requests personal property

that is undergoing donation screening or in the sales process?

    Prior to final disposition, GSA will consider requests from 
authorized federal activities for excess personal property undergoing 
donation screening or in the sales process. Federal transfers may be 
authorized prior to removal of the property under a donation or sales 
action.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.275  May we dispose of excess personal property without

GSA approval?

    No, you may not dispose of excess personal property without GSA 
approval except under the following limited situations:
    (a) You may transfer to another federal agency excess personal 
property that has not yet been reported to GSA, under direct transfer 
procedures contained in Sec. 102-36.145.
    (b) You may dispose of excess personal property that is not required 
to be reported to GSA (see Sec. 102-36.220(b)).
    (c) You may dispose of excess personal property without going 
through GSA when such disposal is authorized by law.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.280  May we withdraw from the disposal process excess

personal property that we have reported to GSA?

    Yes, you may withdraw excess personal property from the disposal 
process, but only with the approval of GSA and to satisfy an internal 
agency requirement. Property that has been approved for transfer or 
donation or offered for sale by GSA may be returned to your control with 
proper justification.

                      Transfers With Reimbursement


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.285  May we charge for personal property transferred to 

another federal agency?

    (a) When any one of the following conditions applies, you may 
require and retain reimbursement for the excess personal property from 
the recipient:
    (1) Your agency has the statutory authority to require and retain 
reimbursement for the property.
    (2) You are transferring the property under the exchange/sale 
authority.
    (3) You had originally acquired the property with funds not 
appropriated from the general fund of the Treasury or appropriated 
therefrom but by law reimbursable from assessment, tax, or other 
revenue. It is current executive branch policy that working capital fund 
property shall be transferred without reimbursement.
    (4) You or the recipient is the U.S. Postal Service.
    (5) You or the recipient is the DC Government.
    (6) You or the recipient is a wholly owned or mixed-ownership 
government corporation.
    (b) You may charge for direct costs you incurred incident to the 
transfer, such as packing, loading and shipping of the property. The 
recipient is responsible for such charges unless you waive the amount 
involved.
    (c) You may not charge for overhead or administrative expenses or 
the costs for care and handling of the property pending disposition.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.290  How much do we charge for excess personal property

on a transfer with reimbursement?

    (a) You may require reimbursement in an amount up to the fair market 
value of the property when the transfer involves property meeting 
conditions in Sec. 102-36.285(a)(1) through (a)(4).
    (b) When you or the recipient is the DC Government or a wholly owned 
or mixed-ownership Government corporation (Sec. 102-36.285(a)(5) and 
(a)(6)), you may only require fair value reimbursement. Fair value 
reimbursement is 20 percent of the original acquisition cost for new or 
unused property (i.e., condition code 1), and zero percent for other 
personal property. A higher fair value may be used if you and the 
recipient agency agree. Due to special circumstances or the nature of 
the property, you may use other criteria for establishing fair value if 
approved or directed by GSA. You must refer any disagreements to the 
appropriate regional GSA Personal Property Management office.

<R05>
Sec. 102-36.305  May we abandon or destroy excess personal property 

without reporting it to GSA?

    Yes, you may abandon or destroy excess personal property when you 
have made a written determination that the property has no commercial 
value or the estimated cost of its continued care and handling would 
exceed the estimated proceeds from its sale. An item has no commercial 
value when it has neither utility nor monetary value (either as an item 
or as scrap).


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.310  Who makes the determination to abandon or destroy 

excess personal property?

    To abandon or destroy excess personal property, an authorized 
official of your agency makes a written finding that must be approved by 
a reviewing official who is not directly accountable for the property.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.315  Are there any restrictions to the use of the 

abandonment/destruction authority?

    Yes, the following restrictions apply:
    (a) You must not abandon or destroy property in a manner which is 
detrimental or dangerous to public health or safety. Additional 
guidelines for the abandonment/destruction of hazardous materials are 
prescribed in part 101-42 of this title.
    (b) If you become aware of an interest from an entity in purchasing 
the property, you must implement sales procedures in lieu of 
abandonment/destruction.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.320  May we transfer or donate excess personal property 

that has been determined appropriate for abandonment/destruction 
without GSA approval?

    In lieu of abandonment/destruction, you may donate such excess 
personal property only to a public body without going through GSA. A 
public body is any department, agency, special purpose district, or 
other instrumentality of a state or local government; any Indian tribe; 
or any agency of the federal government. If you become aware of an 
interest from an eligible non-profit organization (see part 102-37 of 
this chapter) that is not a public body in acquiring the property, you 
must contact the regional GSA Personal Property Management office and 
implement donation procedures in accordance with part 102-37 of this 
chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 102-36.325  What must be done before the abandonment/destruction 

of excess personal property?

    Except as provided in Sec. 102-36.330, you must provide public 
notice of intent to abandon or destroy excess personal property, in a 
format and timeframe specified by your agency regulations (such as 
publishing a notice in a local newspaper, posting of signs in common use 
facilities available to the public, or providing bulletins on your 
website through the internet). You must also include in the notice an 
offer to sell in accordance with part 102-38 of this chapter.

[65 FR 31218, May 16, 2000, as amended at 71 FR 53572, Sept. 12, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.330  Are there occasions when public notice is not needed

regarding abandonment/destruction of excess personal property?

    Yes, you are not required to provide public notice when:
    (a) The value of the property is so little or the cost of its care 
and handling, pending abandonment/destruction, is so great that its 
retention for advertising for sale, even as scrap, is clearly not 
economical;
    (b) Abandonment or destruction is required because of health, 
safety, or security reasons; or
    (c) When the original acquisition cost of the item (estimated if 
unknown) is less than $500.

<R05>
Sec. 102-36.345  May we dispose of excess Flight Safety Critical 

Aircraft Parts (FSCAP)?

    Yes, you may dispose of excess FSCAP, but first you must determine 
whether the documentation available is adequate to allow transfer, 
donation, or sale of the part in accordance with part 102-33, subpart D, 
of this chapter. Otherwise, you must mutilate undocumented FSCAP that 
has no traceability to its original equipment manufacturer and dispose 
of it as scrap. When reporting excess FSCAP, annotate the manufacturer, 
date of manufacture, part number, serial number, and the appropriate 
Criticality Code on the SF 120, and ensure that all available historical 
and maintenance records accompany the part at the time of issue.

[65 FR 31218, May 16, 2000, as amended at 71 FR 53572, Sept. 12, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.350  How do we identify a FSCAP?

    Any aircraft part designated as FSCAP is assigned an alpha 
Criticality Code, and the code is annotated on the original transfer 
document when you acquire the part. You must perpetuate the appropriate 
FSCAP Criticality Code on all personal property records. You may contact 
the Federal agency or Military service that originally owned the part 
for assistance in making this determination, or query DOD's Federal 
Logistics Information System (FLIS) using the National Stock Number 
(NSN) for the part. For assistance in subscribing to the FLIS service 
contact the FedLog Consumer Support Office, 800-351-4381.

<R05>
Sec. 102-36.410  How do we dispose of a gift in the form of money or 

intangible personal property?

    Report intangible personal property to GSA, Personal Property 
Management Division (FBP), Washington, DC 20406. You must not transfer 
or dispose of this property without prior approval of GSA. The Secretary 
of the Treasury will dispose of money and negotiable instruments such as 
bonds, notes, or other securities under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 324.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.415  How do we dispose of gifts other than intangible

personal property?

    (a) When the gift is offered with the condition that the property be 
sold and the proceeds used to reduce the public debt, report the gift to 
the regional GSA Personal Property Management office in which the 
property is located. GSA will convert the gift to money upon acceptance 
and deposit the proceeds into a special account of the U.S. Treasury.
    (b) When the gift is offered with no conditions or restrictions, and 
your agency has gift retention authority, you may use the gift for an 
authorized official purpose without reporting to GSA. The property will 
then lose its identity as a gift and you must account for it in the same 
manner as Federal personal property acquired from authorized sources. 
When the property is no longer needed, you must report it as excess 
personal property to GSA.
    (c) When the gift is offered with no conditions or restrictions, but 
your agency does not have gift retention authority, you must report it 
to the regional GSA Personal Property Management office. GSA will offer 
the property for screening for possible transfer to a federal agency or 
convert the gift to money and deposit the funds with U.S. Treasury. If 
your agency is interested in keeping the gift for an official purpose,

<R05>
Sec. 102-36.430  May we dispose of excess Munitions List Items

(MLIs)/Commerce Control List Items (CCLIs)?

    You may dispose of excess MLIs/CCLIs only when you comply with the 
additional disposal and demilitarization (DEMIL) requirements contained 
in part 101-42 of this title. MLIs may require demilitarization when 
issued to any non-DoD entity, and will require appropriate licensing 
when exported from the U.S. CCLIs usually require export licensing when 
transported from the U.S.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.435  How do we identify Munitions List Items 

(MLIs)/Commerce Control List Items (CCLIs) requiring demilitarization?

    You identify MLIs/CCLIs requiring demilitarization by the 
demilitarization code that is assigned to each MLI or CCLI. The code 
indicates the type and scope of demilitarization and/or export controls 
that must be accomplished, when required, before issue to any non-DOD 
activity. For a listing of the codes and additional guidance on DEMIL 
procedures see DOD Demilitarization and Trade Security Control Manual,

                           Red Cross Property


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.445  Do we report excess personal property originally

acquired from or through the American National Red Cross?

    Yes, when reporting excess personal property which was processed, 
produced, or donated by the American National Red Cross, note ``RED 
CROSS PROPERTY'' on the SF 120 or report document. GSA will offer to 
return this property to the Red Cross if no other federal agency has a 
need for it. If the Red Cross has no requirement, the property continues 
in the disposal process and is available for donation.

                            Shelf-Life Items


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.450  Do we report excess shelf-life items?

    (a) When there are quantities on hand, that would not be utilized by 
the expiration date and cannot be returned to the vendor for credit, you 
must report such expected overage as excess for possible transfer and 
disposal to ensure maximum use prior to deterioration.
    (b) You need not report expired shelf-life items. You may dispose of 
property with expired shelf-life by abandonment/destruction in 
accordance with Sec. 102-36.305 and in compliance with Federal, State, 
and local waste disposal and air and water pollution control standards.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.455  How do we report excess shelf-life items?

    You must identify the property as shelf-life items by ``SL'', 
indicate the expiration date, whether the date is the original or an 
extended date, and if the date is further extendable. GSA may adjust the 
screening period based on re-use potential and the remaining useful 
shelf life.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.460  Do we report excess medical shelf-life items 

held for national emergency purposes?

    When the remaining shelf life of any medical materials or supplies 
held for national emergency purposes is of too short a period to justify 
their continued retention, you should report such property excess for 
possible transfer and disposal. You must make such excess determinations 
at such time as to

[[Page 108]]

ensure that sufficient time remains to permit their use before their 
shelf-life expires and the items are unfit for human use. You must 
identify such items with ``MSL'' and the expiration date, and indicate 
any specialized storage requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.465  May we transfer or exchange excess medical 

shelf-life items with other federal agencies?

    Yes, you may transfer or exchange excess medical shelf-life items 
held for national emergency purposes with any other federal agency for 
other medical materials or supplies, without GSA approval and without 
regard to part 102-39 of this chapter. You and the transferee agency 
will agree to the terms and prices. You may credit any proceeds derived 
from such transactions to your agency's current applicable appropriation 
and use the funds only for the purchase of medical materials or supplies 
for national emergency purposes.

Sec. 102-36.470  What must we do when disposing of excess vessels?

    (a) When you dispose of excess vessels, you must indicate on the SF 
120 the following information:
    (1) Whether the vessel has been inspected by the Coast Guard.
    (2) Whether testing for hazardous materials has been done. And if 
so, the result of the testing, specifically the presence or absence of 
PCB's and asbestos and level of contamination.
    (3) Whether hazardous materials clean up is required, and when it 
will be accomplished by your agency.
    (b) In accordance with 40 U.S.C. 548, the Federal Maritime 
Administration (FMA), Department of Transportation, is responsible for 
disposing of surplus vessels determined to be merchant vessels or

<R05>
Sec. 102-36.475  What is the authority for transfers under 

``Computers for Learning''?

    (a) The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, as 
amended (15 U.S.C. 3710(i)), authorizes federal agencies to transfer 
excess education-related federal equipment to educational institutions 
or nonprofit organizations for educational and research activities. 
Executive Order 12999 (3 CFR, 1996 Comp., p. 180) requires, to the 
extent permitted by law and where appropriate, the transfer of computer 
equipment for use by schools or nonprofit organizations.
    (b) Each federal agency is required to identify a point of contact 
within the agency to assist eligible recipients, and to publicize the 
availability of such property to eligible communities. Excess education-
related equipment may be transferred directly under established agency 
procedures, or reported to GSA as excess for subsequent transfer to 
potential eligible recipients as appropriate. You must include transfers 
under this authority in the annual Non-federal Recipients Report (See 
Sec. 102-36.295) to GSA.
    (c) The ``Computers for Learning'' website has been developed to 
streamline the transfer of excess and surplus Federal computer equipment 
to schools and nonprofit educational organizations. For additional 
information about this program access the ``Computers for Learning'' 
website, http://www.computers.fed.gov.

<R05>
Sec. 102-37.30  When does property become available for donation?

102-36.95 of this chapter.


<R05>

SASPs or public airports to submit any additional information required 
to support and justify transfer of the property.

Sec. 102-37.60  How much time does a transferee have to pick up or

remove surplus property from holding agency premises?

    The transferee (or the transferee's agent) must remove property from 
the holding agency premises within 15 calendar days after being notified 
that the property is available for pickup, unless otherwise coordinated 
with the holding agency. If the transferee decides prior to pickup or 
removal that it no longer needs the property, it must notify the GSA 
regional office that approved the transfer request.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.65  What happens to surplus property that has been

approved for transfer when the prospective transferee decides 
it cannot use the property and declines to pick it up?

    When a prospective transferee decides it cannot use surplus property 
that has already been approved for transfer and declines to pick it up, 
the GSA regional office will advise any other SASP or public airport 
known to be interested in the property to submit a transfer request. If 
there is no transfer interest, GSA will release the property for other 
disposal.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.70  How should a transferee account for the receipt of 

a larger or smaller number of items than approved by GSA on the SF 123?

the quantity and unit of issue, and the unit and total acquisition cost.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.80  What happens to surplus property that isn't transferred

for donation?

    Surplus property not transferred for donation is generally offered 
for sale under the provisions of part 102-38 of this chapter. Under the 
appropriate circumstances (see Sec. 102-36.305 of this chapter), such 
property might be abandoned or destroyed.

[67 FR 2584, Jan. 18, 2002, as amended at 71 FR 23868, Apr. 25, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.85  Can surplus property being offered for sale be 

withdrawn and approved for donation?

    Yes, surplus property being offered for sale may be withdrawn for 
donation if approved by GSA. GSA will not approve requests for the 
withdrawal of property that has been advertised or listed on a sales 
offering if that withdrawal would be harmful to the overall outcome of 
the sale. GSA will only grant such requests prior to sales award, since 
an award is binding.


<R04>
             Subpart B_General Services Administration (GSA)


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.90  What are GSA's responsibilities in the donation 

of surplus property?

    The General Services Administration (GSA) is responsible for 
supervising and directing the disposal of surplus personal property. In 
addition to issuing regulatory guidance for the donation of such 
property, GSA:
    (a) Determines when property is surplus to the needs of the 
Government;
    (b) Allocates and transfers surplus property on a fair and equitable 
basis to State agencies for surplus property (SASPs) for further 
distribution to eligible donees;
    (c) Oversees the care and handling of surplus property while it is 
in the custody of a SASP;
    (d) Approves all transfers of surplus property to public airports, 
pursuant to the appropriate determinations made by the Federal Aviation 
Administration (see subpart F of this part);
    (e) Donates to the American National Red Cross property (generally 
blood plasma and related medical materials) originally provided by the 
Red Cross to a Federal agency, but that has subsequently been determined 
surplus to Federal needs (see subpart G of this part);
    (f) Approves, after consultation with the holding agency, foreign 
excess personal property to be returned to the United States for 
donation purposes;
    (g) Coordinates and controls the level of SASP and donee screening 
at Federal installations;
    (h) Imposes appropriate conditions on the donation of surplus 
property having characteristics that require special handling or use 
limitations (see Sec. 102-37.455); and
    (i) Keeps track of and reports on Federal donation programs (see 
Sec. 102-37.105).


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.95  How will GSA resolve competing transfer requests?

    In case of requests from two or more SASPs, GSA will use the 
allocating criteria in Sec. 102-37.100. When competing requests are 
received from public airports and SASPs, GSA will transfer property 
fairly and equitably, based on such factors as need, proposed use, and 
interest of the holding agency in having the property donated to a 
specific public airport.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.100  What factors will GSA consider in allocating

surplus property among SASPs?

    GSA allocates property among the SASPs on a fair and equitable basis 
using the following factors:
    (a) Extraordinary needs caused by disasters or emergency situations.
    (b) Requests from the Department of Defense (DOD) for DOD-generated 
property to be allocated through a SASP for donation to a specific 
service educational activity.

[[Page 116]]

    (c) Need and usability of property, as reflected by requests from 
SASPs. GSA will also give special consideration to requests transmitted 
through the SASPs by eligible donees for specific items of property. 
(Requests for property to be used as is will be given preference over 
cannibalization requests.)
    (d) States in greatest need of the type of property to be allocated 
where the need is evidenced by a letter of justification from the 
intended donee.
    (e) Whether a SASP has already received similar property in the 
past, and how much.
    (f) Past performance of a SASP in effecting timely pickup or removal 
of property approved for transfer and making prompt distribution of 
property to eligible donees.
    (g) The property's condition and its original acquisition cost.
    (h) Relative neediness of each State based on the State's population 
and per capita income.

<R05>
Sec. 102-37.110  What are a holding agency's responsibilities in the

donation of surplus property?

    Your donation responsibilities as a holding agency begin when you 
determine that property is to be declared excess. You must then:
    (a) Let GSA know if you have a donee in mind for foreign gift items 
or airport property, as provided for in Sec. 102-37.525 and Sec. 102-
42.95(h) of this chapter;
    (b) Cooperate with all entities authorized to participate in the 
donation program and their authorized representatives in locating, 
screening, and inspecting excess or surplus property for possible 
donation;
    (c) Set aside or hold surplus property from further disposal upon 
notification of a pending transfer for donation; (If GSA does not notify 
you of a pending transfer within 5 calendar days following the surplus 
release date, you may proceed with the sale or other authorized disposal 
of the property.)
    (d) Upon receipt of a GSA-approved transfer document, promptly ship 
or release property to the transferee (or the transferee's designated 
agent) in accordance with pickup or shipping instructions on the 
transfer document;
    (e) Notify the approving GSA regional office if surplus property to 
be picked up is not removed within 15 calendar days after you notify the 
transferee (or its agent) of its availability. (GSA will advise you of 
further disposal instructions.); and
    (f) Perform and bear the cost of care and handling of surplus 
property pending its disposal, except as provided in Sec. 102-37.115.

[67 FR 2584, Jan. 18, 2002, as amended at 67 FR 78732, Dec. 26, 2002]

a military department or the Coast Guard to recipients eligible under 10 
U.S.C. 2572, 10 U.S.C. 7306, 10 U.S.C. 7541, 10 U.S.C. 7545, and 14 
U.S.C. 641a (see Appendix A of this part for details). However, such 
property must first undergo excess Federal and surplus donation 
screening as required in this part and part 102-36 of this chapter;
    (2) Donations by holding agencies to public bodies under subpart H 
of this part;
    (3) Donations by the Small Business Administration to small 
disadvantaged businesses under 13 CFR part 124; and

[[Page 117]]

    (4) Donations by holding agencies of law enforcement canines to 
their handlers under 40 U.S.C. 555.
    (b) You may also donate property directly to eligible non-Federal 
recipients under other circumstances if you have statutory authority to 
do so. All such donations must be included on your annual report to GSA 
under Sec. 102-36.300 of this chapter.

    Yes, SASP personnel or donee personnel representing a SASP must have 
a valid screener-identification card (GSA Optional Form 92, Screener's 
Identification, or other suitable identification approved by GSA) before 
screening and selecting property at holding agencies. However, SASP or 
donee personnel do not need a screener-ID card to inspect or remove 
property previously set aside or approved by GSA for transfer.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.185  How does a SASP obtain screening authorization for

itself or its donees?

screeners?

    You must maintain a current record of all individuals authorized to 
screen for your SASP, including their names, addresses, telephone 
numbers, qualifications to screen, and any additional identifying 
information such as driver's license or social security numbers. In the 
case of donee screeners, you should place such records in the donee's 
eligibility file and review for currency each time a periodic review of 
the donee's file is undertaken.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.195  Does a SASP have to have a donee in mind to request 

surplus property?

demand for any property that you request.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.200  What certifications must a SASP make when requesting

surplus property for donation?

    When requesting or applying for property, you must certify that:
    (a) You are the agency of the State designated under State law that 
has legal authority under 40 U.S.C. 549 and GSA regulations, to receive

    (1) A public agency for one or more public purposes.
    (2) An eligible nonprofit organization or institution which is 
exempt from taxation under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 
U.S.C. 501), for the purpose of education or public health (including 
research for any such purpose).
    (3) An eligible nonprofit activity for programs for older 
individuals.

[[Page 119]]

    (4) A service educational activity (SEA), for DOD-generated property 
only.
    (d) When property is picked up by, or shipped to, your SASP, you 
have adequate and available funds, facilities, and personnel to provide 
accountability, warehousing, proper maintenance, and distribution of the 
property.
    (e) When property is distributed by your SASP to a donee, or when 
delivery is made directly from a holding agency to a donee pursuant to a 
State distribution document, you have determined that the donee 
acquiring the property is eligible within the meaning of the Property 
Act and GSA regulations, and that the property is usable and needed by 
the donee.

    (a) You will make prompt statewide distribution of such property, on 
a fair and equitable basis, to donees eligible to acquire property under

after such eligible donees have properly executed the appropriate 
certifications and agreements established by your SASP and/or GSA.
    (b) Title to the property remains in the United States Government 
although you have taken possession of it. Conditional title to the 
property will pass to the eligible donee when the donee executes the 
required certifications and agreements and takes possession of the 
property.
    (c) You will:
    (1) Promptly pay the cost of care, handling, and shipping incident 
to taking possession of the property.
    (2) During the time that title remains in the United States 
Government, be responsible as a bailee for the property from the time it 
is released to you or to the transportation agent you have designated.
    (3) In the event of any loss of or damage to any or all of the 
property during transportation or storage at a place other than a place 
under your control, take the necessary action to obtain restitution 
(fair market value) for the Government. In the event of loss or damage 
due to negligence or willful misconduct on your part, repair, replace, 
or pay to the GSA the fair market value of any such property, or take 
such other action as the GSA may direct.
    (d) You may retain property to perform your donation program 
functions, but only when authorized by GSA in accordance with the 
provisions of a cooperative agreement entered into with GSA.
    (e) When acting under an interstate cooperative distribution 
agreement (see Sec. 102-37.335) as an agent and authorized 
representative of an adjacent State, you will:
    (1) Make the certifications and agreements required in Sec. 102-
37.200 and this section on behalf of the adjacent SASP.
    (2) Require the donee to execute the distribution documents of the 
State in which the donee is located.
    (3) Forward copies of the distribution documents to the 
corresponding SASP.
    (f) You will not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national 
origin, sex, age, or handicap in the distribution of property, and will 
comply with GSA regulations on nondiscrimination as set forth in parts 
101-4, subparts 101-6.2, and 101-8.3 of this title.
    (g) You will not seek to hold the United States Government liable 
for consequential or incidental damages or the personal injuries, 
disabilities, or death to any person arising from the transfer, 
donation, use, processing, or final disposition of this property. The 
Government's liability in any event is limited in scope to that provided 
for by the Federal Tort Claims Act (28 U.S.C. 2671, et seq.).

making allocation to States with the greatest need.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.225  What information or documentation must a SASP 

provide when requesting a surplus aircraft or vessel?

    (a) For each SF 123 that you submit to GSA for transfer of a surplus 
aircraft or vessel covered by Sec. 102-37.455 include:
    (1) A letter of intent, signed and dated by the authorized 
representative of the proposed donee setting forth a detailed plan of 
utilization for the property (see Sec. 102-37.230 for information a 
donee has to include in the letter of intent); and
    (2) A letter, signed and dated by you, confirming and certifying the 
applicant's eligibility and containing an evaluation of the applicant's 
ability to use the aircraft or vessel for the purpose stated in its 
letter of intent and any other supplemental information concerning the 
needs of the donee which supports making the allocation.
    (b) For each SF 123 that GSA approves, you must include:
    (1) Your distribution document, signed and dated by the authorized 
donee representative; and
    (2) A conditional transfer document, signed by you and the intended 
donee, and containing the special terms and conditions prescribed by 
GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.230  What must a letter of intent for obtaining surplus

aircraft or vessels include?

    A letter of intent for obtaining surplus aircraft or vessels must 
provide:
    (a) A description of the aircraft or vessel requested. If the item 
is an aircraft, the description must include the manufacturer, date of 
manufacture, model, and serial number. If the item is a vessel, it must 
include the type, name, class, size, displacement, length, beam, draft, 
lift capacity, and the hull or registry number, if known;
    (b) A detailed description of the donee's program and the number and 
types of aircraft or vessels it currently owns;
    (c) A detailed description of how the aircraft or vessel will be 
used, its purpose, how often and for how long. If an aircraft is 
requested for flight purposes, the donee must specify a source of 
pilot(s) and where the aircraft will be housed. If an aircraft is 
requested for cannibalization, the donee must provide details of the 
cannibalization process (time to complete the cannibalization process, 
how recovered parts are to be used, method of accounting for usable 
parts, disposition of unsalvageable parts, etc.) If a vessel is 
requested for waterway purposes, the donee must specify a source of 
pilot(s) and where the vessel will be docked. If a vessel is requested 
for permanent docking on water or land, the donee

[[Page 121]]

must provide details of the process, including the time to complete the 
process; and
    (d) Any supplemental information (such as geographical area and 
population served, number of students enrolled in educational programs, 
etc.) supporting the donee's need for the aircraft or vessel.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.235  What type of information must a SASP provide when 

requesting surplus property for cannibalization?

    When a donee wants surplus property to cannibalize, include the 
following statement on the SF 123: ``Line Item Number(s)------requested 
for cannibalization.''. In addition to including this statement, provide 
a detailed justification concerning the need for the components or 
accessories and an explanation of the effect removal will have on the 
item. GSA will approve requests for cannibalization only when it is 
clear from the justification that disassembly of the item for use of its 
component parts will provide greater potential benefit than use of the 
item in its existing form.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.240  How must a transfer request for surplus firearms

be justified?

    To justify a transfer request for surplus firearms, the requesting 
SASP must obtain and submit to GSA a letter of intent from the intended 
donee that provides:
    (a) Identification of the donee applicant, including its legal name 
and complete address and the name, title, and telephone number of its 
authorized representative;
    (b) The number of compensated officers with the power to apprehend 
and to arrest;

    (e) The number and types of donated firearms received during the 
previous 12 months through any other Federal program.

                     Custody, Care, and Safekeeping


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.245  What must a SASP do to safeguard surplus property

in its custody?

    To safeguard surplus property in your custody, you must provide 
adequate protection of property in your custody, including protection 
against the hazards of fire, theft, vandalism, and weather.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.250  What actions must a SASP take when it learns of 

damage to or loss of surplus property in its custody?

    If you learn that surplus property in your custody has been damaged 
or lost, you must always notify GSA and notify the appropriate law 
enforcement officials if a crime has been committed.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.255  Must a SASP insure surplus property against loss 

or damage?

    No, you are not required to carry insurance on Federal surplus 
property in your custody. However, if you elect to carry insurance and 
the insured property is lost or damaged, you must submit a check made 
payable to GSA for any insurance proceeds received in excess of your 
actual costs of acquiring and rehabilitating the property prior to its 
loss, damage, or destruction.

                        Distribution of Property


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.260  How must a SASP document the distribution of 

surplus property?

    All SASPs must document the distribution of Federal surplus property 
on forms that are prenumbered, provide for donees to indicate the 
primary purposes for which they are acquiring property, and include the:
    (a) Certifications and agreements in Sec. Sec. 102-37.200 and 102-
37.205; and
    (b) Period of restriction during which the donee must use the 
property for the purpose for which it was acquired.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.265  May a SASP distribute surplus property to eligible 

donees of another State?

    Yes, you may distribute surplus property to eligible donees of 
another State, if you and the other SASP determine that such an 
arrangement will be

[[Page 122]]

of mutual benefit to you and the donees concerned. Where such 
determinations are made, an interstate distribution cooperative 
agreement must be prepared as prescribed in Sec. 102-37.335 and 
submitted to the appropriate GSA regional office for approval. When 
acting under an interstate distribution cooperative agreement, you must:
    (a) Require the donee recipient to execute the distribution 
documents of its home SASP; and
    (b) Forward copies of executed distribution documents to the donee's 
home SASP.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.270  May a SASP retain surplus property for its own use?

    Yes, you can retain surplus property for use in operating the 
donation program, but only if you have a cooperative agreement with GSA 
that allows you to do so. You must obtain prior GSA approval before 
using any surplus property in the operation of the SASP. Make your needs 
known by submitting a listing of needed property to the appropriate GSA 
regional office for approval. GSA will review the list to ensure that it 
is of the type and quantity of property that is reasonably needed and 
useful in performing SASP operations. GSA will notify you within 30 
calendar days whether you may retain the property for use in your 
operations. Title to any surplus property GSA approves for your 
retention will vest in your SASP. You must maintain separate records for 
such property.

                      Service and Handling Charges


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.275  May a SASP accept personal checks and non-official 

payment methods in payment of service charges?

    No, service charge payments must readily identify the donee 
institution as the payer (or the name of the parent organization when 
that organization pays the operational expenses of the donee). Personal 
checks, personal cashier checks, personal money orders, and personal 
credit cards are not acceptable.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.280  How may a SASP use service charge funds?

    Funds accumulated from service charges may be deposited, invested, 
or used in accordance with State law to:
    (a) Cover direct and reasonable indirect costs of operating the 
SASP;
    (b) Purchase necessary equipment for the SASP;
    (c) Maintain a reasonable working capital reserve;
    (d) Rehabilitate surplus property, including the purchase of 
replacement parts;
    (e) Acquire or improve office or distribution center facilities; or
    (f) Pay for the costs of internal and external audits.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.285  May a SASP use service charge funds to support

non-SASP State activities and programs?

    No, except as provided in Sec. 102-37.495, you must use funds 
collected from service charges, or from other sources such as proceeds 
from sale of undistributed property or funds collected from compliance 
cases, solely for the operation of the SASP and the benefit of 
participating donees.

                   Disposing of Undistributed Property


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.290  What must a SASP do with surplus property it 

cannot donate?

    (a) As soon as it becomes clear that you cannot donate the surplus 
property, you should first determine whether or not the property is 
usable.
    (1) If you determine that the undistributed surplus property is not 
usable, you should seek GSA approval to abandon or destroy the property 
in accordance with Sec. 102-37.320.
    (2) If you determine that the undistributed surplus property is 
usable, you should immediately offer it to other SASPs. If other SASPs 
cannot use the property, you should promptly report it to GSA for 
redisposal (i.e., disposition through retransfer, sale, or other means).
    (b) Normally, any property not donated within a 1-year period should 
be processed in this manner.

[[Page 123]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.295  Must GSA approve a transfer between SASPs?

    Yes, the requesting SASP must submit a SF 123, Transfer Order 
Surplus Personal Property, to the GSA regional office in which the 
releasing SASP is located. GSA will approve or disapprove the request 
within 30 calendar days of receipt of the transfer order.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.300  What information must a SASP provide GSA when

reporting unneeded usable property for disposal?

    When reporting unneeded usable property that is not required for 
transfer to another SASP, provide GSA with the:
    (a) Best possible description of each line item of property, its 
current condition code, quantity, unit and total acquisition cost, State 
serial number, demilitarization code, and any special handling 
conditions;
    (b) Date you received each line item of property listed; and
    (c) Certification of reimbursement requested under Sec. 102-37.315.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.305  May a SASP act as GSA's agent in selling undistributed

surplus property (either as usable property or scrap)?

    Yes, you may act as GSA's agent in selling undistributed surplus 
property (either as usable property or scrap) if an established 
cooperative agreement with GSA permits such an action. You must notify 
GSA each time you propose to conduct a sale under the cooperative 
agreement. You may request approval to conduct a sale when reporting the 
property to GSA for disposal instructions. If no formal agreement 
exists, you may submit such an agreement at that time for approval.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.310  What must a proposal to sell undistributed surplus 

property include?

    (a) Your request to sell undistributed surplus property must 
include:
    (1) The proposed sale date;
    (2) A listing of the property;
    (3) Location of the sale;
    (4) Method of sale; and
    (5) Proposed advertising to be used.
    (b) If the request is approved, the GSA regional sales office will 
provide the necessary forms and instructions for you to use in 
conducting the sale.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.315  What costs may a SASP recover if undistributed 

surplus property is retransferred or sold?

    (a) When undistributed surplus property is transferred to a Federal 
agency or another SASP, or disposed of by public sale, you are entitled 
to recoup:
    (1) Direct costs you initially paid to the Federal holding agency, 
including but not limited to, packing, preparation for shipment, and 
loading. You will not be reimbursed for actions following receipt of the 
property, including unloading, moving, repairing, preserving, or 
storage.
    (2) Transportation costs you incurred, but were not reimbursed by a 
donee, for initially moving the property from the Federal holding agency 
to your distribution facility or other point of receipt. You must 
document and certify the amount of reimbursement requested for these 
costs.
    (b) Reimbursable arrangements should be made prior to transfer of 
the property. In the case of a Federal transfer, GSA will secure 
agreement of the Federal agency to reimburse your authorized costs, and 
annotate the amount of reimbursement on the transfer document. You must 
coordinate and make arrangements for reimbursement when property is 
transferred to another SASP. If you and the receiving SASP cannot agree 
on an appropriate reimbursement charge, GSA will determine appropriate 
reimbursement. The receiving SASP must annotate the reimbursement amount 
on the transfer document prior to its being forwarded to GSA for 
approval.
    (c) When undistributed property is disposed of by public sale, GSA 
must approve the amount of sales proceeds you may receive to cover your 
costs. Generally, this will not exceed 50 percent of the total sales 
proceeds.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.320  Under what conditions may a SASP abandon or destroy 

undistributed surplus property?

    (a) You may abandon or destroy undistributed surplus property when 
you have made a written finding that the property has no commercial 
value or the estimated cost of its continued

[[Page 124]]

care and handling would exceed the estimated proceeds from its sale. The 
abandonment or destruction finding must be sent to the appropriate GSA 
regional office for approval. You must include in the finding:
    (1) The basis for the abandonment or destruction;
    (2) A detailed description of the property, its condition, and total 
acquisition cost;
    (3) The proposed method of destruction (burning, burying, etc.) or 
the abandonment location;
    (4) A statement confirming that the proposed abandonment or 
destruction will not be detrimental or dangerous to public health or 
safety and will not infringe on the rights of other persons; and
    (5) The signature of the SASP director requesting approval for the 
abandonment or destruction.
    (b) GSA will notify you within 30 calendar days whether you may 
abandon or destroy the property. GSA will provide alternate disposition 
instructions if it disapproves your request for abandonment or 
destruction. If GSA doesn't reply to you within 30 calendar days of 
notification, the property may be abandoned or destroyed.

                         Cooperative Agreements


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.325  With whom and for what purpose(s) may a SASP enter 

into a cooperative agreement?

    Section 549(f) of title 40, United States Code allows GSA, or 
Federal agencies designated by GSA, to enter into cooperative agreements 
with SASPs to carry out the surplus property donation program. Such 
agreements allow GSA, or the designated Federal agencies, to use the 
SASP's property, facilities, personnel, or services or to furnish such 
resources to the SASP. For example:
    (a) Regional GSA personal property management offices, or designated 
Federal agencies, may enter into a cooperative agreement to assist a 
SASP in distributing surplus property for donation. Assistance may 
include:
    (1) Furnishing the SASP with available GSA or agency office space 
and related support such as office furniture and information technology 
equipment needed to screen and process property for donation.
    (2) Permitting the SASP to retain items of surplus property 
transferred to the SASP that are needed by the SASP in performing its 
donation functions (see Sec. 102-37.270).
    (b) Regional GSA personal property management offices may help the 
SASP to enter into agreements with other GSA or Federal activities for 
the use of Federal telecommunications service or federally-owned real 
property and related personal property.
    (c) A SASP may enter into a cooperative agreement with GSA to 
conduct sales of undistributed property on behalf of GSA (see Sec. 102-
37.305).

[67 FR 2584, Jan. 18, 2002, as amended at 71 FR 23868, Apr. 25, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.330  Must the costs of providing support under a 

cooperative agreement be reimbursed by the parties receiving 
such support?

    The parties to a cooperative agreement must decide among themselves 
the extent to which the costs of the services they provide must be 
reimbursed. Their decision should be reflected in the cooperative 
agreement itself. As a general rule, the Economy Act (31 U.S.C. 1535) 
would require a Federal agency receiving services from a SASP to 
reimburse the SASP for those services. Since SASPs are not Federal 
agencies, the Economy Act would not require them to reimburse Federal 
agencies for services provided by such agencies. In this situation, the 
Federal agencies would have to determine whether or not their own 
authorities would permit them to provide services to SASPs without 
reimbursement. If a Federal agency is reimbursed by a SASP for services 
provided under a cooperative agreement, it must credit that payment to 
the fund or appropriation that incurred the related costs.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.335  May a SASP enter into a cooperative agreement with 

another SASP?

    Yes, with GSA's concurrence and where authorized by State law, a 
SASP may enter into an agreement with an adjacent State to act as its 
agent and authorized representative in disposing of surplus Federal 
property. Interstate

[[Page 125]]

cooperative agreements may be considered when donees, because of their 
geographic proximity to the property distribution centers of the 
adjoining State, could be more efficiently and economically serviced by 
surplus property facilities in the adjacent State. You and the other 
SASP must agree to the payment or reimbursement of service charges by 
the donee and you also must agree to the requirements of Sec. 102-
37.205(e).


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.340  When may a SASP terminate a cooperative agreement?

    You may terminate a cooperative agreement with GSA 60-calendar days 
after providing GSA with written notice. For other cooperative 
agreements with other authorized parties, you or the other party may 
terminate the agreement as mutually agreed. You must promptly notify GSA 
when such other agreements are terminated.

                           Audits and Reviews


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.345  When must a SASP be audited?

    For each year in which a SASP receives $500,000 or more a year in 
surplus property or other Federal assistance, it must be audited in 
accordance with the Single Audit Act (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507) as 
implemented by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-133, 
``Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations'' 
(for availability see 5 CFR 1310.3). GSA's donation program should be 
identified by Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number 39.003 when 
completing the required schedule of Federal assistance.

[67 FR 2584, Jan. 18, 2002, as amended at 71 FR 23868, Apr. 25, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.350  Does coverage under the single audit process in OMB 

Circular A-133 exempt a SASP from other reviews of its program?

    No, although SASPs are covered under the single audit process in OMB 
Circular A-133, from time to time the Government Accountability Office 
(GAO), GSA, or other authorized Federal activities may audit or review 
the operations of a SASP. GSA will notify the chief executive officer of 
the State of the reasons for a GSA audit. When requested, you must make 
available financial records and all other records of the SASP for 
inspection by representatives of GSA, GAO, or other authorized Federal 
activities.

[67 FR 2584, Jan. 18, 2002, as amended at 71 FR 23868, Apr. 25, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.355  What obligations does a SASP have to ensure that 

donees meet Circular A-133 requirements?

    SASPs, if they donate $500,000 or more in Federal property to a 
donee in a fiscal year, must ensure that the donee has an audit 
performed in accordance with Circular A-133. If a donee receives less 
than $500,000 in donated property, the SASP is not expected to assume 
responsibility for ensuring the donee meets audit requirements, beyond 
making sure the donee is aware that the requirements do exist. It is the 
donee's responsibility to identify and determine the amount of Federal 
assistance it has received and to arrange for audit coverage.

[67 FR 2584, Jan. 18, 2002, as amended at 71 FR 23868, Apr. 25, 2006]

                                 Reports


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.360  What reports must a SASP provide to GSA?

    (a) Quarterly report on donations. Submit a GSA Form 3040, State 
Agency Monthly Donation Report of Surplus Personal Property, to the 
appropriate GSA regional office by the 25th day of the month following 
the quarter being reported. (OMB Control Number 3090-0112 has been 
assigned to this form.) Forms and instructions for completing the form 
are available from your servicing GSA office.
    (b) Additional reports. Make other reports GSA may require to carry 
out its discretionary authority to transfer surplus personal property 
for donation and to report to the Congress on the status and progress of 
the donation program.

[[Page 126]]

                           Liquidating a SASP


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.365  What steps must a SASP take if the State decides to 

liquidate the agency?

    Before suspending operations, a SASP must submit to GSA a 
liquidation plan that includes:
    (a) Reasons for the liquidation;
    (b) A schedule for liquidating the agency and the estimated date of 
termination;
    (c) Method of disposing of property on hand under the requirements 
of this part;
    (d) Method of disposing of the agency's physical and financial 
assets;
    (e) Retention of all available records of the SASP for a 2-year 
period following liquidation; and
    (f) Designation of another governmental entity to serve as the 
agency's successor in function until continuing obligations on property 
donated prior to the closing of the agency are fulfilled.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.370  Do liquidation plans require public notice?

    Yes, a liquidation plan constitutes a major amendment of a SASP's 
plan of operation and, as such, requires public notice.

                            Donee Eligibility


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.385  Who determines if a prospective donee applicant is

eligible to receive surplus property under this subpart?

    (a) For most public and nonprofit activities, the SASP determines if 
an applicant is eligible to receive property as a public agency, a 
nonprofit educational or public health institution, or for a program for 
older individuals. A SASP may request GSA assistance or guidance in 
making such determinations.
    (b) For applicants that offer courses of instruction devoted to the 
military arts and sciences, the Defense Department will determine 
eligibility to receive surplus property through the SASP as a service 
educational activity or SEA.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.390  What basic criteria must an applicant meet before

a SASP can qualify it for eligibility?

    To qualify for donation program eligibility through a SASP, an 
applicant must:

Sec. 102-37.400  What type of eligibility information must a SASP

maintain on donees?

    In general, you must maintain the records required by your State 
plan to document donee eligibility (see appendix B of this part). For 
SEAs, you must maintain separate records that include:
    (a) Documentation verifying that the activity has been designated as 
eligible by DOD to receive surplus DOD property.
    (b) A statement designating one or more donee representative(s) to

authorized by DOD for use in the SEA's program.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.405  How often must a SASP update donee eligibility records?

    You must update donee eligibility records as needed, but no less 
than

[[Page 128]]

every 3 years, to ensure that all documentation supporting the donee's 
eligibility is current and accurate. Annually, you must update files for 
nonprofit organizations whose eligibility depends on annual 
appropriations, annual licensing, or annual certification. Particular 
care must be taken to ensure that all records relating to the authority 
of donee representatives to receive and receipt for property, or to 
screen property at Federal facilities, are current.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.410  What must a SASP do if a donee fails to maintain

its eligibility status?

    If you determine that a donee has failed to maintain its eligibility 
status, you must terminate distribution of property to that donee, 
recover any usable property still under Federal restriction (as outlined 
in Sec. 102-37.465), and take any other required compliance actions.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.415  What should a SASP do if an applicant appeals a 

negative eligibility determination?

    If an applicant appeals a negative eligibility determination, 
forward complete documentation on the appeal request, including your 
comments and recommendations, to the applicable GSA regional office for 
review and coordination with GSA headquarters. GSA's decision will be 
final.

                         Conditional Eligibility


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.420  May a SASP grant conditional eligibility to 

applicants who would otherwise qualify as eligible donees, 
but have been unable to obtain approval, accreditation,
or licensing because they are newly organized or their facilities
are not yet constructed?

    You may grant conditional eligibility to such an applicant provided 
it submits a statement from any required approving, accrediting, or 
licensing authority confirming it will be approved, accredited, or 
licensed.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.425  May a SASP grant conditional eligibility to a

not-for-profit organization whose tax-exempt status is pending?

    No, under no circumstances may you grant conditional eligibility 
prior to receiving from the applicant a copy of a letter of 
determination by the Internal Revenue Service stating that the applicant 
is exempt from Federal taxation under section 501 of the Internal 
Revenue Code.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.430  What property can a SASP make available to a

donee with conditional eligibility?

    You may only make available surplus property that the donee can use 
immediately. You may not make available property that will only be used 
at a later date, for example, after the construction of the donee's 
facility has been completed.

                    Terms and Conditions of Donation


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.435  For what purposes may donees acquire and use

surplus property?

    A donee may acquire and use surplus property only for the following 
authorized purposes:

through a SASP must use such property to carry out or to promote one or 
more public purposes for the people it serves.
    (b) Educational and public health purposes, including related 
research. A nonprofit educational or public health institution must use 
surplus property for education or public health, including research for 
either purpose and assistance to the homeless or impoverished. While 
this does not preclude the use of donated surplus property for a related 
or subsidiary purpose incident to the institution's overall program, the 
property may not be used for a nonrelated or commercial purpose.
    (c) Programs for older individuals. An entity that conducts a 
program for older individuals must use donated surplus property to 
provide services that are necessary for the general welfare of older 
individuals, such as social services, transportation services, nutrition

and
    (e) It isn't currently debarred, suspended, declared ineligible, or 
otherwise excluded from receiving the property.

<R05>
Sec. 102-37.450  What agreements must a donee make?

    Before a SASP may release property to a donee, the donee must agree 
to the following conditions:
    (a) The property is acquired on an ``as is, where is'' basis, 
without warranty of any kind, and it will hold the Government harmless 
from any or all debts, liabilities, judgments, costs, demands, suits, 
actions, or claims of any nature arising from or incident to the 
donation of the property, its use, or final disposition.
    (b) It will return to the SASP, at its own expense, any donated 
property:
    (1) That is not placed in use for the purposes for which it was 
donated within 1 year of donation; or
    (2) Which ceases to be used for such purposes within 1 year after 
being placed in use.
    (c) It will comply with the terms and conditions imposed by the SASP 
on the use of any item of property having a unit acquisition cost of 
$5,000 or more and any passenger motor vehicle or other donated item. 
(Not applicable to SEAs.)
    (d) It agrees that, upon execution of the SASP distribution 
document, it has conditional title only to the property during the 
applicable period of restriction. Full title to the property will vest 
in the donee only after the donee has met all of the requirements of 
this part.
    (e) It will comply with conditions imposed by GSA, if any, requiring 
special handling or use limitations on donated property.
    (f) It will use the property for an authorized purpose during the

permanently for use outside the State.
    (h) It will report to the SASP on the use, condition, and location 
of donated property, and on other pertinent matters as the SASP may 
require from time to time.
    (i) If an insured loss of the property occurs during the period of

proceeds of an amount equal to the unamortized portion of the fair 
market value of the damaged or destroyed item.

                   Special Handling or Use Conditions


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.455  On what categories of surplus property has GSA

imposed special handling conditions or use limitations?

[67 FR 2584, Jan. 18, 2002, as amended at 71 FR 23868, Apr. 25, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.460  What special terms and conditions apply to the

donation of aircraft and vessels?

    The following special terms and conditions apply to the donation of 
aircraft and vessels:
    (a) There must be a period of restriction which will expire after 
the aircraft or vessel has been used for the purpose stated in the 
letter of intent (see Sec. 102-37.230) for a period of 5 years, except 
that the period of restriction for a combat-configured aircraft is in 
perpetuity.
    (b) The donee of an aircraft must apply to the FAA for registration 
of an aircraft intended for flight use within 30 calendar days of 
receipt of the aircraft. The donee of a vessel must, within 30 calendar 
days of receipt of the vessel, apply for documentation of the vessel 
under applicable Federal, State, and local laws and must record each 
document with the U.S. Coast Guard at the port of documentation. The 
donee's application for registration or documentation must include a 
fully executed copy of the conditional transfer document and a copy of 
its letter of intent. The donee must provide the SASP

[[Page 131]]

and GSA with a copy of the FAA registration (and a copy of its FAA 
Standard Airworthiness Certificate if the aircraft is to be flown as a 
civil aircraft) or Coast Guard documentation.
    (c) The aircraft or vessel must be used solely in accordance with 
the executed conditional transfer document and the plan of utilization 
set forth in the donee's letter of intent, unless the donee has amended 
the letter, and it has been approved in writing by the SASP and GSA and 
a copy of the amendment recorded with FAA or the U.S. Coast Guard, as 
applicable.
    (d) In the event any of the terms and conditions imposed by the 
conditional transfer document are breached, title may revert to the 
Government. GSA may require the donee to return the aircraft or vessel 
or pay for any unauthorized disposal, transaction, or use.
    (e) If, during the period of restriction, the aircraft or vessel is 
no longer needed by the donee, the donee must promptly notify the SASP 
and request disposal instructions. A SASP may not issue disposal 
instructions without the prior written concurrence of GSA.
    (f) Military aircraft previously used for ground instruction and/or 
static display (Category B aircraft, as designated by DOD) or that are 
combat-configured (Category C aircraft) may not be donated for flight 
purposes.
    (g) For all aircraft donated for nonflight use, the donee must, 
within 30 calendar days of receipt of the aircraft, turn over to the 
SASP the remaining aircraft historical records (except the records of 
the major components/life limited parts; e.g., engines, transmissions, 
rotor blades, etc., necessary to substantiate their reuse). The SASP in 
turn must transmit the records to GSA for forwarding to the FAA.

                         Release of Restrictions


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.465  May a SASP modify or release any of the terms 

and conditions of donation?

    You may alter or grant releases from State-imposed restrictions, 
provided your State plan of operation sets forth the standards by which 
such actions will be taken. You may not grant releases from, or 
amendments or corrections to:
    (a) The terms and conditions you are required by the Property Act to 
impose on the use of passenger motor vehicles and any item of property 
having a unit acquisition cost of $5,000 or more.
    (b) Any special handling condition or use limitation imposed by GSA, 
except with the prior written approval of GSA.
    (c) The statutory requirement that usable property be returned by 
the donee to the SASP if the property has not been placed in use for the 
purposes for which it was donated within 1 year of donation or ceases to 
be used by the donee for those purposes within 1 year of being placed in 
use, except that:
    (1) You may grant authority to the donee to cannibalize property 
items subject to this requirement when you determine that such action 
will result in increased use of the property and that the proposed 
action meets the standards prescribed in your plan of operation.
    (2) You may, with the written concurrence of GSA, grant donees:
    (i) A time extension to place property into use if the delay in 
putting the property into use was beyond the control and without the 
fault or negligence of the donee.
    (ii) Authority to trade in one donated item for one like item having 
similar use potential.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.470  At what point may restrictions be released on property

that has been authorized for cannibalization?

    Property authorized for cannibalization must remain under the period 
of restriction imposed by the transfer/distribution document until the 
proposed cannibalization is completed. Components resulting from the 
cannibalization, which have a unit acquisition cost of $5,000 or more, 
must remain under the restrictions imposed by the transfer/distribution 
document. Components with a unit acquisition cost of less than $5,000 
may be released upon cannibalization from the additional restrictions 
imposed by the State. However, these components must continue to be used 
or be otherwise disposed of in accordance with this part.

[[Page 132]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.475  What are the requirements for releasing restrictions 

on property being considered for exchange?

    GSA must consent to the exchange of donated property under Federal 
restrictions or special handling conditions. The donee must have used 
the donated item for its acquired purpose for a minimum of 6 months 
prior to being considered for exchange, and it must be demonstrated that 
the exchange will result in increased utilization value to the donee. As 
a condition of approval of the exchange, the item being exchanged must 
have remained in compliance with the terms and conditions of the 
donation. Otherwise, Sec. 102-37.485 applies. The item acquired by the 
donee must be:
    (a) Made subject to the period of restriction remaining on the item 
exchanged; and
    (b) Of equal or greater value than the item exchanged.

                       Compliance and Utilization


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.480  What must a SASP do to ensure that property is used

for the purpose(s) for which it was donated?

    You must conduct utilization reviews, as provided in your plan of 
operation, to ensure that donees are using surplus property during the 
period of restriction for the purposes for which it was donated. You 
must fully document your efforts and report all instances of 
noncompliance (misuse or mishandling of property) to GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.485  What actions must a SASP take if a review or other

information indicates noncompliance with donation terms and conditions?

    If a review or other information indicates noncompliance with 
donation terms and conditions, you must:
    (a) Promptly investigate any suspected failure to comply with the 
conditions of donated property;
    (b) Notify GSA immediately where there is evidence or allegation of 
fraud, wrongdoing by a screener, or nonuse, misuse, or unauthorized 
disposal or destruction of donated property;
    (c) Temporarily defer any further donations of property to any donee 
to be investigated for noncompliance allegations until such time as the 
investigation has been completed and:
    (1) A determination made that the allegations are unfounded and the 
deferment is removed.
    (2) The allegations are substantiated and the donee is proposed for 
suspension or debarment; and
    (d) Take steps to correct the noncompliance or otherwise enforce the 
conditions imposed on use of the property if a donee is found to be in 
noncompliance. Enforcement of compliance may involve:
    (1) Ensuring the property is used by the present donee for the 
purpose for which it was donated.
    (2) Recovering the property from the donee for:
    (i) Redistribution to another donee within the State;
    (ii) Transfer through GSA to another SASP; or
    (iii) Transfer through GSA to a Federal agency.
    (3) Recovering fair market value or the proceeds of disposal in 
cases of unauthorized disposal or destruction.
    (4) Recovering fair rental value for property in cases where the 
property has been loaned or leased to an ineligible user or used for an 
unauthorized purpose.
    (5) Disposing of by public sale property no longer suitable, usable, 
or necessary for donation.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.490  When must a SASP coordinate with GSA on compliance 

actions?

    You must coordinate with GSA before selling or demanding payment of 
the fair market or fair rental value of donated property that is:
    (a) Subject to any special handling condition or use limitation 
imposed by GSA (see Sec. 102-37.455); or
    (b) Not properly used within 1 year of donation or which ceases to 
be properly used within 1 year of being placed in use.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.495  How must a SASP handle funds derived from compliance

actions?

    You must handle funds derived from compliance actions as follows:
    (a) Enforcement of Federal restrictions. You must promptly remit to 
GSA any funds derived from the enforcement of

[[Page 133]]

compliance involving a violation of any Federal restriction, for deposit 
in the Treasury of the United States. You must also submit any 
supporting documentation indicating the source of the funds and 
essential background information.
    (b) Enforcement of State restrictions. You may retain any funds 
derived from a compliance action involving violation of any State-
imposed restriction and use such funds as provided in your State plan of 
operation.

                        Returns and Reimbursement


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.500  May a donee receive reimbursement for its donation 

expenses when unneeded property is returned to the SASP?

    When a donee returns unneeded property to a SASP, the donee may be 
reimbursed for all or part of the initial cost of any repairs required 
to make the property usable if:
    (a) The property is transferred to a Federal agency or sold for the 
benefit of the U.S. Government;
    (b) No breach of the terms and conditions of donation has occurred; 
and
    (c) GSA authorizes the reimbursement.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.505  How does a donee apply for and receive reimbursement

for unneeded property returned to a SASP?

    If the donee has incurred repair expenses for property it is 
returning to a SASP and wishes to be reimbursed for them, it will inform 
the SASP of this. The SASP will recommend for GSA approval a 
reimbursement amount, taking into consideration the benefit the donee 
has received from the use of the property and making appropriate 
deductions for that use.
    (a) If this property is subsequently transferred to a Federal 
agency, the receiving agency will be required to reimburse the donee as 
a condition of the transfer.
    (b) If the property is sold, the donee will be reimbursed from the 
sales proceeds.

                  Special Provisions Pertaining to SEAs


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.510  Are there special requirements for donating property

to SEAs?

    Yes, only DOD-generated property may be donated to SEAs. When 
donating DOD property to an eligible SEA, SASPs must observe any 
restrictions the sponsoring Military Service may have imposed on the 
types of property the SEA may receive.


<R05>
Sec. 102-37.515  Do SEAs have a priority over other SASP donees for

DOD property?

    Yes, SEAs have a priority over other SASP donees for DOD property, 
but only if DOD requests GSA to allocate surplus DOD property through a 
SASP for donation to a specific SEA. In such cases, DOD would be 
expected to clearly identify the items in question and briefly justify 
the request.

                                disposition by sale, abandonment, or
                                destruction.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(e) Financing and service      (1) Set forth the means and methods for
 charges.                       financing the SASP. When the State

                                participating donees to cover direct and
                                reasonable indirect costs of its
                                activities, the method of establishing
                                the charges must be set forth in the
                                plan.

                                assessed in such cases and include the
                                bases of computation.

                                nominal cost for care and handling of
                                the property.
                               (4) Set forth how funds accumulated from
                                service charges, or from other sources
                                such as sales or compliance proceeds are
                                to be used for the operation of the SASP
                                and the benefit of participating donees.
                               (5) Affirm, if service charge funds are
                                to be deposited or invested, that such
                                deposits or investments are permitted by
                                State law and set forth the types of
                                depositories and/or investments
                                contemplated.
                               (6) Cite State authority to use service
                                charges to acquire or improve SASP
                                facilities and set forth disposition to
                                be made of any financial assets realized
                                upon the sale or other disposal of the
                                facilities.
                               (7) Indicate if the SASP intends to
                                maintain a working capital reserve. If
                                one is to be maintained, the plan should
                                provide the provisions and limitations
                                for it.

                                an excess in the SASP's working capital
                                reserve and provide details of how such
                                refunds are to be made, such as a

                                SASP elects to impose additional terms
                                and conditions, it should list them in

must not be disclosed prior to announcement of award.


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.95  What is an auction?

    An auction is a sale where the bid amounts of different bidders are 
disclosed as they are submitted, providing bidders the option to

with the highest bid at the close of each bidding process is awarded the 
property.

                            Negotiated Sales


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.100  What is a negotiated sale?

as is feasible under the circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.105  Under what conditions may we negotiate sales of

personal property?

    You may negotiate sales of personal property when--
    (a) The personal property has an estimated fair market value that 
does not exceed $15,000;
    (b) The disposal will be to a State, territory, possession, 
political subdivision thereof, or tax-supported agency therein, and the 
estimated fair market value of the property and other satisfactory terms 
of disposal are obtained by negotiation;
    (c) Bid prices after advertising are not reasonable and re-
advertising would serve no useful purpose;
    (d) Public exigency does not permit any delay such as that caused by 
the time required to advertise a sale;
    (e) The sale promotes public health, safety, or national security;
    (f) The sale is in the public interest under a national emergency 
declared by the President or the Congress. This authority may be used 
only with specific lot(s) of property or for categories determined by 
the Administrator of General Services for a designated period but not in 
excess of three months;
    (g) Selling the property competitively would have an adverse impact 
on the national economy, provided that the estimated fair market value 
of the property and other satisfactory terms of disposal can be obtained 
by negotiation, e.g., sale of large quantities of an agricultural 
product that impact domestic markets; or
    (h) Otherwise authorized by Title 40 of the U.S. Code or other law.


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.110  Who approves our determinations to conduct 

negotiated sales?

    The head of your agency (or his/her designee) must approve all 
negotiated sales of personal property.

submit to the oversight committees for the General Services 
Administration (GSA) in the Senate and House, explanatory statements for 
each sale by negotiation of any personal property with an estimated fair 
market value in excess of $15,000. You must maintain copies of the 
explanatory statements in your disposal files. No statement is needed 
for negotiated sales at fixed price or for any sale made without 
advertising when authorized by law other than 40 U.S.C. 545; and
    (b) Report annually to GSA, Personal Property Management Policy 
Division (MTP), 1800 F Street, NW., Washington, DC, 20405, within 60 
calendar days after the close of each fiscal year, a listing and 
description of all negotiated sales of personal property with an 
estimated fair market value in excess of $5,000. You may submit the 
report electronically or manually (see Sec. 102-38.330).


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.120  When may we conduct negotiated sales of 

personal property at fixed prices (fixed price sale)?

    You may sell personal property at fixed prices when the head of your 
agency, or designee, determines in writing that such sale serves the 
best interests of the Government. You must publicize such sale to the 
extent consistent with the value and nature of the property involved, 
and the prices established must reflect the estimated fair market value 
of the property. Property is sold on a first-come, first-served basis. 
You may also establish additional terms and conditions that must be met 
by the successful purchaser.


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.125  May we sell personal property at fixed prices 

to State agencies?

    Yes, before offering to the public, you may offer the property at 
fixed prices

[[Page 147]]

    Yes, you must provide public notice of your sale of personal

    Announcement of the sale using any media that reaches the public and 
is appropriate to the type and value of personal property to be sold is 
considered public advertising. You may also distribute mailings or 
flyers of your offer to sell to prospective purchasers on mailing lists. 
Public notice should be made far enough in advance of the sale to ensure 
adequate notice, and to target your advertising efforts toward the 
market that will provide the best return at the lowest cost.


<R05>

of personal property?

property to be sold?

    Yes, you must allow for an electronic or physical inspection of the

electronic inspections only, due to unusual circumstances prohibiting 
physical inspection, you must notify your General Services 
Administration Regional Personal Property Office in writing, with the 
circumstances surrounding this restriction at least 3 days prior to the 
start of the screening period.


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.150  How long is the inspection period?

    The length of the inspection period allowed depends upon whether the 
inspection is done electronically or physically. You should also 
consider such factors as the circumstances of sale, volume of property, 
type of property, location of the property, and accessibility of the 
sales facility. Normally, you should provide at least 7 calendar days to 
ensure potential buyers have the opportunity to perform needed 
inspections.

                              Offer to Sell


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.155  What is an offer to sell?

    An offer to sell is a notice listing the terms and conditions for 
bidding on an upcoming sale of personal property, where prospective 
purchasers are advised of the requirements for a responsive bid and the 
contractual obligations once a bid is accepted.


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.160  What must be included in the offer to sell?

    The offer to sell must include--
    (a) Sale date and time;
    (b) Method of sale;
    (c) Description of property being offered for sale;
    (d) Selling agency;
    (e) Location of property;
    (f) Time and place for receipt of bids;
    (g) Acceptable forms of bid deposits and payments; and
    (h) Terms and conditions of sale, including any specific

<R05>
Sec. 102-38.165  Are the terms and conditions in the offer 

to sell binding?

    Yes, the terms and conditions in the offer to sell are normally 
incorporated into the sales contract, and therefore

[[Page 148]]

binding upon both the buyer and the seller once a bid is accepted.

                            Buyer Eligibility


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.170  May we sell Federal personal property to anyone?

    Generally, you may sell Federal personal property to anyone of legal 
age. However, certain persons or entities are debarred or suspended from 
purchasing Federal property. You must not enter into a contract with 
such a person or entity unless your agency head or designee responsible 
for the disposal action determines that there is a compelling reason for 
such an action.


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.175  How do we find out if a person or entity has been 

suspended or debarred from doing business with the Government?

    Refer to the List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and 
Nonprocurement Programs to ensure you do not solicit from or award 
contracts to these persons or entities. The list is available through 
subscription from the U.S. Government Printing Office, or electronically 
on the Internet at http://epls.arnet.gov. For policies, procedures, and 
requirements for debarring/suspending a person or entity from the 
purchase of Federal personal property, follow the procedures in the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 9.4 (48 CFR part 9, subpart 
9.4).

[68 FR 51421, Aug. 26, 2003; 68 FR 53219, Sept. 9, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.180  May we sell Federal personal property to a Federal

employee?

    Yes, you may sell Federal personal property to any Federal employee 
whose agency does not prohibit their employees from purchasing such 
property. However, unless allowed by Federal or agency regulations, 
employees having nonpublic information regarding property offered for 
sale may not participate in that sale (see 5 CFR 2635.703). For purposes 
of this section, the term ``Federal employee'' also applies to an 
immediate member of the employee's household.


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.185  May we sell Federal personal property to State or

local governments?

    Yes, you may sell Federal personal property to State or local 
governments. Additional guidelines on sales to State or local 
governments are contained in subpart G of this part.

                           Acceptance of Bids


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.190  What is considered a responsive bid?

    A responsive bid is a bid that complies with the terms and 
conditions of the sales offering, and satisfies the requirements as to 
the method and timeliness of the submission. Only responsive bids may be 
considered for award.


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.195  Must bidders use authorized bid forms?

    No, bidders do not have to use authorized bid forms; however if a 
bidder uses his/her own bid form to submit a bid, the bid may be 
considered only if--
    (a) The bidder accepts all the terms and conditions of the offer to 
sell; and
    (b) Award of the bid would result in a binding contract.


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.200  Who may accept bids?

    Authorized agency representatives may accept bids for your agency. 
These individuals should meet your agency's requirements for approval of 
Government contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.205  Must we accept all bids?

    No, the Government reserves the right to accept or reject any or all 
bids. You may reject any or all bids when such action is advantageous to 
the Government, or when it is in the public interest to do so.


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.210  What happens when bids have been rejected?

    You may re-offer items for which all bids have been rejected at the 
same sale, if possible, or another sale.


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.215  When may we disclose the bid results to the public?

    You may disclose bid results to the public after the sales award of 
any item or lot of property. On occasions when there is open bidding, 
usually at a spot bid sale or auction, all bids are

[[Page 149]]

disclosed as they are submitted. No information other than names may be 
disclosed regarding the bidder(s).


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.220  What must we do when the highest bids received have 

the same bid amount?

    When the highest bids received have the same bid amount, you must 
consider other factors of the sale (e.g., timely removal of the 
property, terms of payment, etc.) that would make one offer more 
advantageous to the Government. However, if you are unable to make a 
determination based on available information, and the Government has an 
acceptable offer, you may re-offer the property for sale, or you may 
utilize random tiebreakers to avoid the expense of reselling the 
property.


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.225  What are the additional requirements in the bid process?

    All sales except fixed price sales must contain a certification of 
independent price determination. If there is suspicion of false 
certification or an indication of collusion, you must refer the matter 
to the Department of Justice or your agency's Office of the Inspector 
General.

                              Bid Deposits


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.230  Is a bid deposit required to buy personal property?

    No, a bid deposit is not required to buy personal property. However, 
should you require a bid deposit to protect the Government's interest, a 
deposit of 20 percent of the total amount of the bid is generally 
considered reasonable.


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.235  What types of payment may we accept as bid deposits?

    In addition to the acceptable types of payments in Sec. 102-38.290, 
you may also accept a deposit bond. A deposit bond may be used in lieu 
of cash or other acceptable form of deposit when permitted by the offer 
to sell, such as the Standard Form (SF) 150, Deposit Bond--Individual 
Invitation, Sale of Government Personal Property, SF 151, Deposit Bond--
Annual, Sale of Government Personal Property, and SF 28, Affidavit of 
Individual Surety. For information on how to obtain these forms, see 
Sec. 102-2.135 of subchapter A.


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.240  What happens to the deposit bond if the bidder 

defaults or wants to withdraw his/her bid?

    (a) When a bid deposit is secured by a deposit bond and the bidder 
defaults, you must issue a notice of default to the bidder and the 
surety company.
    (b) When a bid deposit is secured by a deposit bond and the bidder 
wants to withdraw his/her bid, you should return the deposit bond to the 
bidder.

                                Late Bids


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.245  Do we consider late bids for award?

    Consider late bids for award only when the bids were delivered 
timely to the address specified and your agency caused the delay in 
delivering the bids to the official designated to accept the bids.


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.250  How do we handle late bids that are not considered?

    Late bids that are not considered must be returned to the bidder 
promptly. You must not disclose information contained in returned bids.

                   Modification or Withdrawal of Bids


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.255  May we allow a bidder to modify or withdraw a bid?

    (a) Yes, a bidder may modify or withdraw a bid prior to the start of 
the sale or the time set for the opening of the bids. After the start of 
the sale, or the time set for opening the bids, the bidder will not be 
allowed to withdraw his/her bid.
    (b) You may consider late modifications to an otherwise successful 
bid at any time, but only when it makes the terms of the bid more 
favorable to the Government.

                            Mistakes in Bids


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.260  Who makes the administrative determinations 

regarding mistakes in bids?

    The administrative procedures for handling mistakes in bids are 
contained in FAR 14.407, Mistakes in Bids (48 CFR 14.407). Your agency 
head, or his/her designee, may delegate the authority to make 
administrative decisions regarding mistakes in bids to a central 
authority, or a limited number

[[Page 150]]

of authorities in your agency, who must not re-delegate this authority.


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.265  Must we keep records on administrative determinations?

    Yes, you must--
    (a) Maintain records of all administrative determinations made, to 
include the pertinent facts and the action taken in each case. A copy of 
the determination must be attached to its corresponding contract; and
    (b) Provide a signed copy of any related determination with the copy 
of the contract you file with the Comptroller General when requested.


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.270  May a bidder protest the determinations made on sales 

of personal property?

    Yes, protests regarding the validity or the determinations made on 
the sale of personal property may be submitted to the Comptroller 
General.

<R05>
Sec. 102-38.275  To whom do we award the sales contract?

    You must award the sales contract to the bidder with the highest 
responsive bid, unless a determination is made to reject the bid under 
Sec. 102-38.205.


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.280  What happens when there is no award?

    When there is no award made, you may sell the personal property at 
another sale, or you may abandon or destroy it pursuant to Sec. 102-
36.305 of this subchapter B.

                            Transfer of Title


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.285  How do we transfer title from the Government to 

the buyer for personal property sold?

    (a) Generally, no specific form or format is designated for 
transferring title from the Government to the buyer for personal 
property sold. For internal control and accountability, you must execute 
a bill of sale or another document as evidence of transfer of title or 
any other interest in Government personal property. You must also ensure 
that the buyer submits any additional certifications to comply with 
specific conditions and restrictions of the sale.
    (b) For sales of vehicles, you must issue to the purchaser a 
Standard Form (SF) 97, the United States Government Certificate to 
Obtain Title to a Vehicle, or a SF 97A, the United States Government 
Certificate to Obtain a Non-Repairable or Salvage Certificate, as 
appropriate, as evidence of transfer of title. For information on how to 
obtain these forms, see Sec. 102-2.135 of this chapter.

                                Payments


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.290  What types of payment may we accept?

    You must adopt a payment policy that protects the Government against 
fraud. Acceptable payments include, but are not limited to, the 
following:
    (a) U.S. currency or any form of credit instrument made payable on 
demand in U.S. currency, e.g., cashier's check, money order. Promissory 
notes and postdated credit instruments are not acceptable.
    (b) Irrevocable commercial letters of credit issued by a United 
States bank payable to the Treasurer of the United States or to the 
Government agency conducting the sale.
    (c) Credit or debit cards.

                         Disposition of Proceeds


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.295  May we retain sales proceeds?

    (a) You may retain that portion of the sales proceeds equal to the 
direct costs and reasonably related indirect costs incurred in selling 
surplus personal property.
    (b) You may retain all sales proceeds when--
    (1) You have statutory authority to retain all proceeds from sales 
of personal property;
    (2) You sold property acquired with non-appropriated funds as 
defined in Sec. 102-36.40 of this subchapter B;
    (3) You sold surplus Government property that was in the custody of 
a contractor or subcontractor and the contract or subcontract provisions 
authorize the proceeds of sale to be credited to the price or cost of 
the contract or subcontract;

[[Page 151]]

    (4) You sold property to obtain replacement property under the 
exchange/sale authority pursuant to part 102-39 of this subchapter B; or
    (5) You sold property related to waste prevention and recycling 
programs, under the authority of Section 607 of Public Law 107-67 
(Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 
1999, Public Law 107-67, 115 Stat. 514). Consult your General Counsel or 
Chief Financial Officer for guidance on use of this authority.


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.300  What happens to sales proceeds that we are not 

authorized to retain or that are unused?

    Any sales proceeds that are not retained pursuant to the authorities 
in Sec. 102-38.295 must be deposited as miscellaneous receipts in the 
U.S. Treasury.

                                Disputes


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.305  How do we handle disputes involved in the sale 

of Federal personal property?

    First contact your Office of General Counsel. Further guidance can 
be found in the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, as amended (41 U.S.C. 
601-613), and the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR part 
33.


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.310  Are we required to use the Disputes clause in the 

sale of personal property?

    Yes, you must ensure the Disputes clause contained in Federal

all offers to sell and contracts for the sale of personal property.


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.315  Are we required to use Alternative Disputes

Resolution for sales contracts?

    No, you are not required to use Alternative Disputes Resolution 
(ADR) for sales contracts. However, you are encouraged to use ADR 
procedures in accordance with the authority and the requirements of the 
Alternative Disputes Resolution Act of 1998 (28 U.S.C. 651-658).


<R04>
                   Subpart E_Other Governing Statutes


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.320  Are there other statutory requirements governing 

the sale of Federal personal property?

    Yes, in addition to Title 40 of the U.S. Code the sale of Federal 
personal property is governed by other statutory requirements, such as 
the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-134, sec. 
31001, 110 Stat. 1321-358) and antitrust requirements that are discussed 
in Sec. 102-38.325.

                         Antitrust Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.325  What are the requirements pertaining to antitrust laws?

    When the sale of personal property has an estimated fair market 
value of $3 million or more or if the sale involves a patent, process, 
technique, or invention, you must notify the Attorney General of the 
Department of Justice (DOJ) and get DOJ's opinion as to whether the sale 
would give the buyer an unfair advantage in the marketplace and violate 
any antitrust laws. Include in the notification the description and 
location of the property, method of sale and proposed selling price, and 
information on the proposed purchaser and intended use of the property. 
You must not complete the sale until you have received confirmation from 
the Attorney General that the proposed transaction would not violate any 
antitrust laws.

<R04>
                    Subpart F_Reporting Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 102-38.330  Are there any reports that we must submit to the

Services Administration (GSA), Personal Property Management Policy 
Division (MTP), 1800 F Street, NW., Washington, DC 20405--
    (a) Negotiated sales report. Within 60 calendar days after the close 
of each fiscal year, you must provide GSA with a listing and description 
of all negotiated sales with an estimated fair

[[Page 152]]

market value in excess of $5,000 (see Sec. 102-38.115). For each 
negotiated sale that meets this criterion, provide the following:
    (1) Description of the property (including quantity and condition).
    (2) Acquisition cost and date (if not known, estimate and so 
indicate).
    (3) Estimated fair market value (including date of estimate and name 
of estimator).

<R05>
Sec. 102-38.345  Do we have to withdraw personal property advertised 

for public sale if a State Agency for Surplus Property wants to buy it?

    No, you are not required to withdraw the item from public sale if 
the property has been advertised.


<R05>

governments regarding negotiated sales?

    Yes, you must waive the requirement for bid deposits and payment 
prior to removal of the property. However, payment must be made within

<R05>
Sec. 102-39.5  How are the terms ``I'' and ``you'' used in this part?

    Use of pronouns ``I'' and ``you'' throughout this part refer to 
executive agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 102-39.10  What does this part cover?

    This part covers the exchange/sale authority, and applies to all 
personal property owned by executive agencies worldwide. For the 
exchange/sale of aircraft parts and hazardous materials, you must meet 
the requirements in this part and in parts 101-33 and 101-42 of this 
title.

[66 FR 48614, Sept. 21, 2001, as amended at 69 FR 11539, Mar. 11, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 102-39.15  Why should I use the exchange/sale authority?

    You should use the exchange/sale authority to:
    (a) Reduce the cost of replacement personal property. If you have 
personal property that needs to be replaced, you can exchange or sell 
that property and apply the exchange allowance or sales proceeds to 
reduce the cost of similar replacement property. By contrast, if you 
choose not to replace the property using the exchange/sale authority, 
you may declare it excess and dispose of it through the normal disposal 
process. Any sales proceeds from the eventual sale of that property as 
surplus generally must be forwarded to the miscellaneous receipts 
account at the United States Treasury and thus would not be available to 
you.
    (b) Avoid costs (e.g., administrative and storage) that may be 
incurred when declaring the property to be replaced as excess and 
processing it through the normal disposal process. The normal disposal 
process may include abandonment or destruction, reutilization by other 
Federal agencies, donation to eligible non-Federal public or non-profit 
organizations, or sale to the public. The time required to determine 
which of these options will apply and to complete the disposal 
transaction is likely to exceed the time required for an exchange/sale 
transaction.


<R05>
Sec. 102-39.20  What definitions apply to this part?

    The following definitions apply to this part:
    Acquire means to procure or otherwise obtain personal property, 
including by lease.
    Combat material means arms, ammunition, and implements of war listed 
in the U.S. munitions list (22 CFR part 121).
    Exchange means to replace personal property by trade or trade-in 
with the supplier of the replacement property.
    Exchange/sale means to exchange or sell non-excess, non-surplus 
personal property and apply the exchange allowance or proceeds of sale 
in whole or in part payment for the acquisition of similar property.
    Executive agency means any executive department or independent 
establishment in the executive branch of the Government, including any 
wholly owned Government corporation.
    Federal agency means any executive agency or any establishment in 
the legislative or judicial branch of the Government (except the Senate, 
the House of Representatives, and the Architect of the Capitol and any 
activities under his/her direction).
    Historic item means property having added value for display purposes 
because its historical significance is greater than its fair market 
value for continued use. Items that are commonly available and remain in 
use for

[[Page 154]]

their intended purpose, such as military aircraft still in use by active 
or reserve units, are not historic items.
    Replacement means the process of acquiring property to be used in 
place of property that is still needed but:
    (1) No longer adequately performs the tasks for which it is used; or
    (2) Does not meet the agency's need as well as the property to be 
acquired.
    Similar means where the acquired item and replaced item:
    (1) Are identical;
    (2) Are designed and constructed for the same purpose;
    (3) Constitute parts or containers for identical or similar end 
items; or
    (4) Fall within a single Federal Supply Classification (FSC) group 
of property that is eligible for handling under the exchange/sale 
authority.

                 Subpart B_Exchange/Sale Considerations


<R05>
Sec. 102-39.30  When should I not use the exchange/sale authority?

    You should not use the exchange/sale authority if the exchange 
allowance or estimated sales proceeds for the property will be 
unreasonably low. You must either abandon or destroy such property, or 
declare the property excess, in accordance with part 102-36 of this 
chapter. Further, you must not use the exchange/sale authority if the 
transaction(s) would violate any other applicable statute or regulation.

[66 FR 48614, Sept. 21, 2001, as amended at 69 FR 11539, Mar. 11, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 102-39.35  How do I determine whether to do an exchange or a sale?

    You must determine whether an exchange or sale will provide the 
greater return for the Government. When estimating the return under each 
method, consider all related administrative and overhead costs.


<R05>
Sec. 102-39.40  When should I arrange for a reimbursable transfer of 

exchange/sale property to a Federal agency or other eligible 
organization, or sell such property to a State Agency for Surplus 
Property?

    If you have property to replace which is eligible for exchange/sale, 
you should first, to the maximum extent practicable, solicit:
    (a) Federal agencies known to use or distribute such property. If a 
Federal agency is interested in acquiring and paying for the property, 
you should arrange for a reimbursable transfer. Reimbursable transfers 
may also be conducted with the Senate, the House of Representatives, the 
Architect of the Capitol and any activities under the Architect's 
direction, the District of Columbia, and mixed-ownership Government 
corporations. When conducting a reimbursable transfer, you must:
    (1) Do so under terms mutually agreeable to you and the recipient.
    (2) Not require reimbursement of an amount greater than the 
estimated fair market value of the transferred property.
    (3) Apply the transfer proceeds in whole or part payment for 
property acquired to replace the transferred property; and
    (b) State Agencies for Surplus Property (SASPs) known to have an 
interest in acquiring such property. If a SASP is interested in 
acquiring the property, you should consider selling it to the SASP by 
negotiated sale at fixed price under the conditions specified at Sec. 
102-38.125 of this title. The sales proceeds must be applied in whole or 
part payment for property acquired to replace the transferred property.

[66 FR 48614, Sept. 21, 2001, as amended at 69 FR 11539, Mar. 11, 2004]

    (e) Scrap materials, except in the case of scrap gold for fine gold.
    (f) Property that was originally acquired as excess or forfeited 
property or from another source other than new procurement, unless such 
property has been in official use by the acquiring agency for at least 1 
year. You may exchange or sell forfeited property in official use for 
less than 1 year if the head of your agency determines that a continuing 
valid requirement exists, but the specific item in use no longer meets 
that requirement, and that exchange or sale meets all other requirements 
of this part.
    (g) Property that is dangerous to public health or safety without 
first rendering such property innocuous or providing for adequate 
safeguards as part of the exchange/sale.
    (h) Combat material without demilitarizing it or obtaining a

Congress, or the Administrator of General Services; or
    (3) Contractual obligation.
    (l) Vessels subject to 40 U.S.C. 584.

<R05>

acquired;
    (b) The property exchanged or sold is not excess or surplus, and you 
have a continuing need for that type of property;

principal purpose of exchange or sale; and

exchange allowance or sale proceeds will be applied to the acquisition 
of replacement property.


<R05>
Sec. 102-39.55  What exceptions apply to the conditions for

    Exchange of property may be accomplished by either of the following 
methods:
    (a) The supplier (e.g., a Government agency, commercial or private 
organization, or an individual) delivers the replacement property to one 
of your organizational units and removes the property being replaced 
from that same organizational unit.
    (b) The supplier delivers the replacement property to one of your 
organizational units and removes the property being replaced from a 
different organizational unit.


<R05>
Sec. 102-39.65  What are the sales methods?

through 102-38.115 of this title regarding negotiated sales. Section 
3709, Revised Statutes (41 U.S.C. 5), specifies the following conditions 
under which property being replaced can be sold by negotiation, subject 
to obtaining such competition as is feasible:
    (1) The reasonable value involved in the contract does not exceed 
$500; or
    (2) Otherwise authorized by law.
    (b) You may sell property being replaced by negotiation at fixed 
prices in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 102-38.120 and 102-
38.125 of this title.

was sold and for one fiscal year thereafter for obligation for the 
purchase of replacement property. Any sales proceeds not applied to 
replacement purchases during this time must be deposited in the United 
States Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.


<R05>
Sec. 102-39.75  What information am I required to report?

    (a) You must submit, within 90 calendar days after the close of each 
fiscal year, a summary report in a format of your choice on the 
exchange/sale transactions made under this part during the fiscal year 
(except for transactions involving books and periodicals in your

                      Subpart A_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 102-41.5  What does this part cover?

located elsewhere must be in accordance with holding agency regulations. 
Please see Sec. 102-36.380 of this subchapter B regarding the disposal 
of foreign excess. The General Services Administration (GSA) does not 
normally accept responsibility for disposal of property located outside 
the United States and its territories. Additional guidance on 
disposition of seized, forfeited, voluntarily abandoned, and unclaimed 
personal property that requires special handling (e.g., firearms, 
hazardous materials) is contained in part 101-42 of this title. 
Additional guidance on the disposition of firearms (as scrap only), 
distilled spirits, wine, beer, and drug paraphernalia is provided in 
subpart E of this part.
    (b) These regulations do not include disposal of seized, forfeited, 
voluntarily abandoned, and unclaimed personal property covered under

    Use of pronouns ``we'', ``you'', and their variants throughout this 
part refer to the agency having custody of the personal property.


<R05>
Sec. 102-41.15  How do we request a deviation from these 

requirements and who can approve it?

    See Sec. Sec. 102-2.60 through 102-2.110 of this chapter to request 
a deviation from the requirements of this part.

                               Definitions


<R05>
Sec. 102-41.20  What definitions apply to this part?

    The following definitions apply to this part:
    Beer means an alcoholic beverage made from malted cereal grain,

including all dilutions and mixtures thereof, for non-industrial use.

[[Page 159]]

    Drug paraphernalia means any equipment, product, or material 
primarily intended or designed for use in manufacturing, compounding, 
converting, concealing, processing, preparing, or introducing into the 
human body a controlled substance in violation of the Controlled 
Substances Act (see 21 U.S.C. 863). It includes items primarily for use

cocaine, hashish, hashish oil, PCP, or amphetamines into the human body.
    Eleemosynary institution means any nonprofit health or medical 
institution that is organized and operated for charitable purposes.
    Firearms means any weapon, silencer, or destructive device designed

U.S.C. 211.

                             Responsibility


<R05>
Sec. 102-41.25  Who retains custody and is responsible for the 

reporting, care, and handling of property covered by this part?

    You, the holding agency, normally retain physical custody of the 
property and are responsible for its care and handling pending final 
disposition. With the exception of property listed in Sec. 102-41.35, 
you must report promptly to the GSA forfeited, voluntarily abandoned, or 
unclaimed personal property not being retained for official use and 
seized property on which proceedings for forfeiture by court decree are 
being started or have begun. In general, the procedures for reporting 
such property parallel those for reporting excess personal property 
under part 102-36 of this subchapter B.


<R05>
Sec. 102-41.30  What is GSA's role in the disposition of property 

covered by this part?

    (a) Seized property subject to court proceedings for forfeiture. (1) 
If the seizing agency files a request for the property for its official 
use, the GSA Region 3/National Capital Region will apply to the court 
for an order to turn the property over to the agency should forfeiture 
be decreed. If no such request has been filed, GSA will determine 
whether retention of the property for Federal official use is in the 
Government's best interest, and, if so, will apply to the court to order 
delivery of the property to--
    (i) Any other Federal agency that requests it; or
    (ii) The seizing agency to be retained for a reasonable time in case 
the property may later become necessary to any agency for official use.
    (2) In the event that the property is not ordered by competent 
authority to be forfeited to the United States, it may be returned to 
the claimant.
    (b) Forfeited, voluntarily abandoned, or unclaimed property. When 
forfeited, voluntarily abandoned, or unclaimed property is reported to 
GSA for disposal, GSA will direct its disposition by--
    (1) Transfer to another Federal agency;

[[Page 160]]

    (2) Donation to an eligible recipient, if the property is not needed 
by a Federal agency and there are no requirements for reimbursement to 
satisfy the claims of owners, lien holders, or other lawful claimants;
    (3) Sale; or
    (4) Abandonment and destruction in accordance with Sec. 102-36.305 
of this subchapter B.


<R05>
Sec. 102-41.35  Do we report to GSA all seized personal property

subject to judicial forfeiture as well as forfeited, voluntarily 
abandoned, or unclaimed personal property not retained for official use?

    Yes, send GSA reports of excess (see Sec. 102-36.125 of this 
subchapter B) for all seized personal property subject to judicial 
forfeiture as well as forfeited, voluntarily abandoned, or unclaimed 
personal property not required for official use, except the following, 
whose disposition is covered under other statutes and authorities:
    (a) Forfeited firearms or munitions of war seized by the Department 
of Commerce and transferred to the Department of Defense (DOD) pursuant 
to 22 U.S.C. 401.
    (b) Forfeited firearms directly transferable to DOD by law.
    (c) Seeds, plants, or misbranded packages seized by the Department 
of Agriculture.
    (d) Game animals and equipment (other than vessels, including cargo) 
seized by the Department of the Interior.
    (e) Files of papers and undeliverable mail in the custody of the 
United States Postal Service.
    (f) Articles in the custody of the Department of Commerce Patent and 
Trademark Office that are in violation of laws governing trademarks or 
patents.
    (g) Unclaimed and voluntarily abandoned personal property subject to 
laws and regulations of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 
Department of Homeland Security.
    (h) Property seized in payment of or as security for debts arising 
under the internal revenue laws.
    (i) Lost, abandoned, or unclaimed personal property the Coast Guard 
or the military services are authorized to dispose of under 10 U.S.C.

unclaimed personal property?

    You may either retain or dispose of unclaimed abandoned personal 
property based on the following circumstances:

for official use if you have held the unclaimed property for 30 calendar 
days and the former owner has not filed a claim. After 30 days, title 
vests in the Government and you may retain the unclaimed property for 
official use. Large sedans and limousines which may only be retained for

required to hold unclaimed property for 30 days, if you decide to

any valid claim filed within this 3-year period.

when he or she files a claim for unclaimed personal property that we 
no longer have?

property, less the costs of the Government's care and handling of the

a foreign gift or decoration?

    Employees, with the approval of their employing agencies, may accept 
and retain:
    (a) Gifts of minimal value received as souvenirs or marks of 
courtesy. When a gift of more than minimal value is accepted, the gift 
becomes the property of the U.S. Government, not the employee, and must 
be reported.
    (b) Decorations that have been offered or awarded for outstanding or 
unusually meritorious performance. If the employing agency disapproves 
retention of the decoration by the employee, the decoration becomes the 
property of the U.S. Government.

decorations that employees are not authorized to retain?

    (a) Non-monetary gifts or decorations. When an employee receives a

employing agency within 60 days after accepting it.
    (2) The employing agency determines if it will keep the gift or 
decoration for official use.

keep it for official use, the employing agency reports it as excess 
personal property to GSA for Federal utilization screening under Sec. 
102-42.95.
    (4) If GSA does not transfer the gift or decoration during
    Federal utilization screening, the employee may purchase the gift or 
decoration (see Sec. 102-42.140).
    (5) If the employee declines to purchase the gift or decoration, and 
there is no Federal requirement for either, GSA may offer it for 
donation through State Agencies for Surplus Property (SASP) under part 
102-37 of this subchapter B.
    (6) If no SASP requests the gift or decoration for donation, GSA may 
offer it for public sale, with the approval of the Secretary of State, 
or will authorize the destruction of the gift or decoration under part 
102-38 of this subchapter B.
    (b) Monetary gifts. When an employee receives a monetary gift above 
the minimal value:
    (1) The employee must report the gift to his/her employing agency 
within 60 days after accepting it.
    (2) The employing agency must:
    (i) Report a monetary gift with possible historic or numismatic 
(i.e., collectible) value to GSA; or
    (ii) Deposit a monetary gift that has no historic or numismatic 
value with the Department of the Treasury.

authority mentioned in Sec. 102-72.30(b) to lease general purpose space 
itself, it may be delegated, upon request, lease management authority to 
manage the administration of one or more lease contracts awarded by GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 102-72.75  What are the requirements for obtaining a delegation

of lease management authority (contracting officer representative 
authority) from GSA?

    An Executive agency may be delegated lease management authority when 
it--
    (a) Occupies at least 90 percent of the building's GSA-controlled 
space or has the written concurrence of 100 percent of rent-paying 
occupants covered under the lease to perform this function; and
    (b) Demonstrates the ability to perform the delegated lease 
management responsibilities.


<R05>
Sec. 102-72.80  What are Executive agencies' responsibilities 

under a disposal of real property delegation of authority

property and to grant approvals and make determinations, subject to the 
conditions in the delegation document.

[[Page 182]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-72.85  What are the requirements for obtaining a 

disposal of real property delegation of authority from GSA?

    While disposal delegations to Executive agencies are infrequent, GSA 
may delegate authority to them based on situations involving certain 
low-value properties and when they can demonstrate that they have the 
technical expertise to perform the disposition functions. GSA may grant 
special delegations of authority to Executive agencies for the 
utilization and disposal of certain real property through the procedures 
set forth in part 102-75, subpart F of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 102-72.90  What are Executive agencies' responsibilities 

under a security delegation of authority from GSA?

    Law enforcement and related security functions were transferred to 
the Department of Homeland Security upon its establishment in 2002. The 
Homeland Security Act authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security, in 
consultation with the Administrator of General Services, to issue 
regulations necessary for the protection and administration of property 
owned or occupied by the Federal Government and persons on the property. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, GSA retained all powers, functions and 
authorities necessary for the operation, maintenance, and protection of 
buildings and grounds owned and occupied by the Federal Government and 
under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 102-72.95  What are the requirements for obtaining a security

delegation of authority from GSA?

    An Executive agency may request a security delegation from GSA by 
submitting a written request with the detailed basis for the requested 
delegation to the Assistant Regional Administrator, PBS, in the region 
where the building is located. A request for multiple buildings in 
multiple regions should be directed to the Commissioner of PBS. The 
delegation may be granted where the requesting agency demonstrates a 
compelling need for the delegated authority and the delegation is not 
inconsistent with the authorities of any other law enforcement agency.


<R05>
Sec. 102-72.100  What are Executive agencies' responsibilities 

under a utility service delegation of authority from GSA?

    With this delegation, Executive agencies have the authority to 
negotiate and execute utility services contracts for periods over one 
year but not exceeding ten years for their use and benefit. Agencies 
also have the authority to intervene in utility rate proceedings to 
represent the consumer interests of the Federal Government, if so 
provided in the delegation of authority.


<R05>
Sec. 102-72.105  What are the requirements for obtaining a

utility services delegation of authority from GSA?

    Executive agencies may be delegated utility services authority when 
they have the technical expertise and adequate staffing.

<R04>
                      Subpart A_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 102-73.5  What is the scope of this part?

    The real property policies contained in this part apply to Federal 
agencies, including GSA's Public Buildings Service (PBS), operating 
under, or subject to, the authorities of the Administrator of General 
Services.


<R05>
Sec. 102-73.10  What is the basic real estate acquisition policy?

    When seeking to acquire space, Federal agencies should first seek 
space in Government-owned and Government-leased buildings. If suitable 
Government-controlled space is unavailable, Federal agencies must 
acquire real estate and related services in an efficient and cost 
effective manner.


<R05>
Sec. 102-73.15  What real estate acquisition and related 

services may Federal agencies provide?

    Federal agencies, upon approval from GSA, may provide real estate 
acquisition and related services, including leasing (with or without 
purchase options), building and/or site purchase, condemnation, and 
relocation assistance. For information on the design and construction of 
Federal facilities, see part 102-76 of this chapter.

[[Page 185]]

              United States Postal Service-Controlled Space


<R05>
Sec. 102-73.20  Are Federal agencies required to give priority

consideration to space in buildings under the custody and control
of the United States Postal 
          Service in fulfilling Federal agency space needs?

    Yes, after considering the availability of GSA-controlled space and 
determining that no such space is available to meet its needs, Federal 
agencies must extend priority consideration to available space in 
buildings under the custody and control of the United States Postal 
Service (USPS) in fulfilling Federal agency space needs, as specified in 
the ``Agreement Between General Services Administration and the United 
States Postal Service Covering Real and Personal Property Relationships 
and Associated Services,'' dated July 1985.

                       Locating Federal Facilities


<R05>
Sec. 102-73.25  What policies must Executive agencies comply

with in locating Federal facilities?

    Executive agencies must comply with the location policies in this 
part and part 102-83 of this chapter.

                          Historic Preservation


<R05>
Sec. 102-73.30  What historic preservation provisions must Federal 

agencies comply with prior to acquiring, constructing, or leasing space?

    Prior to acquiring, constructing, or leasing space, Federal agencies 
must comply with the provisions of section 110(a) of the National 
Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (16 U.S.C. 470h-2(a)), 
regarding the use of historic properties. Federal agencies can find 
guidance on protecting, enhancing, and preserving historic and cultural 
property in part 102-78 of this chapter.

                         Prospectus Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 102-73.35  Is a prospectus required for all acquisition,

construction, or alteration projects?

    No, a prospectus is not required if the dollar value of a project 
does not exceed the prospectus threshold. 40 U.S.C. 3307 establishes a 
prospectus threshold, applicable to Federal agencies operating under, or 
subject to, the authorities of the Administrator of General Services, 
for the construction, alteration, purchase, and acquisition of any 
building to be used as a public building, and establishes a prospectus 
threshold to lease any space for use for public purposes. The current 
prospectus threshold value for each fiscal year can be accessed by 
entering GSA's Web site at http://www.gsa.gov and then inserting 
``prospectus thresholds'' in the search mechanism in the upper right-
hand corner of the page.


<R05>
Sec. 102-73.40  What happens if the dollar value of the project 

exceeds the prospectus threshold?

    Projects require approval by the Senate and the House of 
Representatives if the dollar value of a project exceeds the prospectus 
threshold. To obtain this approval, the Administrator of General 
Services will transmit the proposed prospectuses to Congress for 
consideration by the Senate and the House of Representatives. 
Furthermore, as indicated in Sec. 102-72.30(b), the general purpose 
lease delegation authority is restricted to below the prospectus 
threshold, and therefore, GSA must conduct all lease acquisitions over 
the threshold.


<R04>
                     Subpart B_Acquisition by Lease


<R05>
Sec. 102-73.45  When may Federal agencies consider leases of

privately owned land and buildings to satisfy their space needs?

    Federal agencies may consider leases of privately owned land and 
buildings only when needs cannot be met satisfactorily in Government-
controlled space and one or more of the following conditions exist:
    (a) Leasing is more advantageous to the Government than constructing 
a new building, or more advantageous than altering an existing Federal 
building.
    (b) New construction or alteration is unwarranted because demand for 
space in the community is insufficient, or is indefinite in scope or 
duration.
    (c) Federal agencies cannot provide for the completion of a new 
building within a reasonable time.

[[Page 186]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-73.50  Are Federal agencies that possess independent 

statutory authority to acquire leased space subject to requirements
of this part?

    No, Federal agencies possessing independent statutory authority to 
acquire leased space are not subject to GSA authority and, therefore, 
may not be subject to the requirements of this part. However, lease 
prospectus approval requirements of 40 U.S.C. Section 3307 may still 
apply appropriations to lease of space for public purposes under an 
agency's independent leasing authority.


<R05>
Sec. 102-73.55  On what basis must Federal agencies acquire leases?

    Federal agencies must acquire leases on the most favorable basis to 
the Federal Government, with due consideration to maintenance and 
operational efficiency, and at charges consistent with prevailing market 
rates for comparable facilities in the community.


<R05>
Sec. 102-73.60  With whom may Federal agencies enter into lease 

agreements?

    Federal agencies, upon approval from GSA, may enter into lease 
agreements with any person, partnership, corporation, or other public or 
private entity, provided that such lease agreements do not bind the 
Government for periods in excess of twenty years (40 U.S.C. 585(a)). 
Federal agencies may not enter into lease agreements with persons who 
are barred from contracting with the Federal Government (e.g., Members 
of Congress or debarred or suspended contractors).


<R05>
Sec. 102-73.65  Are there any limitations on leasing certain types

of space?

    Yes, the limitations on leasing certain types of space are as 
follows:
    (a) In general, Federal agencies may not lease any space to 
accommodate computer and telecommunications operations; secure or 
sensitive activities related to the national defense or security; or a 
permanent courtroom, judicial chamber, or administrative office for any 
United States court, if the average annual net rental cost of leasing 
such space would exceed the prospectus threshold (40 U.S.C. 3307(f)(1)).
    (b) However, Federal agencies may lease such space if the 
Administrator of General Services first determines that leasing such 
space is necessary to meet requirements that cannot be met in public 
buildings, and then submits such determination to the Committee on 
Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives in 
accordance with 40 U.S.C. 3307(f)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 102-73.70  Are Executive agencies required to acquire leased 

space by negotiation?

    Yes, Executive agencies must acquire leased space by negotiation, 
except where the sealed bid procedure is required by the Competition in 
Contracting Act, as amended (CICA) (41 U.S.C. 253(a)).


<R05>
Sec. 102-73.75  What functions must Federal agencies perform with

regard to leasing building space?

    Federal agencies, upon approval from GSA, must perform all functions 
of leasing building space, and land incidental thereto, for their use 
except as provided in this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 102-73.80  Who is authorized to contact lessor, offerors, or 

potential offerors concerning space leased or to be leased?

    No one, except the Contracting Officer or his or her designee, may 
contact lessors, offerors, or potential offerors concerning space leased 
or to be leased for the purpose of making oral or written representation 
or commitments or agreements with respect to the terms of occupancy of 
particular space, tenant improvements, alterations and repairs, or 
payment for overtime services.


<R05>
Sec. 102-73.85  Can agencies with independent statutory authority 

to lease space have GSA perform the leasing functions?

    Yes, upon request, GSA may perform, on a reimbursable basis, all 
functions of leasing building space, and land incidental thereto, for 
Federal agencies possessing independent statutory authority to lease 
space. However, GSA reserves the right to accept or reject

[[Page 187]]

reimbursable leasing service requests on a case-by-case basis.


<R05>
Sec. 102-73.90  What contingent fee policy must Federal agencies

apply to the acquisition of real property by lease?

    Federal agencies must apply the contingent fee policies in 48 CFR 
3.4 to all negotiated and sealed bid contracts for the acquisition of 
real property by lease. Federal agencies must appropriately adapt the 
representations and covenants required by that subpart for use in leases 
of real property for Government use.


<R05>
Sec. 102-73.95  How are Federal agencies required to assist GSA?

    The heads of Federal agencies must--
    (a) Cooperate with and assist the Administrator of General Services 
in carrying out his responsibilities respecting office buildings and 
space;
    (b) Take measures to give GSA early notice of new or changing space 
requirements;
    (c) Seek to economize their requirements for space; and
    (d) Continuously review their needs for space in and near the 
District of Columbia, taking into account the feasibility of 
decentralizing services or activities that can be carried on elsewhere 
without excessive costs or significant loss of efficiency.

                 Competition in Contracting Act of 1984


<R05>
Sec. 102-73.100  Is the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984, 

as amended (CICA), applicable to lease acquisition?

    Yes, Executive agencies must obtain full and open competition among 
suitable locations meeting minimum Government requirements, except as 
otherwise provided by CICA, 41 U.S.C. 253.

            National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA)

Sec. 102-73.110  What rules must Executive agencies follow when 

acquiring leasehold interests in buildings constructed for Federal
Government use?

contract that will result in the construction of a building;
    (b) Use competitive procedures;
    (c) Inspect every building during construction to ensure that the 
building complies with the Government's specifications;
    (d) Evaluate every building after completion of construction to 
determine that the building complies with the Government's 
specifications; and
    (e) Ensure that any contract that will result in the construction of 
a building contains provisions permitting the Government to reduce the 
rent during any period when the building does not comply with the 
Government's specifications.

                Price Preference for Historic Properties


<R05>
Sec. 102-73.115  Must Federal agencies offer a price preference to

space in historic properties when acquiring leased space?

    Yes, Federal agencies must give a price preference to space in 
historic properties when acquiring leased space using either the lowest 
price technically acceptable or the best value tradeoff source selection 
processes.


<R05>
Sec. 102-73.120  How much of a price preference must Federal agencies 

give when acquiring leased space using the lowest price technically 
acceptable source 
          selection process?

    Federal agencies must give a price evaluation preference to space in 
historic properties as follows:
    (a) First to suitable historic properties within historic districts, 
a 10 percent price preference.
    (b) If no suitable historic property within an historic district is 
offered, or

[[Page 188]]

the 10 percent preference does not result in such property being the 
lowest price technically acceptable offer, the Government will give a 
2.5 percent price preference to suitable non-historic developed or 
undeveloped sites within historic districts.
    (c) If no suitable non-historic developed or undeveloped site within 
an historic district is offered, or the 2.5 percent preference does not 
result in such property being the lowest price technically acceptable 
offer, the Government will give a 10 percent price preference to 
suitable historic properties outside of historic districts.
    (d) Finally, if no suitable historic property outside of historic 
districts is offered, no historic price preference will be given to any 
property offered.


<R05>
Sec. 102-73.125  How much of a price preference must Federal agencies 

give when acquiring leased space using the best value tradeoff source

<R05>
Sec. 102-73.260  What land acquisition policy must Federal 

agencies

follow?

    Federal agencies must follow the land acquisition policy in the 
Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies 
Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4651-4655, which--
    (a) Encourages and expedites the acquisition of real property by 
agreements with owners;
    (b) Avoids litigation, including condemnation actions, where 
possible and relieves congestion in the courts;
    (c) Provides for consistent treatment of owners; and
    (d) Promotes public confidence in Federal land acquisition 
practices.


<R05>
Sec. 102-73.265  What actions must Federal agencies take to 

facilitate land acquisition?

    To facilitate land acquisition, Federal agencies must, among other 
things--
    (a) Appraise the real property before starting negotiations and give 
the owner (or the owner's representative) the opportunity to accompany 
the appraiser during the inspection;
    (b) Establish an amount estimated to be the just compensation before 
starting negotiations and promptly offer to acquire the property for 
this full amount;
    (c) Try to negotiate with owners on the price;
    (d) Pay the agreed purchase price to the property owner, or in the 
case of a condemnation, deposit payment in the registry of the court, 
for the benefit of the owner, before requiring the owner to surrender 
the property; and
    (e) Provide property owners (and occupants) at least 90 days' notice 
of displacement before requiring anyone to move. If a Federal agency 
permits the owner to keep possession for a short time after acquiring 
the owner's property, Federal agencies must not charge rent in excess of 
the property's fair rental value to a short-term occupier.

                            Just Compensation


<R05>
Sec. 102-73.270  Are Federal agencies required to provide the owner

with a written statement of the amount established as just 
compensation?

    Yes, Federal agencies must provide the owner with a written 
statement of this amount and summarize the basis for it. When it is 
appropriate, Federal agencies must separately state the just 
compensation for the property to be acquired and damages to the 
remaining real property.


<R05>
Sec. 102-73.275  What specific information must be included 

in the summary statement for the owner that explains the basis 
for just compensation?

Federal agency considers part of the real property for which just 
compensation is being offered;
    (c) State that the Federal agency based the estimate of just 
compensation on the Government's estimate of the property's fair market 
value. If only part of a property or less than a full interest is being 
acquired, Federal agencies must explain how they determined the just 
compensation for it; and

[[Page 194]]

    (d) State that the Government's estimate of just compensation is at 
least as much as the property's approved appraisal value.


<R05>
Sec. 102-73.280  Where can Federal agencies find guidance on how 

to appraise the value of properties being acquired by the Federal 
Government?

    The Interagency Land Acquisition Conference has developed, 
promulgated, and adopted the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal 
Land Acquisitions, sometimes referred to as the ``Yellow Book.'' The 
Interagency Land Acquisition Conference, established on November 27, 
1968, by invitation of the Attorney General, is a voluntary organization 
composed of the many Federal agencies engaged in the acquisition of real 
estate for public uses. The ``Yellow Book'' is published by the 
Appraisal Institute in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Justice 
and is available in hard copy or on the Department of Justice's internet 
Web site at http://www.usdoj.gov/enrd/land-ack/.

agency pays ``just compensation'' to a tenant?

    Yes, Federal agencies must not--
    (a) Duplicate any payment to the tenant otherwise authorized by law; 
and
    (b) Pay a tenant unless the landowner disclaims all interests in the 
tenant's improvements. In consideration for any such payment, the tenant 
must assign, transfer, and release to the Federal agency all of its 
right, title, and interest in the improvements. The tenant may reject 
such payment under this subpart and obtain payment for its property 
interests according to other sections of applicable law.

                Expenses Incidental to Property Transfer


<R05>
Sec. 102-73.295  What property transfer expenses must Federal 

agencies cover when acquiring real property?

    Federal agencies must--
    (a) Reimburse property owners for all reasonable expenses actually 
incurred for recording fees, transfer taxes, documentary stamps, 
evidence of title, boundary surveys, legal descriptions of the real 
property, and similar expenses needed to convey the property to the 
Federal Government;
    (b) Reimburse property owners for all reasonable expenses actually 
incurred for penalty costs and other charges to prepay any existing, 
recorded mortgage that a property owner entered into in good faith and 
that encumbers the real property;
    (c) Reimburse property owners for all reasonable expenses actually 
incurred for the prorated part of any prepaid real property taxes that 
cover the period after the Federal Government gets title to the property 
or effective possession of it, whichever is earlier; and
    (d) Whenever possible, directly pay the costs identified in this 
section, so property owners will not have to pay them and then seek 
reimbursement from the Government.

                           Litigation Expenses


<R05>
Sec. 102-73.300  Are Federal agencies required to pay for litigation

expenses incurred by a property owner because of a condemnation proceeding?

appraisals, and engineering fees that a property owner incurs because of 
a condemnation proceeding, if any of the following are true:

acquire the real property by condemnation.
    (b) The Federal agency abandons the condemnation proceeding other 
than under an agreed-on settlement.

                      Relocation Assistance Policy


<R05>
Sec. 102-73.305  What relocation assistance policy must Federal 

agencies follow?

relocation assistance under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real 
Property Acquisition Policies Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4651-4655, to 
eligible owners and tenants of property purchased for use by Federal 
agencies in accordance with the implementing regulations found in 49 CFR 
part 24. Appropriate relocation assistance means that the Federal agency 
must pay the displaced person for actual--
    (a) Reasonable moving expenses (in moving himself, his family, and 
business);
    (b) Direct losses of tangible personal property as a result of 
moving or discontinuing a business;
    (c) Reasonable expenses in searching for a replacement business or 
farm; and

portions thereof) to the public;

    (c) When property or a portion thereof is closed to the public, 
restrict admission to the property, or the affected portion, to 
authorized persons who must register upon entry to the property and 
must, when requested, display Government or other identifying 
credentials to Federal police officers or other authorized individuals

<R04>
                      Subpart A_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.5  What is the scope of this part?

    The real property policies contained in this part apply to Federal 
agencies, including GSA's Public Buildings Service (PBS), operating 
under, or subject to, the authorities of the Administrator of General 
Services. Federal agencies with authority to dispose of real property 
under Subchapter III of Chapter 5 of Title 40 of the United States Code 
will be referred to as ``disposal agencies'' in this part. Except in 
rare instances where GSA delegates disposal authority to a Federal 
agency, the ``disposal agency'' as used in this part refers to GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.10  What basic real property disposal policy governs

disposal agencies?

    Disposal agencies must provide, in a timely, efficient, and cost 
effective manner, the full range of real estate services necessary to 
support their real property utilization and disposal needs. Landholding 
agencies must survey the real property under their custody or control to 
identify property that is not utilized, underutilized, or not being put 
to optimum use. Disposal agencies must have adequate procedures in place 
to promote the effective utilization and disposal of such real property.

                     Real Property Disposal Services


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.15  What real property disposal services must agencies 

provide under a delegation of authority from GSA?

    Disposal agencies must provide real property disposal services for 
real property assets under their custody and control, such as the 
utilization of excess property, surveys, and the disposal of surplus 
property, which includes public benefit conveyances, negotiated sales, 
public sales, related disposal services, and appraisals.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.20  How can Federal agencies with independent disposal

authority obtain related disposal services?

    Federal agencies with independent disposal authority are encouraged 
to obtain utilization, disposal, and related services from those 
agencies with expertise in real property disposal, such as GSA, as 
allowed by 31 U.S.C. 1535 (the Economy Act), so that they can remain 
focused on their core mission.


<R04>
              Subpart B_Utilization of Excess Real Property


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.25  What are landholding agencies' responsibilities 

concerning the utilization of excess property?

    Landholding agencies' responsibilities concerning the utilization of 
excess property are to--
    (a) Achieve maximum use of their real property, in terms of economy 
and efficiency, to minimize expenditures for the purchase of real 
property;
    (b) Increase the identification and reporting of their excess real 
property; and
    (c) Fulfill its needs for real property, so far as practicable, by 
utilization of real property determined excess by other agencies, 
pursuant to the provision of this part, before it purchases non-Federal 
real property.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.30  What are disposal agencies' responsibilities concerning

the utilization of excess property?

    Disposal agencies' responsibilities concerning the utilization of 
excess property are to--
    (a) Provide for the transfer of excess real property among Federal 
agencies, to mixed-ownership Government corporations, and to the 
municipal government of the District of Columbia; and
    (b) Resolve conflicting requests for transferring real property that 
the involved agencies cannot resolve.

[[Page 228]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.35  [Reserved]

                                Standards


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.40  What are the standards that each Executive agency must

use to identify unneeded Federal real property?

    Each Executive agency must identify unneeded Federal property using 
the following standards:
    (a) Not utilized.
    (b) Underutilized.
    (c) Not being put to optimum use.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.45  What does the term ``Not utilized'' mean?

    Not utilized means an entire property or portion thereof, with or 
without improvements, not occupied for current program purposes of the 
accountable Executive agency, or occupied in caretaker status only.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.50  What does the term ``Underutilized'' mean?

    Underutilized means an entire property or portion thereof, with or 
without improvements, which is used--
    (a) Irregularly or intermittently by the accountable Executive 
agency for current program purposes of that agency; or
    (b) For current program purposes that can be satisfied with only a 
portion of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.55  What does the term ``Not being put to optimum use'' mean?

    Not being put to optimum use means an entire property or portion 
thereof, with or without improvements, which--
    (a) Even though used for current program purposes, the nature, 
value, or location of the property is such that it could be utilized for 
a different and significantly higher and better purpose; or
    (b) The costs of occupying are substantially higher than other 
suitable properties that could be made available through transfer, 
purchase, or lease with total net savings to the Government, after 
considering property values, costs of moving, occupancy, operational 
efficiency, environmental effects, regional planning, and employee 
morale.

                               Guidelines


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.60  What are landholding agencies' responsibilities 

concerning real property surveys?

    A landholding agency's responsibilities concerning real property 
utilization surveys are to--
    (a) Survey real property under its control (i.e., property reported 
on its financial statements) at least annually to identify property that 
is not utilized, underutilized, or not being put to optimum use. When 
other needs for the property are identified or recognized, the agency 
must determine whether continuation of the current use or another use 
would better serve the public interest, considering both the Federal 
agency's needs and the property's location. In conducting annual reviews 
of their property holdings, the GSA Customer Guide to Real Property 
Disposal can provide guidelines for Executive agencies to consider in 
identifying unneeded Federal real property;
    (b) Maintain its inventory of real property at the absolute minimum 
consistent with economical and efficient conduct of the affairs of the 
agency; and
    (c) Promptly report to GSA real property that it has determined to 
be excess.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.65  Why is it important for Executive agencies to notify

the disposal agency of its real property needs?

    It is important that each Executive agency notify the disposal 
agency of its real property needs to determine whether the excess or 
surplus property of another agency is available that would meet its need 
and prevent the unnecessary purchase or lease of real property.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.70  Are there any exceptions to this notification policy?

    Yes, Executive agencies are not required to notify the disposal 
agency when an agency's proposed acquisition of real property is 
dictated by such factors as exact geographical location, topography, 
engineering, or similar characteristics that limit the possible use

[[Page 229]]

of other available property. For example, Executive agencies are not 
required to notify disposal agencies concerning the acquisition of real 
property for a dam site, reservoir area, or the construction of a 
generating plant or a substation, since specific lands are needed, which 
limit the possible use of other available property. Therefore, no useful 
purpose would be served by notifying the disposal agency.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.75  What is the most important consideration in evaluating

a proposed transfer of excess real property?

    In every case of a proposed transfer of excess real property, the 
most important consideration is the validity and appropriateness of the 
requirement upon which the proposal is based. Also, a proposed transfer 
must not establish a new program that has never been reflected in any 
previous budget submission or congressional action. Additionally, a 
proposed transfer must not substantially increase the level of an 
agency's existing programs beyond that which has been contemplated in 
the President's budget or by the Congress.
    (Note: See Subpart I--Screening of Excess Federal Real Property 
(Sec. Sec. 102-75.1220 through 102-75.1290) for information on 
screening and transfer requests.)


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.80  What are an Executive agency's responsibilities

before requesting a transfer of excess real property?

    Before requesting a transfer of excess real property, an Executive 
agency must--
    (a) Screen its own property holdings to determine whether the new 
requirement can be met through improved utilization of existing real 
property; however, the utilization must be for purposes that are 
consistent with the highest and best use of the property under 
consideration;
    (b) Review all real property under its accountability that has been 
permitted or outleased and terminate the permit or lease for any 
property, or portion thereof, suitable for the proposed need, if 
termination is not prohibited by the terms of the permit or lease;
    (c) Utilize property that is or can be made available under Sec. 
102-75.80(a) or (b) for the proposed need in lieu of requesting a 
transfer of excess real property and reassign the property, when 
appropriate;
    (d) Confirm that the appraised fair market value of the excess real 
property proposed for transfer will not substantially exceed the 
probable purchase price of other real property that would be suitable 
for the intended purpose;
    (e) Limit the size and quantity of excess real property to be 
transferred to the actual requirements and separate, if possible, other 
portions of the excess installation for possible disposal to other 
agencies or to the public; and
    (f) Consider the design, layout, geographic location, age, state of 
repair, and expected maintenance costs of excess real property proposed 
for transfer; agencies must be able to demonstrate that the transfer 
will be more economical over a sustained period of time than the 
acquisition of a new facility specifically planned for the purpose.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.85  Can disposal agencies transfer excess real 

property to agencies for programs that appear to be scheduled 
for substantial curtailment or 
          termination?

    Yes, but only on a temporary basis with the condition that the 
property will be released for further Federal utilization or disposal as 
surplus property at an agreed upon time when the transfer is arranged.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.90  How is excess real property needed for office,

storage, and related purposes normally transferred to the
requesting agency?

    GSA may temporarily assign or direct the use of such excess real 
property to the requesting agency. See Sec. 102-75.240.

[[Page 230]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.95  Can Federal agencies that normally do not require

real property (other than for office, storage, and related purposes)
or that may not have 
          statutory authority to acquire such property, obtain the use 
          of excess real property?

    Yes, GSA can authorize the use of excess real property for an 
approved program. See Sec. 102-75.240.

            Land Withdrawn or Reserved From the Public Domain


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.100  When an agency holds land withdrawn or reserved

from the public domain and determines that it no longer needs 
this land, what must it do?

    An agency holding unneeded land withdrawn or reserved from the 
public domain must submit to the appropriate GSA Regional Office a 
Report of Excess Real Property (Standard Form 118), with appropriate 
Schedules A, B, and C, only when--
    (a) It has filed a notice of intention to relinquish with the 
Department of the Interior (43 CFR part 2372 et seq.) and sent a copy of 
the notice to the appropriate GSA Regional Office;
    (b) The Department of the Interior has notified the agency that the 
Secretary of the Interior has determined that the lands are not suitable 
for return to the public domain for disposition under the general public 
land laws because the lands are substantially changed in character by 
improvements or otherwise; and
    (c) The Department of the Interior provides a report identifying 
whether or not any other agency claims primary, joint, or secondary 
jurisdiction over the lands and whether its records show that the lands 
are encumbered by rights or privileges under the public land laws.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.105  What responsibility does the Department of the 

nterior have if it determines that minerals in the land are 
unsuitable for disposition under 
          the public land mining and mineral leasing laws?

    In such cases, the Department of the Interior must--
    (a) Notify the appropriate GSA Regional Office of such a 
determination; and
    (b) Authorize the landholding agency to identify in the Standard 
Form 118 any minerals in the land that the Department of the Interior 
determines to be unsuitable for disposition under the public land mining 
and mineral leasing laws.

                       Transfers Under Other Laws


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.110  Can transfers of real property be made under 

authority of laws other than those codified in Title 40 of the 
United States Code?

    Yes, the provisions of this section shall not apply to transfers of 
real property authorized to be made by 40 U.S.C. 113(e) or by any 
special statute that directs or requires an Executive agency to transfer 
or convey specifically described real property in accordance with the 
provisions of that statute. Transfers of real property must be made only 
under the authority of Title 40 of the United States Code, unless the 
independent authority granted to such agency specifically exempts the 
authority from the requirements of Title 40.

                    Reporting of Excess Real Property


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.115  Must reports of excess real property and related 

personal property be prepared on specific forms?

    Yes, landholding agencies must prepare reports of excess real 
property and related personal property on--
    (a) Standard Form 118, Report of Excess Real Property, and 
accompanying Standard Form 118a, Buildings Structures, Utilities, and 
Miscellaneous Facilities, Schedule A;
    (b) Standard Form 118b, Land, Schedule B; and
    (c) Standard Form 118c, Related Personal Property, Schedule C.

[[Page 231]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.120  Is there any other information that needs to 

accompany (or be submitted with) the Report of Excess Real 
Property (Standard Form 118)?

    Yes, in all cases where Government-owned land is reported excess, 
Executive agencies must include a title report, prepared or approved by 
a qualified employee of the landholding agency, documenting the 
Government's title to the property.

                              Title Report


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.125  What information must agencies include in 

the title report?

    When completing the title report, agencies must include--
    (a) The description of the property;
    (b) The date title vested in the United States;
    (c) All exceptions, reservations, conditions, and restrictions, 
relating to the title;
    (d) Detailed information concerning any action, thing, or 
circumstance that occurred from the date the United States acquired the 
property to the date of the report that in any way affected or may have 
affected the United States' right, title, or interest in and to the real 
property (including copies of legal comments or opinions discussing the 
manner in which and the extent to which such right, title, or interest 
may have been affected). In the absence of any such action, thing, or 
circumstance, a statement to that effect must be made a part of the 
report;
    (e) The status of civil and criminal jurisdiction over the land that 
is peculiar to the property by reason of it being Government-owned land. 
In the absence of any special circumstances, a statement to that effect 
must be made a part of the report;
    (f) Detailed information regarding any known flood hazards or 
flooding of the property, and, if the property is located in a flood-
plain or on wetlands, a listing of restricted uses (along with the 
citations) identified in Federal, State, or local regulations as 
required by Executive Orders 11988 and 11990 of May 24, 1977;
    (g) The specific identification and description of fixtures and 
related personal property that have possible historic or artistic value;
    (h) The historical significance of the property and whether the 
property is listed, is eligible for, or has been nominated for listing 
in the National Register of Historic Places or is in proximity to a 
property listed in the National Register. If the landholding agency is 
aware of any effort by the public to have the property listed in the 
National Register, it must also include this information;
    (i) A description of the type, location, and condition of asbestos 
incorporated in the construction, repair, or alteration of any building 
or improvement on the property (e.g., fire-proofing, pipe insulation, 
etc.) and a description of any asbestos control measures taken for the 
property. Agencies must also provide to GSA any available indication of 
costs and/or time necessary to remove all or any portion of the 
asbestos-containing materials. Agencies are not required to conduct any 
specific studies and/or tests to obtain this information. (The 
provisions of this subpart do not apply to asbestos on Federal property 
that is subject to section 120(h) of the Superfund Amendments and 
Reauthorization Act of 1986, Public Law 99-499);
    (j) A statement indicating whether or not lead-based paint is 
present on the property. Additionally, if the property is target housing 
(all housing except housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities 
or any zero bedroom dwelling) constructed prior to 1978, provide a risk 
assessment and paint inspection report that details all lead-based paint 
hazards; and
    (k) A statement indicating whether or not, during the time the 
property was owned by the United States, any hazardous substance 
activity, as defined by regulations issued by the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR part 373, took place on the property. 
Hazardous substance activity includes situations where any hazardous 
substance was stored for one year or more, known to have been released, 
or disposed of on the property. Agencies reporting such property must 
review the regulations issued by EPA at 40 CFR part 373 for details on 
the information required and must comply

[[Page 232]]

with these requirements. In addition, agencies reporting such property 
shall review and comply with the regulations for the utilization and 
disposal of hazardous materials and certain categories of property set 
forth at 41 CFR part 101-42.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.130  If hazardous substance activity took place on 

the property, what specific information must an agency include in 
the title report?

    If hazardous substance activity took place on the property, the 
reporting agency must include information on the type and quantity of 
such hazardous substance and the time at which such storage, release, or 
disposal took place. The reporting agency must also advise the disposal 
agency if all remedial action necessary to protect human health and the 
environment with respect to any such hazardous substance activity was 
taken before the date the property was reported excess. If such action 
was not taken, the reporting agency must advise the disposal agency when 
such action will be completed or how the agency expects to comply with 
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability 
Act (CERCLA) in the disposal. See Sec. Sec. 102-75.340 and 102-75.345.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.135  If no hazardous substance activity took place on the 

property, what specific information must an agency include in the 
title report?

    If no hazardous substance activity took place, the reporting agency 
must include the following statement:
    The (reporting agency) has determined, in accordance with 
regulations issued by EPA at 40 CFR part 373, that there is no evidence 
indicating that hazardous substance activity took place on the property 
during the time the property was owned by the United States.

                       Other Necessary Information


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.140  In addition to the title report, and all necessary

environmental information and certifications, what information must
an Executive agency 
          transmit with the Report of Excess Real Property (Standard 
          Form 118)?

    Executive agencies must provide--
    (a) A legible, reproducible copy of all instruments in possession of 
the agency that affect the United States' right, title, or interest in 
the property reported or the use and operation of such property 
(including agreements covering and licenses to use, any patents, 
processes, techniques, or inventions). If it is impracticable to 
transmit the abstracts of title and related title evidence, agencies 
must provide the name and address of the custodian of such documents in 
the title report referred to in Sec. 102-75.120;
    (b) Any appraisal reports indicating or providing the fair market 
value or the fair annual rental of the property, if requested by the 
disposal agency; and
    (c) A certification by a responsible person that the property does 
or does not contain polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) transformers or other 
equipment regulated by EPA under 40 CFR part 761, if requested by the 
disposal agency. If the property does contain any equipment subject to 
EPA regulation under 40 CFR part 761, the certification must include the 
landholding agency's assurance that each piece of equipment is now and 
will continue to be in compliance with the EPA regulations until 
disposal of the property.

                      Examination for Acceptability


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.145  Is GSA required to review each report of excess?

    Yes, GSA must review each report of excess to ascertain whether the 
report was prepared according to the provisions of this part. GSA must 
notify the landholding agency, in writing, whether the report is 
acceptable or other information is needed within 15 calendar days after 
receipt of the report.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.150  What happens when GSA determines that the report of

excess is adequate?

    When GSA determines that a report is adequate, GSA will accept the 
report and inform the landholding agency of the acceptance date. 
However, the landholding agency must, upon request, promptly furnish any 
additional information or documents relating to the property required by 
GSA to accomplish a transfer or a disposal.

[[Page 233]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.155  What happens if GSA determines that the report of 

excess is insufficient?

    Where GSA determines that a report is insufficient, GSA will return 
the report and inform the landholding agency of the facts and 
circumstances that make the report insufficient. The landholding agency 
must promptly take appropriate action to submit an acceptable report to 
GSA. If the landholding agency is unable to submit an acceptable report, 
the property will no longer be considered as excess property and the 
disposal agency will cease activity for the disposal of the property. 
However, GSA may accept the report of excess on a conditional basis and 
identify what deficiencies in the report must be corrected in order for 
the report to gain full acceptance.

                    Designation as Personal Property


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.160  Should prefabricated movable structures be designated

real or personal property for disposition purposes?

    Prefabricated movable structures such as Butler-type storage 
warehouses, Quonset huts, and house trailers (with or without 
undercarriages) reported to GSA along with the land on which they are 
located may, at GSA's discretion, be designated for disposition as 
personal property for off-site use or as real property for disposal with 
the land.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.165  Should related personal property be designated real or

personal property for disposition purposes?

    Related personal property may, at the disposal agency's discretion, 
be designated as personal property for disposal purposes. However, for 
fine artwork and sculptures, GSA's policy is that artwork specifically 
created for a Federal building is considered as a fixture of the 
building. This also applies to sculptures created for a Federal building 
or a public park. Disposal agencies must follow the policies and 
guidance for disposal of artwork and sculptures developed by the GSA 
Office of the Chief Architect, Center for Design Excellence and the 
Arts, and the Bulletin dated March 26, 1934, entitled ``Legal Title to 
Works Produced under the Public Works of Art Project.''


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.170  What happens to the related personal property in 

a structure scheduled for demolition?

    When a structure is to be demolished, any fixtures or related 
personal property therein may, at the disposal agency's discretion, be 
designated for disposition as personal property where a ready 
disposition can be made of these items. As indicated in Sec. 102-
75.165, particular consideration should be given to designating items 
having possible historical or artistic value as personal property.

                                Transfers


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.175  What are GSA's responsibilities regarding 

transfer requests?

    Before property can be transferred among Federal agencies, to mixed-
ownership Government corporations, and to the municipal government of 
the District of Columbia, GSA must determine that--
    (a) The transfer is in the best interest of the Government;
    (b) The requesting agency is the appropriate agency to hold the 
property; and
    (c) The proposed land use will maximize use of the real property, in 
terms of economy and efficiency, to minimize expenditures for the 
purchase of real property.
    (Note: See Subpart I--Screening of Excess Federal Real Property 
(Sec. Sec. 102-75.1220 through 102-75.1290) for information on 
screening and transfer requests.)


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.180  May landholding agencies transfer excess real 

property without notifying GSA?

    Landholding agencies may, without notifying GSA, transfer excess 
real property that they use, occupy, or control under a lease, permit, 
license, easement, or similar instrument when--
    (a) The lease or other instrument is subject to termination by the 
grantor or owner of the premises within nine months;
    (b) The remaining term of the lease or other instrument, including 
renewal

[[Page 234]]

rights, will provide for less than nine months of use and occupancy; or
    (c) The lease or other instrument provides for use and occupancy of 
space for office, storage, and related facilities, which does not exceed 
a total of 2,500 square feet.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.185  In those instances where landholding agencies may 

transfer excess real property without notifying GSA, which policies 
must they follow?

    In those instances, landholding agencies must transfer property 
following the policies in this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.190  What amount must the transferee agency pay for the 

transfer of excess real property?

    The transferee agency must pay an amount equal to the property's 
fair market value (determined by the Administrator)--
    (a) Where the transferor agency has requested the net proceeds of 
the transfer pursuant to 40 U.S.C. 574; or
    (b) Where either the transferor or transferee agency (or 
organizational unit affected) is subject to the Government Corporation 
Control Act (31 U.S.C. 841), is a mixed-ownership Government 
corporation, or the municipal government of the District of Columbia.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.195  If the transferor agency is a wholly owned 

Government corporation, what amount must the transferee agency
pay?

    As may be agreed upon by GSA and the corporation, the transferee 
agency must pay an amount equal to--
    (a) The estimated fair market value of the property; or
    (b) The corporation's book value of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.200  What amount must the transferee agency pay if

property is being transferred for the purpose of upgrading the 
transferee agency's facilities?

    Where the transfer is for the purpose of upgrading facilities (i.e., 
for the purpose of replacing other property of the transferee agency, 
which because of the location, nature, or condition thereof, is less 
efficient for use), the transferee must pay an amount equal to the 
difference between the fair market value of the property to be replaced 
and the fair market value of the property requested, as determined by 
the Administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.205  Are transfers ever made without reimbursement by

the transferee agency?

    Transfers may be made without reimbursement by the transferee agency 
only if--
    (a) Congress has specifically authorized the transfer without 
reimbursement, or
    (b) The Administrator, with the approval of the Director of the 
Office of Management and Budget (OMB), has approved a request for an 
exception from the 100 percent reimbursement requirement.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.210  What must a transferee agency include in its request

for an exception from the 100 percent reimbursement requirement?

    The request must include an explanation of how granting the 
exception would further essential agency program objectives and at the 
same time be consistent with Executive Order 12512, Federal Real 
Property Management, dated April 29, 1985. The transferee agency must 
attach the explanation to the Request for Transfer of Excess Real and 
Related Personal Property (GSA Form 1334) prior to submitting the form 
to GSA. The unavailability of funds alone is not sufficient to justify 
an exception.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.215  Who must endorse requests for exception to the 100

percent reimbursement requirement?

    Agency heads must endorse requests for exceptions to the 100 percent 
reimbursement requirement.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.220  Where should an agency send a request for exception

to the 100 percent reimbursement requirement?

    Agencies must submit all requests for exception from the 100 percent 
reimbursement requirement to the appropriate GSA regional property 
disposal office.

[[Page 235]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.225  Who must review and approve a request for exception

from the 100 percent reimbursement requirement?

    The Administrator must review all requests for exception from the 
100 percent reimbursement requirement. If the Administrator approves the 
request, it is then submitted to OMB for final concurrence. If OMB 
approves the request, then GSA may complete the transfer.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.230  Who is responsible for property protection and 

maintenance costs while the request for exception is being reviewed?

    The agency requesting the property will assume responsibility for 
protection and maintenance costs not more than 40 days from the date of 
the Administrator's letter to OMB requesting concurrence for an 
exception to the 100 percent reimbursement requirement. If the request 
is denied, the requesting agency may pay the fair market value for the 
property or withdraw its request. If the request is withdrawn, 
responsibility for protection and maintenance cost will return to the 
landholding agency at that time.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.235  May disposal agencies transfer excess property to 

the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the Architect of 
the Capitol?

    Yes, disposal agencies may transfer excess property to the Senate, 
the House of Representatives, and the Architect of the Capitol and any 
activities under his or her direction, pursuant to the provisions of 40 
U.S.C. 113(d). The amount of reimbursement for such transfer must be the 
same as would be required for a transfer of excess property to an 
Executive agency under similar circumstances.

                          Temporary Utilization


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.240  May excess real property be temporarily

assigned/reassigned?

    Yes, whenever GSA determines that it is more advantageous to assign 
property temporarily rather than permanently, it may do so. If the space 
is for office, storage, or related facilities, GSA will determine the 
length of the assignment/reassignment. Agencies are required to 
reimburse the landholding agency (or GSA, if GSA has become responsible 
for seeking an appropriation for protection and maintenance expenses) 
(see Sec. 102-75.970) for protection and maintenance expenses. GSA may 
also temporarily assign/reassign excess real property for uses other 
than storage, office or related facilities. In such cases, the agency 
receiving the temporary assignment may be required to pay a rental or 
users charge based upon the fair market value of the property, as 
determined by GSA. If the property will be required by the agency for a 
period of more than 1 year, it may be transferred on a conditional 
basis, with an understanding that the property will be reported excess 
at an agreed upon time (see Sec. 102-75.85). The requesting agency is 
responsible for protection and maintenance expenses.

               Non-Federal Interim Use of Excess Property


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.245  When can landholding agencies grant rights for

non-Federal interim use of excess property reported to GSA?

    Landholding agencies, upon approval from GSA, may grant rights for 
non-Federal interim use of excess property reported to GSA, when it is 
determined that such excess property is not required for the needs of 
any Federal agency and when the interim use will not impair the ability 
to dispose of the property.


<R04>
                Subpart C_Surplus Real Property Disposal


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.250  What general policy must the disposal agency 

follow concerning the disposal of surplus property?

    The disposal agency must dispose of surplus real property--
    (a) In the most economical manner consistent with the best interests 
of the Government; and
    (b) Ordinarily for cash, consistent with the best interests of the 
Government.

[[Page 236]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.255  What are disposal agencies' specific responsibilities

concerning the disposal of surplus property?

    The disposal agency must determine that there is no further Federal 
need or requirement for the excess real property and the property is 
surplus to the needs of the Federal Government. After reaching this 
determination, the disposal agency must expeditiously make the surplus 
property available for acquisition by State and local governmental units 
and non-profit institutions (see Sec. 102-75.350) or for sale by public 
advertising, negotiation, or other disposal action. The disposal agency 
must consider the availability of real property for public purposes on a 
case-by-case basis, based on highest and best use and estimated fair 
market value. Where hazardous substance activity is identified, see 
Sec. Sec. 102-75.340 and 102-75.345 for required information that the 
disposal agency must incorporate into the offer to purchase and 
conveyance document.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.260  When may the disposal agency dispose of surplus

real property by exchange for privately owned property?

    The disposal agency may dispose of surplus real property by exchange 
for privately owned property for property management considerations such 
as boundary realignment or for providing access. The disposal agency may 
also dispose of surplus real property by exchange for privately owned 
property where authorized by law, when the requesting Federal agency 
receives approval from the Office of Management and Budget and the 
appropriate oversight committees, and where the transaction offers 
substantial economic or unique program advantages not otherwise 
obtainable by any other acquisition method.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.265  Are conveyance documents required to identify all

agreements and representations concerning property restrictions and
conditions?

    Yes, conveyance documents must identify all agreements and 
representations concerning restrictions and conditions affecting the 
property's future use, maintenance, or transfer.

                     Applicability of Antitrust Laws


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.270  Must antitrust laws be considered when disposing 

of property?

    Yes, antitrust laws must be considered in any case in which there is 
contemplated a disposal to any private interest of--
    (a) Real and related personal property that has an estimated fair 
market value of $3 million or more; or
    (b) Patents, processes, techniques, or inventions, irrespective of 
cost.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.275  Who determines whether the proposed disposal would 

create or maintain a situation inconsistent with antitrust laws?

    The Attorney General determines whether the proposed disposal would 
create or maintain a situation inconsistent with antitrust laws.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.280  What information concerning a proposed disposal 

must a disposal agency provide to the Attorney General to determine 
the applicability of 
          antitrust laws?

    The disposal agency must promptly provide the Attorney General with 
notice of any such proposed disposal and the probable terms or 
conditions, as required by 40 U.S.C. 559. If notice is given by any 
disposal agency other than GSA, a copy of the notice must also be 
provided simultaneously to the GSA Regional Office in which the property 
is located. Upon request, a disposal agency must furnish information 
that the Attorney General believes to be necessary in determining 
whether the proposed disposition or any other disposition of surplus 
real property violates or would violate any of the antitrust laws.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.285  Can a disposal agency dispose of real property to a

private interest specified in Sec. 102-75.270 before advice is 
received from the Attorney 
          General?

    No, advice from the Attorney General must be received before 
disposing of real property.

[[Page 237]]

                       Disposals Under Other Laws


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.290  Can disposals of real property be made under 

authority of laws other than Chapter 5 of Subtitle I of Title 40
of the United States Code?

    Except for disposals specifically authorized by special legislation, 
disposals of real property must be made only under the authority of 
Chapter 5 of Subtitle I of Title 40 of the United States Code. However, 
the Administrator of General Services can evaluate, on a case-by-case 
basis, the disposal provisions of any other law to determine consistency 
with the authority conferred by Title 40. The provisions of this section 
do not apply to disposals of real property authorized to be made by 40 
U.S.C. 113 or by any special statute that directs or requires an 
Executive agency named in the law to transfer or convey specifically 
described real property in accordance with the provisions of that 
statute.

                            Credit Disposals


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.295  What is the policy on extending credit in 

connection with the disposal of surplus property?

    The disposal agency--
    (a) May extend credit in connection with any disposal of surplus 
property when it determines that credit terms are necessary to avoid 
reducing the salability of the property and potential obtainable price 
and, when below market rates are extended, confer with the Office of 
Management and Budget to determine if the Federal Credit Reform Act of 
1990 is applicable to the transaction;
    (b) Must administer and manage the credit disposal and any related 
security;
    (c) May enforce, adjust, or settle any right of the Government with 
respect to extending credit in a manner and with terms that are in the 
best interests of the Government; and
    (d) Must include provisions in the conveyance documents that 
obligate the purchaser, where a sale is made upon credit, to obtain the 
disposal agency's prior written approval before reselling or leasing the 
property. The purchaser's credit obligations to the United States must 
be fulfilled before the disposal agency may approve the resale of the 
property.

                    Designation of Disposal Agencies


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.296  When may a landholding agency other than GSA be 

the disposal agency for real and related personal property?

    A landholding agency may be the disposal agency for real and related 
personal property when--
    (a) The agency has statutory authority to dispose of real and 
related personal property;
    (b) The agency has delegated authority from GSA to dispose of real 
and related personal property; or
    (c) The agency is disposing of--
    (1) Leases, licenses, permits, easements, and other similar real 
estate interests held by agencies in non-Government-owned real property;
    (2) Government-owned improvements, including fixtures, structures, 
and other improvements of any kind as long as the underlying land is not 
being disposed; or
    (3) Standing timber, embedded gravel, sand, stone, and underground 
water, without the underlying land.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.297  Are there any exceptions to when landholding agencies

can serve as the disposal agency?

    Yes, landholding agencies may not serve as the disposal agency 
when--
    (a) Either the landholding agency or GSA determines that the 
Government's best interests are served by disposing of leases, licenses, 
permits, easements and similar real estate interests together with other 
property owned or controlled by the Government that has been or will be 
reported to GSA, or
    (b) Government-owned machinery and equipment being used by a 
contractor-operator will be sold to a contractor-operator.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.298  Can agencies request that GSA be the disposal

agency for real property and real property interests described 
in Sec. 102-75.296?

    Yes. If requested, GSA, at its discretion, may be the disposal 
agency for such real property and real property interests.

[[Page 238]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.299  What are landholding agencies' responsibilities 

if GSA conducts the disposal?

    Landholding agencies are and remain responsible for all rental/lease 
payments until the lease expires or is terminated. Landholding agencies 
are responsible for paying any restoration or other direct costs 
incurred by the Government associated with termination of a lease, and 
for paying any demolition and removal costs not offset by the sale of 
the property. (See also Sec. 102-75.965.)

                                Appraisal


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.300  Are appraisals required for all real property 

disposal transactions?

    Generally, yes, appraisals are required for all real property 
disposal transactions, except when--
    (a) An appraisal will serve no useful purpose ( e.g., legislation 
authorizes conveyance without monetary consideration or at a fixed 
price). This exception does not apply to negotiated sales to public 
agencies intending to use the property for a public purpose not covered 
by any of the special disposal provisions in subpart C of this part; or
    (b) The estimated fair market value of property to be offered on a 
competitive sale basis does not exceed $300,000.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.305  What type of appraisal value must be obtained for 

real property disposal transactions?

    For all real property transactions requiring appraisals, agencies 
must obtain, as appropriate, an appraisal of either the fair market 
value or the fair annual rental value of the property available for 
disposal.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.310  Who must agencies use to appraise the real property?

    Agencies must use only experienced and qualified real estate 
appraisers familiar with the types of property to be appraised when 
conducting the appraisal. When an appraisal is required for negotiation 
purposes, the same standard applies. However, agencies may authorize 
other methods of obtaining an estimate of the fair market value or the 
fair annual rental when the cost of obtaining that data from a contract 
appraiser would be out of proportion to the expected recoverable value 
of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.315  Are appraisers authorized to consider the effect

of historic covenants on the fair market value?

    Yes, appraisers are authorized to consider the effect of historic 
covenants on the fair market value, if the property is in or eligible 
for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.320  Does appraisal information need to be kept confidential?

    Yes, appraisals, appraisal reports, appraisal analyses, and other 
pre-decisional appraisal documents are confidential and can only be used 
by authorized Government personnel who can substantiate the need to know 
this information. Appraisal information must not be divulged prior to 
the delivery and acceptance of the deed. Any persons engaged to collect 
or evaluate appraisal information must certify that--
    (a) They have no direct or indirect interest in the property; and
    (b) The report was prepared and submitted without bias or influence.

                               Inspection


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.325  What responsibility does the landholding agency 

have to provide persons the opportunity to inspect available surplus
property?

    Landholding agencies should provide all persons interested in 
acquiring available surplus property with the opportunity to make a 
complete inspection of the property, including any available inventory 
records, plans, specifications, and engineering reports that relate to 
the property. These inspections are subject to any necessary national 
security restrictions and are subject to the disposal agency's rules. 
(See Sec. Sec. 102-75.335 and 102-75.985.)

                Submission of Offers To Purchase or Lease


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.330  What form must all offers to purchase or lease be in?

    All offers to purchase or lease must be in writing, accompanied by 
any required earnest money deposit, using the form prescribed by the 
disposal

[[Page 239]]

agency. In addition to the financial terms upon which the offer is 
predicated, the offer must set forth the willingness of the offeror to 
abide by the terms, conditions, reservations, and restrictions upon 
which the property is offered, and must contain such other information 
as the disposal agency may request.

                     Provisions Relating to Asbestos


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.335  Where asbestos is identified, what information must 

the disposal agency incorporate into the offer to purchase and the 
conveyance document?

    Where the existence of asbestos on the property has been brought to 
the attention of the disposal agency by the Report of Excess Real 
Property (Standard Form 118) information provided (see Sec. 102-
75.125), the disposal agency must incorporate this information (less any 
cost or time estimates to remove the asbestos-containing materials) into 
any offer to purchase and conveyance document and include the following 
wording:
    Notice of the Presence of Asbestos--Warning!
    (a) The Purchaser is warned that the property offered for sale 
contains asbestos-containing materials. Unprotected or unregulated 
exposures to asbestos in product manufacturing, shipyard, and building 
construction workplaces have been associated with asbestos-related 
diseases. Both the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
(OSHA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulate 
asbestos because of the potential hazards associated with exposure to 
airborne asbestos fibers. Both OSHA and EPA have determined that such 
exposure increases the risk of asbestos-related diseases, which include 
certain cancers and which can result in disability or death.
    (b) Bidders (offerors) are invited, urged and cautioned to inspect 
the property to be sold prior to submitting a bid (offer). More 
particularly, bidders (offerors) are invited, urged and cautioned to 
inspect the property as to its asbestos content and condition and any 
hazardous or environmental conditions relating thereto. The disposal 
agency will assist bidders (offerors) in obtaining any authorization(s) 
that may be required in order to carry out any such inspection(s). 
Bidders (offerors) shall be deemed to have relied solely on their own 
judgment in assessing the overall condition of all or any portion of the 
property including, without limitation, any asbestos hazards or 
concerns.
    (c) No warranties either express or implied are given with regard to 
the condition of the property including, without limitation, whether the 
property does or does not contain asbestos or is or is not safe for a 
particular purpose. The failure of any bidder (offeror) to inspect, or 
to be fully informed as to the condition of all or any portion of the 
property offered, will not constitute grounds for any claim or demand 
for adjustment or withdrawal of a bid or offer after its opening or 
tender.
    (d) The description of the property set forth in the Invitation for 
Bids (Offer to Purchase) and any other information provided therein with 
respect to said property is based on the best information available to 
the disposal agency and is believed to be correct, but an error or 
omission, including, but not limited to, the omission of any information 
available to the agency having custody over the property and/or any 
other Federal agency, shall not constitute grounds or reason for 
nonperformance of the contract of sale, or any claim by the Purchaser 
against the Government including, without limitation, any claim for 
allowance, refund, or deduction from the purchase price.
    (e) The Government assumes no liability for damages for personal 
injury, illness, disability, or death, to the Purchaser, or to the 
Purchaser's successors, assigns, employees, invitees, or any other 
person subject to Purchaser's control or direction, or to any other 
person, including members of the general public, arising from or 
incident to the purchase, transportation, removal, handling, use, 
disposition, or other activity causing or leading to contact of any kind 
whatsoever with asbestos on the property that is the subject of this 
sale, whether the Purchaser, its successors or assigns has or have 
properly warned or failed properly to warn the individual(s) injured.
    (f) The Purchaser further agrees that, in its use and occupancy of 
the property, it will comply with all Federal, State, and local laws 
relating to asbestos.

           Provisions Relating to Hazardous Substance Activity


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.340  Where hazardous substance activity has been 

identified on property proposed for disposal, what information 
must the disposal agency 
          incorporate into the offer to purchase and the conveyance 
          document?

    Where the existence of hazardous substance activity has been brought 
to the attention of the disposal agency by the Report of Excess Real 
Property (Standard Form 118) information provided (see Sec. Sec. 102-
75.125 and 102-75.130),

[[Page 240]]

the disposal agency must incorporate this information into any offer to 
purchase and conveyance document. In any offer to purchase and 
conveyance document, disposal agencies, generally, must also address the 
following (specific recommended language that addresses the following 
issues can be found in the GSA Customer Guide to Real Property 
Disposal):
    (a) Notice of all hazardous substance activity identified as a 
result of a complete search of agency records by the landholding agency.
    (b) A statement, certified by a responsible landholding agency 
official in the Report of Excess Real Property, that all remedial 
actions necessary to protect human health and the environment with 
regard to such hazardous substance activity have been taken (this is not 
required in the offer to purchase or conveyance document in the case of 
a transfer of property under the authority of section 120(h)(3)(C) of 
CERCLA, or the Early Transfer Authority, or a conveyance to a 
``potentially responsible party'', as defined by CERCLA (see 102-
75.345)).
    (c) A commitment, on behalf of the United States, to return to 
correct any hazardous condition discovered after the conveyance that 
results from hazardous substance activity prior to the date of 
conveyance.
    (d) A reservation by the United States of a right of access in order 
to accomplish any further remedial actions required in the future.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.345  What is different about the statements in the offer

to purchase and conveyance document if the sale is to a potentially 
responsible party with 
          respect to the hazardous substance activity?

    In the case where the purchaser or grantee is a potentially 
responsible party (PRP) with respect to hazardous substance activity on 
the property under consideration, the United States is no longer under a 
general obligation to certify that the property has been successfully 
remediated, or to commit to return to the property to address 
contamination that is discovered in the future. Therefore, the 
statements of responsibility and commitments on behalf of the United 
States referenced in Sec. 102-75.340 should not be used. Instead, 
language should be included in the offer to purchase and conveyance 
document that is consistent with any agreement that has been reached 
between the landholding agency and the PRP with regard to prior 
hazardous substance activity.

                       Public Benefit Conveyances


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.350  What are disposal agencies' responsibilities

concerning public benefit conveyances?

    Based on a highest and best use analysis, disposal agencies may make 
surplus real property available to State and local governments and 
certain non-profit institutions or organizations at up to 100 percent 
public benefit discount for public benefit purposes. Some examples of 
such purposes are education, health, park and recreation, the homeless, 
historic monuments, public airports, highways, correctional facilities, 
ports, and wildlife conservation. The implementing regulations for these 
conveyances are found in this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.351  May the disposal agency waive screening for public

benefit conveyances?

    All properties, consistent with the highest and best use analysis, 
will normally be screened for public benefit uses. However, the disposal 
agency may waive public benefit screening, with the exception of the 
mandatory McKinney-Vento homeless screening, for specific property 
disposal considerations, e.g., when a property has been reported excess 
for exchange purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.355  What clause must be in the offer to purchase and 

the conveyance documents for public benefit conveyances?

    Executive agencies must include in the offer to purchase and 
conveyance documents the non-discrimination clause in Sec. 102-75.360 
for public benefit conveyances.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.360  What wording must be in the non-discrimination 

clause that is required in the offer to purchase and in the 
conveyance document?

    The wording of the non-discrimination clause must be as follows:

[[Page 241]]

    The Grantee covenants for itself, its heirs, successors, and assigns 
and every successor in interest to the property hereby conveyed, or any 
part thereof, that the said Grantee and such heirs, successors, and 
assigns shall not discriminate upon the basis of race, creed, color, 
religion, sex, disability, age, or national origin in the use, 
occupancy, sale, or lease of the property, or in their employment 
practices conducted thereon. This covenant shall not apply, however, to 
the lease or rental of a room or rooms within a family dwelling unit; 
nor shall it apply with respect to religion to premises used primarily 
for religious purposes. The United States of America shall be deemed a 
beneficiary of this covenant without regard to whether it remains the 
owner of any land or interest therein in the locality of the property 
hereby conveyed and shall have the sole right to enforce this covenant 
in any court of competent jurisdiction.

                        Power Transmission Lines


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.365  Do disposal agencies have to notify State entities 

and Government agencies that a surplus power transmission line and 
right-of-way is available?

    Yes, disposal agencies must notify State entities and Government 
agencies of the availability of a surplus power transmission line and 
right-of-way.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.370  May a State, or any political subdivision thereof, 

certify to a disposal agency that it needs a surplus power transmission
line and the right-
          of-way acquired for its construction to meet the requirements 
          of a public or cooperative power project?

    Yes, section 13(d) of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 (50 U.S.C. 
App. 1622(d)) allows any State or political subdivision, or any State or 
Government agency or instrumentality to certify to the disposal agency 
that a surplus power transmission line and the right-of-way acquired for 
its construction is needed to meet the requirements of a public or 
cooperative power project.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.375  What happens once a State, or political subdivision,

certifies that it needs a surplus power transmission line and the 
right-of-way acquired 
          for its construction to meet the requirements of a public or 
          cooperative power project?

    Generally, once a State or political subdivision certifies that it 
needs a surplus power transmission line and the right-of-way, the 
disposal agency may sell the property to the state, or political 
subdivision thereof, at the fair market value. However, if a sale of a 
surplus transmission line cannot be accomplished because of the price to 
be charged, or other reasons, and the certification by the State or 
political subdivision is not withdrawn, the disposal agency must report 
the facts involved to the Administrator of General Services, to 
determine what further action will or should be taken to dispose of the 
property.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.380  May power transmission lines and rights-of-way be 

disposed of in other ways?

    Yes, power transmission lines and rights-of-way not disposed of by 
sale for fair market value may be disposed of following other applicable 
provisions of this part, including, if appropriate, reclassification by 
the disposal agency.

                      Property for Public Airports


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.385  Do disposal agencies have the responsibility to

notify eligible public agencies that airport property has been
determined to be surplus?

    Yes, the disposal agency must notify eligible public agencies that 
property currently used as or suitable for use as a public airport under 
the Surplus Property Act of 1944, as amended, has been determined to be 
surplus. A copy of the landholding agency's Report of Excess Real 
Property (Standard Form 118, with accompanying schedules) must be 
transmitted with the copy of the surplus property notice sent to the 
appropriate regional office of the Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA). The FAA must furnish an application form and instructions for the 
preparation of an application to eligible public agencies upon request.

[[Page 242]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.390  What does the term ``surplus airport property'' mean?

    For the purposes of this part, surplus airport property is any 
surplus real property including improvements and personal property 
included as a part of the operating unit that the Administrator of FAA 
deems is--
    (a) Essential, suitable, or desirable for the development, 
improvement, operation, or maintenance of a public airport, as defined 
in the Federal Airport Act, as amended (49 U.S.C. 1101); or
    (b) Reasonably necessary to fulfill the immediate and foreseeable 
future requirements of the grantee for the development, improvement, 
operation, or maintenance of a public airport, including property needed 
to develop sources of revenue from non-aviation businesses at a public 
airport. Approval for non-aviation revenue-producing areas may only be 
given for such areas as are anticipated to generate net proceeds that do 
not exceed expected deficits for operation of the aviation area applied 
for at the airport.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.395  May surplus airport property be conveyed or disposed
of to a State, political subdivision, municipality, or tax-supported 
institution for a public airport?

    Yes, section 13(g) of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 (49 U.S.C. 
Sec. 47151) authorizes the disposal agency to convey or dispose of 
surplus airport property to a State, political subdivision, 
municipality, or tax-supported institution for use as a public airport.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.400  Is industrial property located on an airport 

also considered to be ``airport property''?

    No, if the Administrator of General Services determines that a 
property's highest and best use is industrial, then the property must be 
classified as such for disposal without regard to the public benefit 
conveyance provisions of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.405  What responsibilities does the Federal Aviation 

Administration (FAA) have after receiving a copy of the notice 
(and a copy of the Report of 
          Excess Real Property (Standard Form 118)) given to eligible 
          public agencies that there is surplus airport property?

    As soon as possible after receiving the copy of the surplus notice, 
the FAA must inform the disposal agency of its determination. Then, the 
FAA must provide assistance to any eligible public agency known to have 
a need for the property for a public airport, so that the public agency 
may develop a comprehensive and coordinated plan of use and procurement 
for the property.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.410   What action must the disposal agency take after an 

eligible public agency has submitted a plan of use and application to 
acquire property for 
          a public airport?

    After an eligible public agency submits a plan of use and 
application, the disposal agency must transmit two copies of the plan 
and two copies of the application to the appropriate FAA regional 
office. The FAA must promptly submit a recommendation to the disposal 
agency for disposal of the property for a public airport or must inform 
the disposal agency that no such recommendation will be submitted.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.415  What happens after the disposal agency receives the 

FAA's recommendation for disposal of the property for a public airport?

    The head of the disposal agency, or his or her designee, may convey 
property approved by the FAA for use as a public airport to the eligible 
public agency, subject to the provisions of the Surplus Property Act of 
1944, as amended.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.420  What happens if the FAA informs the disposal agency 

that it does not recommend disposal of the property for a public airport?

    Any airport property that the FAA does not recommend for disposal as 
a public airport must be disposed of in accordance with other applicable 
provisions of this part. However, the disposal agency must first notify 
the landholding agency of its inability to dispose of the property for 
use as a

[[Page 243]]

public airport. In addition, the disposal agency must allow the 
landholding agency 30 days to withdraw the property from surplus or to 
waive any future interest in the property for public airport use.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.425  Who has sole responsibility for enforcing compliance 

with the terms and conditions of disposal for property disposed of for
use as a public 
          airport?

    The Administrator of the FAA has the sole responsibility for 
enforcing compliance with the terms and conditions of disposals to be 
used as a public airport. The FAA is also responsible for reforming, 
correcting, or amending any disposal instruments; granting releases; and 
any action necessary for recapturing the property, using the provisions 
of 49 U.S.C. 47101 et seq.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.430  What happens if property conveyed for use as a public

airport is revested in the United States?

    If property that was conveyed for use as a public airport is 
revested in the United States for noncompliance with the terms of the 
disposal, or other cause, the Administrator of the FAA must be 
accountable for the property and must report the property to GSA as 
excess property following the provisions of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.435  Does the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970, 

as amended (Airport Act of 1970), apply to the transfer of airports 
to State and local 
          agencies?

    No, the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970, as amended (49 
U.S.C. 47101-47131) (Airport Act of 1970), does not apply to the 
transfer of airports to State and local agencies. The transfer of 
airports to State and local agencies may be made only under section 
13(g) of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 (49 U.S.C. 47151-47153). Only 
property that the landholding agency determines cannot be reported 
excess to GSA for disposal under Title 40, but nevertheless may be made 
available for use by a State or local public body as a public airport 
without being inconsistent with the Federal program of the landholding 
agency, may be conveyed under the Airport Act of 1970. In the latter 
instance, the Airport Act of 1970 may be used to transfer non-excess 
land for airport development purposes provided it does not constitute an 
entire airport. An entire, existing and established airport can only be 
disposed of to a State or eligible local government under section 13(g) 
of the Surplus Property Act of 1944.

                 Property for Use as Historic Monuments


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.440  Who must disposal agencies notify that surplus 

property is available for historic monument use?

    Disposal agencies must notify State and area wide clearinghouses and 
eligible public agencies that property that may be conveyed for use as a 
historic monument has been determined to be surplus. A copy of the 
landholding agency's Report of Excess Real Property (Standard Form 118) 
with accompanying schedules must be transmitted with the copy of each 
notice that is sent to the appropriate regional or field offices of the 
National Park Service (NPS) of the Department of the Interior (DOI).


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.445  Who can convey surplus real and related personal

property for historic monument use?

    A disposal agency may convey surplus real and related personal 
property for use as a historic monument, without monetary consideration, 
to any State, political subdivision, instrumentality thereof, or 
municipality, for the benefit of the public, provided the Secretary of 
the Interior has determined that the property is suitable and desirable 
for such use.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.450  What type of property is suitable or desirable for

use as a historic monument?

    Only property conforming with the recommendation of the Advisory 
Board on National Parks, Historic Sites, Buildings, and Monuments shall 
be determined to be suitable or desirable for use as a historic 
monument.

[[Page 244]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.455  May historic monuments be used for revenue-producing

activities?

    The disposal agency may authorize the use of historic monuments 
conveyed under 40 U.S.C. 550(h) or the Surplus Property Act of 1944, as 
amended, for revenue-producing activities, if the Secretary of the 
Interior--
    (a) Determines that the activities, described in the applicant's 
proposed program of use, are compatible with the use of the property for 
historic monument purposes;
    (b) Approves the grantee's plan for repair, rehabilitation, 
restoration, and maintenance of the property;
    (c) Approves the grantee's plan for financing the repair, 
rehabilitation, restoration, and maintenance of the property. DOI must 
not approve the plan unless it provides that all income in excess of 
costs of repair, rehabilitation, restoration, maintenance, and a 
specified reasonable profit or payment that may accrue to a lessor, 
sublessor, or developer in connection with the management, operation, or 
development of the property for revenue producing activities, is used by 
the grantee, lessor, sublessor, or developer, only for public historic 
preservation, park, or recreational purposes; and
    (d) Examines and approves the grantee's accounting and financial 
procedures for recording and reporting on revenue-producing activities.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.460  What information must disposal agencies furnish eligible 

public agencies?

    Upon request, the disposal agency must furnish eligible public 
agencies with adequate preliminary property information and, with the 
landholding agency's cooperation, provide assistance to enable public 
agencies to obtain adequate property information.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.465  What information must eligible public agencies

interested in acquiring real property for use as a historic monument
submit to the appropriate 
          regional or field offices of the National Park Service (NPS) 
          of the Department of the Interior (DOI)?

    Eligible public agencies must submit the original and two copies of 
the completed application to acquire real property for use as a historic 
monument to the appropriate regional or field offices of NPS, which will 
forward one copy of the application to the appropriate regional office 
of the disposal agency.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.470  What action must NPS take after an eligible public

agency has submitted an application for conveyance of surplus property
for use as a 
          historic monument?

    NPS must promptly--
    (a) Submit the Secretary of the Interior's determination to the 
disposal agency; or
    (b) Inform the disposal agency that no such recommendation will be 
submitted.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.475  What happens after the disposal agency receives the

Secretary of the Interior's determination for disposal of the surplus 
property for a 
          historic monument and compatible revenue-producing activities?

    The head of the disposal agency or his or her designee may convey to 
an eligible public agency surplus property determined by the Secretary 
of the Interior to be suitable and desirable for use as a historic 
monument for the benefit of the public and for compatible revenue-
producing activities subject to the provisions of 40 U.S.C. 550(h).


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.480  Who has the responsibility for enforcing compliance 

with the terms and conditions of disposal for surplus property 
conveyed for use as a 
          historic monument?

    The Secretary of the Interior has the responsibility for enforcing 
compliance with the terms and conditions of such a disposal. DOI is also 
responsible for reforming, correcting, or amending any disposal 
instrument; granting releases; and any action necessary for recapturing 
the property using the provisions of 40 U.S.C. 550(b). The actions are 
subject to the approval of the head of the disposal agency.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.485  What happens if property that was conveyed for use

as a historic monument is revested in the United States?

    In such a case, DOI must notify the appropriate GSA Public Buildings

[[Page 245]]

Service (PBS) Regional Office immediately by letter when title to the 
historic property is to be revested in the United States for 
noncompliance with the terms and conditions of disposal or for other 
cause. The notification must cite the legal and administrative actions 
that DOI must take to obtain full title and possession of the property. 
In addition, it must include an adequate description of the property, 
including any improvements constructed since the original conveyance to 
the grantee. After receiving a statement from DOI that title to the 
property is proposed for revesting, GSA will review the statement and 
determine if title should be revested. If GSA, in consultation with DOI, 
determines that the property should be revested, DOI must submit a 
Report of Excess Real Property, Standard Form 118 to GSA. GSA will 
review and act upon the Standard Form 118, if acceptable. However, the 
grantee must provide protection and maintenance of the property until 
the title reverts to the Federal Government, including the period of the 
notice of intent to revert. Such protection and maintenance must, at a 
minimum, conform to the standards prescribed in the GSA Customer Guide 
to Real Property Disposal.

           Property for Educational and Public Health Purposes


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.490  Who must notify eligible public agencies that 

surplus real property for educational and public health purposes
is available?

    The disposal agency must notify eligible public agencies that 
surplus property is available for educational and/or public health 
purposes. The notice must require that any plans for an educational or 
public health use, resulting from the development of the comprehensive 
and coordinated plan of use and procurement for the property, must be 
coordinated with the Department of Education (ED) or the Department of 
Health and Human Services (HHS), as appropriate. The notice must also 
let eligible public agencies know where to obtain the applications, 
instructions for preparing them, and where to submit the application. 
The requirement for educational or public health use of the property by 
an eligible public agency is contingent upon the disposal agency's 
approval, under Sec. 102-75.515, of a recommendation for assignment of 
Federal surplus real property received from ED or HHS. Further, any 
subsequent transfer is subject to the approval of the head of the 
disposal agency as stipulated under 40 U.S.C. 550(c) or (d) and 
referenced in Sec. 102-75.535.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.495  May the Department of Education (ED) or the Department

of Health and Human Services (HHS) notify nonprofit organizations 
that surplus real 
          property and related personal property is available for 
          educational and public health purposes?

    Yes, ED or HHS may notify eligible non-profit institutions that such 
property has been determined to be surplus. Notices to eligible non-
profit institutions must require eligible non-profit institutions to 
coordinate any request for educational or public health use of the 
property with the appropriate public agency responsible for developing 
and submitting a comprehensive and coordinated plan of use and 
procurement for the property.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.500  Which Federal agencies may the head of the disposal 

agency (or his or her designee) assign for disposal surplus real 
property to be used for 
          educational and public health purposes?

    The head of the disposal agency or his designee may--
    (a) Assign to the Secretary of ED for disposal under 40 U.S.C. 
550(c) surplus real property, including buildings, fixtures, and 
equipment, as recommended by the Secretary as being needed for school, 
classroom, or other educational use; or
    (b) Assign to the Secretary of HHS for disposal under 40 U.S.C. 550 
(d) such surplus real property, including buildings, fixtures, and 
equipment situated thereon, as recommended by the Secretary as being 
needed for use in the protection of public health, including research.

[[Page 246]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.505  Is the request for educational or public health use 

of a property by an eligible nonprofit institution contingent upon the
disposal agency's 
          approval?

    Yes, eligible non-profit organizations will only receive surplus 
real property for an educational or public health use if the disposal 
agency approves or grants the assignment request from either ED or HHS. 
The disposal agency will also consider other uses for available surplus 
real property, taking into account the highest and best use 
determination. Any subsequent transfer is subject to the approval of the 
head of the disposal agency as stipulated under 40 U.S.C. 550(c) or (d) 
and referenced in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.510  When must the Department of Education and the Department

of Health and Human Services notify the disposal agency that an eligible 
applicant is 
          interested in acquiring the property?

    ED and HHS must notify the disposal agency if it has an eligible 
applicant interested in acquiring the property within 30 calendar days 
after the date of the surplus notice. Then, after the 30-day period 
expires, ED or HHS has 30 calendar days to review and approve an 
application and request assignment of the property, or inform the 
disposal agency that no assignment request will be forthcoming.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.515  What action must the disposal agency take after an 

eligible public agency has submitted a plan of use for property for 
an educational or 
          public health requirement?

for reforming, correcting, or amending any transfer instruments; 
granting releases; and for taking any necessary actions for recapturing 
the property using or following the provisions of 40 U.S.C. 550(b). 
These actions are subject to the approval of the head of the disposal 
agency. ED or HHS must notify the disposal agency of its intent to take 
any actions to recapture the property. The notice must identify the 
property affected, describe in detail the proposed action, and state the 
reasons for the proposed action.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.545  What happens if property that was transferred to meet

an educational or public health requirement is revested in the United

of title for noncompliance with the terms or conditions of sale or other 
cause, ED or HHS must, prior to repossession or reversion of title, 
provide the appropriate GSA regional property disposal office with an 
accurate description of the real and related personal property involved 
using the Report of Excess Real Property (Standard Form 118), and the 
appropriate schedules. After receiving a statement from ED or HHS that 
the property is proposed for revesting, GSA will review the statement 
and determine if title should be revested. If GSA, in conjunction with 
ED or HHS, determines that the property should be revested, ED or HHS 
must submit a Standard Form 118 to GSA. GSA will review and act upon the 
Standard Form 118, if acceptable. However, the grantee must provide 
protection and maintenance for the property until the title reverts to 
the Federal Government, including the period of any notice of intent to 
revert. Such protection and maintenance must, at a minimum, conform to 
the standards prescribed in the GSA Customer Guide to Real Property 
Disposal.

appropriateness of the use of a transferred property.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.815  What happens if property conveyed for correctional 

facility, law enforcement, or emergency management response purposes
is found to be in 
          noncompliance with the terms of the conveyance documents?

    OJP or FEMA must, prior to the repossession, provide the appropriate 
GSA regional property disposal office with an accurate description of 
the real and related personal property involved. OJP or FEMA must use 
the Report of Excess Real Property (Standard Form 118), and the 
appropriate schedules for this purpose. After receiving a statement from 
OJP or FEMA that the title to the property is proposed for revesting, 
GSA will review the statement and determine if title should be revested. 
If GSA, in consultation with OJP or FEMA, determines that the property 
should be revested, OJP or FEMA must submit a Standard Form 118 to GSA. 
GSA will review and act upon the Standard Form 118, if acceptable. 
However, the grantee must provide protection and maintenance for the 
property until the title reverts to the Federal Government, including 
the period following any notice of intent to revert. Such protection and 
maintenance must, at a minimum, conform to the standards prescribed in 
the GSA Customer Guide to Real Property Disposal.

Sec. 102-75.840  What action must the disposal agency take after an 

eligible public agency has submitted a plan of use for and an 
application to acquire a port 
          facility property?

    Whenever an eligible public agency has submitted a plan of use for a 
port facility requirement, the disposal agency must transmit two copies

other disposal action.

[[Page 258]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.860  What happens after the disposal agency receives 

the assignment recommendation from DOT?

    If, after considering other uses for the property, the disposal 
agency approves the assignment recommendation from DOT, the disposal 
agency must assign the property by letter or other document to DOT. If

disposal agency to consider the notice. DOT must furnish the disposal 
agency two conformed copies of the instruments conveying property and 
all related documents containing restrictions or conditions regulating 
the future use, maintenance, or transfer of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.870  Who is responsible for enforcing compliance with the

terms and conditions of the port facility conveyance?

conditions of conveyance, including reforming, correcting, or amending 
any instrument of conveyance; granting releases; and taking any 
necessary actions to recapture the property following the provisions of 
40 U.S.C. 554(f). Any of these actions are subject to the approval of 
the head of the disposal agency. DOT must notify the head of the 
disposal agency of its intent to take any proposed action, identify the 
property affected, and describe in detail the proposed action, including 
the reasons for the proposed action.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.875  What happens in the case of repossession by the United

States under a reversion of title for noncompliance with the terms or 
conditions of 
          conveyance?

    In each case of a repossession by the United States, DOT must, at or 
prior to reversion of title, provide the appropriate GSA regional 
property disposal office, with a Report of Excess Real Property 
(Standard Form 118) and accompanying schedules. After receiving a 
statement from DOT that title to the property is proposed for revesting, 
GSA will review the statement and determine if title should be revested. 
If GSA, in consultation with DOT, determines that the property should be 
revested, DOT must submit a Standard Form 118 to GSA. GSA will review 
and act upon the Standard Form 118, if acceptable. However, the grantee 
must provide protection and maintenance for the property until the title 
reverts to the Federal Government, including the period following the 
notice of intent to revert. Such protection and maintenance must, at a 
minimum, conform to the standards prescribed in the GSA Customer Guide

<R05>
Sec. 102-75.880  When may Executive agencies conduct negotiated sales?

    Executive agencies may conduct negotiated sales only when--
    (a) The estimated fair market value of the property does not exceed

circumstances make it impractical to advertise for competitive bids and 
the fair market value of the property and other satisfactory terms of 
disposal are obtainable by negotiation;
    (d) The disposals will be to States, the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico, possessions, political subdivisions, or

[[Page 259]]

tax-supported agencies therein, and the estimated fair market value of 
the property and other satisfactory terms of disposal are obtainable by 
negotiation. Negotiated sales to public bodies can only be conducted if 
a public benefit, which would not be realized from a competitive sale, 
will result from the negotiated sale; or
    (e) Negotiation is otherwise authorized by Chapter 5 of Subtitle I 
of Title 40 of the United States Code or other law, such as disposals of 
power transmission lines for public or cooperative power projects.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.885  What are the disposal agency's responsibilities 

concerning negotiated sales?

    The disposal agency must--
    (a) Obtain such competition as is feasible in all negotiations of 
disposals and contracts for disposal of surplus property; and
    (b) Prepare and transmit an explanatory statement if the fair market 
value of the property exceeds $100,000, identifying the circumstances of

of such disposal.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.890  What clause must be in the offer to purchase and 

conveyance documents for negotiated sales to public agencies?

    Disposal agencies must include in the offer to purchase and 
conveyance documents an excess profits clause, which usually runs for 3 
years, to eliminate the potential for windfall profits to public 
agencies. This clause states that, if the purchaser should sell or enter 
into agreements to sell the property within 3 years from the date of 
title transfer by the Federal Government, all proceeds in excess of the 
purchaser's costs will be remitted to the Federal Government.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.895  What wording must generally be in the excess profits

clause that is required in the offer to purchase and in the conveyance
document?

    The wording of the excess profits clause should generally be as 
follows:
    Excess Profits Covenant for Negotiated Sales to Public Bodies
    (a) This covenant shall run with the land for a period of 3 years 
from the date of conveyance. With respect to the property described in 
this deed, if at any time within a 3-year period from the date of 
transfer of title by the Grantor, the Grantee, or its successors or 
assigns, shall sell or enter into agreements to sell the property, 
either in a single transaction or in a series of transactions, it is 
covenanted and agreed that all proceeds received or to be received in 
excess of the Grantee's or a subsequent seller's actual allowable costs 
will be remitted to the Grantor. In the event of a sale of less than the 
entire property, actual allowable costs will be apportioned to the 
property based on a fair and reasonable determination by the Grantor.
    (b) For purposes of this covenant, the Grantee's or a subsequent 
seller's allowable costs shall include the following:
    (1) The purchase price of the real property.
    (2) The direct costs actually incurred and paid for improvements 
that serve only the property, including road construction, storm and 
sanitary sewer construction, other public facilities or utility 
construction, building rehabilitation and demolition, landscaping, 
grading, and other site or public improvements.
    (3) The direct costs actually incurred and paid for design and 
engineering services with respect to the improvements described in 
(b)(2) of this section.
    (4) The finance charges actually incurred and paid in conjunction 
with loans obtained to meet any of the allowable costs enumerated above.
    (c) None of the allowable costs described in paragraph (b) of this 
section will be deductible if defrayed by Federal grants or if used as 
matching funds to secure Federal grants.
    (d) To verify compliance with the terms and conditions of this 
covenant, the Grantee, or its successors or assigns, shall submit an 
annual report for each of the subsequent 3 years to the Grantor on the 
anniversary date of this deed. Each report will identify the property 
involved in this transaction and will contain such of the following 
items of information as are applicable at the time of submission:
    (1) A statement indicating whether or not a resale has been made.
    (2) A description of each portion of the property that has been 
resold.
    (3) The sale price of each such resold portion.
    (4) The identity of each purchaser.
    (5) The proposed land use.
    (6) An enumeration of any allowable costs incurred and paid that 
would offset any realized profit.
    (e) The Grantor may monitor the property and inspect records related 
thereto to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of this 
covenant and may take any actions that

[[Page 260]]

it deems reasonable and prudent to recover any excess profits realized 
through the resale of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.900  What is a negotiated sale for economic development 

purposes?

    A negotiated sale for economic development purposes means that the 
public body purchasing the property will develop or make substantial 
improvements to the property with the intention of reselling or leasing 
the property in parcels to users to advance the community's economic 
benefit. This type of negotiated sale is acceptable where the expected 
public benefits to the community are greater than the anticipated 
proceeds derived from a competitive public sale.

               Explanatory Statements for Negotiated Sales


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.905  When must the disposal agency prepare an explanatory

statement?

circumstances of each of the following proposed disposals by 
negotiation:
    (a) Any real property that has an estimated fair market value in 
excess of $100,000, except that any real property disposed of by lease 
or exchange is subject only to paragraphs (b) through (d) of this 
section.
    (b) Any real property disposed of by lease for a term of 5 years or 
less, if the estimated fair annual rent is in excess of $100,000 for any 
of such years.
    (c) Any real property disposed of by lease for a term of more than 5 
years, if the total estimated rent over the term of the lease is in 
excess of $100,000.
    (d) Any real property or real and related personal property disposed 
of by exchange, regardless of value, or any property disposed in which 
any part of the consideration is real property.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.910  Are there any exceptions to this policy of preparing 

explanatory statements?

    Yes, the disposal agency is not required to prepare an explanatory 
statement for property authorized to be disposed of without advertising 
by any provision of law other than 40 U.S.C. 545.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.915  Do disposal agencies need to retain a copy of the

explanatory statement?

    Yes, disposal agencies must retain a copy of the explanatory 
statement in their files.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.920  Where is the explanatory statement sent?

    Disposal agencies must submit each explanatory statement to the 
Administrator of General Services for review and transmittal by letter 
from the Administrator of General Services to the Senate Committee on 
Governmental Affairs and the House Committee on Government Reform and 
any other appropriate committees of the Senate and House of 
Representatives. Disposal agencies must include in the submission to the 
Administrator of General Services any supporting data that may be 
relevant and necessary for evaluating the proposed action.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.925  Is GSA required to furnish the disposal agency with 

the explanatory statement's transmittal letter sent to Congress?

    Yes, GSA must furnish copies of its transmittal letters to the 
committees of the Congress (see Sec. 102-75.920) to the disposal 
agency.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.930  What happens if there is no objection by an 

appropriate committee or subcommittee of Congress concerning the 
proposed negotiated sale?

    If there is no objection, the disposal agency may consummate the 
sale on or after 35 days from the date the Administrator of General 
Services transmitted the explanatory statement to the committees. If 
there is an objection, the disposal agency must resolve objections with 
the appropriate Congressional committee or subcommittee before 
consummating the sale.

                              Public Sales


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.935  What are disposal agencies' responsibilities 

concerning public sales?

    Disposal agencies must make available by competitive public sale any

[[Page 261]]

surplus property that is not disposed of by public benefit discount 
conveyance or by negotiated sale. Awards must be made to the responsible 
bidder whose bid will be most advantageous to the Government, price and 
other factors considered.

                         Disposing of Easements


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.936  When can an agency dispose of an easement?

    When the use, occupancy or control of an easement is no longer 
needed, agencies may release the easement to the owner of the land 
subject to the easement (servient estate).


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.937  Can an easement be released or disposed of at no cost?

    Yes. However, agencies must consider the Government's cost of 
acquiring the easement and other factors when determining if the 
easement will be disposed of with or without monetary or other 
consideration. If the easement was acquired at substantial 
consideration, agencies must--
    (a) Determine the easement's fair market value (estimate the fair 
market value of the fee land without the easement and with the easement 
then compute the difference or compute the damage the easement caused to 
the fee land); and
    (b) Negotiate the highest obtainable price with the owner of the 
servient estate to release the easement.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.938  May the easement and the land that benefited from the 

easement (dominant estate) be disposed of separately?

    Yes. If the easement is no longer needed in connection with the 
dominant estate, it may be disposed of separately to the owner of the 
servient estate. However, if the dominant estate is also surplus, the

<R05>
Sec. 102-75.939  When can agencies grant easements?

value of the property?

    If the easement will reduce the property's value, agencies must

value is decreased unless the agency determines that the Government's 
best interests are served by granting the easement at either reduced or 
without monetary or other consideration.

    (a) The lease or permit does not exceed one year and is revocable 
with not more than a 30-day notice by the disposal agency;
    (b) The use and occupancy will not interfere with, delay, or impede

personal property, by providing only those minimum services necessary to 
preserve the Government's interest and realizable value of the property 
considered;
    (b) Place excess and surplus real property in productive use through 
interim utilization, provided, that such temporary use and occupancy do 
not interfere with, delay, or impede its transfer to a Federal agency or 
disposal; and
    (c) Render safe or destroy aspects of excess and surplus real 
property that are dangerous to the public health or safety.

                       Taxes and Other Obligations


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.950  Who has the responsibility for paying property-related

obligations pending transfer or disposal of the property?

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 102-75.230, the landholding

surplus real property?

    The landholding agency is responsible for all expenses to the 
Government and for the supervision of the decontamination of excess and 
surplus real property that has been contaminated with hazardous 
materials of any sort. Extreme care must be exercised in the 
decontamination, management, and disposal of contaminated property in 
order to prevent such properties from becoming a hazard to the general 
public. The landholding agency must inform the disposal agency of any 
and all hazards involved relative to such property to protect the 
general public from hazards and to limit the Government's liability 
resulting from disposal or mishandling of hazardous materials.

                       Improvements or Alterations


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.960  May landholding agencies make improvements or 

alterations to excess or surplus property in those cases where 
disposal is otherwise not 
          feasible?

    Yes, landholding agencies may make improvements or alterations that 
involve rehabilitation, reconditioning, conversion, completion, 
additions, and replacements in excess or surplus structures, utilities, 
installations, and land improvements, in those cases where disposal 
cannot be accomplished without such improvements or alterations. 
However, agencies must not enter into commitments concerning

and must perform the protection and maintenance of such property pending 
transfer to another Federal agency or disposal. Guidelines for 
protection and maintenance of excess and surplus real property are in 
the GSA Customer Guide to Real Property Disposal. The landholding agency

and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan and initiating or 
cooperating with others in the actions prescribed for the prevention, 
containment, or remedy of hazardous conditions.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.970  How long is the landholding agency responsible for 

the expense of protection and maintenance of excess and surplus real 
property pending its 
          transfer or disposal?

    Generally, the landholding agency is responsible for the cost of 
protection and maintenance of excess or surplus

[[Page 263]]

property until the property is transferred or disposed, but not more 
than 15 months. However, the landholding agency is responsible for 
providing and funding protection and maintenance during any delay beyond 
that 15 month period, if the landholding agency--
    (a) Requests deferral of the disposal beyond the 15 month period;
    (b) Continues to occupy the property beyond the 15 month period to 
the detriment of orderly disposal; or
    (c) Otherwise takes actions that result in a delay in the 
disposition beyond the 15 months.


<R05>

disposed of during this time frame?

    If the property is not transferred to a Federal agency or disposed 
of during the 15-month period mentioned in Sec. 102-75.970, then the 
disposal agency must pay or reimburse the landholding agency for 
protection and maintenance expenses incurred from the expiration date of 
said time period to final disposal, unless--
    (a) There is no written agreement between the landholding agency and 
the disposal agency specifying the maximum amount of protection and 
maintenance expenses for which the disposal agency is responsible;
    (b) The disposal agency's appropriation, as authorized by Congress, 
does not contain a provision to allow for payment and/or reimbursement 
of protection and maintenance expenses; or
    (c) The delay is caused by an Executive agency's request for an 
exception from the 100 percent reimbursement requirement specified in 
Sec. 102-75.205. In this latter case, the requesting agency becomes 
responsible for protection and maintenance expenses incurred because of 
the delay.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.980  Who is responsible for protection and maintenance 

expenses if there is no written agreement or no Congressional 
appropriation to the disposal 
          agency?

landholding agency must absorb the entire cost of such actions.


<R04>
    Subpart E_Abandonment, Destruction, or Donation to Public Bodies


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.990  May Federal agencies abandon, destroy, or donate

to public bodies real property?

estimated proceeds from its sale, may--
    (a) Abandon or destroy Government-owned improvements and related 
personal property located on privately-owned land;
    (b) Destroy Government-owned improvements and related personal 
property located on Government-owned land (abandonment of such property

donating it to a public body?

    A Federal agency may not abandon or destroy improvements on land or

This written finding is in addition to the determination prescribed in 
Sec. Sec. 102-75.1000, 102-75.1005, and 102-75.1010. If donating the

regional property disposal office and must submit to GSA a 
recommendation indicating whether

[[Page 268]]

the Government should accept or reject the gift. Nothing in this subpart 
shall be construed as applicable to the acceptance of gifts under the 
provisions of other laws. Following receipt of such notification and 
recommendation, GSA must--

reject such conditional gifts of real property on behalf of the United 
States or before it transfers such conditional gifts of real property to 
an agency; and
    (b) Advise the donor and the agencies concerned of the action taken

offer of a conditional gift take?

    Prior to notifying the appropriate GSA regional property disposal 
office, the receiving Federal agency must acknowledge receipt of the 
offer in writing and advise the donor that the offer will be referred to 
the appropriate GSA regional property disposal office. The receiving 
agency must not indicate acceptance or rejection of the gift on behalf 
of the United States at this time. The receiving agency must provide a 
copy of the acknowledgment with the notification and recommendation to 
the GSA regional property disposal office.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.1150  What happens to the gift if GSA determines it to

be acceptable?

    When GSA determines that the gift is acceptable and can be accepted 
and used in the form in which it was offered, GSA must designate an 
agency and transfer the gift without reimbursement to this agency to use 
as the donor intended.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.1155  May an acceptable gift of property be 

converted to money?

    GSA can determine whether or not a gift of property can and should

best effectuate the intent of the donor, in accordance with Treasury 
Department procedures.

                              Applicability


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.1165  What is the applicability of this subpart?

    (a) This part applies to Federal real property that has been 
designated by Federal landholding agencies as unutilized, underutilized, 
excess, or surplus, and is, therefore, subject to the provisions of 
title V of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, as amended (42 
U.S.C. 11411).
    (b) The following categories of properties are not subject to this 
subpart (regardless of whether they may be unutilized or underutilized):
    (1) Machinery and equipment.
    (2) Government-owned, contractor-operated machinery, equipment, 
land, and other facilities reported excess for sale only to the using 
contractor and subject to a continuing military requirement.
    (3) Properties subject to special legislation directing a particular 
action.
    (4) Properties subject to a court order.
    (5) Property not subject to survey requirements of Executive Order 
12512 (April 29, 1985).
    (6) Mineral rights interests.
    (7) Air Space interests.
    (8) Indian Reservation land subject to 40 U.S.C. 523.
    (9) Property interests subject to reversion.
    (10) Easements.
    (11) Property purchased in whole or in part with Federal funds, if 
title to the property is not held by a Federal landholding agency as 
defined in this part.

                       Collecting the Information


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.1170  How will information be collected?

    (a) Canvass of landholding agencies. On a quarterly basis, HUD will 
canvass landholding agencies to collect information about property 
described as unutilized, underutilized, excess, or surplus in surveys 
conducted by the agencies under 40 U.S.C. 524, Executive Order 12512, 
and subpart H of this part. Each canvass will collect information on 
properties not previously reported and about property reported 
previously the status or classification of which has changed or for 
which any of the information reported on the property checklist has 
changed.
    (1) HUD will request descriptive information on properties 
sufficient to make a reasonable determination, under the criteria 
described below, of the suitability of a property for use as a facility 
to assist the homeless.
    (2) HUD will direct landholding agencies to respond to requests for 
information within 25 days of receipt of such requests.
    (b) Agency annual report. By December 31 of each year, each 
landholding agency must notify HUD regarding the current availability 
status and classification of each property controlled by the agency 
that--
    (1) Was included in a list of suitable properties published that 
year by HUD; and
    (2) Remains available for application for use to assist the 
homeless, or has become available for application during that year.
    (c) GSA inventory. HUD will collect information, in the same manner 
as described in paragraph (a) of this section, from GSA regarding 
property that is in GSA's current inventory of excess or surplus 
property.
    (d) Change in status. If the information provided on the property 
checklist changes subsequent to HUD's determination of suitability, and 
the property remains unutilized, underutilized, excess or surplus, the 
landholding agency must submit a revised property checklist in response 
to the next quarterly canvass. HUD will make a new determination of 
suitability and, if it differs from the previous determination, 
republish the property information in the Federal Register. For example, 
property determined unsuitable for national security concerns may no 
longer be subject to security restrictions, or property determined 
suitable may subsequently be found to be contaminated.

                        Suitability Determination


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.1175  Who issues the suitability determination?

    (a) Suitability determination. Within 30 days after the receipt of 
information from landholding agencies regarding properties that were 
reported pursuant

[[Page 271]]

to the canvass described in Sec. 102-75.1170(a), HUD will determine, 
under criteria set forth in Sec. 102-75.1185, which properties are 
suitable for use as facilities to assist the homeless and report its 
determination to the landholding agency. Properties that are under 
lease, contract, license, or agreement by which a Federal agency retains 
a real property interest or which are scheduled to become unutilized or 
underutilized will be reviewed for suitability no earlier than six 
months prior to the expected date when the property will become 
unutilized or underutilized, except that properties subject to the Base 
Closure and Realignment Act may be reviewed up to eighteen months prior 
to the expected date when the property will become unutilized or 
underutilized.
    (b) Scope of suitability. HUD will determine the suitability of a 
property for use as a facility to assist the homeless without regard to 
any particular use.
    (c) Environmental information. HUD will evaluate the environmental 
information contained in property checklists forwarded to HUD by the 
landholding agencies solely for the purpose of determining suitability 
of properties under the criteria in Sec. 102-75.1185.
    (d) Written record of suitability determination. HUD will assign an 
identification number to each property reviewed for suitability. HUD 
will maintain a written public record of the following:
    (1) The suitability determination for a particular piece of 
property, and the reasons for that determination; and
    (2) The landholding agency's response to the determination pursuant 
to the requirements of Sec. 102-75.1190(a).
    (e) Property determined unsuitable. Property that is reviewed by HUD 
under this section and that is determined unsuitable for use to assist 
the homeless may not be made available for any other purpose for 20 days 
after publication in the Federal Register of a notice of unsuitability 
to allow for review of the determination at the request of a 
representative of the homeless.
    (f) Procedures for appealing unsuitability determinations. (1) To 
request review of a determination of unsuitability, a representative of 
the homeless must contact HUD within 20 days of publication of notice in 
the Federal Register that a property is unsuitable. Requests may be 
submitted to HUD in writing or by calling 1-800-927-7588 (Toll Free). 
Written requests must be received no later than 20 days after notice of 
unsuitability is published in the Federal Register.
    (2) Requests for review of a determination of unsuitability may be 
made only by representatives of the homeless, as defined in Sec. 102-
75.1160.
    (3) The request for review must specify the grounds on which it is 
based, i.e., that HUD has improperly applied the criteria or that HUD 
has relied on incorrect or incomplete information in making the 
determination (e.g., that property is in a floodplain but not in a 
floodway).
    (4) Upon receipt of a request to review a determination of 
unsuitability, HUD will notify the landholding agency that such a 
request has been made, request that the agency respond with any 
information pertinent to the review, and advise the agency that it 
should refrain from initiating disposal procedures until HUD has 
completed its reconsideration regarding unsuitability.
    (i) HUD will act on all requests for review within 30 days of 
receipt of the landholding agency's response and will notify the 
representative of the homeless and the landholding agency in writing of 
its decision.
    (ii) If a property is determined suitable as a result of the review, 
HUD will request the landholding agency's determination of availability 
pursuant to Sec. 102-75.1190(a), upon receipt of which HUD will 
promptly publish the determination in the Federal Register. If the 
determination of unsuitability stands, HUD will inform the 
representative of the homeless of its decision.

                  Real Property Reported Excess to GSA


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.1180  For the purposes of this subpart, what is 

the policy concerning real property reported excess to GSA?

    (a) Each landholding agency must submit a report to GSA of 
properties it determines excess. Each landholding agency must also 
provide a copy of

[[Page 272]]

HUD's suitability determination, if any, including HUD's identification 
number for the property.
    (b) If a landholding agency reports a property to GSA that has been 
reviewed by HUD for homeless assistance suitability and HUD determined 
the property suitable, GSA will screen the property pursuant to Sec. 
102-75.1180(g) and will advise HUD of the availability of the property 
for use by the homeless as provided in Sec. 102-75.1180(e). In lieu of 
the above, GSA may submit a new checklist to HUD and follow the 
procedures in Sec. 102-75.1180(c) through Sec. 102-75.1180(g).
    (c) If a landholding agency reports a property to GSA that has not 
been reviewed by HUD for homeless assistance suitability, GSA will 
complete a property checklist, based on information provided by the 
landholding agency, and will forward this checklist to HUD for a 
suitability determination. This checklist will reflect any change in 
classification, i.e., from unutilized or underutilized to excess.
    (d) Within 30 days after GSA's submission, HUD will advise GSA of 
the suitability determination.
    (e) When GSA receives a letter from HUD listing suitable excess 
properties in GSA's inventory, GSA will transmit to HUD within 45 days a 
response that includes the following for each identified property:
    (1) A statement that there is no other compelling Federal need for 
the property and, therefore, the property will be determined surplus; or
    (2) A statement that there is further and compelling Federal need 
for the property (including a full explanation of such need) and that, 
therefore, the property is not presently available for use to assist the 
homeless.
    (f) When an excess property is determined suitable and available and 
notice is published in the Federal Register, GSA will concurrently 
notify HHS, HUD, State and local government units, known homeless 
assistance providers that have expressed interest in the particular 
property, and other organizations, as appropriate, concerning suitable 
properties.
    (g) Upon submission of a Report of Excess to GSA, GSA may screen the 
property for Federal use. In addition, GSA may screen State and local 
governmental units and eligible non-profit organizations to determine 
interest in the property in accordance with current regulations. (See 
GSA Customer Guide to Real Property Disposal.)
    (h) The landholding agency will retain custody and accountability 
and will protect and maintain any property that is reported excess to 
GSA as provided in Sec. 102-75.965.

                          Suitability Criteria


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.1185  What are suitability criteria?

    (a) All properties, buildings, and land will be determined suitable 
unless a property's characteristics include one or more of the following 
conditions:
    (1) National security concerns. A property located in an area to 
which the general public is denied access in the interest of national 
security (e.g., where a special pass or security clearance is a 
condition of entry to the property) will be determined unsuitable. Where 
alternative access can be provided for the public without compromising 
national security, the property will not be determined unsuitable on 
this basis.
    (2) Property containing flammable or explosive materials. A property 
located within 2,000 feet of an industrial, commercial, or Federal 
facility handling flammable or explosive material (excluding underground 
storage) will be determined unsuitable. Above ground containers with a 
capacity of 100 gallons or less, or larger containers that provide the 
heating or power source for the property, and that meet local safety, 
operation, and permitting standards, will not affect whether a 
particular property is determined suitable or unsuitable. Underground 
storage, gasoline stations, and tank trucks are not included in this 
category, and their presence will not be the basis of an unsuitability 
determination unless there is evidence of a threat to personal safety as 
provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
    (3) Runway clear zone and military airfield clear zone. A property 
located within an airport runway clear zone or military airfield clear 
zone will be determined unsuitable.

[[Page 273]]

    (4) Floodway. A property located in the floodway of a 100-year 
floodplain will be determined unsuitable. If the floodway has been 
contained or corrected, or if only an incidental portion of the property 
not affecting the use of the remainder of the property is in the 
floodway, the property will not be determined unsuitable.
    (5) Documented deficiencies. A property with a documented and 
extensive condition(s) that represents a clear threat to personal 
physical safety will be determined unsuitable. Such conditions may 
include, but are not limited to, contamination, structural damage, 
extensive deterioration, friable asbestos, PCBs, natural hazardous 
substances such as radon, periodic flooding, sinkholes, or earth slides.
    (6) Inaccessible. A property that is inaccessible will be determined 
unsuitable. An inaccessible property is one that is not accessible by 
road (including property on small off-shore islands) or is land locked 
(e.g., can be reached only by crossing private property and there is no 
established right or means of entry).
    (b) [Reserved]

                      Determination of Availability


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.1190  What is the policy concerning determination of 

availability statements?

    (a) Within 45 days after receipt of a letter from HUD pursuant to 
Sec. 102-75.1170(a), each landholding agency must transmit to HUD a 
statement of one of the following:
    (1) In the case of unutilized or underutilized property--
    (i) An intention to declare the property excess;
    (ii) An intention to make the property available for use to assist 
the homeless; or
    (iii) The reasons why the property cannot be declared excess or made 
available for use to assist the homeless. The reasons given must be 
different than those listed as suitability criteria in Sec. 102-
75.1185.
    (2) In the case of excess property that had previously been reported 
to GSA--
    (i) A statement that there is no compelling Federal need for the 
property and that, therefore, the property will be determined surplus; 
or
    (ii) A statement that there is a further and compelling Federal need 
for the property (including a full explanation of such need) and that, 
therefore, the property is not presently available for use to assist the 
homeless.
    (b) [Reserved]

                     Public Notice of Determination


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.1195  What is the policy concerning making public the 

notice of determination?

    (a) No later than 15 days after the last-45 day period has elapsed 
for receiving responses from the landholding agencies regarding 
availability, HUD will publish in the Federal Register a list of all 
properties reviewed, including a description of the property, its 
address, and classification. The following designations will be made:
    (1) Properties that are suitable and available.
    (2) Properties that are suitable and unavailable.
    (3) Properties that are suitable and to be declared excess.
    (4) Properties that are unsuitable.
    (b) Information about specific properties can be obtained by 
contacting HUD at the following toll free number: 1-800-927-7588.
    (c) HUD will transmit to the ICH a copy of the list of all 
properties published in the Federal Register. The ICH will immediately 
distribute to all state and regional homeless coordinators area-relevant 
portions of the list. The ICH will encourage the state and regional 
homeless coordinators to disseminate this information widely.
    (d) No later than February 15 of each year, HUD will publish in the 
Federal Register a list of all properties reported pursuant to Sec. 
102-75.1170(b).
    (e) HUD will publish an annual list of properties determined 
suitable, but that agencies reported unavailable, including the reasons 
such properties are not available.
    (f) Copies of the lists published in the Federal Register will be 
available for review by the public in the HUD headquarters building 
library (room 8141); area-relevant portions of the lists will be 
available in the HUD regional offices and in major field offices.

                           Application Process


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.1200  How may representatives of the homeless apply 

for the use of properties to assist the homeless?

    (a) Holding period. (1) Properties published as available for 
application for use to assist the homeless shall not be available for 
any other purpose for a period of 60 days beginning on the date of 
publication. Any representative of the homeless interested in any 
underutilized, unutilized, excess or surplus Federal property for use as 
a facility to assist the homeless must send to HHS a written expression 
of interest in that property within 60 days after the property has been 
published in the Federal Register.
    (2) If a written expression of interest to apply for suitable 
property for use to assist the homeless is received by HHS within the 
60-day holding period, such property may not be made available for any 
other purpose until the date HHS or the appropriate landholding agency 
has completed action on the application submitted pursuant to that 
expression of interest.
    (3) The expression of interest should identify the specific 
property, briefly describe the proposed use, the name of the 
organization, and indicate whether it is a public body or a private, 
non-profit organization. The expression of interest must be sent to the 
Division of Health Facilities Planning (DHFP) of the Department of 
Health and Human Services at the following address: Director, Division 
of Health Facilities Planning, Public Health Service, Room 17A-10, 
Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857. HHS 
will notify the landholding agency (for unutilized and underutilized 
properties) or GSA (for excess and surplus properties) when an 
expression of interest has been received for a particular property.
    (4) An expression of interest may be sent to HHS any time after the 
60-day holding period has expired. In such a case, an application 
submitted pursuant to this expression of interest may be approved for 
use by the homeless if--
    (i) No application or written expression of interest has been made 
under any law for use of the property for any purpose; and
    (ii) In the case of excess or surplus property, GSA has not received 
a bona fide offer to purchase that property or advertised for the sale 
of the property by public auction.
    (b) Application requirements. Upon receipt of an expression of 
interest, DHFP will send an application packet to the interested entity. 
The application packet requires the applicant to provide certain 
information, including the following:
    (1) Description of the applicant organization. The applicant must 
document that it satisfies the definition of a ``representative of the 
homeless,'' as specified in Sec. 102-75.1160. The applicant must 
document its authority to hold real property. Private, non-profit 
organizations applying for deeds must document that they are section 
501(c)(3) tax-exempt.
    (2) Description of the property desired. The applicant must describe 
the property desired and indicate that any modifications made to the 
property will conform to local use restrictions, except for, in the case 
of leasing the property, local zoning regulations.
    (3) Description of the proposed program. The applicant must fully 
describe the proposed program and demonstrate how the program will 
address the needs of the homeless population to be assisted. The 
applicant must fully describe what modifications will be made to the 
property before the program becomes operational.
    (4) Ability to finance and operate the proposed program. The 
applicant must specifically describe all anticipated costs and sources 
of funding for the proposed program. The applicant must indicate that it 
can assume care, custody, and maintenance of the property and that it 
has the necessary funds or the ability to obtain such funds to carry out 
the approved program of use for the property.
    (5) Compliance with non-discrimination requirements. Each applicant 
and lessee under this part must certify in writing that it will comply 
with the requirements of the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-3619) and 
implementing regulations; and as applicable, Executive Order 11063 
(Equal Opportunity in

[[Page 275]]

Housing) and implementing regulations; Title VI of the Civil Rights Act 
of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d to d-4) (Nondiscrimination in Federally-
Assisted Programs) and implementing regulations; the prohibitions 
against discrimination on the basis of age under the Age Discrimination 
Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101-6107) and implementing regulations; and the 
prohibitions against otherwise qualified individuals with handicaps 
under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and 
implementing regulations. The applicant must state that it will not 
discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, 
sex, age, familial status, or disability in the use of the property, and 
will maintain the required records to demonstrate compliance with 
Federal laws.
    (6) Insurance. The applicant must certify that it will insure the 
property against loss, damage, or destruction in accordance with the 
requirements of 45 CFR Sec. 12.9.
    (7) Historic preservation. Where applicable, the applicant must 
provide information that will enable HHS to comply with Federal historic 
preservation requirements.
    (8) Environmental information. The applicant must provide sufficient 
information to allow HHS to analyze the potential impact of the 
applicant's proposal on the environment, in accordance with the 
instructions provided with the application packet. HHS will assist 
applicants in obtaining any pertinent environmental information in the 
possession of HUD, GSA, or the landholding agency.
    (9) Local government notification. The applicant must indicate that 
it has informed, in writing, the applicable unit of general local 
government responsible for providing sewer, water, police, and fire 
services of its proposed program.
    (10) Zoning and local use restrictions. The applicant must indicate 
that it will comply with all local use restrictions, including local 
building code requirements. Any applicant applying for a lease or permit 
for a particular property is not required to comply with local zoning 
requirements. Any applicant applying for a deed of a particular 
property, pursuant to Sec. 102-75.1200(b)(3), must comply with local 
zoning requirements, as specified in 45 CFR part 12.
    (c) Scope of evaluations. Due to the short time frame imposed for 
evaluating applications, HHS' evaluation will, generally, be limited to 
the information contained in the application.
    (d) Deadline. Completed applications must be received by DHFP, at 
the above address, within 90 days after an expression of interest is 
received from a particular applicant for that property. Upon written 
request from the applicant, HHS may grant extensions, provided that the 
appropriate landholding agency concurs with the extension. Because each 
applicant will have a different deadline based on the date the applicant 
submitted an expression of interest, applicants should contact the 
individual landholding agency to confirm that a particular property 
remains available prior to submitting an application.
    (e) Evaluations. (1) Upon receipt of an application, HHS will review 
it for completeness and, if incomplete, may return it or ask the 
applicant to furnish any missing or additional required information 
prior to final evaluation of the application.
    (2) HHS will evaluate each completed application within 25 days of 
receipt and will promptly advise the applicant of its decision. 
Applications are evaluated on a first-come, first-serve basis. HHS will 
notify all organizations that have submitted expressions of interest for 
a particular property regarding whether the first application received 
for that property has been approved or disapproved. All applications 
will be reviewed on the basis of the following elements, which are 
listed in descending order of priority, except that paragraphs 
(e)(2)(iv) and (e)(2)(v) of this section are of equal importance:
    (i) Services offered. The extent and range of proposed services, 
such as meals, shelter, job training, and counseling.
    (ii) Need. The demand for the program and the degree to which the 
available property will be fully utilized.
    (iii) Implementation time. The amount of time necessary for the 
proposed program to become operational.

[[Page 276]]

    (iv) Experience. Demonstrated prior success in operating similar 
programs and recommendations attesting to that fact by Federal, State, 
and local authorities.
    (v) Financial ability. The adequacy of funding that will likely be 
available to run the program fully and properly and to operate the 
facility.
    (3) Additional evaluation factors may be added as deemed necessary 
by HHS. If additional factors are added, the application packet will be 
revised to include a description of these additional factors.
    (4) If HHS receives one or more competing applications for a 
property within 5 days of the first application, HHS will evaluate all 
completed applications simultaneously. HHS will rank approved 
applications based on the elements listed in Sec. 102-75.1200(e)(2) and 
notify the landholding agency, or GSA, as appropriate, of the relative 
ranks.

                     Action on Approved Applications


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.1205  What action must be taken on approved applications?

    (a) Unutilized and underutilized properties. (1) When HHS approves 
an application, it will so notify the applicant and forward a copy of 
the application to the landholding agency. The landholding agency will 
execute the lease, or permit document, as appropriate, in consultation 
with the applicant.
    (2) The landholding agency maintains the discretion to decide the 
following:
    (i) The length of time the property will be available. (Leases and 
permits will be for a period of at least one year, unless the applicant 
requests a shorter term.)
    (ii) Whether to grant use of the property pursuant to a lease or 
permit.
    (iii) The terms and conditions of the lease or permit document.
    (b) Excess and surplus properties. (1) When HHS approves an 
application, it will so notify the applicant and request that GSA assign 
the property to HHS for leasing. Upon receipt of the assignment, HHS 
will execute a lease in accordance with the procedures and requirements 
set out in 45 CFR part 12. In accordance with Sec. 102-75.965, custody 
and accountability of the property will remain throughout the lease term 
with the agency that initially reported the property as excess.
    (2) Prior to assignment to HHS, GSA may consider other Federal uses 
and other important national needs; however, in deciding the disposition 
of surplus real property, GSA will generally give priority of 
consideration to uses to assist the homeless. GSA may consider any 
competing request for the property made under 40 U.S.C. 550 (education, 
health, public park or recreation, and historic monument uses) that is 
so meritorious and compelling that it outweighs the needs of the 
homeless, and HHS may likewise consider any competing request made under 
40 U.S.C. 550(c) or (d) (education and health uses).
    (3) Whenever GSA or HHS decides in favor of a competing request over 
a request for property for homeless assistance use as provided in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the agency making the decision will 
transmit to the appropriate committees of the Congress an explanatory 
statement that details the need satisfied by conveyance of the surplus 
property, and the reasons for determining that such need was so 
meritorious and compelling as to outweigh the needs of the homeless.
    (4) Deeds. Surplus property may be conveyed to representatives of 
the homeless pursuant to 40 U.S.C. 550, and section 501(f) of the 
McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 11411. 
Representatives of the homeless must complete the application packet 
pursuant to the requirements of Sec. 102-75.1200 and in accordance with 
the requirements of 45 CFR part 12.
    (c) Completion of lease term and reversion of title. Lessees and 
grantees will be responsible for the protection and maintenance of the 
property during the time that they possess the property. Upon 
termination of the lease term or reversion of title to the Federal 
Government, the lessee or grantee will be responsible for removing any 
improvements made to the property and will be responsible for 
restoration of the property. If such improvements are not removed, they 
will become the property of the Federal Government. GSA or the 
landholding agency, as appropriate,

[[Page 277]]

will assume responsibility for protection and maintenance of a property 
when the lease terminates or title reverts.

                          Unsuitable Properties


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.1210  What action must be taken on properties determined

unsuitable for homeless assistance?

    The landholding agency will defer, for 20 days after the date that 
notice of a property is published in the Federal Register, action to 
dispose of properties determined unsuitable for homeless assistance. HUD 
will inform landholding agencies or GSA, if a representative of the 
homeless files an appeal of unsuitability pursuant to Sec. 102-
75.1175(f)(4). HUD will advise the agency that it should refrain from 
initiating disposal procedures until HUD has completed its 
reconsideration process regarding unsuitability. Thereafter, or if no 
appeal has been filed after 20 days, GSA or the appropriate landholding 
agency may proceed with disposal action in accordance with applicable 
law.

                        No Applications Approved


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.1215  What action must be taken if there is no expression 

of interest?

    (a) At the end of the 60-day holding period described in Sec. 102-
75.1200(a), HHS will notify GSA, or the landholding agency, as 
appropriate, if an expression of interest has been received for a 
particular property. Where there is no expression of interest, GSA or 
the landholding agency, as appropriate, will proceed with disposal in 
accordance with applicable law.
    (b) Upon advice from HHS that all applications have been 
disapproved, or if no completed applications or requests for extensions 
have been received by HHS within 90 days from the date of the last 
expression of interest, disposal may proceed in accordance with 
applicable law.


<R04>
              Subpart I_Screening of Federal Real Property


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.1220  How do landholding agencies find out if excess 

Federal real property is available?

    If agencies report excess real and related personal property to GSA, 
GSA conducts a ``Federal screening'' for the property. Federal screening 
consists of developing a ``Notice of Availability'' and circulating the 
``Notice'' among all Federal landholding agencies for a maximum of 30 
days.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.1225  What details are provided in the ``Notice of 

Availability''?

    The ``Notice of Availability'' describes the physical 
characteristics of the property; it also provides information on 
location, hazards or restrictions, contact information, and a date by 
which an interested Federal agency must respond in writing to indicate a 
definite or potential need for the property.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.1230  How long does an agency have to indicate its 

interest in the property?

    Generally, agencies have 30 days to express written interest in the 
property. However, sometimes GSA has cause to conduct an expedited 
screening of the real property and the time allotted for responding is 
less than 30 days. The Notice of Availability always contains a 
``respond by'' date.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.1235  Where should an agency send its written response 

to the ``Notice of Availability''?

    Look for the contact information provided in the Notice of 
Availability. Most likely, an agency will be directed to contact one of 
GSA's regional offices.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.1240  Who, from the interested landholding agency,

should submit the written response to GSA's ``Notice of Availability''?

    An authorized official of the landholding agency must sign the 
written response to the Notice of Availability. An ``authorized 
official'' is one who is responsible for acquisition and/or disposal 
decisions (e.g., head of the agency or official designee).

[[Page 278]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.1245  What happens after the landholding agency 

properly responds to a ``Notice of Availability''?

    The landholding agency has 60 days (from the expiration date of the 
``Notice of Availability'') to submit a formal transfer request for the 
property. Absent a formal request for transfer within the prescribed 60 
days, GSA may, at its discretion, pursue other disposal options.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.1250  What if the agency is not quite sure it wants 

the property and needs more time to decide?

    If the written response to the ``Notice of Availability'' indicates 
a potential need, then the agency has an additional 30 days (from the 
expiration date of the ``Notice of Availability'') to determine whether 
or not its has a definite requirement for the property, and then 60 days 
to submit a transfer request.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.1255  What happens when more than one agency has a 

valid interest in the property?

    GSA will attempt to facilitate an equitable solution between the 
agencies involved. However, the Administrator has final decision making 
authority in determining which requirement aligns with the Federal 
Government's best interests.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.1260  Does GSA conduct Federal screening on every

property reported as excess real property?

    No. GSA may waive the Federal screening for excess real property 
when it determines that doing so is in the best interest of the Federal 
Government.
    Below is a sample list of some of the factors GSA may consider when 
making the decision to waive Federal screening. This list is a 
representative sample and is not all-inclusive:
    (a) There is a known Federal need;
    (b) The property is located within the boundaries of tribal lands;
    (c) The property has known disposal limitations precluding further 
Federal use (e.g., title and/or utilization restrictions; reported 
excess specifically for participation in the Relocation Program; 
reported excess for transfer to the current operating contractor who 
will continue production according to the terms of the disposal 
documents; directed for disposal by law or special legislation);
    (d) The property will be transferred to a ``potentially responsible 
party'' (PRP) that stored, released, or disposed of hazardous substances 
at the Government-owned facility;
    (e) The property is an easement;
    (f) The excess property is actually a leasehold interest where there 
are Government-owned improvements with substantial value and cannot be 
easily removed;
    (g) Government-owned improvements on Government-owned land, where 
the land is neither excess nor expected to become excess; or
    (h) Screening for public benefit uses, except for the McKinney-Vento 
homeless screening, for specific property disposal considerations (see 
Sec. 102-75.351).


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.1265  Are extensions granted to the Federal screening

and response timeframes?

    Generally, no. GSA believes the timeframes are sufficient for 
agencies to make a decision and respond. Requests for extensions must be 
strongly justified and approved by the appropriate GSA Regional 
Administrator. For example, agencies may request an extension of time to 
submit their formal transfer request if they are not promptly provided 
GSA's estimate of FMV after submission of the initial expression of 
interest. Agencies requesting extensions must also submit an agreement 
accepting responsibility for providing and funding protection and 
maintenance for the requested property during the period of the 
extension until the property is transferred to the requesting agency or 
the requesting agency notifies GSA that it is no longer interested in 
the property. This assumption of protection and maintenance 
responsibility also applies to extensions associated with a requesting 
agency's request for an exception from the 100 percent reimbursement 
requirement (see Sec. 102-75.205).

[[Page 279]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.1270  How does an agency request a transfer of 

Federal real property?

    Agencies must use GSA Form 1334, Request for Transfer of Excess Real 
and Related Personal Property.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.1275  Does a requesting agency have to pay for excess

real property?

    Yes. GSA is required by law to obtain full fair market value (as 
determined by the Administrator) for all real property (see Sec. 102-
75.190), except when a transfer without reimbursement has been 
authorized (see Sec. 102-75.205). GSA, upon receipt of a valid 
expression of interest, will promptly provide each interested 
landholding agency with an estimate of fair market value for the 
property. GSA may transfer property without reimbursement, if directed 
to do so by law or special legislation and for the following purposes:
    (a) Migratory Bird Management under Pub. L. 80-537, as amended by 
Pub. L. 92-432.
    (b) Wildlife Conservation under Pub. L. 80-537.
    (c) Federal Correctional facilities.
    (d) Joint Surveillance System.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.1280  What happens if the property has already been

declared surplus and an agency discovers a need for it?

    GSA can redesignate surplus property as excess property, if the 
agency requests the property for use in direct support of its mission 
and GSA is satisfied that this transfer would be in the best interests 
of the Federal Government.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.1285  How does GSA transfer excess real property to 

the requesting agency?

    GSA transfers the property via letter assigning ``custody and 
accountability'' for the property to the requesting agency. Title to the 
property is held in the name of the United States; however, the 
requesting agency becomes the landholding agency and is responsible for 
providing and funding protection and maintenance for the property.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.1290  What happens if the landholding agency requesting 

the property does not promptly accept custody and accountability?

    (a) The requesting agency must assume protection and maintenance 
responsibilities for the property within 30 days of the date of the 
letter assigning custody and accountability for the property.
    (b) After notifying the requesting agency, GSA may, at its 
discretion, pursue other disposal options.

<R04>
                  Subpart C_Architectural Barriers Act


<R05>
Sec. 102-76.60  To which facilities does the Architectural 

Barriers Act apply?

    (a) The Architectural Barriers Act applies to any facility that is 
intended for use by the public or that may result in the employment or 
residence therein of individuals with disabilities, which is to be--
    (1) Constructed or altered by, or on behalf of, the United States;
    (2) Leased in whole or in part by the United States;
    (3) Financed in whole or in part by a grant or loan made by the 
United States, if the building or facility is subject to standards for 
design, construction, or alteration issued under the authority of the 
law authorizing such a grant or loan; or
    (4) Constructed under the authority of the National Capital 
Transportation Act of 1960, the National Capital Transportation Act of 
1965, or Title III of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit 
Regulation Compact.
    (b) The Architectural Barriers Act does not apply to any privately 
owned residential facility unless leased by the Government for 
subsidized housing programs, and any facility on a military reservation 
designed and constructed primarily for use by able bodied military 
personnel.


<R05>
Sec. 102-76.65  What standards must facilities subject to the

Architectural Barriers Act meet?

    (a) GSA adopts Appendices C and D to 36 CFR part 1191 (ABA Chapters 
1 and 2, and Chapters 3 through 10) as the Architectural Barriers Act 
Accessibility Standard (ABAAS). Facilities subject to the Architectural 
Barriers Act (other than facilities described in paragraphs (b) and (c) 
of this section) must comply with ABAAS as set forth below:
    (1) For construction or alteration of facilities subject to the 
Architectural Barriers Act (other than Federal lease-construction and 
other lease actions described in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3), 
respectively, of this section), compliance with ABAAS is required if the 
construction or alteration commenced after May 8, 2006. If the 
construction or alteration of such a facility commenced on or before May 
8, 2006, compliance with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards 
(UFAS) is required.
    (2) For Federal lease-construction actions subject to the 
Architectural Barriers Act, where the Government expressly requires new 
construction to meet its needs, compliance with ABAAS is required for 
all such leases awarded on or after June 30, 2006. UFAS compliance is 
required for all such leases awarded before June 30, 2006.
    (3) For all other lease actions subject to the Architectural 
Barriers Act

[[Page 283]]

(other than those described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section), 
compliance with ABAAS is required for all such leases awarded pursuant 
to solicitations issued after February 6, 2007. UFAS compliance is 
required for all such leases awarded pursuant to solicitations issued on

Sec. 102-76.70  When are the costs of alterations to provide

an accessible path of travel to an altered area containing a 
primary function disproportionate to 
          the costs of the overall alterations for facilities subject to 
          the standards in Sec. 102-76.65(a)?

    For facilities subject to the standards in Sec. 102-76.65(a), the 
costs of alterations to provide an accessible path of travel to an 
altered area containing a primary function are disproportionate to the 
costs of the overall alterations when they exceed 20 percent of the 
costs of the alterations to the primary function area. If a series of 
small alterations are made to areas containing a primary function and 
the costs of any of the alterations considered individually would not 
result in providing an accessible path of travel to the altered areas, 
the total costs of the alterations made within the three year period 
after the initial alteration must be considered when determining whether 
the costs of alterations to provide an accessible path of travel to the 
altered areas are disproportionate. Facilities for which new leases are 
entered into must comply with F202.6 of the Architectural Barriers Act 
Accessibility Standard without regard to whether the costs of 
alterations to comply with F202.6 are disproportionate to the costs of 
the overall alterations.


<R05>
Sec. 102-76.75  What costs are included in the costs of alterations to

provide an accessible path of travel to an altered area containing a 
primary function 
          for facilities subject to the standards in Sec. 102-76.65(a)?

    For facilities subject to the standards in Sec. 102-76.65(a), the 
costs of alterations to provide an accessible path of travel to an 
altered area containing a primary function include the costs associated 
with--
    (a) Providing an accessible route to connect the altered area and 
site arrival points, including but not limited to interior and exterior 
ramps, elevators and lifts, and curb ramps;
    (b) Making entrances serving the altered area accessible, including 
but not limited to widening doorways and installing accessible hardware;
    (c) Making restrooms serving the altered area accessible, including, 
but not limited to, enlarging toilet stalls, installing grab bars and 
accessible faucet controls, and insulating pipes under lavatories;
    (d) Making public telephones serving the altered area accessible, 
including, but not limited to, placing telephones at an accessible 
height, and installing amplification devices and TTYs;
    (e) Making drinking fountains serving the altered area accessible; 
and
    (f) Making parking spaces serving the altered area accessible.


<R05>
Sec. 102-76.80  What is required if the costs of alterations to 

provide an accessible path of travel to an altered area containing
a primary function are 
          disproportionate to the costs of the overall alterations for 
          facilities subject to the standards in Sec. 102-76.65(a)?

    For facilities subject to the standards in Sec. 102-76.65(a), if 
the costs of alterations to provide an accessible path of travel to an 
altered area containing a primary function are disproportionate to the 
costs of the overall alterations, the path of travel must be made 
accessible to the extent possible without exceeding 20 percent of the 
costs of the alterations to the primary function area. Priority should 
be given to those elements that will provide the greatest access in the 
following order:
    (a) An accessible route and an accessible entrance;

[[Page 284]]

    (b) At least one accessible restroom for each sex or a single unisex 
restroom;
    (c) Accessible telephones;
    (d) Accessible drinking fountains; and
    (e) Accessible parking spaces.


<R05>
Sec. 102-76.85  What is a primary function area for purposes of 

providing an accessible route in leased facilities subject to the 
standards in Sec. 102-
          76.65(a)?

    For purposes of providing an accessible route in leased facilities 
subject to the standards in Sec. 102-76.65(a), a primary function area 
is an area that contains a major activity for which the leased facility 
is intended. Primary function areas include areas where services are 
provided to customers or the public, and offices and other work areas in 
which the activities of the Federal agency using the leased facility are 
carried out.


<R05>
Sec. 102-76.90  Who has the authority to waive or modify the standards

in Sec. 102-76.65(a)?

    The Administrator of General Services has the authority to waive or 
modify the standards in Sec. 102-76.65(a) on a case-by-case basis if 
the agency head or GSA department head submits a request for waiver or 
modification and the Administrator determines that the waiver or 
modification is clearly necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 102-76.95  What recordkeeping responsibilities do Federal

agencies have?

    (a) The head of each Federal agency must ensure that documentation 
is maintained on each contract, grant or loan for the design, 
construction or alteration of a facility and on each lease for a 
facility subject to the standards in Sec. 102-76.65(a) containing one 
of the following statements:
    (1) The standards have been or will be incorporated in the design, 
the construction or the alteration.
    (2) The grant or loan has been or will be made subject to a 
requirement that the standards will be incorporated in the design, the 
construction or the alteration.
    (3) The leased facility meets the standards, or has been or will be 
altered to meet the standards.
    (4) The standards have been waived or modified by the Administrator 
of General Services, and a copy of the waiver or modification is 
included with the statement.
    (b) If a determination is made that a facility is not subject to the 
standards in Sec. 102-76.65(a) because the Architectural Barriers Act 
does not apply to the facility, the head of the Federal agency must 
ensure that documentation is maintained to justify the determination.

    (a) At least 95 percent of the membership of the credit union to be 
served by the allotment of space is composed of persons who either are 
presently Federal employees or were Federal employees at the time of 
admission into the credit union, and members of their families; and
    (b) Space is available.


<R05>
Sec. 102-79.45  What type of services may Federal agencies provide 

without charge to Federal credit unions?

    Federal agencies may provide without charge to Federal credit union 
services such as--
    (a) Lighting;
    (b) Heating and cooling;

                          Utilization of Space


<R05>
Sec. 102-79.50  What standard must Executive agencies promote in

their utilization of space?

    Executive agencies, when acquiring or utilizing Federally owned or 
leased space under Title 40 of the United States Code, must promote 
efficient utilization of space. Where there is no Federal agency space 
need, Executive agencies must make every effort to maximize the 
productive use of vacant space through the issuance of permits, licenses 
or leases to non-Federal entities to the extent authorized by law. (For 
vacant property determined excess to agency needs, refer to part 102-75, 
Real Property Disposal.)


<R05>
Sec. 102-79.55  Is there a general hierarchy of consideration that 

agencies must follow in their utilization of space?

    Yes, Federal agencies must--
    (a) First utilize space in Government-owned and Government-leased 
buildings; and
    (b) If there is no suitable space in Government-owned and 
Government-leased buildings, utilize space in buildings under the 
custody and control of the U.S. Postal Service; and
    (c) If there is no suitable space in buildings under the custody and 
control of the U.S. Postal Service, agencies may acquire real estate by 
lease, purchase, or construction, as specified in part 102-73 of this 
chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 102-79.60  Are agencies required to use historic properties 

available to the agency?

    Yes, Federal agencies must assume responsibility for the 
preservation of the historic properties they own or control. Prior to 
acquiring, constructing or leasing buildings, agencies must use, to the 
maximum extent feasible, historic properties already owned or leased by 
the agency (16 U.S.C. 470h-2).

                               Outleasing


<R05>
Sec. 102-79.65  May Executive agencies outlease space on major 

public access levels, courtyards and rooftops of public buildings?

    Yes. Authority to execute such outleases may be delegated by the 
Administrator based on authorities provided by the Public Buildings 
Cooperative Use Act (40 U.S.C. Sec. 581(h)), the proceeds of which are 
to be deposited into GSA's Federal Buildings Fund. Using such authority, 
Executive agencies, upon approval from GSA, may--
    (a) Enter into leases of space on major public access levels, 
courtyards and rooftops of any public building with persons, firms, or 
organizations engaged in commercial, cultural, educational, or 
recreational activities (as defined in 40 U.S.C. 3306);
    (b) Establish rental rates for such leased space equivalent to the 
prevailing commercial rate for comparable space devoted to a similar 
purpose in the vicinity of the building; and
    (c) Use leases that contain terms and conditions that the 
Administrator deems necessary to promote competition and protect the 
public interest.

                   Siting Antennas on Federal Property


<R05>
Sec. 102-79.70  May Executive agencies assess fees against other 

Executive agencies for antenna placements and supporting services?

    Yes. Executive agencies, upon approval from GSA, may assess fees for 
placement of antennas and supporting services against other agencies 
(that own these antennas) under 40 U.S.C. 586(c) and 40 U.S.C. 121(e). 
Unless a differing rate has been approved by the Administrator, such 
fees or charges must approximate commercial charges for comparable space 
and services (i.e., market rates). The proceeds from such charges or 
fees must be credited to the appropriation or fund initially charged for 
providing the space or services. Any amounts in excess of actual 
operating and maintenance costs must be credited to miscellaneous 
receipts unless otherwise provided by law. The charges or fees assessed 
by the Administrator for the placement of antennas and supporting 
services in GSA-controlled

[[Page 291]]

space are generally credited to GSA's Federal Buildings Fund.


<R05>
Sec. 102-79.75  May Executive agencies assess fees for antenna

placements against public service organizations for antenna site 
outleases on major pedestrian 
          access levels, courtyards, and rooftops of public buildings?

    Yes. Executive agencies in GSA-controlled space, upon approval from 
GSA, may assess fees for antenna placements against public service 
organizations under 40 U.S.C. 581(h) and 40 U.S.C. 121(e). Such fees or 
rental rates must be equivalent to the prevailing commercial rate for 
comparable space devoted to commercial antenna placements in the 
vicinity of the public building and the proceeds from such charges or 
fees must be credited to GSA's Federal Buildings Fund.


<R05>
Sec. 102-79.80  May Executive agencies assess fees for antenna 

placements against telecommunication service providers for antenna 
site outleases on major 
          pedestrian access levels, courtyards, and rooftops of public 
          buildings?

    Yes. GSA, or other Executive agencies, upon approval from GSA, may 
charge fees based on market value to telecommunication service providers 
for antenna placements in public buildings. Market value should be 
equivalent to the prevailing commercial rate for comparable space for 
commercial antenna placements in the vicinity of the public building. 
Such fees must be credited to GSA's Federal Buildings Fund.


<R05>
Sec. 102-79.85  What policy must Executive agencies follow concerning

the placement of commercial antennas on Federal property?

    Executive agencies will make antenna sites available on a fair, 
reasonable, and nondiscriminatory basis. Collocation of antennas should 
be encouraged where there are multiple antenna siting requests for the 
same location. In cases where this is not feasible and space 
availability precludes accommodating all antenna siting applicants, 
competitive procedures may be used. This should be done in accordance 
with applicable Federal, State and local laws and regulations, and 
consistent with national security concerns. In making antenna sites 
available, agencies must avoid electromagnetic intermodulations and 
interferences. To the maximum extent practicable, when placing antennas 
for the provision of telecommunication services to the Federal 
Government, agencies should use redundant and physically separate entry 
points into the building and physically diverse local network facilities 
in accordance with guidance issued by the Office of Management and 
Budget.


<R05>
Sec. 102-79.90  What criteria must Executive agencies consider when 

evaluating antenna siting requests?

    When evaluating antenna siting requests, Executive agencies must 
consider issues such as--
    (a) Public health and safety with respect to the antenna 
installation and maintenance;
    (b) Aesthetics;
    (c) Effects on historic districts, sites, buildings, monuments, 
structures, or other objects pursuant to the National Historic 
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and implementing regulations;
    (d) Protection of natural and cultural resources (e.g., National 
Parks and Wilderness areas, National Wildlife Refuge systems);
    (e) Compliance with the appropriate level of review and 
documentation as necessary under the National Environmental Policy Act 
of 1969, as amended, and implementing regulations of each Federal 
department and agency responsible for the antenna siting project, and 
the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Telecommunications and 
Information Administration, and other relevant departments and agencies;
    (f) Compliance with the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) 
guidelines for radiofrequency exposure, ET Docket No. 93-62, entitled 
``Guidelines for Evaluating the Environmental Effects of Radiofrequency 
Radiation,'' issued August 1, 1996, and any other order on 
reconsideration relating to radiofrequency guidelines and their 
enforcement. These are updated guidelines for meeting health concerns 
that reflect the latest scientific knowledge

[[Page 292]]

in this area, and are supported by Federal health and safety agencies 
such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug 
Administration; and
    (g) Any requirements of the Federal agency managing the facility, 
FCC, Federal Aviation Administration, National Telecommunications and 
Information Administration, and other relevant departments and agencies. 
To the maximum extent practicable, when placing antennas for the 
provision of telecommunication services to the Federal Government, 
agencies should use redundant and physically separate entry points into 
the building and physically diverse local network facilities in 
accordance with guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget. 
In addition, the National Capital Planning Commission should be 
consulted for siting requests within the Washington, D.C. metropolitan 
area.


<R05>
Sec. 102-79.95  Who is responsible for the costs associated with 

providing access to antenna sites?

    The telecommunications service provider is responsible for any 
reasonable costs to Federal agencies associated with providing access to 
antenna sites, including obtaining appropriate clearance of provider 
personnel for access to buildings or land deemed to be security 
sensitive as is done with service contractor personnel. OMB Circular A-
25, entitled ``User Charges,'' revised July 8, 1993, provides guidelines 
that agencies should use to assess fees for Government services and for 
the sale or use of Government property or resources. For antenna sites 
on non-GSA property, see also the Department of Commerce Report on 
``Improving Rights-of-Way Management Across Federal Lands: A Roadmap for 
Greater Broadband Deployment'' (April 2004) beginning at page 26. Under 
40 U.S.C. 1314, GSA is covered in granting easements and permits to 
support the installation of antennas and cabling across raw land in 
support of constructing new and improving existing telecommunication 
infrastructures provided that such installation does not negatively 
impact on the Government.


<R05>
Sec. 102-79.100  What must Federal agencies do with antenna siting 

fees that they collect?

    The account into which an antenna siting fee is to be deposited 
depends on the authority under which the antenna site is made available 
and the fee assessed. For GSA-controlled property outleased under 40 
U.S.C. 581(h) or section 412 of Division H of public law 108-447, the 
fee is to be deposited into GSA's Federal Building Fund. For surplus 
property outleased under 40 U.S.C. 543, the fee is to be deposited in 
accordance with the provisions of Subchapter IV of Chapter 5 of Subtitle 
I of Title 40 of the United States Code. For siting fees collected under 
other statutory authorities, the fees might be deposited into 
miscellaneous receipts, an account of the landholding agency, or as 
otherwise provided by law. Federal agencies should consult with their 
agency's legal advisors before depositing antenna proceed from sites on 
agency-controlled Federal property.

                          Integrated Workplace


<R05>
Sec. 102-79.105  What is the Integrated Workplace?

    The Integrated Workplace, developed by the GSA Office of 
Governmentwide Policy, is a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to 
developing workspace and work strategies that best support an 
organization's strategic business goals and work processes, and have the 
flexibility to accommodate the changing needs of the occupants and the 
organization. Integrated Workplace concepts support the objectives of 
Executive Order 13327, ``Federal Real Property Asset Management,'' which 
calls for the enhancement of Federal agency productivity through an 
improved working environment.


<R05>
Sec. 102-79.110  What Integrated Workplace policy must Federal

agencies strive to promote?

    Federal agencies must strive to design work places that--
    (a) Are developed using sustainable development concepts (see Sec. 
102-76.55);
    (b) Align with the organization's mission and strategic plan;
    (c) Serve the needs and work practices of the occupants;

[[Page 293]]

    (d) Can be quickly and inexpensively adjusted by the user to 
maximize his or her productivity and satisfaction;
    (e) Are comfortable, efficient, and technologically advanced and 
allow people to accomplish their work in the most efficient way;
    (f) Meet the office's needs and can justify its cost through the 
benefits gained;
    (g) Are developed with an integrated building systems approach;
    (h) Are based on a life cycle cost analysis that considers both 
facility and human capital costs over a substantial time period; and
    (i) Support alternative workplace arrangements, including 
telecommuting, hoteling, virtual offices, and other distributive work 
arrangements (see Part 102-74, Subpart F--Telework).


<R05>
Sec. 102-79.111  Where may Executive agencies find additional 

information on Integrated Workplace concepts?

    The GSA Office of Governmentwide Policy provides additional guidance 
in its publication entitled ``Innovative Workplace Strategies.''

                  Public Access Defibrillation Programs


<R05>
Sec. 102-79.115  What guidelines must an agency follow if it elects

to establish a public access defibrillation program in a Federal 
facility?

    Federal agencies electing to establish a public access 
defibrillation program in a Federal facility must follow the guidelines, 
entitled ``Guidelines for Public Access Defibrillation Programs in 
Federal Facilities,'' which can be obtained from the Office of 
Governmentwide Policy, Office of Real Property (MP), General Services 
Administration, 1800 F Street, NW, Washington, DC 20405.

                   Assessment of Environmental Issues


<R05>
Sec. 102-80.75  Who assesses environmental issues in Federal 

construction and lease construction projects?

    Federal agencies must assess required environmental issues 
throughout planning and project development so that the environmental 
impacts of a project are considered during the decision making process.


<R04>
                 Subpart C_Accident and Fire Prevention


<R05>
Sec. 102-80.80  With what general accident and fire prevention 

policy must Federal agencies comply?

    Federal agencies must--
    (a) Comply with the occupational safety and health standards 
established in the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (Pub. L. 
91-596); Executive Order 12196; 29 CFR part 1960; and applicable safety 
and environmental management criteria identified in this part;
    (b) Not expose occupants and visitors to unnecessary risks;
    (c) Provide safeguards that minimize personal harm, property damage, 
and impairment of Governmental operations, and that allow emergency 
forces to accomplish their missions effectively;
    (d) Follow accepted fire prevention practices in operating and 
managing buildings;
    (e) To the maximum extent feasible, comply with one of the 
nationally recognized model building codes and with other nationally-
recognized codes in their construction or alteration of each building in 
accordance with 40 U.S.C. 3312; and
    (f) Use the applicable national codes and standards as a guide for 
their building operations.

                          State and Local Codes


<R05>
Sec. 102-80.85  Are Federally owned and leased buildings exempt from

State and local code requirements in fire protection?

    Federally owned buildings are generally exempt from State and local 
code requirements in fire protection; however, in accordance with 40 
U.S.C. 3312, each building constructed or altered by a Federal agency 
must be constructed or altered, to the maximum extent feasible, in 
compliance with one of the nationally recognized model building codes 
and with other nationally recognized codes. Leased buildings are subject 
to local code requirements and inspection.

              Fire Administration Authorization Act of 1992


<R05>
Sec. 102-80.90  Is the Fire Administration Authorization Act of 

1992 (Public Law 102-522) relevant to fire protection engineering?

    Yes, the Fire Administration Authorization Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-
522) requires sprinklers or an equivalent level of safety in certain 
types of Federal employee office buildings, Federal employee housing 
units, and Federally assisted housing units (15 U.S.C. 2227).


<R05>
Sec. 102-80.95  Is the Fire Administration Authorization Act of 

1992 applicable to all Federal agencies?

    Yes, the Fire Administration Authorization Act applies to all 
Federal agencies and all Federally owned and leased buildings in the 
United States.

                       Automatic Sprinkler Systems


<R05>
Sec. 102-80.100  What performance objective should an automatic

sprinkler system be capable of meeting?

    The performance objective of the automatic sprinkler system is that 
it must be capable of protecting human lives. Sprinklers should be 
capable of controlling the spread of fire and its effects beyond the 
room of origin. A functioning sprinkler system should activate prior to 
the onset of flashover.

                   Equivalent Level of Safety Analysis


<R05>
Sec. 102-80.105  What information must be included in an equivalent 

level of safety analysis?

    The equivalent level of life safety evaluation is to be performed by 
a qualified fire protection engineer. The analysis should include a 
narrative discussion of the features of the building structure, 
function, operational support systems and occupant activities

[[Page 298]]

that impact fire protection and life safety. Each analysis should 
describe potential reasonable worst case fire scenarios and their impact 
on the building occupants and structure. Specific issues that must be 
addressed include rate of fire growth, type and location of fuel items, 
space layout, building construction, openings and ventilation, 
suppression capability, detection time, occupant notification, occupant 
reaction time, occupant mobility, and means of egress.


<R05>
Sec. 102-80.110  What must an equivalent level of safety analysis 

indicate?

    To be acceptable, the analysis must indicate that the existing and/
or proposed safety systems in the building provide a period of time 
equal to or greater than the amount of time available for escape in a 
similar building complying with the Fire Administration Authorization 
Act. In conducting these analyses, the capability, adequacy, and 
reliability of all building systems impacting fire growth, occupant 
knowledge of the fire, and time required to reach a safety area will 
have to be examined. In particular, the impact of sprinklers on the 
development of hazardous conditions in the area of interest will have to 
be assessed.


<R05>
Sec. 102-80.115  Is there more than one option for establishing that

an equivalent level of safety exists?

    Yes, the following are three options for establishing that an 
equivalent level of safety exists:
    (a) In the first option, the margin of safety provided by various 
alternatives is compared to that obtained for a code complying building 
with complete sprinkler protection. The margin of safety is the 
difference between the available safe egress time and the required safe 
egress time. Available safe egress time is the time available for 
evacuation of occupants to an area of safety prior to the onset of 
untenable conditions in occupied areas or the egress pathways. The 
required safe egress time is the time required by occupants to move from 
their positions at the start of the fire to areas of safety. Available 
safe egress times would be developed based on analysis of a number of 
assumed reasonable worst case fire scenarios including assessment of a 
code complying fully sprinklered building. Additional analysis would be 
used to determine the expected required safe egress times for the 
various scenarios. If the margin of safety plus an appropriate safety 
factor is greater for an alternative than for the fully sprinklered 
building, then the alternative should provide an equivalent level of 
safety.
    (b) A second alternative is applicable for typical office and 
residential scenarios. In these situations, complete sprinkler 
protection can be expected to prevent flashover in the room of fire 
origin, limit fire size to no more than 1 megawatt (950 Btu/sec), and 
prevent flames from leaving the room of origin. The times required for 
each of these conditions to occur in the area of interest must be 
determined. The shortest of these three times would become the time 
available for escape. The difference between the minimum time available 
for escape and the time required for evacuation of building occupants 
would be the target margin of safety. Various alternative protection 
strategies would have to be evaluated to determine their impact on the 
times at which hazardous conditions developed in the spaces of interest 
and the times required for egress. If a combination of fire protection 
systems provides a margin of safety equal to or greater than the target 
margin of safety, then the combination could be judged to provide an 
equivalent level of safety.
    (c) As a third option, other technical analysis procedures, as 
approved by the responsible agency head, can be used to show 
equivalency.


<R05>
Sec. 102-80.120  What analytical and empirical tools should be 

used to support the life safety equivalency evaluation?

    Analytical and empirical tools, including fire models and grading 
schedules such as the Fire Safety Evaluation System (Alternative 
Approaches to Life Safety, NEPA 101A) should be used to support the life 
safety equivalency evaluation. If fire modeling is used as part of an 
analysis, an assessment of the predictive capabilities of the fire

[[Page 299]]

models must be included. This assessment should be conducted in 
accordance with the American Society for Testing and Materials Standard 
Guide for Evaluating the Predictive Capability of Fire Models (ASTM E 
1355).


<R05>
Sec. 102-80.125  Who has the responsibility for determining the

acceptability of each equivalent level of safety analysis?

    The head of the agency responsible for physical improvements in the 
facility or providing Federal assistance or a designated representative 
will determine the acceptability of each equivalent level of safety 
analysis. The determination of acceptability must include a review of 
the fire protection engineer's qualifications, the appropriateness of 
the fire scenarios for the facility, and the reasonableness of the 
assumed maximum probable loss. Agencies should maintain a record of each 
accepted equivalent level of safety analysis and provide copies to fire 
departments or other local authorities for use in developing pre-fire 
plans.


<R05>
Sec. 102-80.130  Who must perform the equivalent level of safety 

analysis?

    A qualified fire protection engineer must perform the equivalent 
level of safety analysis.


<R05>
Sec. 102-80.135  Who is a qualified fire protection engineer?

    A qualified fire protection engineer is defined as an individual 
with a thorough knowledge and understanding of the principles of physics 
and chemistry governing fire growth, spread, and suppression, meeting 
one of the following criteria:
    (a) An engineer having an undergraduate or graduate degree from a 
college or university offering a course of study in fire protection or 
fire safety engineering, plus a minimum of 4 years work experience in 
fire protection engineering.
    (b) A professional engineer (P.E. or similar designation) registered 
in Fire Protection Engineering.
    (c) A professional engineer (P.E. or similar designation) registered 
in a related engineering discipline and holding Member grade status in 
the International Society of Fire Protection Engineers.

                             Room of Origin


<R05>
Sec. 102-80.140  What is meant by ``room of origin''?

    Room of origin means an area of a building where a fire can be 
expected to start. Typically, the size of the area will be determined by 
the walls, floor, and ceiling surrounding the space. However, this could 
lead to unacceptably large areas in the case of open plan office space 
or similar arrangements. Therefore, the maximum allowable fire area 
should be limited to 200 m2 (2000 ft2), including intervening spaces. In 
the case of residential units, an entire apartment occupied by one 
tenant could be considered as the room of origin to the extent it did 
not exceed the 200 m2 (2000 ft2) limitation.

                                Flashover


<R05>
Sec. 102-80.145  What is meant by ``flashover''?

    Flashover means fire conditions in a confined area where the upper 
gas layer temperature reaches 600 [deg]C (1100 [deg]F) and the heat flux 
at floor level exceeds 20 kW/m2 (1.8 Btu/ft2/sec).

                   Reasonable Worst Case Fire Scenario


<R05>
Sec. 102-80.150  What is meant by ``reasonable worst case fire

scenario''?

    Reasonable worst case fire scenario means a combination of an 
ignition source, fuel items, and a building location likely to produce a 
fire that would have a significant adverse impact on the building and 
its occupants. The development of reasonable worst case scenarios must 
include consideration of types and forms of fuels present (e.g., 
furniture, trash, paper, chemicals), potential fire ignition locations 
(e.g., bedroom, office, closet, corridor), occupant capabilities (e.g., 
awake, intoxicated, mentally or physically impaired), numbers of 
occupants, detection and suppression system adequacy and reliability, 
and fire department capabilities. A quantitative analysis of the 
probability of occurrence of each scenario and combination of events 
will be necessary.

<R04>
                           Subpart B_Security


<R05>
Sec. 102-81.15  Who is responsible for upgrading and maintaining 

security standards in each existing Federally owned and leased
facility?

    In a June 28, 1995, Presidential Policy Memorandum for Executive 
Departments and Agencies, entitled ``Upgrading Security at Federal 
Facilities'' (see the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents, vol. 
31, p. 1148), the President directed that Executive agencies must, where 
feasible, upgrade and maintain security in facilities they own or lease 
under their own authority to the minimum standards specified in the 
Department of Justice's June 28, 1995, study entitled ``Vulnerability 
Assessment of Federal Facilities.'' The study may be obtained by writing 
to the Superintendent of Documents, P.O. Box 371954, Pittsburgh, PA 
15250-7954.


<R05>
Sec. 102-81.20  Are the security standards for new Federally owned and

leased facilities the same as the standards for existing Federally owned
and leased 
          facilities?

    No, the minimum standards specified in the Department of Justice's 
June 28, 1995, study entitled ``Vulnerability Assessment of Federal 
Facilities'' identifies the minimum-security standards that agencies 
must adhere to for all existing owned and leased Federal facilities. As 
specified in Sec. 102-81.25, new Federally owned and leased facilities 
must be designed to meet the standards identified in the document 
entitled ``Interagency Security Committee Security Design Criteria for 
New Federal Office Buildings and Major Modernization Projects,'' dated 
May 28, 2001. The security design criteria for new facilities takes into 
consideration technology developments, new cost consideration, the 
experience of practitioners applying the criteria, and the need to 
balance security requirements with public building environments that 
remain lively, open, and accessible.


<R05>
Sec. 102-81.25  Do the Interagency Security Committee Security

Design Criteria apply to all new Federally owned and leased 
facilities?

    No, the Interagency Security Committee Security Design Criteria--
    (a) Apply to new construction of general purpose office buildings 
and new or lease-construction of courthouses occupied by Federal 
employees in the United States and not under the jurisdiction and/or 
control of the Department of Defense. The criteria also apply to lease-
construction projects

[[Page 301]]

being submitted to Congress for appropriations or authorization. Where 
prudent and appropriate, the criteria apply to major modernization 
projects; and
    (b) Do not apply to airports, prisons, hospitals, clinics, and ports 
of entry, or to unique facilities such as those classified by the 
Department of Justice Vulnerability Assessment Study as Level V. Nor 
will the criteria overrule existing Federal laws and statutes, and other 
agency standards that have been developed for special facilities, such 
as border stations and child care centers.


<R05>
Sec. 102-81.30  What information must job applicants at child care

centers reveal?

    Anyone who applies for employment (including volunteer positions) at 
a child care facility, located on Federally controlled property 
(including Federally leased property), must reveal any arrests and 
convictions on the job application. Employment at a child care facility 
means any position that involves work with minor children, such as a 
teacher, daycare worker, or school administrator.

<R05>
Sec. 102-82.15  What utility services must Executive agencies provide?

    Executive agencies must negotiate with public utilities to procure 
utility services and, where appropriate, provide rate intervention 
services in proceedings (see Sec. Sec. 102-72.100 and 102-72.105 of 
this chapter) before Federal and State utility regulatory bodies.


<R05>
Sec. 102-82.20  What are Executive agencies' rate intervention

responsibilities?

    Where the consumer interests of the Federal Government will be 
significantly affected and upon receiving a delegation of authority from 
GSA, Executive agencies must provide representation in proceedings 
involving utility services before Federal and State regulatory bodies. 
Specifically, these responsibilities include instituting formal or 
informal action before Federal and State regulatory bodies to contest 
the level, structure, or applicability of rates or service terms of 
utility suppliers. The Secretary of Defense is independently authorized 
to take such actions without a delegation from GSA, when the Secretary 
determines such actions to be in the best interests of national 
security.


<R05>
Sec. 102-82.25  What are Executive agencies' responsibilities 

concerning the procurement of utility services?

    Executive agencies, operating under a utility services delegation 
from GSA, or the Secretary of Defense, when the Secretary determines it 
to be in the best interests of national security, must provide for the 
procurement of utility services (such as commodities

[[Page 302]]

and utility rebate programs), as required, and must procure from sources 
of supply that are the most advantageous to the Federal Government in 
terms of economy, efficiency, reliability, or quality of service. 
Executive agencies, upon receiving a delegation of authority from GSA, 
may enter into contracts for utility services for periods not exceeding 
ten years (40 U.S.C. 501(b)(1)(B)).

amended (41 U.S.C. 253(a)), Executive agencies must consider whether 
restricting the delineated area for obtaining leased space to the 
central business area (CBA) will provide for adequate competition when 
acquiring leased space. Where an Executive agency determines that the 
delineated area must be expanded beyond the CBA to provide adequate 
competition, the agency may expand the delineated area in consultation 
with local officials. Executive agencies must continue to include the 
CBA in such expanded areas.


<R05>
Sec. 102-83.40  Who must approve the final delineated area?

    Federal agencies conducting the procurement must approve the final 
delineated area for site acquisitions and lease actions and must confirm 
that the final delineated area complies with the requirements of all 
applicable laws, regulations, and Executive Orders.


<R05>
Sec. 102-83.45  Where may Executive agencies find guidance on 

appealing GSA's decisions and recommendations concerning 
delineated areas?

    GSA's PBS provides guidance in its Customer Guide to Real Property 
on the process for appealing GSA's decisions and recommendations 
concerning delineated areas.

program requirements call for locations in an urban area. First priority 
to the location of new offices and other facilities in rural areas must 
be given in accordance with the hierarchy specified in Sec. 102-79.55 
of this chapter.

                               Urban Areas


<R05>
Sec. 102-83.70  What is Executive Order 12072?

    Executive Order 12072, entitled ``Federal Space Management,'' 
requires all Executive agencies that have a mission requirement to 
locate in an urban area to give first consideration to locating Federal 
facilities in central business areas, and/or adjacent areas of similar 
character, to use them to make downtowns attractive places to work, 
conserve existing resources, and encourage redevelopment. It also 
directs Executive agencies to consider opportunities for locating 
cultural, educational, recreational, or commercial activities within the 
proposed facility.


<R05>
Sec. 102-83.75  What is Executive Order 13006?

    Executive Order 13006, entitled ``Locating Federal Facilities on 
Historic Properties in Our Nation's Central Cities,'' requires all 
Executive agencies that have a mission requirement to locate in an urban 
area to give first consideration to locating Federal facilities in 
historic buildings and districts within central business areas. It also 
directs Executive agencies to remove regulatory barriers, review their 
policies, and build new partnerships with the goal of enhancing 
participation in the National Historic Preservation program.


<R05>
Sec. 102-83.80  What is an urban area?

    Urban area means any metropolitan area (MA) as defined by the Office 
of Management and Budget (OMB) in OMB Bulletin No. 99-04, or succeeding 
OMB Bulletin, that does not meet the definition of rural area in Sec. 
102-83.55.


<R05>
Sec. 102-83.85  What is a central business area?

    Central business area (CBA) means the centralized community business 
area and adjacent areas of similar character, including other specific 
areas that may be recommended by local officials in accordance with 
Executive Order 12072. The CBAs are designated by local government and 
not by Federal agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 102-83.90  Do Executive Orders 12072 and 13006 apply to rural areas?

    No, Executive Orders 12072 and 13006 only apply to agencies looking 
for space in urban areas.


<R05>
Sec. 102-83.95  After an agency has identified that its geographic 

service area and delineated area are in an urban area, what is 
the next step for an agency?

    After an agency identifies its geographic service area and 
delineated area within which it wishes to locate specific activities are 
in an urban area (i.e., determined that the agency's mission 
requirements dictate a need to locate its facility in an urban area), 
Federal agencies must seek space in historic properties already under 
agency control, in accordance with section 110 of the National Historic 
Preservation Act. The National Historic Preservation Act provides that 
prior to purchasing, constructing or leasing new space, Federal agencies 
must--
    (a) Consider agency-controlled historic properties within historic 
districts inside CBAs when locating Federal operations, in accordance 
with Executive Order 13006 (which, by reference, also incorporates the 
requirements in Executive Order 12072 and the Rural Development Act of 
1972);
    (b) Then consider agency-controlled developed or undeveloped sites 
within historic districts, if no suitable agency-controlled historic 
property specified

[[Page 305]]

in paragraph (a) of this section is available;
    (c) Then consider agency-controlled historic properties outside of 
historic districts, if no suitable agency-controlled site exists within 
a historic district as specified in paragraph (b) of this section;
    (d) Then consider non-historic agency-controlled properties, if no 
suitable agency-controlled historic properties outside of historic 
districts exist as specified in paragraph (c) of this section;
    (e) Then consider historic properties under the custody and control 
of the U.S. Postal Service, if there is no available space in non-
historic agency-controlled properties specified in paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (f) Then consider non-historic properties under the custody and 
control of the U.S. Postal Service, if there is no available space in 
historic properties under the custody and control of the U.S. Postal 
Service specified in paragraph (e) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 102-83.100  Why must agencies consider available space in 

properties under the custody and control of the U.S. Postal 
ervice?

    See Sec. 102-73.20 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 102-83.105  What happens if there is no available space

in non-historic buildings under the custody and control of 
the U.S. Postal Service?

    If no suitable space in non-historic buildings under the custody and 
control of the U.S. Postal Service is available, agencies may then 
acquire real estate by purchase, lease, or construction, in accordance 
with FMR part 102-73.


<R05>
Sec. 102-83.110  When an agency's mission and program requirements 

call for the location in an urban area, are Executive agencies 
required to give first 
          consideration to central business areas?

    Yes, if an agency has a specific location need to be in an urban 
area, then Executive Orders 12072 and 13006 require that agencies should 
give first consideration to locating in a historic building in a 
historic district in the CBA of a central city of the appropriate 
metropolitan area. If no such space is available, agencies must give 
consideration to locating in a non-historic building in a historic 
district in the CBA of a central city of the appropriate metropolitan 
area. If no such space is available, agencies must give consideration to 
locating in a historic building outside of a historic district in the 
CBA of a central city of the appropriate metropolitan area. If no such 
space is available, agencies should give consideration to locating in a 
non-historic building outside of a historic district in the CBA of a 
central city of the appropriate metropolitan area.


<R05>
Sec. 102-83.115  What is a central city?

    Central cities are those central cities defined by OMB in OMB 
Bulletin No. 99-04, or succeeding OMB Bulletin.


<R05>
Sec. 102-83.120  What happens if an agency has a need to be in a

specific urban area that is not a central city in a metropolitan
area?

    If an agency has a need to be in a specific urban area that is not a 
central city in a metropolitan area, then the agency must give first 
consideration to locating in a historic building in a historic district 
in the CBA of the appropriate metropolitan area. If no such space is 
available, agencies must give consideration to locating in a non-
historic building in a historic district in the CBA of the appropriate 
metropolitan area. If no such space is available, agencies must give 
consideration to locating in a historic building outside of a historic 
district in the CBA of the appropriate metropolitan area. If no such 
space is available, agencies should give consideration to locating in a 
non-historic building outside of a historic district in the CBA of the 
appropriate metropolitan area.

                    Preference to Historic Properties


<R05>
Sec. 102-83.125  Are Executive agencies required to give preference

to historic properties when acquiring leased space?

    Yes, Federal agencies must give a price preference when acquiring 
space using either the lowest price technically acceptable or the best 
value tradeoff source selection process. See part 102-73 of this chapter 
for additional guidance.

[[Page 306]]

               Application of Socioeconomic Considerations


<R05>
Sec. 102-83.130  When must agencies consider the impact of 

location decisions on low- and moderate-income employees?

    Federal agencies proposing locations for Federal construction or 
major lease actions involving the relocation of a major work force must 
consider the impact on employees with low and moderate incomes.


<R05>
Sec. 102-83.135  With whom must agencies consult in determining

the availability of low- and moderate-income housing?

    Federal agencies must consult with the U.S. Department of Housing 
and Urban Development (HUD) in accordance with the Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) between HUD and GSA. The text of the HUD-GSA MOU is 
located in the Appendix to this part.

    APPENDIX to Part 102-83--Memorandum of Understanding Between the 
  Department of Housing and Urban Development and the General Services 
       Administration Concerning Low- and Moderate-Income Housing

    Purpose. The purpose of the memorandum of understanding is to 
provide an effective, systematic arrangement under which the Federal 
Government, acting through HUD and GSA, will fulfill its 
responsibilities under law, and as a major employer, in accordance with 
the concepts of good management, to assure for its employees the 
availability of low- and moderate-income housing without discrimination 
because of race, color, religion, or national origin, and to consider 
the need for development and redevelopment of areas and the development 
of new communities and the impact on improving social and economic 
conditions in the area, whenever Federal Government facilities locate or 
relocate at new sites, and to use its resources and authority to aid in 
the achievement of these objectives.
    1. Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3601) 
states, in section 801, that ``It is the policy of the United States to 
provide, within constitutional limitations, for fair housing throughout 
the United States.'' Section 808(a) places the authority and 
responsibility for administering the Act in the Secretary of Housing and 
Urban Development. Section 808(d) requires all Executive departments and 
agencies to administer their programs and activities relating to housing 
and urban development in a manner affirmatively to further the purposes 
of title VIII (fair housing) and to cooperate with the Secretary to 
further such purposes. Section 808(e)(5) provides that the Secretary of 
HUD shall administer the programs and activities relating to housing and 
urban development in a manner affirmatively to further the policies of 
title VIII.
    2. Section 2 of the Housing Act of 1949 (42 U.S.C. 1441) declares 
the national policy of ``* * * the realization as soon as feasible of 
the goal of a decent home and a suitable living environment for every 
American family * * *.'' This goal was reaffirmed in the Housing and 
Urban Development Act of 1968 (sections 2 and 1601; 12 U.S.C. 1701t and 
42 U.S.C. 1441a).
    3. By virtue of the Public Buildings Act of 1959, as amended; the 
Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended; 
and Reorganization Plan No. 18 of 1950, the Administrator of General 
Services is given certain authority and responsibility in connection 
with planning, developing, and constructing Government-owned public 
buildings for housing Federal agencies, and for acquiring leased space 
for Federal agency use.
    4. Executive Order 11512, February 27, 1970, sets forth the policies 
by which the Administrator of General Services and the heads of 
Executive agencies will be guided in the acquisition of both federally 
owned and leased office buildings and space.
    5. While Executive Order No. 11512 provides that material 
consideration will be given to the efficient performance of the missions 
and programs of the Executive agencies and the nature and functions of 
the facilities involved, there are six other guidelines set forth, 
including:
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> The need for development and redevelopment of 
areas and the development of new communities, and the impact a selection 
will have on improving social and economic conditions in the area; and
    <bullet<ls-thn-eq> The availability of adequate low- and moderate-
income housing, adequate access from other areas of the urban center, 
and adequacy of parking.
    6. General Services Administration (GSA) recognizes its 
responsibility, in all its determinations with respect to the 
construction of Federal buildings and the acquisition of leased space, 
to consider to the maximum possible extent the availability of low- and 
moderate-income housing without discrimination because of race, color, 
religion, or national origin, in accordance with its duty affirmatively 
to further the purposes of title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 
and with the authorities referred to in paragraph 2 above, and the 
guidelines referred to in paragraph 5 above, and consistent with the 
authorities cited in paragraphs 3 and 4 above. In connection with the 
foregoing statement,

[[Page 307]]

it is recognized that all the guidelines must be considered in each 
case, with the ultimate decision to be made by the Administrator of 
General Services upon his determination that such decision will improve 
the management and administration of governmental activities and 
services, and will foster the programs and policies of the Federal 
Government.
    7. In addition to its fair housing responsibilities, the 
responsibilities of HUD include assisting in the development of the 
Nation's housing supply through programs of mortgage insurance, home 
ownership and rental housing assistance, rent supplements, below market 
interest rates, and low-rent public housing. Additional HUD program 
responsibilities which relate or impinge upon housing and community 
development include comprehensive planning assistance, metropolitan area 
planning coordination, new communities, relocation, urban renewal, model 
cities, rehabilitation loans and grants, neighborhood facilities grants, 
water and sewer grants, open space, public facilities loans, Operation 
BREAKTHROUGH, code enforcement, workable programs, and others.
    8. In view of its responsibilities described in paragraphs 1 and 7 
above, HUD possesses the necessary expertise to investigate, determine, 
and report to GSA on the availability of low- and moderate-income 
housing on a nondiscriminatory basis and to make findings as to such 
availability with respect to proposed locations for a federally-
constructed building or leased space which would be consistent with such 
reports. HUD also possesses the necessary expertise to advise GSA and 
other Federal agencies with respect to actions which would increase the 
availability of low- and moderate-income housing on a nondiscriminatory 
basis, once a site has been selected for a federally-constructed 
building or a lease executed for space, as well as to assist in 
increasing the availability of such housing through its own programs 
such as those described in paragraph 7 above.
    9. HUD and GSA agree that:
    (a) GSA will pursue the achievement of low- and moderate-income 
housing objectives and fair housing objectives, in accordance with its 
responsibilities recognized in paragraph 6 above, in all determinations, 
tentative and final, with respect to the location of both federally 
constructed buildings and leased buildings and space, and will make all 
reasonable efforts to make this policy known to all persons, 
organizations, agencies and others concerned with federally owned and 
leased buildings and space in a manner which will aid in achieving such 
objectives.
    (b) In view of the importance to the achievement of the objectives 
of this memorandum of agreement of the initial selection of a city or 
delineation of a general area for location of public buildings or leased 
space, GSA will provide the earliest possible notice to HUD of 
information with respect to such decisions so that HUD can carry out its 
responsibilities under this memorandum of agreement as effectively as 
possible.
    (c) Government-owned Public Buildings Projects. (1) In the planning 
for each new public buildings project under the Public Buildings Act of 
1959, during the survey preliminary to the preparation and submission of 
a project development report, representatives of the regional office of 
GSA in which the project is proposed will consult with, and receive 
advice from, the regional office of HUD, and local planning and housing 
authorities concerning the present and planned availability of low- and 
moderate-income housing on a nondiscriminatory basis in the area where 
the project is to be located. Such advice will constitute the principal 
basis for GSA's consideration of the availability of such housing in 
accordance with paragraphs 6 and 9(a). A copy of the prospectus for each 
project which is authorized by the Committees on Public Works of the 
Congress in accordance with the requirements of section 7(a) of the 
Public Buildings Act of 1959, will be provided to HUD.
    (2) When a site investigation for an authorized public buildings 
project is conducted by regional representatives of GSA to identify a 
site on which the public building will be constructed, a representative 
from the regional office of HUD will participate in the site 
investigation for the purposes of providing a report on the availability 
of low- and moderate-income housing on a nondiscriminatory basis in the 
area of the investigation. Such report will constitute the principal 
basis for GSA's consideration of the availability of such housing in 
accordance with paragraphs 6 and 9(a).
    (d) Major lease actions having a significant socioeconomic impact on 
a community: At the time GSA and the agencies who will occupy the space 
have tentatively delineated the general area in which the leased space 
must be located in order that the agencies may effectively perform their 
missions and programs, the regional representative of HUD will be 
consulted by the regional representative of GSA who is responsible for 
the leasing action to obtain advice from HUD concerning the availability 
of low- and moderate-income housing on a nondiscriminatory basis to the 
delineated area. Such advice will constitute the principal basis for 
GSA's consideration of the availability of such housing in accordance 
with paragraphs 6 and 9(a). Copies of lease-construction prospectuses 
approved by the Committees on Public Works of the Congress in conformity 
with the provisions of the Independent Offices and Department of Housing 
and Urban Development appropriation acts, will be provided to HUD.

[[Page 308]]

    (e) GSA and HUD will each issue internal operating procedures to 
implement this memorandum of understanding within a reasonable time 
after its execution. These procedures shall recognize the right of HUD, 
in the event of a disagreement between HUD and GSA representatives at 
the area or regional level, to bring such disagreement to the attention 
of GSA officials at headquarters in sufficient time to assure full 
consideration of HUD's views, prior to the making of a determination by 
GSA.
    (f) In the event a decision is made by GSA as to the location of a 
federally constructed building or leased space, and HUD has made 
findings, expressed in the advice given or a report made to GSA, that 
the availability to such location of low- and moderate-income housing on 
a nondiscriminatory basis is inadequate, the GSA shall provide the DHUD 
with a written explanation why the location was selected.
    (g) Whenever the advice or report provided by HUD in accordance with 
paragraph 9(c)(1), 9(c)(2), or 9(d) with respect to an area or site 
indicates that the supply of low-and moderate-income housing on a 
nondiscriminatory basis is inadequate to meet the needs of the personnel 
of the agency involved, GSA and HUD will develop an affirmative action 
plan designed to insure that an adequate supply of such housing will be 
available before the building or space is to be occupied or within a 
period of 6 months thereafter. The plan should provide for commitments 
from the community involved to initiate and carry out all feasible 
efforts to obtain a sufficient quantity of low- and moderate-income 
housing available to the agency's personnel on a nondiscriminatory basis 
with adequate access to the location of the building or space. It should 
include commitments by the local officials having the authority to 
remove obstacles to the provision of such housing, when such obstacles 
exist, and to take effective steps to assure its provision. The plan 
should also set forth the steps proposed by the agency to develop and 
implement a counseling and referral service to seek out and assist its 
personnel to obtain such housing. As part of any plan during, as well as 
after its development, HUD agrees to give priority consideration to 
applications for assistance under its housing programs for the housing 
proposed to be provided in accordance with the plan.
    10. This memorandum will be reviewed at the end of one year, and 
modified to incorporate any provision necessary to improve its 
effectiveness in light of actual experience.

Sec. 102-84.5  What is the scope of this part?

    GSA's policies contained in this part apply to all Federal agencies. 
This part prescribes guidance that you must follow in preparing and 
submitting annual real property inventory information for real property 
owned by and leased to the United States. The detailed guidance 
implementing these policies is contained in separate customer guides 
issued by the GSA Office of Governmentwide Policy.


<R05>
Sec. 102-84.10  What is the purpose of the Annual Real Property 

Inventory Program?

    The purpose of the Annual Real Property Inventory program is to:
    (a) Maintain a centralized source of information on Federal real 
property holdings;
    (b) Track space utilization of reporting agencies;

[[Page 309]]

the press, trade associations, educational institutions, Federal, State 
and local government agencies, and the general public.


<R05>
Sec. 102-84.15  Why must I provide information for the Annual Real

Property Inventory?

    You must provide information for the Annual Real Property Inventory 
because:
    (a) The Senate Committee on Appropriations requests that the 
Government maintain an Annual Real Property Inventory.
    (b) Executive Order 12411, Government Work Space Management Reforms, 
dated March 29, 1983 (3 CFR, 1983 Comp., p. 155), requires that 
Executive agencies:
    (1) Produce and maintain a total inventory of work space and related 
furnishings and declare excess to the Administrator of General Services 
all such holdings that are not necessary to satisfy existing or known 
and verified planned programs; and
    (2) Establish information systems, implement inventory controls and 
conduct surveys, in accordance with procedures established by the 
Administrator of General Services, so that a governmentwide reporting 
system may be developed.


<R05>
Sec. 102-84.20  Where should I obtain information to be reported 

for the Annual Real Property Inventory?

    You should obtain data reported for the Annual Real Property 
Inventory from the most accurate real property and accounting records 
maintained by your agency, preferably the same accounting records used 
to support your agency's financial statements.


<R05>
Sec. 102-84.25  Is it necessary for my agency to designate an

official to serve as the point of contact for the real property 
inventories?

of contact for the Annual Real Property Inventories. We recommend that 
you designate the same point of contact for the Federally-owned and 
leased real property inventory, although separate points of contact are 
permitted. You must advise the General Services Administration, Office 
of Governmentwide Policy, Office of Real Property (MP), 1800 F Street, 
NW., Washington, DC 20405, in writing, of the name(s) of these 
representative(s) and any subsequent changes. Each agency's point of 
contact for the real property inventories can be found at http://
worldwide.gsa.gov.


<R05>
Sec. 102-84.30  Is it necessary for my agency to certify the 

accuracy of its real property inventory submission?

    Yes, your agency's highest ranking real property official must 
certify the accuracy of the real property information submitted to GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 102-84.35  Which agencies must submit a report for inclusion 

in the Annual Real Property Inventory?

    Each agency that carries real property on its financial statement as 
of September 30 each year has the responsibility for submitting the real 
property inventory information. Information provided in these reports 
related to asset values must be consistent with agency records used for 
financial reporting in accordance with standards issued by the Federal 
Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB). For purposes of this part, 
this requirement shall apply regardless of the method used to acquire 
the property or which agency is currently using or occupying the 
property.


<R05>
Sec. 102-84.40  What types of real property must I report for the 

Annual Real Property Inventory?

    You must report for the Annual Real Property Inventory all land, 
buildings, and other structures and facilities owned by the United 
States (including wholly-owned Federal Government corporations) 
throughout the world and all real property leased by the United States 
from private individuals, organizations, and municipal, county, State, 
and foreign governments. These reports must include all real property 
that a Federal agency carries on its financial statement and/or in 
documentation accompanying the financial statement, such as:

[[Page 310]]

    (a) Unreserved public domain lands;
    (b) Public domain lands reserved for national forests, national 
parks, military installations, or other purposes;
    (c) Real property acquired by purchase, construction, donation, 
eminent domain proceedings, or any other method;
    (d) Real property in which the Government has a long-term interest 
considered by the reporting agency as being equivalent to ownership. 
This would include land acquired by treaty or long-term lease (e.g., 99-
year lease), and that your agency considers equivalent to Federally-
owned land;
    (e) Buildings or other structures and facilities owned by or leased 
to the Government whether or not located on Government-owned land;
    (f) Excess and surplus real property;
    (g) Real property held in trust by the Federal Government;
    (h) Leased real property (including leased land, leased buildings, 
leased other structures and facilities, or combination thereof); and
    (i) Real property leased rent free or for a nominal rental rate if

    (19) Executive Order 13006 of May 21, 1996 (61 FR 26071).


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.10  What is the scope of this part?

    (a) This part describes GSA policy and principles for the assignment 
and occupancy of space under its control and the rights and obligations 
of GSA and the customer agencies that request or occupy such space 
pursuant to GSA Occupancy Agreements (OA).
    (b) Space managed by agencies under delegation of authority from GSA 
is subject to the provisions of this part.
    (c) This part is not applicable to:
    (1) Licenses, permits or leases with non-Federal entities under the 
Public Buildings Cooperative Use Act (40 U.S.C. 490(a)(16-19)); or
    (2) The disposal of surplus lease space under section 210(h)(2) of 
the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended 
(40 U.S.C. 490(h)(2)).


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.15  What are the basic policies for charging Rent for space 

and services?

    (a) GSA will charge for space and services furnished by GSA (unless 
otherwise exempted by the Administrator of General Services) a Rent 
charge which will approximate commercial charges for comparable space 
and services. Rent for all assignments for GSA-controlled space will be 
priced according to the principles of the pricing policy in this part. 
These principles are reflected in the following elements of GSA Rent 
charges:
    (1) ``Shell'' Rent based on approximate commercial charges for 
comparable space and services for Federally owned space (accomplished 
using appraisal procedures);
    (2) Rent based on actual cost of the lease, including the costs (if 
any) of services not provided by the lessor, plus a GSA fee;
    (3) Amortization of any tenant improvement allowance used;
    (4) Any applicable real estate taxes, operating costs, parking, 
security and joint use fees; and
    (5) For certain projects involving new construction or major 
renovation of Federally-owned buildings, a return on investment pricing 
approach if an appraisal-determined rental value does not provide a 
minimum return (OMB discount rate for calculating the present value of 
yearly costs plus 2%) on the cost of the prospective capital investment. 
Each specific use of Return on Investment (ROI) pricing must be approved 
by OMB and duly recorded in an Occupancy Agreement (OA) with the 
customer agency. Once the ROI methodology is employed to establish Rent 
for a capital investment, the ROI method must be retained for the 
duration of the OA term.
    (b) Special services not included in the standard levels of service 
may be provided by GSA on a reimbursable basis. GSA may also furnish 
alterations on a reimbursable basis in buildings where GSA is 
responsible for alterations only.
    (c) The financial terms and conditions under which GSA assigns, and 
a customer agency occupies, each block of GSA-controlled space, shall be 
documented in a written OA.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.20  What does an Occupancy Agreement (OA) do?

    An OA defines GSA's relationship with each customer agency and:
    (a) Establishes specific financial terms, provisions, rights, and 
obligations of GSA and its customer for each space assignment;
    (b) Minimizes exposure to future unknown costs for both GSA and 
customer agencies;
    (c) Stabilizes Rent payments to the extent reasonable and desired by 
customers; and
    (d) Allows tailoring of space and related services to meet customer 
agency needs.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.25  What is the basic principle governing OAs?

    The basic principle governing OAs is to adopt the private sector 
practice of capturing in a written document the business terms to which 
GSA and a

[[Page 313]]

customer agency agree concerning individual space assignments.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.30  Are there special rules for certain Federal customers?

    Yes, in lieu of OAs, GSA is able to enter into agreements with 
customer agencies that reflect the parties particular needs. For 
example, the space and services provided to the U.S. House of 
Representatives and the U.S. Senate are governed by existing memoranda 
of agreement (MOA). When there are conflicts between the provisions of 
this part and MOAs, the MOAs prevail.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.35  What definitions apply to this part?

    The following definitions apply to this part:
    Accept space or acceptance of space means a commitment from an 
agency to occupy specified GSA-controlled space.
    Agency-controlled and/or operated space means:
    (1) Space that is owned, leased, or otherwise controlled or operated 
by Federal agencies under any authority other than the Federal Property 
and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended; and
    (2) it also includes agency-acquired space for which acquisition 
authority has been delegated or otherwise granted to the agency by GSA. 
It does not include space covered by an OA.
    Assign or assignment is defined in the definition for space 
assignment.
    Building shell means the complete enveloping structure, the base-
building systems, and the finished common areas (building common and 
floor common) of a building that bound the tenant areas.
    Customer agency means any department, agency, or independent 
establishment in the Federal Government, including any wholly-owned 
corporation; any executive agency or any establishment in the 
legislative or judicial branch of the Government (except the Senate, the 
House of Representatives, and the Architect of the Capitol, and any 
activities under his direction).
    Emergency relocation is a customer move that results from an 
extraordinary event such as a fire, natural disaster, or immediate 
threat to the health and safety of occupants that renders a current 
space assignment unusable and requires that it be vacated, permanently 
or temporarily.
    Federal Buildings Fund means the fund into which Rent charges and 
other revenues are deposited, and collections cited in section 210(j) of 
the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended 
(U.S.C. 490(j)), and from which monies are available for expenditures 
for real property management and related activities in such amounts as 
are specified in annual appropriations acts without regard to fiscal 
year limitations.
    Federally controlled space means workspace for which the United 
States Government has a right of occupancy by ownership, by lease, or by 
any other means, such as by contract, barter, license, easement, permit, 
requisition, or condemnation. Such workspace excludes space owned or 
leased by private sector entities performing work on Government 
contracts.
    Federally owned space means space, the title to which is vested in 
the United States Government or which will vest automatically according 
to an existing agreement.
    Forced move means the involuntary physical relocation, from one 
space assignment to another, of a customer agency housed in GSA-
controlled space initiated by another customer agency or by GSA, before 
the expiration of a lease or an OA term. (See also the definition of 
GSA-initiated move.)
    General use space means all types of space other than ``warehouse,'' 
``parking,'' or ``unique'' space, as defined elsewhere in this part. 
Examples of general use space are:
    (1) Office and office-related space such as file areas, libraries, 
meeting rooms, computer rooms, mail rooms, training and conference, 
automated data processing operations, courtrooms, and judicial chambers; 
and
    (2) Storage space that contains different quality and finishes from 
general use space, but that is within a building where predominantly 
general use space is located.
    GSA-controlled space means Federally controlled space under the 
custody or control of GSA. It includes space for which GSA has delegated 
operational,

[[Page 314]]

maintenance, or protection authority to the customer agency.
    GSA-delegated space (or GSA delegated building) means GSA-controlled 
space for which GSA has delegated operational, maintenance or protection 
authority to the customer agency.
    GSA-initiated move means any relocation action in GSA-controlled 
space that:
    (1) Is involuntary to the customer agency and required to be 
effective prior to the expiration of an effective OA, or in the case of 
leased space, prior to the expiration of the lease; or
    (2) Is an emergency relocation initiated by GSA.
    Initial space alteration (ISA). See definition of ``tenant 
improvement.''
    Initial space layout means the specific placement of workstations, 
furniture and equipment within new space assignments.
    Inventory means a summary or itemized list of the real property, and 
associated descriptive information, that is under the control of a 
Federal agency.
    Joint-use space means common space within a Federally controlled 
facility, not specifically assigned to any one agency, and available for 
use by multiple agencies, such as cafeterias, auditoriums, conference 
rooms, credit unions, visitor parking spaces, snack bars, certain 
wellness/physical fitness facilities, and child care centers.
    Leased space means space for which the United States Government has 
a right of use and occupancy by virtue of having acquired a leasehold 
interest.
    Non-cancelable space means space that, due to its layout, design, 
location, or other characteristics, is unlikely to be needed by another 
GSA customer agency. Typical conditions that might cause space to be 
defined as non-cancelable are:
    (1) Special space construction features;
    (2) Lack of any realistic Federal need for the space other than by 
the requesting agency; and
    (3) Remote location or unusual term (short or long) desired by the 
agency.
    Occupancy Agreement (OA) means a written agreement descriptive of 
the financial terms and conditions under which GSA assigns, and a 
customer agency occupies, the GSA-controlled space identified therein.
    Parking or parking space means surface land, structures, or areas 
within structures designed and designated for the purpose of parking 
vehicles.
    Personnel means the peak number of persons to be housed during a 
single shift, regardless of how many workstations are provided for them. 
In addition to permanent employees of the agency, personnel includes 
temporaries, part-time, seasonal, and contractual employees, budgeted 
vacancies, and employees of other agencies and organizations who are 
housed in a space assignment.
    Portfolio leases mean long term or ``master'' leases, usually 
negotiated to house several agencies whose individual term requirements 
differ from the terms of the underlying GSA lease with the lessor, and 
from each other. These may also be leases housing single agencies, but 
which entail for GSA responsibilities (burdens and benefits) which mimic 
an ownership position, or equity rights, even though no equity interest 
or ownership liability exists. An example of the latter would be long 
term renewal options on a lease which, in order to enjoy, involve 
substantial capital outlays by GSA to improve the building 
infrastructure. In both these cases, GSA is assuming risks or capital 
expenditures outside of the conventions of single transactions or 
occupancies. Accordingly, for a portfolio lease, it is not appropriate 
merely to pass through to the customer agency(ies) the rental rate of 
the underlying GSA lease. Portfolio leases are treated for pricing 
purposes as owned space, with Rent set by appraisal.
    Predominant use means the use to which the greatest portion of a 
location is put. Predominant use is determined by the Public Buildings 
Service (PBS), GSA, and will typically result in the designation of a 
location as one of four types of space--General Use, Warehouse, Unique, 
or Parking--even though some smaller portions of the space may be used 
for one or more of the other types of uses.
    Rent means the amounts charged by GSA for space and related services 
to the customer agencies with tenancy in GSA-controlled space. The word

[[Page 315]]

``Rent'' is capitalized to differentiate it from the contract ``rent'' 
that GSA pays lessors.
    Rentable square footage means the amount of space as defined in 
``Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA)/American National 
Standards Institute (ANSI) Standard Z65.1-1996.'' The BOMA/ANSI standard 
also defines ``gross,'' ``office area,'' ``floor common,'' and 
``building common'' areas. Any references to these terms in this part 
refer to the BOMA/ANSI standard definitions. This standard has been 
adopted in accordance with GSA's interest in conforming its practices to 
nationally recognized industry standards to the extent possible.

    Note to the Definition of Rentable Square Footage: Rentable square 
footage generally includes square footage of areas occupied by customers 
plus a prorated share of floor common areas such as elevator lobbies, 
building corridors, public restrooms, utility closets, and machine 
rooms. Rentable square footage also includes a prorated share of 
building common areas located throughout the building. Examples of 
building common space include ground floor entrance lobby, enclosed 
atrium, loading dock, and mail room.

    Request for space or space request means a written or electronically 
submitted document or an oral request, within which an agency's space 
needs are summarized. A request for space is requisite for development 
of an OA. Thus, it must be submitted to GSA by a duly authorized 
official of the customer agency, and it must be accompanied by 
documentation of the customer agency's ability to fund payment of 
required Rent charges.
    Return on Investment (ROI) pricing is one possible methodology used 
to establish a Rent rate for certain owned space. Typically, ROI pricing 
is a Rent rate that ensures GSA a reasonable return on its cost to 
acquire and improve the asset. ROI pricing may be used where no other 
comparable commercial space is available or no other appraisal method 
would be appropriate. It may also be used in cases in which an 
appraisal-based rental rate will not meet GSA's minimum return 
requirements for the planned level of investment.
    Security fees mean Rent charges for building services provided by 
GSA's Federal Protective Service. Security fees are comprised of basic 
and building specific charges.
    (a) A basic security fee is assessed in all PBS-controlled 
properties where the Federal Protective Service (FPS) provides security 
services. The rate is set annually on a per-square-foot basis. The 
charge includes the following services:
    (1) General law enforcement on PBS-controlled property;
    (2) Physical security assessments;
    (3) Crime prevention and awareness training;
    (4) Advice and assistance to building security committees;
    (5) Intelligence sharing program;
    (6) Criminal investigation;
    (7) Assistance and coordination in Occupancy Emergency Plan 
development;
    (8) Coordination of mobilization and response to terrorist threat or 
civil disturbance;
    (9) Program administration for security guard contracts; and
    (10) Megacenter operations for monitoring building perimeter alarms 
and dispatching appropriate law enforcement response.
    (b) The building specific security charge is comprised of two 
elements: Operating expenses and amortized capital costs. Building 
specific charges, whether operating expenses or capital costs, are 
distributed overall federal users by building or facility in direct 
proportion to each customer agency's percentage of federal occupancy. As 
with joint use charges, the distribution of building-specific charges 
among customer agencies is not re-adjusted for vacancy.
    Space means a defined area within a building and/or parcel of land. 
(Personal property and furniture are not included.)
    Space allocation standard (SAS) means a standard agreed upon by GSA 
and a customer agency, written in terms that permit nationwide or 
regional application, that is used as a basis for establishing that 
agency's space requirements. An SAS may describe special GSA and 
customer agency funding responsibilities, although such responsibilities 
will be covered in OAs for space assignments. An SAS may also

[[Page 316]]

be developed between GSA and customer agencies on a regional level to 
standardize or simplify transactions, provided that the terms of a 
regional SAS are consistent with the terms of that agency's national SAS 
and the terms of this part.
    Space assignment or assignments means a transaction between GSA and 
a customer agency that results in a customer agency's right to occupy 
certain GSA-controlled space, usually in return for customer agency 
payment(s) to GSA for use of the space. Space assignment rights, 
obligations, and responsibilities not covered in this part, or in the 
customer guides, are formalized in an OA.
    Space planning means the process of using recognized professional 
techniques of planning, layout and interior design to determine the best 
internal location and the most efficient configuration for satisfying 
agency space needs.
    Space program of requirements means a summary statement of an 
agency's space needs. These requirements will generally include 
information about location, square footage, construction requirements, 
and duration of the agency's space need. They may be identified in any 
format mutually agreeable to GSA and the agency.
    Special space means space which has unusual architectural/
construction features, requires the installation of special equipment, 
or requires disproportionately high or low costs to construct, maintain 
and/or operate as compared to office or storage space. Special space 
generally refers to space which has construction features, finishes, 
services, utilities, or other additional costs beyond those specified in 
the customer general allowance (e.g., courtrooms, laboratories).
    Standard level of service. See Sec. 102-85.165 for the definition 
of standard level of service.
    Telecommunications means electronic processing of information, 
either voice or data or both, over a wide variety of media, (e.g., 
copper wire, microwave, fiber optics, radio frequencies), between 
individuals or offices within a building (e.g., local area networks), 
between buildings, and between cities.
    Tenant improvement (TI) means a finished component of an interior 
block of space. Tenant improvements represent additions to or 
alterations of the building shell that adapt the workspace to the 
specific uses of the customer. If made at initial occupancy, the TIs are 
known as initial space alterations or ISAs.
    Tenant improvement (TI) allowance means the dollar amount, including 
design, labor, materials, contractor costs (if contractors are used), 
management, and inspection, that GSA will spend to construct, alter, and 
finish space for customer occupancy (excluding personal property and 
furniture, which are customer agency responsibilities) at initial 
occupancy. The dollar amounts for the allowances are different for each 
agency and bureau to accommodate agencies' different mission needs. The 
dollar amounts also may vary by locations reflecting different costs in 
different markets. The PBS bill will only reflect the actual amount the 
customers spend, not the allowance. The amount of the TI allowance is 
determined by GSA. Agencies can request that GSA revise the TI allowance 
amount by project or categorically for an entire bureau. The cost of 
replacement of tenant improvements is borne by the customer agency.
    Unique space means space for which there is no commercial market 
comparable (e.g., border stations).
    Warehouse or warehouse space means space contained in a structure 
primarily intended for the housing of files, records, equipment, or 
other personal property, and is not primarily intended for housing 
personnel and office operations. Warehouse space generally is designed 
and constructed to lower specifications than office buildings, with 
features such as exposed ceilings, unfinished perimeter and few dividing 
partitions. Warehouse space also is usually heated to a lesser degree 
but not air-conditioned, and is cleaned to lesser standards than office 
space.
    Workspace means Federally controlled space in buildings and 
structures (permanent, semi-permanent, or temporary) that provides an 
acceptable environment for the performance of

[[Page 317]]

agency mission requirements by employees or by other persons occupying 
it.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.40  What are the major components of the pricing policy?

    The major components of the pricing policy are:
    (a) An OA between a customer agency and GSA;
    (b) Tenant improvement allowance; and
    (c) The establishment of Rent the agency pays to GSA based on the OA 
for:
    (1) Leased space, a pass-through to the customer agency of the 
underlying GSA lease contract costs, and a PBS fee; or
    (2) GSA-owned space, Rent determined by appraisal.


<R04>
                      Subpart B_Occupancy Agreement


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.45  When is an Occupancy Agreement required?

    An Occupancy Agreement (OA) is required for each customer agency's 
space assignment. The OA must be agreed to by GSA and the customer 
agency prior to GSA's commitment of funds for occupancy and formal 
assignment of space.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.50  When does availability of funding have to be certified?

    The customer agency must sign an OA prior to GSA's making any major 
contractual commitments associated with the space request. Typically, 
this should occur at the earliest possible opportunity-i.e., when funds 
become available. However, in no event shall certification occur later 
than just prior to the award of the contract to a design architect in 
the case of Federal construction or renovation in Federally owned space 
or prior to the award of a lease. This serves as a customer agency's 
funding commitment unless certification is provided on another document.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.55  What are the terms and conditions included in an OA?

    The terms and conditions are modeled after commercial practice. They 
are intended to reflect a full mutual understanding of the financial 
terms and agreement of the parties. The OA describes the actual space 
and services to be provided and all associated actual costs to the 
customer during the term of occupancy. The OA does not include any 
general provisions or terms contained in this part. OAs typically 
describe the following, depending on whether the space is leased or 
Federally owned:
    (a) Assigned square footage;
    (b) Shell Rent and term of occupancy;
    (c) Amortized amount of customer allowance used;
    (d) Operating costs and escalations;
    (e) One time charges; e.g., lump sum payments by the customer;
    (f) Real estate tax and escalations;
    (g) Parking and escalations;
    (h) Additional/reduced services;
    (i) Security services and associated Rent;
    (j) Joint use space and associated Rent;
    (k) PBS fee;
    (l) Customer rights and provisions for occupancy after OA 
expiration;
    (m) Cancellation provisions if different from this part or the 
customer service guides;
    (n) Any special circumstances associated with the occupancy, such as 
environmental responsibilities, unusual use restrictions, or agreements 
with local authorities;
    (o) Emergency relocations;
    (p) Clauses specific to the agreement;
    (q) Other Rent, e.g., charges for antenna sites, land;
    (r) Agency standard clauses; and
    (s) General clauses defining the obligations of both parties.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.60  Who can execute an OA?

    Authorized GSA and customer agency officials who can commit or 
obligate the funds of their respective agencies can execute an OA. 
Higher level signatories may be appropriate from both agencies for space 
assignments in owned or leased space, that are unusual in size, 
location, duration, public interest, or other factors. Each agency 
decides its appropriate signatory level.

[[Page 318]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.65  How does an OA obligate the customer agency?

    An OA obligates the executing customer agency to fund the current-
year Rent obligation owed GSA, as well as to reimburse GSA for any other 
bona fide obligations that GSA may have incurred on behalf of the 
customer agency. Although the OA is an interagency agreement, 
memorializing the understanding of GSA and its customer agency, the OA 
may not be construed as obligating future year customer agency funds 
until they are legally available. A multi-year OA commitment assumes the 
customer agency will seek the necessary funding through budget and 
appropriations processes.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.70  Are the standard OA terms appropriate for 

non-cancelable space?

    Yes, most of the standard terms apply; however, the right to cancel 
upon a 4-month (120 day) notice is not available. See Sec. 102-85.35 
for the definition of non-cancelable space.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.75  When can space assignments be terminated?

    (a) Customer agencies can terminate any space assignments, except 
those designated as non-cancelable, with the following stipulations:
    (1) The agency must give GSA written notice at least four months 
prior to termination.
    (2) The agency is responsible for reimbursing GSA for the unpaid 
balance of the cost of tenant improvements, generally prior to GSA 
releasing the agency from the space assignment. In the event the 
customer agency received a rent concession (e.g., free rent) at the 
inception of the assignment as part of the consideration for the entire 
lease term, then the amount of the concession applicable to the 
remaining term must be repaid to GSA.
    (3) If the space to be vacated is ready for occupancy by another 
customer and marketable, GSA accepts the termination of assignment.
    (4) If the agency has vacated all of the space and removed all 
personal property and equipment from the space by the cancellation date 
in the written notice, the agency will be released effective that date 
from further Rent payments.
    (5) An agency may terminate a GSA space assignment with less than a 
four-month advance written notice to GSA, if:
    (i) Either GSA or the terminating agency has identified another 
agency customer for the assigned space and that substitute agency wants 
and is able to fully assume the Rent payments due from the terminating 
agency; and
    (ii) The terminating agency continues to pay Rent until the new 
agency starts paying Rent.
    (b) GSA can terminate space assignments according to GSA regulations 
for emergency or forced moves.
    (c) OAs terminate automatically at expiration.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.80  Who is financially responsible for expenses resulting 

from tenant non-performance?

    The customer agencies are financially responsible for expenses 
incurred by the Government as a result of any failure on their part to 
fulfill a commitment outlined in an OA or other written agreements in 
advance of, or in addition to, the OA. Customer agencies are also 
financially responsible for revised design costs and any additional 
costs resulting from changes to space requirements or space layouts made 
by the agency after a lease, alteration, design, or construction 
contract has been awarded by GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.85  What if a customer agency participates in a

consolidation?

    If an agency agrees to participate in a consolidation upon 
expiration of an OA, the relocation expenses will be addressed in the 
new OA negotiated by GSA and the customer agency. The customer agency 
generally pays such costs.


<R04>
                 Subpart C_Tenant Improvement Allowance


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.90  What is a tenant improvement allowance?

    A tenant improvement (TI) allowance enables the customer agency to 
design, configure and build out space to support its program operations. 
It is based

[[Page 319]]

on local market construction costs and the specific bureau's historical 
use of space. (See also the definition at Sec. 102-85.35.)


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.95  Who pays for the TI allowance?

    The customer agency pays for the amount of the tenant improvement 
allowance actually used.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.100  How does a customer agency pay for tenant improvements?

    To pay for the installation of tenant improvements, the customer 
agency may spend an amount not to exceed the tenant allowance. The 
amount spent by the customer agency for TIs is amortized over a period 
of time specified in the OA, not to exceed the useful life of the 
improvements. This amortization payment is in addition to the shell rent 
and services.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.105  How does an agency pay for customer alterations 

that exceed the TI allowance?

    Amounts exceeding the TI allowance are paid in a one-time lump sum 
and are not amortized over the term of the occupancy. The agency 
certifies lump sum funds are available prior to GSA proceeding with the 
work.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.110  Can the allowance amount be changed?

    The GSA schedule of allowances for new assignments is adjusted 
annually for design and construction cost changes. As the need arises, 
GSA may adjust an agency or bureau's TI allowance. GSA may also adjust a 
TI allowance for a specific project, if conditions warrant. This 
decision is solely GSA's. In addition, the customer agency may waive any 
part or all of its customization allowance in the case of a new space 
assignment. In the case of backfill space (also known as relet space), 
the customer agency can also waive any part or all of the tenant general 
allowance, if the customer agency will use the existing tenant 
improvements, with or without modifications.


<R04>
                         Subpart D_Rent Charges


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.115  How is the Rent determined?

    Unless an exemption is granted under the authority of the 
Administrator of General Services, the Rent charged approximates 
commercial charges for comparable space and space-related services as 
follows:
    (a) Generally, Rent for Federally owned space provided by GSA is 
based on market appraisals of fully serviced rental values for the 
predominant use to which space in a building is put; e.g., general use, 
warehouse use, and parking use. In cases where market appraisals are not 
practical; e.g., in cases involving unique space or when market 
comparables are not available, GSA may establish Rent on the basis of 
alternate commercial practices. See the discussion of alternate 
valuation methods in Sec. 102-85.125. Amortization of tenant 
improvements, parking fees, and security charges are calculated 
separately and added to the appraised shell Rent to establish the Rent 
charge. Customer agencies also pay for a pro rata share of joint use 
space.
    (b) Generally, Rent for space leased by GSA is based on the actual 
cost of the lease, including the costs (if any) of services not provided 
by the lessor, plus a GSA fee, and security charges and parking (if not 
in the lease).
    (1) The Rent is based on the terms and conditions of the OA, 
starting with the shell Rent.
    (2) In addition to the shell Rent, the Rent includes amortization of 
TI allowances used, real estate taxes, operating costs, extra services, 
parking, GSA fee for its services, and charges for security, joint-use, 
and other applicable rental charges (e.g., antenna site, land, 
wareyard).


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.120  What is shell Rent?

    Shell Rent is that portion of GSA Rent charged for the building 
envelope and land. (See Sec. 102-85.35 for the definition of building 
shell.)

[[Page 320]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.125  What alternate methods may be used to establish Rent 

in Federally-owned space?

    Alternate methods of establishing Rent are based on private sector 
models. They include, but are not limited to:
    (a) Return on investment (ROI) approach or a similar cost recovery 
method used when market comparables are not available and/or GSA must 
``build to suit'' to fulfill customer agency requirements; e.g., border 
stations; and
    (b) Rent schedules for the right to use rooftops and other floor 
areas not suitable for workspace; e.g., antenna sites and signage.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.130  How are exemptions from Rent granted?

    Exemptions from Rent are rare. However, the Administrator of General 
Services may exempt any GSA customer from Rent after a determination 
that application of Rent would not be feasible or practical. Customer 
agency requests for exemptions must be addressed to the Administrator of 
General Services and submitted in accordance with GSA Order PBS 4210.1, 
``Rent Exemption Procedures,'' dated December 20, 1991, or in accordance 
with any superseding GSA order. A copy of the order may be obtained from 
the Office of Portfolio Management, General Services Administration, 
1800 F Street, NW., Washington, DC 20405.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.135  What if space and services are provided by other 

executive agencies?

    Any executive agency other than GSA providing space and services is 
authorized to charge the occupant for the space and services at rates 
approved by the Administrator of General Services and the Director of 
the Office of Management and Budget. If space and services are of the 
type provided by the Administrator of General Services, the executive 
agency providing the space and services must credit the monies derived 
from any fees or charges to the appropriation or fund initially charged 
for providing the space or services, as prescribed by Subsection 210(k) 
of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as 
amended (40 U.S.C. 490(k)).


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.140  How are changes in Rent reflected in OAs?

    (a) If Rent changes in ways that are identified in the OA, then no 
change to the OA is required. Typically, OAs state that certain 
components of Rent are subject to annual escalation; e.g., operating 
expenses, real estate taxes, parking charges, the basic security charge, 
and building-specific security operating and amortized capital expenses 
which do not entail a change in service level. Also, in Federally-owned 
space, OAs state that the shell rent is re-marked to market every five 
years. In leased space, the OA will identify any programmed changes in 
the lease contract rent (such as pre-set increases or steps in the 
contract rent rate) that will translate into a change in the customer 
agency's Rent. Changes in Rent specified in OAs will serve as notice to 
agencies of future Rent changes for budgeting purposes. For a discussion 
of budgeting for Rent, see Sec. 102-85.160.
    (b) Changes to Rent other than those identified in paragraph (a) of 
this section typically require an amended OA. There are many events that 
might occasion a change in Rent, and an amended OA, such as:
    (1) An agency expands or contracts at an existing location;
    (2) PBS agrees to fund additional tenant improvements that are then 
amortized over the remaining OA term, or over an extended OA term;
    (3) Upon physical re-measurement, the true square footage of the 
space assignment is found to be different from the square footage of 
record;
    (4) The amount of joint use space in the building changes;
    (5) The level of building-specific security services changes; or
    (6) PBS undertakes new capital expenditures for new or enhanced 
security countermeasures.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.145  When are customer agencies responsible for Rent charges?

    (a) When a customer agency occupies cancelable space, it is 
responsible for Rent charges until:
    (1) The date of release specified in the OA, or until the date space 
is actually vacated, whichever occurs later; or
    (2) Four months after having provided GSA written notice of release; 
or

[[Page 321]]

    (3) The date space is actually vacated, whenever occupancy extends 
beyond the date agreed upon under either paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this 
section.
    (b) When a customer agency releases non-cancelable space, it is 
responsible for all attributable Rent and other space charges until the 
OA expires. This responsibility is mitigated to the extent that GSA is 
able to assign the space to another user or dispose of it. (See Sec. 
102-85.65 How does an OA obligate the customer agency?)
    (c) When a customer agency commits to occupy space in an OA or other 
binding document, but never occupies that space, that agency is 
responsible for:
    (1) Non-cancelable space: Rent payments due for the space until the 
OA expires, unless GSA can mitigate; or
    (2) All other space: Either GSA's space charges for 4 months plus 
the cost of tenant improvements or GSA's actual costs, whichever is 
less.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.150  How will Rent charges be reflected on the customer

agency's Rent bill?

    Rent charges are billed monthly, in arrears, based on an annual rate 
which is divided by 12. Billing commences the first month in which the 
agency occupies the space for more than half of the month, and ends in 
the last month the agency occupies the space.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.155  What does a customer agency do if it does not agree

with a Rent bill?

    (a) If a customer agency does not agree with the way GSA has 
determined its Rent obligation (e.g., the agency does not agree with 
GSA's space classification, appraised Rent, or the allocation of space), 
the agency may appeal its Rent bill to GSA.
    (b) GSA will not increase or otherwise change Rent for any 
assignment, except as agreed in an OA, in the case of errors, or when 
the OA is amended. However, customer agencies may at any time request a 
regional review of the measurement, classification, service levels 
provided, or charges assessed that pertain to the space assignment 
without resorting to formal procedures. Such requests do not constitute 
appeals and should be directed to the appropriate GSA Regional 
Administrator.
    (c) If a customer agency still wants to pursue a formal appeal of 
Rent charges, they may do so, but with the following limitations:
    (1) Terms, including rates, to which the parties agree in an OA are 
not appealable;
    (2) In leased space, the contract rent passed through from the 
underlying lease cannot be appealed;
    (3) In GSA-owned space, when the fully-serviced shell Rent is 
established through appraisal, the appraised rate must exceed comparable 
commercial square foot rates by 20 percent. When shell Rent in owned 
space is established on the basis of ROI at the inception of an OA, and 
the customer agency executes the OA, then the ROI rate cannot later be 
appealed. Other components of Rent that are established on the basis of 
actual cost--eg., amortization of TIs and building specific security 
charges--also cannot be appealed.
    (4) Additionally, the customer agency is required to compare its 
assigned space with other space in the surrounding community that:
    (i) Is available in similar size block of space in a comparable 
location;
    (ii) Is comparable in quality to the space provided by GSA;
    (iii) Provides similar service levels as part of the charges;
    (iv) Contains similar contractual terms, conditions, and escalations 
clauses; and
    (v) Represents a lease transaction completed at a similar point in 
time.
    (5) Data from at least three comparable locations will be necessary 
to demonstrate a market trend sufficient to warrant revising an 
appraised Rent charge.
    (d) A customer agency filing an appeal for a particular location or 
building must develop documentation supporting the appeal and file the 
appeal with the appropriate Regional Administrator. The GSA regional 
office will verify all pertinent information and documentation 
supporting the appeal. The GSA Regional Administrator will accept or 
deny the appeal and will notify the appealing agency of his or her 
ruling.

[[Page 322]]

    (e) A further appeal may be filed by the customer agency's 
headquarters level officials with the Commissioner, Public Buildings 
Service, if equitable resolution has not been obtained from the initial 
appeal. A head of a customer agency may further appeal to the 
Administrator of the General Services. Documentation of the procedures 
followed for prior resolution must accompany an appeal to the 
Administrator. Decisions made by the Administrator are final.
    (f) Adjustments of Rent resulting from reviews and appeals will be 
effective in the month that the agency submitted a properly documented 
appeal. Adjustments in Rent made under this section remain in effect for 
the remainder of the 5-year period in which the charges cited in the OA 
were applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.160  How does a customer agency know how much to

budget for Rent?

    GSA normally provides customer agencies an estimate of Rent 
increases approximately 2 months prior to the agencies' Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) submission for the fiscal year in which GSA 
will charge Rent. This gives the affected customer agencies an 
opportunity to budget for an increase or decrease. However, GSA must 
obtain the concurrence of OMB for such changes prior to notifying 
customer agencies. In the event GSA is unable to provide timely notice 
of a future Rent increase, customer agencies are nonetheless obligated 
to pay the increased Rent amount. For existing assignments in owned 
buildings, GSA charges for fully serviced shell Rent, in aggregate, 
shall not exceed the bureau level budget estimates provided to the 
customer agencies annually. This provision does not apply to:
    (a) New assignments;
    (b) Changes in current assignments;
    (c) Leased space;
    (d) New tenant improvement amortization;
    (e) Building specific security costs; and
    (f) New amortization of capital expenditures under ROI pricing due 
to changes in scope of proposed projects or repair and/or replacement of 
building components


<R04>
                  Subpart E_Standard Levels of Service


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.165  What are standard levels of service?

    (a) The standard levels of service covered by GSA Rent are 
comparable to those furnished in commercial practice. They are based on 
the effort required to service the customer agency's space for a 5-day 
week (Monday to Friday), one-shift regular work schedule. GSA will 
provide adequate building startup services, before the beginning of the 
customer's regular one-shift work schedule, and shutdown services after 
the end of this schedule.
    (b) Without additional charge, GSA customers may use their assigned 
space and supporting automatic elevator systems, lights and small office 
and business machines including personal computers on an incidental 
basis, unless specified otherwise in the OA.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.170  Can flexitime and other alternative work schedules 

cost the customer agency more?

    Yes, GSA customers who extend their regular work schedule by a 
system of flexible hours shall reimburse GSA for its approximate cost of 
the additional services required.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.175  Are the standard level services for cleaning,

mechanical operation, and maintenance identified in an OA?

    Unless specified otherwise in the OA, standard level services for 
cleaning, mechanical operation, and maintenance shall be provided in 
accordance with the GSA standard level of services as defined in Sec. 
102-85.165, and in the PBS Customer Guide to Real Property. A copy of 
the guide may be obtained from the General Services Administration, 
Office of Business Performance (PX), 1800 F Street, NW., Washington, DC 
20405.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.180  Can there be other standard services?

    GSA may provide additional services to its customers at the levels 
and times

[[Page 323]]

deemed by the Administrator of General Services to be necessary for 
efficient operations and proper servicing of space under the assignment 
responsibility of GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.185  Can space be exempted from the standard levels 

of service

    Yes, customer agencies may be excused from paying for standard 
service levels for space assignments when:
    (a) In GSA-delegated space, the customer agency provides for these 
services itself and thus pays Rent minus charges for these services; or
    (b) In rare instances, standard service levels may be waived by the 
Administrator of General Services in instances where charging for such 
standard services would not be feasible or practical, e.g., in 
assignments of limited square footage or functional use.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.190  Can GSA Rent be adjusted when standard levels of

service are performed by other customer agencies?

    Customer agencies that arrange and pay separately for the costs of 
standard level services normally covered by GSA Rent will receive a Rent 
credit or other type of reimbursement by GSA for the amount GSA would 
have charged for such services. The type of reimbursement is at GSA's 
discretion. The reimbursement is limited to the amount included for the 
services in GSA Rent. Approval to perform or contract for such services 
must be obtained in advance by the customer agency from the appropriate 
GSA regional office.


<R04>
                       Subpart F_Special Services


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.195  Does GSA provide special services?

    Yes, GSA provides special services on a cost-reimbursable basis:
    (a) In GSA-controlled space, GSA may provide for special services 
that cannot be separated from the building or space costs (inseparable 
services, such as utilities, which are not individually metered). GSA's 
estimate of the special service cost is the basis for the bill amount. 
The bill amount for separable special services is either based on a 
previously agreed upon fixed price or the actual cost, including a fee 
for GSA's services.
    (b) GSA can also provide special services to other Federal agencies 
in agency-controlled and operated space on a cost-reimbursable basis.


<R04>
       Subpart G_Continued Occupancy, Relocation and Forced Moves


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.200  Can customer agencies continue occupancy of 

space or must they relocate at the end of an OA?

    The answer is contingent upon whether the customer agency is in 
Federally owned or leased space.
    (a) Unless stated otherwise in the OA, a customer agency within a 
GSA controlled, Federally owned building has automatic occupancy rights 
at the end of the OA term for occupied space. However, a new OA must be 
negotiated.
    (b) In leased space, the OA generally reflects the provisions of the 
underlying lease and will specify whether or not renewal options are 
available. If the OA does not include a renewal option, customer 
agencies should assume relocation would be necessary upon OA expiration, 
and budget for it. Further, renewal options are not, in themselves, a 
guarantee of continued occupancy at that location. In some cases, the 
renewal rate is substantially above market or the option was not part of 
the initial price evaluation for the occupancy. In such cases, GSA may 
be required to run a competition for the replacement lease, and a 
relocation may ensue. Nonetheless, it is also possible that GSA may 
execute a succeeding lease with the incumbent lessor, in which case 
there is no move.
    (c) GSA and customer agencies should initiate discussions at least 
18-20 months in advance of OA expiration to address an action for the 
replacement or continued occupancy of the existing space assignment. 
This allows both agencies time to budget for the work and the cost.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.205  What happens if a customer agency continues 

occupancy after the expiration of an OA?

    A mutual goal of GSA and its customers is to have current OAs in 
place

[[Page 324]]

for all space assignments. However, provisions are necessary to cover 
the GSA and customer relationship if an OA expires prior to execution of 
a mutually desired succeeding agreement. Because the risks, liabilities, 
and consequences of a customer's continued occupancy depend on whether 
the assigned space is leased or Federally owned, different provisions in 
the following table apply:

   Holdover Tenancy--Customer Agency Responsibilities in the Event of
                     Tenant Delay in Vacating Space
------------------------------------------------------------------------
              In leased space                 In federally owned space
------------------------------------------------------------------------
To pay those costs associated with lease    To pay Rent as determined by
 contract, GSA fee, and damages/claims,      GSA's pricing policy, as
 arising from changes in GSA contract        described in this part, and
 costs which are caused by the tenant's      those added costs to GSA
 delay.                                      (claims, damages, changes,
                                             etc.) resulting from the
                                             tenant-caused delay.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.210  What if a customer agency has to relocate?

    If the agency or GSA determines relocation is necessary at the 
expiration of an OA for either Federally owned or leased space, the 
customer agency is responsible for all costs associated with relocation 
at that time.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.215  What if another customer agency forces 

a GSA customer to move?

    If a GSA customer agency, or GSA, forces the relocation of another 
GSA customer agency prior to the expiration of the customer's OA, the 
``forcing'' agency is responsible:
    (a) For all reasonable costs associated with the relocation of the 
agency being ``forced'' to move, including architectural-engineering 
design, move coordination and physical relocation, telecommunications 
and ADP equipment relocation and installation;
    (b) To GSA for all of the relocated agency's unpaid tenant 
improvements, if any; and
    (c) To the customer agency for the undepreciated amount of any lump 
sum payment that was already made by the agency for alterations.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.220  Can a customer agency forced to relocate waive

the reimbursements?

    Yes, a customer agency forced to relocate can waive some or all of 
the reimbursements from the forcing agency that are prescribed in Sec. 
102-85.215. However, a relocated customer agency cannot waive the 
requirement for the forcing customer agency to reimburse GSA for unpaid 
tenant improvements. If GSA is the ``forcing'' agency, it is responsible 
for the same costs as any other forcing customer agency.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.225  What are the funding responsibilities for 

relocations resulting from emergencies?

    (a) In emergencies, swift remedies, including the possible 
relocation of a customer agency to alternate space, are required. The 
remedies may include requests for funding authorizations from OMB and 
Congress. GSA may serve as the central coordinator of such remedies.
    (b) Funding responsibility will vary by situation. If a customer 
agency is only temporarily displaced from its space, GSA typically 
covers the cost of temporary set-up in a provisional location. If the 
agency is obliged to relocate permanently, an OA will be prepared which 
will address all terms of the occupancy. In such cases, new tenant 
improvements will be constructed which can be amortized over the life of 
a new occupancy term, and a new Rent rate will be developed.

         Subpart B_Acquiring Transportation or Related Services


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.30  What choices do I have when acquiring transportation

or related services?

    When you acquire transportation or related services you may:
    (a) Use the GSA tender of service;
    (b) Use another agency's contract or rate tender with a TSP only if 
allowed by the terms of that agreement or if the Administrator of 
General Services delegates authority to another agency to enter an 
agreement available to other Executive agencies;
    (c) Contract directly with a TSP using the acquisition procedures 
under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR chapter 1); or
    (d) Negotiate a rate tender under a Federal transportation 
procurement statute, 49 U.S.C. 10721 or 13712.

[[Page 329]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.35  What are the advantages and disadvantages of using 

GSA's tender of service?

    (a) It is an advantage to use GSA's tender of service when you want 
to:
    (1) Use GSA's authority to negotiate on behalf of the Federal 
Government and take advantage of the lower rates and optimum service 
that result from a larger volume of business;
    (2) Use a uniform tender of service; and
    (3) Obtain assistance with loss and damage claims.
    (b) It is a disadvantage to use GSA's tender of service when:
    (1) You want an agreement that is binding for a longer term than the 
GSA tender of service;
    (2) You have sufficient time to follow FAR contracting procedures; 
and
    (3) You do not want to pay for the GSA administrative service charge 
as a participant in the GSA rate tender programs.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.40  When is it advantageous for me to use another 

agency's contract or rate tender for transportation services?

for transportation services when the contract or rate tender offers 
better or equal value than otherwise available to you.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.45  What other factors must I consider when using

another agency's contract or rate tender?

    When using another agency's contract or rate tender, you must:
    (a) Assure that the contract or rate tender meets any special 
requirements unique to your agency;
    (b) Pay any other charges imposed by the other agency for external 
use of their contract or rate tender; and
    (c) Ensure the terms of the other agency's contract or rate tender 
allow you to use it.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.50  What are the advantages and disadvantages of 

contracting directly with a TSP under the FAR?

    (a) The FAR is an advantage to use when:
    (1) You ship consistent volumes in consistent traffic lanes;
    (2) You have sufficient time to follow FAR contracting procedures; 
and
    (3) Your contract office is able to handle the requirement.
    (b) The FAR may be a disadvantage when you:
    (1) Cannot prepare and execute a FAR contract within your time 
frame; or
    (2) Have recurring shipments between designated places, but do not 
expect sufficient volume to obtain favorable rates.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.55  What are the advantages and disadvantages of 

using a rate tender?

    (a) Using a rate tender is an advantage when you:
    (1) Have a shipment that must be made within too short a time frame 
to identify or solicit for a suitable contract; or
    (2) Have shipments recurring between designated places, but do not 
expect sufficient volume to obtain favorable rates.
    (b) Using a rate tender may be a disadvantage when:
    (1) You have sufficient time to use the FAR and this would achieve 
better results;
    (2) You require transportation service for which no rate tender 
currently exists; or
    (3) A TSP may revoke or terminate the tender on short notice.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.60  What is the importance of terms and conditions 

in a rate tender or other transportation document?

    Terms and conditions are important to protect the Government's 
interest and establish the performance and standards expected of the 
TSP. It is important to remember that terms and conditions are:
    (a) Negotiated between the agency and the TSP before movement of any 
item; and
    (b) Included in all contracts and rate tenders listing the services 
the TSP is offering to perform at the cost presented in the rate tender 
or other transportation document.

    Note to Sec. 102-117.60: You must reference the negotiated contract 
or rate tender on all transportation documents. For further information 
see Sec. 102-117.65.

overcharges made and shall be paid at the same rate in effect on that 
date as published by the Secretary of the Treasury according to the Debt 
Collection Act of 1982, 31 U.S.C. 3717.
    (d) To qualify for the rates specified in a rate tender filed under 
the provisions of the Federal transportation procurement statutes (49 
U.S.C. 10721 or 13712), property must be shipped by or for the 
Government and the rate tender must indicate the Government is either 
the consignor or the consignee and include the following statement:

    Transportation is for the (agency name) and the total charges paid 
to the transportation service provider by the consignor or consignee are 
for the benefit of the Government.

    (e) When using a rate tender for transportation under a cost-
reimbursable contract, include the following statement in the rate 
tender:

    Transportation is for the (agency name), and the actual total 
transportation charges paid to the transportation service provider by 
the consignor or consignee are to be reimbursed by the Government 
pursuant to cost reimbursable contract (number). This may be confirmed 
by contacting the agency representative at (name, address and telephone 
number).

    (f) Other terms and conditions that may be specific to your agency 
or the TSP such as specialized packaging requirements or HAZMAT. For

    Subpart C_Business Rules To Consider Before Shipping Freight or 
                             Household Goods


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.100  What business rules must I consider before

acquiring transportation or related services?

    When acquiring transportation or related services you must:
    (a) Use the mode or individual transportation service provider (TSP) 
that provides the overall best value to the agency. For more 
information, see Sec. Sec. 102-117.105 through 102-117.130;
    (b) Demonstrate no preferential treatment to any TSP when arranging 
for transportation services except on international shipments. 
Preference on international shipments must be given to United States 
registered commercial vessels and aircraft;
    (c) Ensure that small businesses receive equal opportunity to 
compete for all business they can perform to the maximum extent 
possible, consistent with the agency's interest (see 48 CFR part 19);
    (d) Encourage minority-owned businesses and women-owned businesses, 
to compete for all business they can perform to the maximum extent 
possible, consistent with the agency's interest (see 48 CFR part 19);
    (e) Review the need for insurance. Generally, the Government is 
self-insured; however, there are instances when the Government will 
purchase insurance coverage for Government property. An example may be 
cargo insurance for international air cargo shipments to cover losses 
over those allowed under the International Air Transport Association 
(IATA) or for ocean freight shipments; and
    (f) Consider the added requirements on international transportation 
found in subpart D of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.105  What does best value mean when routing a shipment?

    Best value to your agency when routing a shipment means using the 
mode or individual TSP providing the best combination of satisfactory 
service factors.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.110  What is satisfactory service?

    You should consider the following factors in assessing whether a TSP 
offers satisfactory service:
    (a) Availability and suitability of the TSP's equipment;
    (b) Adequacy of shipping and receiving facilities at origin and 
destination;
    (c) Adequacy of pickup and/or delivery service;
    (d) Availability of accessorial and special services;
    (e) Estimated time in transit;
    (f) Record of past performance of the TSP including accuracy of 
billing;
    (g) Capability of warehouse equipment and storage space; and
    (h) Experience of company, management, and personnel to perform the 
requirements.

[[Page 332]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.115  How do I calculate total delivery costs?

    You calculate total delivery costs for a shipment by considering all 
costs related to the shipping or receiving process, such as packing, 
blocking, bracing, drayage, loading and unloading, and transporting.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.120  To what extent must I equally distribute orders for

transportation and related services among TSPs?

    You must assure that small businesses, socially or economically 
disadvantaged and women-owned TSPs have equal opportunity to provide the 
transportation or related services.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.125  How detailed must I describe property for shipment

when communicating to a TSP?

    You must describe property in enough detail for the TSP to determine 
the type of equipment or any special precautions necessary to move the 
shipment. Details might include weight, volume, measurements, routing, 
hazardous cargo, or special handling designations.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.130  Must I select TSPs who use alternative fuels?

    No, but, whenever possible, you are encouraged to select TSPs that 
use alternative fuel vehicles and equipment, under policy in the Clean 
Air Act Amendments of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 7612) or the Energy Policy Act of 
1992 (42 U.S.C. 13212).

                       Freight and Household Goods


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.135  What are the international transportation restrictions?

    Several statutes mandate the use of U.S. flag carriers for 
international shipments (see 48 CFR part 47, subparts 47.4 and 47.5). 
For example:
    (a) Arrangements for international air transportation services must 
follow the Fly America Act (International Air Transportation Fair 
Competitive Practices Act of 1974) (49 U.S.C. 40118); and
    (b) International movement of property by water is subject to the 
cargo preference laws (see 46 CFR part 381 and 48 CFR part 47, subpart 
47.5), which require the use of a U.S. flag carrier when service is 
available. The Maritime Administration (MARAD) monitors agency 
compliance of these laws. All Government shippers must send a rated copy 
of the ocean carrier's bill of lading to MARAD within 30 days of loading 
aboard a vessel to:

Sec. 102-117.145  What are coastwise laws?

    Coastwise laws refer to laws governing shipment of freight, 
household goods and passengers by water between points in the United 
States or its territories. The purpose of these laws is to assure 
reliable shipping service and the existence of a maritime capability in 
times of war or national emergency (see section 27 of the Merchant 
Marine Act of 1920, 46 App. U.S.C. 883, 19 CFR 4.80).

<R05>
Sec. 102-117.225  What is the difference between a contract or 

a rate tender and a commuted rate system?

    (a) Under a contract or a rate tender, the agency prepares the bill 
of lading and books the shipment. The agency is the shipper and pays the 
TSP the applicable charges. If loss or damage occurs, the agency may 
either file a claim on behalf of the employee directly with the TSP, or 
help the employee in filing a claim against the TSP.
    (b) Under the commuted rate system an employee arranges for shipping 
HHG and is reimbursed by the agency for the resulting costs. Use this 
method only within the continental United States (not Hawaii or Alaska). 
The agency reimburses the employee according to the Commuted Rate 
Schedule published by the GSA. The Commuted Rate Schedule (without rate 
table) is available on the Internet at http://www.policyworks.gov.

measures you can report specific accomplishments and your success in 
supporting the agency mission. The Government Performance and Results 
Act (GPRA) of 1993 (31 U.S.C. 1115) requires agencies to develop 
business plans and set up program performance measures.
    (b) Examples of performance measurements in transportation would 
include how well you:
    (1) Increase the use of electronic commerce;
    (2) Adopt industry best practices and services to meet your agency 
requirements;
    (3) Use TSPs with a track record of successful past performance or 
proven superior ability;
    (4) Take advantage of competition in moving agency freight and 
household goods;

complaints) as a percentage of shipments; and
    (j) Percentage of customer satisfaction reports on carrier 
performance.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.285  What are my choices if a TSP's performance 

is not satisfactory?

    You may choose to place a TSP in temporary nonuse, suspension, or 
debarment if performance is unsatisfactory.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.290  What is the difference between temporary nonuse,

suspension and debarment?

    (a) Temporary nonuse is limited to your agency and initiated by the 
agency transportation officers for a period not to exceed 90 days for:
    (1) Willful violations of the terms of the rate tender;
    (2) Persistent or willful failure to meet requested packing and 
pickup service;
    (3) Failure to meet required delivery dates;
    (4) Violation of Department of Transportation (DOT) hazardous 
material regulations;
    (5) Mishandling of freight, damaged or missing transportation seals, 
improper loading, blocking, packing or bracing of property;
    (6) Improper routing of property;
    (7) Subjecting your shipments to unlawful seizure or detention by 
failing to pay debts;
    (8) Operating without legal authority;
    (9) Failure to settle claims according to Government regulations; or
    (10) Repeated failure to comply with regulations of DOT, Surface 
Transportation Board, State or local governments or other Government 
agencies.
    (b) Suspension is disqualifying a TSP from receiving orders for 
certain services under a contract or rate tender pending an 
investigation or legal proceeding. A TSP may be suspended on adequate 
evidence of:
    (1) Fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, 
attempting to obtain, or performing a contract for transportation;
    (2) Violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes;
    (3) Embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or 
destruction of records, making false statements, or receiving stolen 
property; and
    (4) Any other offense indicating a lack of business integrity or 
business honesty that seriously and directly affects the present 
responsibility of the TSP as a transporter of the Government's property 
or the HHG of its employees relocated for the Government.
    (c) Debarment means action taken to exclude a contractor from 
contracting with all Federal agencies. The seriousness of the TSP's acts 
or omissions and the mitigating factors must be considered in making any 
debarment decisions. A TSP may be debarred for the following reasons:
    (1) Failure of a TSP to take the necessary corrective actions within 
the period of temporary nonuse; or
    (2) Conviction of or civil judgment for any of the causes for

       Subpart J_Representation Before Regulatory Body Proceedings


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.320  What is a transportation regulatory body proceeding?

    A transportation regulatory body proceeding is a hearing before a 
transportation governing entity, such as a State public utility 
commission, the Surface Transportation Board, or the Federal Maritime 
Commission. The proceeding may be at the Federal or State level 
depending on the activity regulated.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.325  May my agency appear on its own behalf before

a transportation regulatory body proceeding?

    Generally, no executive agency may appear on its own behalf in any 
proceeding before a transportation regulatory body, unless the 
Administrator of General Services delegates the authority to the agency. 
The statutory authority for the Administrator of General Services to 
participate in regulatory proceedings on behalf of all Federal agencies 
is in section 201(a)(4) of the Federal Property and Administrative 
Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 481(a)(4)).


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.330  When, or under what circumstances, would GSA

delegate authority to an agency to appear on its own behalf before
a transportation regulatory 
          body proceeding?

    GSA will delegate authority when it does not have the expertise, or 
when it is outside of GSA's purview, to make a determination on an issue 
such as a protest of rates, routings or excessive charges.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.335  How does my agency ask for a delegation to represent 

itself in a regulatory body proceeding?

    You must send your request for delegation with enough detail to 
explain

[[Page 339]]

the circumstances surrounding the need for delegation of authority for 
representation to:

General Services Administration
Office of Transportation and Personal Property (MT)
1800 F Street, NW.
Washington, DC 20405


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.340  What other types of assistance may GSA 

provide agencies in dealing with regulatory bodies?

    (a) GSA has oversight of all public utilities used by the Federal 
Government including transportation. There are specific regulatory 
requirements a TSP must meet at the State level, such as the requirement 
to obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity.
    (b) GSA has a list of TSPs, which meet certain criteria regarding 
insurance and safety, approved by DOT. You must furnish GSA with an 
affidavit to determine if the TSP meets the basic qualification to 
protect the Government's interest. As an oversight mandate, GSA 
coordinates this function. For further information contact:

                            Subpart K_Reports


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.345  Is there a requirement for me to report

to GSA on my transportation activities?

    (a) Currently, there is no requirement for reporting to GSA on your 
transportation activities. However, GSA will work with your agency and 
other agencies to develop reporting requirements and procedures. In 
particular, GSA will develop a Governmentwide transportation reporting 
system by October 1, 2002.
    (b) Preliminary reporting requirements may include an electronic 
formatted report on the quantity shipped, locations (from and to) and 
cost of transportation. The following categories are examples:
    (1) Dollar amount spent for transportation;
    (2) Volume of weight shipped;
    (3) Commodities shipped;
    (4) HAZMAT shipped;
    (5) Mode used for shipment;
    (6) Location of items shipped (international or domestic); and
    (7) Domestic subdivided by East and West (Interstate 85).


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.350  How will GSA use reports I submit?

    (a) Reporting on transportation and transportation related services 
will provide GSA with:
    (1) The ability to assess the magnitude and key characteristics of 
transportation within the Government (e.g., how much agencies spend; 
what type of commodity is shipped; etc.);
    (2) Data to analyze and recommend changes to policies, standards, 
practices, and procedures to improve Government transportation; and
    (3) A better understanding of how your activity relates to other 
agencies and your influence on the Governmentwide picture of 
transportation services.
    (b) In addition, this information will assist you in showing your 
management the magnitude of your agency's transportation program and the 
effectiveness of your efforts to control cost and improve service.

      Subpart L_Governmentwide Transportation Policy Council (GTPC)


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.355  What is the Governmentwide Transportation Policy

Council (GTPC)?

    The Office of Governmentwide Policy sponsors a Governmentwide 
Transportation Policy Council (GTPC) to help agencies establish, 
improve, and maintain effective transportation management policies, 
practices and procedures. The council:
    (a) Collaborates with private and public stakeholders to develop 
valid performance measures and promote solutions that lead to effective 
results; and
    (b) Provides assistance in developing the Governmentwide 
transportation reporting system (see Sec. 102-117.345).

                            Subpart A_General

                              Introduction


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.5  What is the purpose of this part?

    The purpose of this part is to interpret statutes and other policies 
that assure that payment and payment mechanisms for agency 
transportation services are uniform and appropriate. This part 
communicates the policies clearly to agencies and transportation service 
providers (TSPs). (See Sec. 102-118.35 for the definition of TSP.)


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.10  What is a transportation audit?

    A transportation audit is a thorough review and validation of 
transportation related bills. The audit must examine the validity, 
propriety, and conformity of the charges with tariffs, quotations, 
agreements, or tenders, as appropriate. Each agency must ensure that its 
internal transportation audit procedures prevent duplicate payments and 
only allow payment for authorized services, and that the TSP's bill is 
complete with required documentation.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.15  What is a transportation payment?

    A transportation payment is a payment made by an agency to a TSP for 
the movement of goods or people and/or transportation related services.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.20  Who is subject to this part?

    All agencies and TSPs defined in Sec. 102-118.35 are subject to 
this part. Your agency is required to incorporate this part into its 
internal regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.25  Does GSA still require my agency to submit its 

overall transportation policies for approval?

    GSA no longer requires your agency to submit its overall 
transportation policies for approval. However, as noted in Sec. 102-
118.325, agencies must submit their prepayment audit plans for approval. 
In addition, GSA may from time to time request to examine your agency's 
transportation policies to verify the correct performance of the 
prepayment audit of your agency's transportation bills.

[[Page 344]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.30  Are Government corporations bound by this part?

    No, Government corporations are not bound by this part. However, 
they may choose to use it if they wish.

                               Definitions


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.35  What definitions apply to this part?

    The following definitions apply to this part:
    Agency, as used in this part, means a department, agency, or 
instrumentality of the United States Government.
    Agency claim means any demand by an agency upon a TSP for the 
payment of overcharges, ordinary debts, fines, penalties, administrative 
fees, special charges, and interest.
    Bill of lading, sometimes referred to as a commercial bill of lading 
(but includes GBLs), is the document used as a receipt of goods, and 
documentary evidence of title. It is also a contract of carriage when 
movement is under 49 U.S.C. 10721 and 49 U.S.C. 13712.
    Cash means cash, personal checks, personal charge cards, and 
travelers checks. Cash may only be used to pay for transportation 
expenses in extremely limited cases where government payment mechanisms 
are not available or acceptable.
    Document reference number means the unique number on a bill of 
lading, Government Bill of Lading, Government Transportation Request, or 
transportation ticket, used to track the movement of shipments and 
individuals.
    EDI signature means a discrete authentication code which serves in 
place of a paper signature and binds parties to the terms and conditions 
of a contract in electronic communication.
    Electronic commerce means electronic techniques for performing 
business transactions (ordering, billing, and paying for goods and 
services), including electronic mail or messaging, Internet technology, 
electronic bulletin boards, charge cards, electronic funds transfers, 
and electronic data interchange.
    Electronic data interchange means electronic techniques for carrying 
out transportation transactions using electronic transmissions of the 
information between computers instead of paper documents. These 
electronic transmissions must use established and published formats and 
codes as authorized by the applicable Federal Information Processing 
Standards.
    Electronic funds transfer means any transfer of funds, other than 
transactions initiated by cash, check, or similar paper instrument, that 
is initiated through an electronic terminal, telephone, computer, or 
magnetic tape, for the purpose of ordering, instructing, or authorizing 
a financial institution to debit or credit an account. The term includes 
Automated Clearinghouse transfers, Fed Wire transfers, and transfers 
made at automatic teller machines and point of sale terminals.
    Government Bill of Lading (GBL) means Optional Forms 1103 and 1203, 
the transportation documents issued by GSA and used as a receipt of 
goods, evidence of title, and generally a contract of carriage.
    Government contractor-issued charge card means both an individually 
billed travel card, which the individual is required to pay, and a 
centrally billed account for paying travel expenses, which the agency is 
required to pay.
    Government Transportation Request (GTR) means Optional Form 1169, 
the Government document used to buy transportation services. The 
document normally obligates the Government to pay for the transportation 
services provided.
    Offset means agency use of money owed by the agency to a 
transportation service provider (TSP) to cover a previous debt incurred 
to the agency by the TSP.
    Ordinary debt means an amount that a TSP owes an agency other than 
for the repayment of an overcharge. Ordinary debts include, but are not 
limited to, payments for transportation services ordered and not 
provided (including unused transportation tickets), duplicate payments, 
and amounts for which a TSP is liable because of loss and/or damage to 
property it transported.
    Overcharge means those charges for transportation and travel 
services that exceed those applicable under the contract for carriage. 
This also includes charges more than those applicable

[[Page 345]]

under rates, fares and charges established pursuant to section 13712 and 
10721 of the Revised Interstate Commerce Act, as amended (49 U.S.C. 
13712 and 10721), or other equivalent contract, arrangement or exemption 
from regulation.
    Postpayment audit means an audit of transportation billing documents 
after payment to decide their validity, propriety, and conformity with 
tariffs, quotations, agreements, or tenders. This process may also 
include subsequent adjustments and collections actions taken against a 
TSP by the Government.
    Prepayment audit means an audit of transportation billing documents 
before payment to determine their validity, propriety, and conformity 
with tariffs, quotations, agreements, or tenders.
    Privately Owned Personal Property Government Bill of Lading, 
Optional Form 1203, means the agency transportation document used as a 
receipt of goods, evidence of title, and generally a contract of 
carriage. It is only available for the transportation of household 
goods. Use of this form is mandatory for Department of Defense, but 
optional for other agencies.
    Rate authority means the document that establishes the legal charges 
for a transportation shipment. Charges included in a rate authority are 
those rates, fares, and charges for transportation and related services 
contained in tariffs, tenders, and other equivalent documents.
    Released value is stated in dollars and is considered the assigned 
value of the cargo for reimbursement purposes, not necessarily the 
actual value of the cargo. Released value may be more or less than the 
actual value of the cargo. The released value is the maximum amount that 
could be recovered by the agency in the event of loss or damage for the 
shipments of freight and household goods. In return, when negotiating 
for rates and the released value is proposed to be less than the actual 
value of the cargo, the TSP should offer a rate lower than other rates 
for shipping cargo at full value. The statement of released value may be 
shown on any applicable tariff, tender, contract, transportation 
document or other documents covering the shipment.
    Reparation means the payment involving a TSP to or from an agency of 
an improper transportation billing as determined by a postpayment audit. 
Improper routing, overcharges, or duplicate payments may cause such 
improper billing. This is different from payments to settle a claim for 
loss and damage to items shipped under those rates.
    Standard carrier alpha code (SCAC) means an unique four-letter code 
assigned to each TSP by the National Motor Freight Traffic Association, 
Inc.
    Statement of difference means a statement issued by an agency or its 
designated audit contractor during a prepayment audit when they 
determine that a TSP has billed the agency for more than the proper 
amount for the services. This statement tells the TSP on the invoice, 
the amount allowed and the basis for the proper charges. The statement 
also cites the applicable rate references and other data relied on for 
support. The agency issues a separate statement of difference for each 
transportation transaction.
    Statement of difference rebuttal means a document used by the agency 
to respond to a TSP's claim about an improper reduction made against the 
TSP's original bill by the paying agency.
    Supplemental bill means a bill for services that the TSP submits to 
the agency for additional payment after reimbursement for the original 
bill. The need to submit a supplemental bill may occur due to an 
incorrect first bill or due to charges which were not included on the 
original bill.
    Taxpayer identification number (TIN) means the number required by 
the Internal Revenue Service to be used by the TSP in reporting income 
tax or other returns. For a TSP, the TIN is an employer identification 
number.
    Transportation document (TD) means any executed agreement for 
transportation service, such as a bill of lading (including a Government 
Bill of Lading), a Government Transportation Request, or transportation 
ticket.
    Transportation service means service involved in the physical 
movement

[[Page 346]]

(from one location to another) of products, people, household goods, and 
any other objects by a TSP for an agency as well as activities directly 
relating to or supporting that movement. Examples of this are storage, 
crating, or connecting appliances.
    Transportation service provider (TSP) means any party, person, 
agent, or carrier that provides freight or passenger transportation and 
related services to an agency. For a freight shipment this would include 
packers, truckers, and storers. For passenger transportation this would 
include airlines, travel agents and travel management centers.
    Transportation service provider claim means any demand by the TSP 
for amounts not included in the original bill that the TSP believes an 
agency owes them. This includes amounts deducted or offset by an agency; 
amounts previously refunded by the TSP, which they now believe they are 
owed; and any subsequent bills from the TSP resulting from a transaction 
that was pre- or postpayment audited by the GSA Audit Division.
    Virtual GBL (VGBL) means the use of a unique GBL number on a 
commercial document, which binds the TSP to the terms and conditions of 
a GBL.

    Note to Sec. 102-118.35: 49 U.S.C. 13102, et seq., defines 
additional transportation terms not listed in this section.

Sec. 102-118.40  How does my agency order transportation and 

transportation services?

    Your agency orders:
    (a) Transportation of freight and household goods and related 
transportation services (e.g., packaging, storage) with a Government 
contractor-issued charge card, purchase order (or electronic 
equivalent), or a Government bill of lading for international shipments 
(including domestic overseas shipments). In extremely limited cases, 
cash can be used where government payment mechanisms are not available 
or acceptable.
    (b) Transportation of people through the purchase of transportation 
tickets with a Government issued charge card (or centrally billed travel 
account citation), Government issued individual travel charge card, 
personal charge card, cash (in accordance with Department of the 
Treasury regulations), or in limited prescribed situations, a Government 
Transportation Request (GTR). See the ``U.S. Government Passenger 
Transportation--Handbook,'' obtainable from:

<R05>
Sec. 102-118.45  How does a transportation service provider 

(TSP) bill my agency for transportation and transportation services?

    The manner in which your agency orders transportation and 
transportation services determines the manner in which a TSP bills for 
service. This is shown in the following table:

                 Transportation Service Provider Billing
------------------------------------------------------------------------
          (a) Ordering method                   (b) Billing method

------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.50  How does my agency pay for transportation services?

    Your agency may pay for transportation services in three ways:
    (a) Electronic funds transfer (EFT) (31 U.S.C. 3332, et seq.). Your 
agency is required by statute to make all payments by EFT unless your 
agency receives a waiver from the Department of the Treasury.
    (b) Check. For those situations where EFT is not possible and the 
Department of the Treasury has issued a waiver, your agency may make 
payments by check.
    (c) Cash. In very unusual circumstances and as a last option, your 
agency payments may be made in cash in accordance with Department of the 
Treasury regulations (31 CFR part 208).


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.55  What administrative procedures must my agency 

establish for payment of freight, household goods, or other 
transportation services?

    Your agency must establish administrative procedures which assure 
that the following conditions are met:
    (a) The negotiated price is fair and reasonable;
    (b) A document of agreement signifying acceptance of the 
arrangements with terms and conditions is filed with the participating 
agency by the TSP;
    (c) The terms and conditions are included in all transportation 
agreements and referenced on all transportation documents (TDs);
    (d) Bills are only paid to the TSP providing service under the bill 
of lading to your agency and may not be waived;
    (e) All fees paid are accounted for in the aggregate delivery costs;
    (f) All payments are subject to applicable statutory limitations;
    (g) Procedures (such as an unique numbering system) are established 
to prevent and detect duplicate payments, properly account for 
expenditures and discrepancy notices;
    (h) All transactions are verified with any indebtedness list. On 
charge card transactions, your agency must consult any indebtedness list 
if the charge card contract provisions allow for it; and
    (i) Procedures are established to process any unused tickets.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.60  To what extent must my agency use electronic commerce?

    Your agency must use electronic commerce in all areas of your 
transportation program. This includes the use of electronic systems and 
forms for ordering, receiving bills and paying for transportation and 
transportation services.

[69 FR 57618, Sept. 24, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.65  Can my agency receive electronic billing for 

payment of transportation services?

    Yes, when mutually agreeable to the agency and the GSA Audit 
Division, your agency is encouraged to use electronic billing for the 
procurement and billing of transportation services.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.70  Must my agency make all payments via electronic

funds transfer?

    Yes, under 31 U.S.C. 3332, et seq., your agency must make all 
payments for goods and services via EFT (this includes goods and 
services ordered using charge cards).

[[Page 348]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.75  What if my agency or the TSP does not have an 

account with a financial institution or approved payment agent?

    Under 31 U.S.C. 3332, et seq., your agency must obtain an account 
with a financial institution or approved payment agent in order to meet 
the statutory requirements to make all Federal payments via EFT unless 
your agency receives a waiver from the Department of the Treasury. To 
obtain a waiver, your agency must contact:

<R05>
Sec. 102-118.80  Who is responsible for keeping my agency's 

electronic commerce transportation billing records?

    Your agency's internal financial regulations will identify 
responsibility for recordkeeping. In addition, the GSA Audit Division 
keeps a central repository of electronic transportation billing records 
for legal and auditing purposes. Therefore, your agency must forward all 
relevant electronic transportation billing documents to:

<R05>
Sec. 102-118.85  Can my agency use a Government contractor issued

charge card to pay for transportation services?

    Yes, your agency may use a Government contractor issued charge card 
to purchase transportation services if permitted under the charge card 
contract or task order. In these circumstances your agency will receive 
a bill for these services from the charge card company.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.90  If my agency orders transportation and/or 

transportation services with a Government contractor issued 

charge card or charge account citation, 
          is this subject to prepayment audit?

    Generally, no transportation or transportation services ordered with 
a Government contractor issued charge card or charge account citation 
can be prepayment audited because the bank or charge card contractor 
pays the TSP directly, before your agency receives a bill that can be 
audited from the charge card company. However, if your agency contracts 
with the charge card or charge account provider to provide for a 
prepayment audit, then, as long as your agency is not liable for paying 
the bank for improper charges (as determined by the prepayment audit 
verification process), a prepayment audit can be used. As with all 
prepayment audit programs, the charge card prepayment audit must be 
approved by the GSA Audit Division prior to implementation. If the 
charge card contract does not provide for a prepayment audit, your 
agency must submit the transportation line items on the charge card to 
the GSA Audit Division for a postpayment audit.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.91  May my agency authorize the use of cash?

    Yes, in limited circumstances, a Government employee can use cash 
where government payment mechanisms are not available or acceptable.

[69 FR 57618, Sept. 24, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.92  How does my agency handle receipts, tickets or other

records of cash payments?

    Your agency must ensure that its employees keep the original 
receipts for transportation purchases over $75.00 made with cash. If it 
is impractical to furnish receipts in any instance as required by this 
subtitle, the failure to do so must be fully explained on the travel 
voucher. Mere inconvenience in the matter of taking receipts will not be 
considered. These receipts must be saved for a possible postpayment 
audit by the GSA Audit Division. If your agency requires the filing of 
paper receipts, then you must do so. For transportation purchases over 
$75.00, your

[[Page 349]]

agency must ensure that copies of all original papers are retained at 
your agency. Copies of tickets from a TSP must be sent to--General 
Services Administration, Federal Supply Service, Audit Division (FBA), 
1800 F Street, NW., Washington, DC 20405, www.gsa.gov/transaudits.

[69 FR 57618, Sept. 24, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.95  What forms can my agency use to pay 

transportation bills?

    Your agency must use commercial payment practices and forms to the 
maximum extent possible; however, when viewed necessary by your agency, 
your agency may use the following Government forms to pay transportation 
bills:
    (a) Standard Form (SF) 1113, Public Voucher for Transportation 
Charges, and SF 1113-A, Memorandum Copy;
    (b) Optional Form (OF) 1103, Government Bill of Lading and OF 1103A 
Memorandum Copy (used for movement of things, both privately owned and 
Government property for official uses);
    (c) OF 1169, Government Transportation Request (used to pay for 
tickets to move people); and
    (d) OF 1203, Privately Owned Personal Property Government Bill of 
Lading, and OF 1203A, Memorandum Copy (used by the Department of Defense 
to move private property for official transfers).

    Note to Sec. 102-118.95: By March 31, 2002, your agency may no 
longer use the GBLs (OF 1103 and OF 1203) for domestic shipments. After 
September 30, 2000, your agency should minimize the use of GTRs (OF 
1169).

[65 FR 24569, Apr. 26, 2000, as amended at 66 FR 48812, Sept. 24, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.100  What must my agency ensure is on each SF 1113?

    Your agency must ensure during its prepayment audit of a TSP bill 
that the TSP filled out the Public Vouchers, SF 1113, completely 
including the taxpayer identification number (TIN), and standard carrier 
alpha code (SCAC). An SF 1113 must accompany all billings.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.105  Where can I find the rules governing the use of a 

Government Bill of Lading?

<R05>
Sec. 102-118.115  Must my agency use a GBL?

    No, your agency is not required to use a GBL and must use commercial 
payment practices to the maximum extent possible. Effective March 31, 
2002, your agency must phase out the use of the Optional Forms 1103 and 
1203 for domestic shipments. After this date, your agency may use the 
GBL solely for international shipments.

<R05>
Sec. 102-118.120  Must my agency use a GTR?

    No, your agency is not required to use a GTR. Your agency must adopt 
commercial practices and eliminate GTR use to the maximum extent 
possible.

[[Page 350]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.125  What if my agency uses a TD other than a GBL?

    If your agency uses any other TD for shipping under its account, the 
requisite and the named safeguards must be in place (i.e., terms and 
conditions found herein and in the ``U.S. Government Freight 
Transportation--Handbook,'' appropriate numbering, etc.).


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.130  Must my agency use a GBL for express, courier,

or small package shipments?

    No, however, in using commercial forms all shipments must be subject 
to the terms and conditions set forth for use of a bill of lading for 
the Government. Any other non-conflicting applicable contracts or 
agreements between the TSP and an agency involving buying transportation 
services for Government traffic remain binding. This purchase does not 
require a SF 1113. When you are using GSA's schedule for small package 
express delivery, the terms and conditions of that contract are binding.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.135  Where are the mandatory terms and conditions 

governing the use of bills of lading?

    The mandatory terms and conditions governing the use of bills of 
lading are contained in this part and the ``U.S. Government Freight 
Transportation Handbook.''


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.140  What are the major mandatory terms and 

conditions governing the use of GBLs and bills of lading?

    The mandatory terms and conditions governing the use of GBLs and 
bills of lading are:
    (a) Unless otherwise permitted by statute and approved by the 
agency, the TSP may not demand prepayment or collect charges from the 
consignee. The TSP, providing service under the bill of lading, must 
present a legible copy of the bill of lading or an original, properly 
certified GBL attached to Standard Form (SF) 1113, Public Voucher for 
Transportation Charges, to the paying office for payment;
    (b) The shipment must be made at the restricted or limited valuation 
specified in the tariff or classification or limited contract, 
arrangement or exemption at or under which the lowest rate is available, 
unless indicated on the GBL or bill of lading. (This is commonly 
referred to as an alternation of rates);
    (c) Receipt for the shipment is subject to the consignee's 
annotation of loss, damage, or shrinkage on the delivering TSP's 
documents and the consignee's copy of the same documents. If loss or 
damage is discovered after delivery or receipt of the shipment, the 
consignee must promptly notify the nearest office of the last delivering 
TSP and extend to the TSP the privilege of examining the shipment;

Government Passenger Transportation--Handbook.''

[[Page 351]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.150  What are the major mandatory terms and

conditions governing the use of passenger transportation documents?

    The mandatory terms and conditions governing the use of passenger 
transportation documents are:
    (a) Government travel must be via the lowest cost available, that 
meets travel requirements; e.g., Government contract, fare, through, 
excursion, or reduced one way or round trip fare. This should be done by 
entering the term ``lowest coach'' on the Government travel document if 
the specific fare basis is not known;
    (b) The U.S. Government is not responsible for charges exceeding 
those applicable to the type, class, or character authorized in 
transportation documents;
    (c) The U.S. Government contractor-issued charge card must be used 
to the maximum extent possible to procure passenger transportation 
tickets. GTRs must be used minimally;
    (d) Government passenger transportation documents must be in 
accordance with Federal Travel Regulation Chapters 300 and 301 (41 CFR 
chapters 300 and 301), and the ``U.S. Government Passenger 
Transportation--Handbook'';
    (e) Interest shall accrue from the voucher payment date on 
overcharges made hereunder and shall be paid at the same rate in effect 
on that date as published by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to 
the Debt Collection Act of 1982;

commenced;
    (g) The issuing official or traveler, by signature, certifies that 
the requested transportation is for official business;
    (h) The TSP must not honor any request containing erasures or 
alterations unless the TD contains the authentic, valid initials of the 
issuing official; and
    (i) Additional mandatory terms and conditions are in this part and 
the ``U. S. Government Passenger Transportation--Handbook.''


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.155  How does my agency handle supplemental billings

from the TSP after payment of the original bill?

the findings, your agency must attempt to resolve the disputed amount.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.160  Who is liable if my agency makes an overpayment on

a transportation bill?

    If the agency conducts prepayment audits of its transportation 
bills, agency transportation certifying and disbursing officers are 
liable for any overpayments made. If GSA has granted a waiver to the 
prepayment audit requirement and the agency performs a postpayment audit 
(31 U.S.C. 3528 and 31 U.S.C. 3322) neither the certifying nor 
disbursing officers are liable for the reasons listed in these two cited 
statutes.


<R05>

adjustment that you make either electronically or in writing within 7 
days of receipt of the bill, as required by the Prompt Payment Act (31 
U.S.C. 3901, et seq.). This notice must include the TSP's taxpayer 
identification number, standard carrier alpha code, bill number and 
document reference number, agency name, amount requested by the TSP, 
amount paid, payment voucher number, complete tender or tariff 
authority, the applicable rate authority and the complete fiscal 
authority including the appropriation.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.170  Will GSA continue to maintain a centralized

numbering system for Government transportation documents?

    Yes, GSA will maintain a numbering system for GBLs and GTRs. For 
commercial TDs, each agency must create a unique numbering system to 
account for and prevent duplicate numbers. The GSA Audit Division must 
approve this system. Write to:

         Subpart D_Prepayment Audits of Transportation Services

                Agency Requirements for Prepayment Audits


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.265  What is a prepayment audit?

    A prepayment audit is a review of a transportation service provider 
(TSP) bill that occurs prior to your agency making payment to a TSP. 
This review compares the charges on the bill against the charge 
permitted under the contract, rate tender, or other agreement under 
which the TSP provided the transportation and/or transportation related 
services.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.270  Must my agency establish a prepayment audit program?

    (a) Yes, under 31 U.S.C. 3726, your agency is required to establish 
a prepayment audit program. Your agency must send a preliminary copy of 
your prepayment audit program to:

General Services Administration
Office of Transportation and Personal Property (MT)
1800 F Street, NW.
Washington, DC 20405
http://policyworks.gov/org/main/MT

    (b) The final plan must be approved and in place by April 20, 2000.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.275  What must my agency consider when designing and 

implementing a prepayment audit program?

    (a) As shown in Sec. 102-118.45, the manner in which your agency 
orders transportation services determines how and by whom the bill for 
those services will

[[Page 355]]

be presented. Each method of ordering transportation and transportation 
services may require a different kind of prepayment audit.
    Your agency's prepayment audit program must consider all of the 
methods that you use to order and pay for transportation services. With 
each method of ordering transportation services, your agency should 
ensure that each TSP bill or employee travel voucher contains enough 
information for the prepayment audit to determine which contract or rate 
tender is used and that the type and quantity of any additional services 
are clearly delineated.
    (b) For transportation payments made through cost reimbursable 
contracts, the agency must include a statement in the contract that the 
contractor shall submit to the address identified for prepayment audit, 
transportation documents which show that the United States will assume 
freight charges that were paid by the contractor.
    (c) Cost reimbursable contractors shall only submit for audit bills 
of lading with freight shipment charges exceeding $100.00. Bills under 
$100.00 shall be retained on-site by the contractor and made available 
for on-site audits.

[69 FR 57619, Sept. 24, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.280  What advantages does the prepayment audit offer

my agency?

    Prepayment auditing will allow your agency to detect and eliminate 
billing errors before payment and will eliminate the time and cost of 
recovering agency overpayments.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.285  What options for performing a prepayment audit does

my agency have?

    Your agency may perform a prepayment audit by:
    (a) Creating an internal prepayment audit program;
    (b) Contracting directly with a prepayment audit service provider; 
or
    (c) Using the services of a prepayment audit contractor under GSA's 
multiple award schedule covering audit and financial management 
services.

    Note to Sec. 102-118.285: Either of the choices in paragraph (a), 
(b) or (c) of this section might include contracts with charge card 
companies that provide prepayment audit services.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.290  Must every electronic and paper transportation 

bill undergo a prepayment audit?

    Yes, all transportation bills and payments must undergo a prepayment 
audit unless your agency's prepayment audit program uses a statistical 
sampling technique of the bills or the Administrator of General Services 
grants a specific waiver from the prepayment audit requirement. If your 
agency chooses to use statistical sampling, all bills must be at or 
below the Comptroller General specified limit of $2,500.00 (31 U.S.C. 
3521(b) and General Accounting Office Policy and Procedures Manual

undergoing a prepayment audit?

    The limited exceptions to bills undergoing a prepayment audit are 
those bills subject to a waiver from GSA (which may include bills 
determined to be below your agency's threshold). The waiver to 
prepayment audit requirements may be for bills, mode or modes of 
transportation or for an agency or subagency.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.300  How does my agency fund its prepayment audit program?

    Your agency must pay for the prepayment audit from those funds 
appropriated for transportation services.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.305  Must my agency notify the TSP of any adjustment

to the TSP's bill?

    Yes, your agency must notify the TSP of any adjustment to the TSP's 
bill either electronically or in writing within 7 days of receipt of the 
bill. This notice must refer to the TSP's bill number, agency name, 
taxpayer identification number, standard carrier alpha code, document 
reference number, amount billed, amount paid, payment voucher number, 
complete tender or

[[Page 356]]

tariff authority, including item or section number.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.310  Must my agency prepayment audit program establish

appeal procedures whereby a TSP may appeal any reduction in the amount
billed?

    Yes, your agency must establish an appeal process that directs TSP 
appeals to an agency official who is able to provide adequate 
consideration and review of the circumstances of the claim. Your agency 
must complete the review of the appeal within 30 days.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.315  What must my agency do if the TSP disputes the 

findings and my agency cannot resolve the dispute?

    (a) If your agency is unable to resolve the disputed amount with the 
TSP, your agency should forward all relevant documents including a 
complete billing history, and the appropriation or fund charged, to:

General Services Administration
Federal Supply Service
Audit Division (FBA)
1800 F Street, NW.
Washington, DC 20405
www.gsa.gov/transaudits

    (b) The GSA Audit Division will review the appeal of an agency's 
final, full or partial denial of a claim and issue a decision. A TSP 
must submit claims within 3 years under the guidelines established in 
Sec. 102-118.460.

<R05>
Sec. 102-118.325  Must I get approval for my agency's prepayment 

audit program?

    Yes, your agency must get approval for your prepayment audit 
program. The highest level budget or financial official of each agency, 
such as the Chief Financial Officer, initially approves your agency's 
prepayment audit program. After internal agency approval, your agency 
submits the plan in writing to the GSA Audit Division for final 
approval.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.330  What are the elements of an acceptable prepayment 

audit program?

    An acceptable prepayment audit program must:
    (a) Verify all transportation bills against filed rates and charges 
before payment;
    (b) Comply with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3901, et seq.);
    (c) Allow for your agency to establish minimum dollar thresholds for 
transportation bills subject to audit;

reasons for any full or partial rejection of the stated charges on the 
invoice. An accurate notice must include the TSP's invoice number, the 
billed amount, TIN, standard carrier alpha code, the charges calculated 
by the agency, and the specific reasons including applicable rate 
authority for the rejection;
    (h) Forward documentation monthly to the GSA Audit Division, which 
will store paid transportation bills under the General Records Schedule 
9, Travel and Transportation (36 CFR Chapter XII, 1228.22) which 
requires keeping records for 3 years. GSA will arrange for storage of 
any document requiring special handling (e.g., bankruptcy, court case, 
etc.). These bills will be retained pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 3309 until 
claims have been settled;
    (i) Establish procedures in which transportation bills not subject 
to prepayment audit (i.e., bills for unused tickets and charge card

transportation rates, freight classifications, or other information 
provided on a GBL or passenger transportation request when the 
Administrator of General Services or designee waives the prepayment 
audit requirement and your agency uses postpayment audits.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.360  What relief from liability is available for the

certifying official under a postpayment audit?

    The agency counsel relieves a certifying official from liability for 
overpayments in cases where postpayment is the approved method of 
auditing and:
    (a) The overpayment occurred solely because the administrative 
review before payment did not verify transportation rates; and
    (b) The overpayment was the result of using improper transportation 
rates or freight classifications or the failure to deduct the correct 
amount under a land grant law or agreement.

[[Page 358]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.365  Do the requirements of a prepayment audit change 

the disbursing official's liability for overpayment?

    Yes, the disbursing official has a liability for overpayments on all 
transportation bills subject to prepayment audit (31 U.S.C. 3322).


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.370  Where does relief from prepayment audit liability 

for certifying, accountable, and disbursing officers reside in my 
agency?

    Your agency's counsel has the authority to relieve liability and 
give advance opinions on liability issues to certifying, accountable, 
and disbursing officers (31 U.S.C. 3527).

<R05>
Sec. 102-118.375  Who has the authority to grant a waiver of the

prepayment audit requirement?

    Only the Administrator of General Services or designee has the 
authority to grant waivers from the prepayment audit requirement.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.380  How does my agency apply for a waiver from a

prepayment audit of requirement?

    Your agency must submit a request for a waiver from the requirement 
to perform a prepayment in writing to:

General Services Administration
Office of Transportation and Personal Property (MT)
1800 F Street, NW.
Washington, DC 20405
http://policyworks.gov/org/main/MT


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.385  What must a waiver request include?

    A waiver request must explain in detail how the use of a prepayment 
audit increases costs over a postpayment audit, decreases efficiency, 
involves a relevant public interest, adversely affects the agency's 
mission, or is not feasible for the agency. A waiver request must 
identify the mode or modes of transportation, agency or subagency to 
which the waiver would apply.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.390  On what basis does GSA grant a waiver to the 

prepayment audit requirement?

    GSA issues waivers to the prepayment audit requirement based on:
    (a) Cost-effectiveness;
    (b) Government efficiency;
    (c) Public interest; or
    (d) Other factors the Administrator of General Services considers 
appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.395  How long will GSA take to respond to a waiver request?

    GSA will respond to a written waiver request within 30 days from the 
receipt of the request.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.400  Must my agency renew a waiver of the prepayment

audit requirements?

    Yes, your agency waiver to the prepayment audit requirement will not 
exceed 2 years. Your agency must reapply to ensure the circumstances at 
the time of approval still apply.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.405  Are my agency's prepayment audited transportation

bills subject to periodic postpayment audit oversight from the GSA 
Audit Division?

    Yes, two years or more after starting prepayment audits, the GSA 
Audit Division (depending on its evaluation of the results) may subject 
your agency's prepayment audited transportation bills to periodic 
postpayment audit oversight rather than blanket postpayment audits. The 
GSA Audit Division will then prepare a report analyzing the success of 
your agency's prepayment audit program. This report will be on file at 
GSA and available for your review.

             Suspension of Agency Prepayment Audit Programs


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.410  Can GSA suspend my agency's prepayment audit program?

    (a) Yes, the Director of the GSA Audit Division may suspend your 
agency's prepayment audit program based on his or her determination of a 
systematic or frequent failure of the program to:

[[Page 359]]

    (1) Conduct an accurate prepayment audit of your agency's 
transportation bills;
    (2) Abide by the terms of the Prompt Payment Act;
    (3) Adjudicate TSP claims disputing prepayment audit positions of 
the agency regularly within 30 days of receipt;
    (4) Follow Comptroller General decisions, GSA Board of Contract 
Appeals decisions, the Federal Management Regulation and GSA 
instructions or precedents about substantive and procedure matters; and/
or
    (5) Provide information and data or to cooperate with on-site 
inspections necessary to conduct a quality assurance review.
    (b) A systematic or a multitude of individual failures will result 
in suspension. A suspension of an agency's prepayment audit program may 
be in whole or in part for failure to conduct proper prepayment audits.


<R04>
               Subpart E_Postpayment Transportation Audits


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.415  Will the widespread mandatory use of prepayment 

audits eliminate postpayment audits?

    No, the mandatory use of prepayment audits will not eliminate 
postpayment audits because:
    (a) Postpayment audits will continue for those areas which do not 
lend themselves to the prepayment audit; and
    (b) The GSA Audit Division will continue to review and survey the 
progress of the prepayment audit by performing a postpayment audit on 
the bills. The GSA Audit Division has a Congressionally mandated 
responsibility under 31 U.S.C. 3726 to perform oversight on 
transportation bill payments. During the early startup period for 
prepayment audits, transportation bills are subject to a possible 
postpayment audit to discover the effectiveness of the prepayment audit 
process.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.420  Can the Administrator of General Services waive the 

postpayment auditing provisions of this subpart?

    Yes, in certain circumstances, the Administrator of General Services 
or designee may waive the postpayment audit oversight requirements of 
this subpart on a case by case basis.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.425  Is my agency allowed to perform a postpayment audit

on our transportation bills?

    No, your agency must forward all transportation bills to GSA for a 
postpayment audit regardless of any waiver allowing for postpayment 
audit.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.430  What information must be on my agency's 

transportation bills submitted for a postpayment audit?

for postpayment audit with:
    (a) The date received from a TSP;
    (b) A TSP's bill number;
    (c) Your agency name;
    (d) A Document Reference Number;
    (e) The amount requested;
    (f) The amount paid;
    (g) The payment voucher number;
    (h) Complete tender or tariff authority, including contract price 
(if purchased under the Federal Acquisition Regulation), item or section 
number;
    (i) The TSP's taxpayer identification number; and
    (j) The TSP's standard carrier alpha code (SCAC).


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.435  What procedures does GSA use to perform a

postpayment audit?

    When GSA performs a postpayment audit, the GSA Audit Division has 
the delegated authority to implement the following procedures:
    (a) Audit selected TSP bills after payment;
    (b) Audit selected TSP bills before payment as needed to protect the 
Government's interest (i.e., bankruptcy, fraud);
    (c) Examine, settle, and adjust accounts involving payment for 
transportation and related services for the account of agencies;
    (d) Adjudicate and settle transportation claims by and against 
agencies;
    (e) Offset an overcharge by any TSP from an amount subsequently 
found to be due that TSP;
    (f) Issue a Notice of Overcharge stating that a TSP owes a debt to 
the agency. This notice states the amount paid, the basis for the proper 
charge for the

[[Page 360]]

document reference number, and cites applicable tariff or tender along 
with other data relied on to support the overcharge. A separate Notice 
of Overcharge is prepared and mailed for each bill; and
    (g) Issue a GSA Notice of Indebtedness when a TSP owes an ordinary 
debt to an agency. This notice states the basis for the debt, the TSP's 
rights, interest, penalty, and other results of nonpayment. The debt is 
due immediately and subject to interest charges, penalties, and 
administrative cost under 31 U.S.C. 3717.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.440  What are the postpayment audit responsibilities 

and roles of the GSA Audit Division?

    When the GSA Audit Division performs a postpayment audit for your 
agency, GSA will:
    (a) Examine and analyze payments to discover their validity, 
relevance and conformity with tariffs, quotations, contracts, agreements 
or tenders and make adjustments to protect the interest of an agency;
    (b) Examine, adjudicate, and settle transportation claims by and 
against the agency;
    (c) Collect from TSPs by refund, setoff, offset or other means, the 
amounts determined to be due the agency;
    (d) Adjust, terminate or suspend debts due on TSP overcharges;
    (e) Prepare reports to the Attorney General of the United States 
with recommendations about the legal and technical bases available for 
use in prosecuting or defending suits by or against an agency and 
provide technical, fiscal, and factual data from relevant records;
    (f) Provide transportation specialists and lawyers to serve as 
expert witnesses, assist in pretrial conferences, draft pleadings, 
orders, and briefs, and participate as requested in connection with 
transportation suits by or against an agency;
    (g) Review agency policies, programs, and procedures to determine 
their adequacy and effectiveness in the audit of freight or passenger 
transportation payments, and review related fiscal and transportation 
practices;
    (h) Furnish information on rates, fares, routes, and related 
technical data upon request;
    (i) Tell an agency of irregular shipping routing practices, 
inadequate commodity descriptions, excessive transportation cost 
authorizations, and unsound principles employed in traffic and 
transportation management; and
    (j) Confer with individual TSPs or related groups and associations 
presenting specific modes of transportation to resolve mutual problems 
concerning technical and accounting matters and acquainting them with 
agency requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.445  Must my agency pay for a postpayment audit when

using the GSA Audit Division?

    No, the expenses of postpayment audit contract administration and 
audit-related functions are financed from overpayments collected from 
the TSP's bills previously paid by the agency and similar type of 
refunds.

(31 U.S.C. 3726). The reason for this is that he or she has access to 
Governmentwide data on a TSP's payments and billings with the 
Government. Your agency has the responsibility to correctly pay 
individual transportation claims.

        Transportation Service Provider (TSP) Filing Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.545  What information must a TSP claim include?

    Transportation service provider (TSP) claims received by GSA or its 
designee must include one of the following:
    (a) The signature of an individual or party legally entitled to 
receive payment for services on behalf of the TSP;
    (b) The signature of the TSP's agent or attorney accompanied by a 
duly executed power of attorney or other documentary evidence of the 
agent's or attorney's right to act for the TSP; or
    (c) An electronic signature, when mutually agreed upon.

 Transportation Service Provider (TSP) and Agency Appeal Procedures for 
                            Prepayment Audits


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.570  If my agency denies the TSP's challenge to the

statement of difference, may the TSP appeal?

    Yes, the TSP may appeal if your agency denies its challenge to the 
statement of difference. However, the appeal must be handled at a higher 
level in your agency.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.575  If a TSP disagrees with the decision of my 

agency, can the TSP appeal?

    Yes, the TSP may file a claim with the GSA Audit Division, which 
will review the TSP's appeal of your agency's final full or partial 
denial of a claim. The TSP may also appeal to the GSA Audit Division if 
your agency has not responded to a challenge within 30 days.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.580  May a TSP appeal a prepayment audit decision of 

the GSA Audit Division?

    (a) Yes, the TSP may appeal to the GSA's Board of Contract Appeals 
(GSBCA), under guidelines established in this subpart, or file a claim 
with the United States Court of Federal Claims. The TSP's request for 
review must be received by the GSBCA in writing within 6 months (not 
including time of war) from the date the settlement action was taken or 
within the periods of limitation specified in 31 U.S.C. 3726, as

<R05>
Sec. 102-118.585  May a TSP appeal a prepayment audit decision of 

the GSBCA?

    No, a ruling by the GSBCA is the final administrative remedy

governs administrative actions only and does not affect any of the TSP's 
rights. A TSP may still pursue a legal remedy through the courts.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.590  May my agency appeal a prepayment audit decision 

of the GSA Audit Division?

    No, your agency may not appeal. A GSA Audit Division decision is

give a complete explanation of any amount that is disallowed. GSA will 
forward the certificate to the agency whose funds are to be charged for 
processing and payment.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.615  Will GSA notify a TSP if they internally offset 

a payment?

    Yes, the GSA Audit Division will inform the TSP if they internally 
offset a payment.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.620  How will a TSP know if the GSA Audit Division 

disallows a claim?

    The GSA Audit Division will furnish a GSA Form 7932, Settlement 
Certificate, to the TSP explaining the disallowance.


<R05>

request a review by the Administrator of General Services.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.630  How must a TSP refund amounts due to GSA?

    (a) TSPs must promptly refund amounts due to GSA, preferably by EFT. 
If an EFT is not used, checks must be made payable to ``General Services

    Note to Sec. 102-118.630: Amounts collected by GSA are returned to 
the Treasurer of the United States (31 U.S.C. 3726).

[65 FR 24569, Apr. 26, 2000, as amended at 69 FR 57620, Sept. 24, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.635  Can the Government charge interest on an amount

due from a TSP?

    Yes, the Government can charge interest on an amount due from a TSP. 
This procedure is provided for under the Debt Collection Act (31 U.S.C. 
3717), the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR parts 101 through 
105), and 41 CFR part 105-55.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.640  If a TSP fails to pay or to appeal an overcharge,

what actions will GSA pursue to collect the debt?

    GSA will pursue debt collection through one of the following 
methods:
    (a) When an indebted TSP files a claim, GSA will apply all or any 
portion of the amount it determines to be

[[Page 366]]

due the TSP, to the outstanding balance owed by the TSP, under the 
Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR parts 101 through 105) and 41 
CFR part 105-55;
    (b) When the action outlined in paragraph (a) of this section cannot 
be taken by GSA, GSA will instruct one or more Government disbursing 
offices to deduct the amount due to the agency from an unpaid TSP's 
bill. A 3-year limitation applies on the deduction of overcharges from 
amounts due a TSP (31 U.S.C. 3726) and a 10-year limitation applies on 
the deduction of ordinary debt (31 U.S.C. 3716);
    (c) When collection cannot be accomplished through either of the 
procedures in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, GSA normally sends 
two additional demand letters to the indebted TSP requesting payment of 
the amount due within a specified time. Lacking a satisfactory response, 
GSA may place a complete stop order against amounts otherwise payable to 
the indebted TSP by adding the name of that TSP to the Department of the 
Army ``List of Contractors Indebted to the United States''; and/or
    (d) When collection actions, as stated in paragraphs (a) through (c) 
of this section are unsuccessful, GSA may report the debt to the 
Department of Justice for collection, litigation, and related 
proceedings, as prescribed in 4 CFR parts 101 through 105.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.645  Can a TSP file an administrative claim on collection

actions?

    Yes, a TSP may file an administrative claim involving collection 
actions resulting from the transportation audit performed by the GSA 
directly with the GSA Audit Division. Any claims submitted to GSA will 
be considered ``disputed claims'' under section 4(b) of the Prompt 
Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3901, et seq.). The TSP must file all other 
transportation claims with the agency out of whose activities they 
arose. If this is not feasible (e.g., where the responsible agency 
cannot be determined or is no longer in existence) claims may be sent to 
the GSA Audit Division for forwarding to the responsible agency or for 
direct settlement by the GSA Audit Division. Claims for GSA processing 
must be addressed to:

General Services Administration
Federal Supply Service
Audit Division (FBA)
1800 F Street, NW.
Washington, DC 20405
www.gsa.gov/transaudits

[65 FR 24569, Apr. 26, 2000, as amended at 69 FR 57620, Sept. 24, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.650  Can a TSP request a review of a settlement action 

by the Administrator of General Services?

    Yes, a TSP desiring a review of a settlement action taken by the 
Administrator of General Services may request a review by the GSA Board 
of Contract Appeals (GSBCA) or file a claim with the United States Court 
of Federal Claims (28 U.S.C. 1491).


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.655  Are there time limits on a TSP request for an 

administrative review by the GSBCA?

    (a) Yes, the GSBCA must receive a request for review from the TSP 
within six months (not including time of war) from the date the 
settlement action was taken or within the periods of limitation 
specified in 31 U.S.C. 3726, as amended, whichever is later. The request 
must be addressed to:

GSA Board of Contract Appeals
1800 F Street, NW.
Room 7022
Washington, DC 20405

    (b) The GSBCA will accept legible submissions via facsimile (FAX) on 
(202) 501-0664.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.660  May a TSP appeal a postpayment audit decision of

the GSBCA?

    No, a ruling by the GSBCA is the final administrative remedy and the 
TSP has no statutory right of appeal. This subpart governs 
administrative actions only and does not affect any rights of the TSPs. 
A TSP may still pursue a legal remedy through the courts.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.665  May my agency appeal a postpayment audit decision 

by the GSBCA?

    No, your agency may not appeal a postpayment audit decision and must 
follow the ruling of the GSBCA.

<R05>
Sec. 102-118.670  If a TSP cannot immediately pay a debt, can they

make other arrangements for payment?

    Yes, if a TSP is unable to pay the debt promptly, the Director of 
the GSA Audit Division has the discretion to enter into alternative 
arrangements for payment.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.675  What recourse does my agency have if a TSP does 

not pay a transportation debt?

    If a TSP does not pay a transportation debt, GSA may refer 
delinquent debts to consumer reporting agencies and Federal agencies 
including the Department of the Treasury and Department of Justice.

<R04>
                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 102-173.5  What is Internet GOV Domain?

    Internet GOV Domain refers to the Internet top-level domain ``dot-
gov'' operated by the General Services Administration for the 
registration of U.S. government-related domain names. In general, these 
names reflect the organization names in the Federal Government and non-
Federal government entities in the United States. These names are now 
being used to promote government services and increase the ease of 
finding these services.


<R05>
Sec. 102-173.10  What is the authority or jurisdiction of the 

Internet GOV Domain?

    Jurisdiction of the Internet GOV (dot-gov) domain was delegated to 
the General Services Administration in 1997 by the Federal Networking 
Council with guidance in the form of Internet Engineering Task Force 
(IETF) Informational RFC 2146, which can be obtained on the Internet at: 
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2146.txt?number=2146.


<R05>
Sec. 102-173.15  What is the scope of this part?

    This part addresses the registration of second-level domain names 
used in the Internet GOV Domain. This registration process assures that 
the assigned domain names are unique worldwide.


<R05>
Sec. 102-173.20  To whom does this part apply?

    This part applies to Federal, State, and local governments, and 
Native Sovereign Nations. You do not need to register domain names with 
the General Services Administration if you will be using some other top-
level domain registration, such as dot-us, dot-org, or dot-net.


<R05>
Sec. 102-173.25  What definitions apply to this part?

    The following definitions apply to this part:
    Domain is a region of jurisdiction on the Internet for naming 
assignment.

[[Page 369]]

The General Services Administration (GSA) is responsible for 
registrations in the dot-gov domain.
    Domain name is a name assigned to an Internet server. This is the 
name that you request from GSA. Typically, you would apply this name to 
a domain name server. A domain name locates the organization or other 
entity on the Internet. The dot gov part of the domain name reflects the 
purpose of the organization or entity. This part is called the Top-Level 
Domain name. The Second-Level Domain name to the left of the dot gov 
maps to a readable version of the Internet address. The Domain Name 
server has a registry of Internet Protocol (IP) address numbers that 
relate to the readable text name.
    Domain name server is the computer that provides pointers from the 
domain name to the actual computers.
    Dot-gov refers to domain names ending with a ``.gov'' suffix. The 
Internet GOV domain is another way of expressing the collection of dot-
gov domain names.
    Native Sovereign Nations (NSN) are federally recognized tribes.


<R04>
                         Subpart B_Registration


<R05>
Sec. 102-173.30  Who may register in the dot-gov domain?

    Registration in the dot-gov domain is available to official 
governmental organizations in the United States including Federal, 
State, and local governments, and Native Sovereign Nations.


<R05>
Sec. 102-173.35  Who authorizes domain names?

    Domain names must be authorized by the Chief Information Officer 
(CIO) of the requesting or sponsoring governmental organization. For 
Federal departments and agencies, the General Services Administration 
(GSA) will accept authorization from the CIO of the department or 
agency. For independent Federal government agencies, boards, and 
commissions, GSA will accept authorization from the highest-ranking 
Information Technology Official. For State and local governments, GSA 
will accept authorization from appropriate State or local officials, see 
Sec. 102-173.40.
    For Native Sovereign Nations, GSA will only accept authorization 
from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior. In most 
cases, GSA will not make determinations on the appropriateness of the 
selected domain names, but reserves the right to not assign domain names 
on a case-by-case basis. Non-Federal government domain names must follow 
the naming conventions described in Sec. Sec. 102-173.50 through 102-
173.65. For other government entities, CIO's may delegate this authority 
by notification to GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 102-173.40  Who is my Chief Information Officer (CIO)?

    Your Chief Information Officer (CIO) may vary according to the 
branch of government. For the Federal Government, the General Services 
Administration (GSA) recognizes the cabinet level CIOs listed at http://
www.cio.gov. For States, GSA will accept authorization from the Office 
of the Governor or highest-ranking Information Technology (IT) official. 
Other officials include the Mayor (for city or town), County 
Commissioner (for counties) or highest ranking IT official. Native 
Sovereign Nations (NSN) must receive authorization from the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs. CIOs may delegate this authority by notification to GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 102-173.45  Is there a registration charge for domain names?

    The General Services Administration (GSA) reserves the right to 
charge for domain names in order to recover cost of operations. For 
current registration charges, please visit the GSA Web site at http://
www.nic.gov. GSA does not currently charge a fee. GSA has the authority 
to employ a system of collection that includes a one-time setup fee for 
new registrations, which will not exceed $1000, depending on the level 
of assistance that may be provided by GSA, and a recurring annual charge 
that will not exceed $500 for all dot-gov domains. The fees are based on 
anticipated costs for operating the registration service.


<R05>
Sec. 102-173.50  What is the naming convention for States?

    (a) To register any second-level domain within dot-gov, State 
government

[[Page 370]]

entities must register the full State name or clearly indicate the State 
postal code within the name. Examples of acceptable names include 
virginia.gov, tennesseeanytime.gov, wa.gov, nmparks.gov, mysc.gov, 
emaryland.gov, and ne-taxes.gov. However--
    (1) Use of the State postal code should not be embedded within a 
single word in a way that obscures the postal code. For example, Indiana 
(IN) should not register for win.gov, or independence.gov; and
    (2) Where potential conflicts arise between postal codes and 
existing domain names, States are encouraged to register URL's that 
contain the full State name.
    (b) There is no limit to the number of domain names for which a 
State may register.
    (c) States are encouraged to make second-level domains available for 
third-level registration by local governments and State Government 
departments and programs. For example, the State of North Carolina could 
register NC.GOV as a second-level domain and develop a system of 
registration for their local governments. The State would be free to 
develop policy on how the local government should be registered under 
NC.GOV. One possibility might be to spell out the city, thus 
Raleigh.NC.gov could be a resulting domain name.


<R05>
Sec. 102-173.55  What is the naming convention for Cities and Townships?

    (a) To register any second-level domain within dot-gov, City (town) 
governments must register the domain name with the city (town) name or 
abbreviation, and clear reference to the State in which the city (town) 
is located. However--
    (1) Use of the State postal code should not be embedded within a 
single word in a way that obscures the postal code; and
    (2) Inclusion of the word city or town within the domain name is 
optional and may be used at the discretion of the local government.
    (b)(1) The preferred format for city governments is to denote the 
State postal code after the city name, optionally separated by a dash. 
Examples of preferred domain names include--
    (i) Chicago-il.gov;
    (ii) Cityofcharleston-sc.gov;
    (iii) Charleston-wv.gov;
    (iv) Townofdumfries-va.gov; and
    (v) Detroitmi.gov.
    (2) GSA reserves the right to make exceptions to the naming 
conventions described in this subpart on a case-by-case basis in unique 
and compelling cases.
    (c) If third-level domain naming is used, GSA reserves the right to 
offer exceptions to the third-level domain naming conventions described 
in this section on a case-by-case basis in unique and compelling cases.


<R05>
Sec. 102-173.60  What is the naming convention for Counties or Parishes?

    (a) To register any second-level domain within dot-gov, County or 
Parish governments must register the County's or Parish's name or 
abbreviation, the word ``county'' or ``parish'' (because many counties 
have the same name as cities within the same State), and a reference to 
the State in which the county or parish is located. However, the use of 
the State postal code should not be embedded within a single word in a 
way that obscures the postal code.
    (b) The preferred format for county or parish governments is to 
denote the State postal code after the county or parish, optionally 
separated by a dash. Examples of preferred domain names include--
    (1) Richmondcounty-ga.gov;
    (2) Pwc-county-va.gov; and
    (3) Countyofdorchestor-sc.gov.
    (c) If third-level domain naming is available from the State 
government, counties or parishes are encouraged to register for a domain 
name under a State's registered second-level (e.g., 
richmondcounty.ga.gov).


<R05>
Sec. 102-173.65  What is the naming convention for Native

Sovereign Nations?

    To register any second-level domain in dot-gov, Native Sovereign 
Nations (NSN) may register any second-level domain name provided that it 
contains the registering NSN name followed by

[[Page 371]]

a suffix of ``-NSN.gov'' (case insensitive).


<R05>
Sec. 102-173.70  Where do I register my dot-gov domain name?

    Registration is an online process at the General Services 
Administration's Web site at http://www.nic.gov. At the Network 
Information Site, you will find the instructions and online registration 
forms for registering your domain name. To register your domain name you 
will need to provide information such as your desired domain name, 
sponsoring organization, points of contact, and at least two name server 
addresses.


<R05>
Sec. 102-173.75  How long does the process take?

    The process can be completed within 48 hours if all information 
received is complete and accurate. Most requests take up to thirty (30) 
days because the registrar is waiting for Chief Information Officer 
(CIO) approval.


<R05>
Sec. 102-173.80  How will I know if my request is approved?

    A registration confirmation notice is sent within one business day 
after you register your domain name, informing you that your 
registration information was received. If all of your information is 
accurate and complete, a second notice will be sent to you within one 
business day, informing you that all of your information is in order. If 
you are ineligible, or if the information provided is incorrect or 
incomplete, your registration will be rejected and a notice will be sent 
to you stating the reason for rejection. Registration requests will be 
activated within two business days after receiving valid authorization 
from the appropriate Chief Information Officer (CIO). Once your domain 
name has been activated, a notice will be sent to you.


<R05>
Sec. 102-173.85  How long will my application be held, pending 

approval by the Chief Information Officer (CIO)?

    Registrations will be held in reserve status for sixty (60) days 
pending Chief Information Officer (CIO) authorization from your 
sponsoring organization.


<R05>
Sec. 102-173.90  Are there any special restrictions on the use

and registration of canonical, or category names like recreation.gov?

    Yes, canonical names registration request must provide access 
coverage for the areas conveyed by the name. So the URL recreation.gov 
would not be approved for the state of Maryland, but the URL 
recreationMD.gov would be approved if it provides statewide coverage. 
The logic of the names adds value to the dot gov domain. GSA reserves 
the right deny use of canonical names that do not provide appropriate 
coverage and to arbitrate these issues.


<R05>
Sec. 102-173.95  Are there any restrictions on the use of the

dot-gov domain name?

    The General Services Administration approves domain names for a 
specific term of time, generally two years unless otherwise stated, and 
under conditions of use. General conditions of registration and are 
posted at the registration Web site at http://www.nic.gov and may be 
modified over time. Organizations that operate web sites that are not in 
compliance with the conditions of use may have their domain name 
terminated.

Sec. 102-192.35  What definitions apply to this part?

    The following definitions apply to this part:
    Agency mail manager means the person who manages the overall mail 
communications program of a Federal agency. The agency mail manager also

    (2) First Class.
    (3) Standard Mail (e.g., bulk marketing mail).
    (4) Package Services.
    (5) Periodicals.
    Commingling means the merging of outgoing mail from one facility or 
agency with outgoing mail from at least one other source.
    Expedited mail is a generic term that means mail designated for

by class of mail). Examples of expedited mail include USPS Express Mail 
and overnight and two-day delivery by other service providers.

U.S.C. 2901(14)).

[[Page 374]]

    Federal facility (or facility) means any office building, 
installation, base, etc., where Federal agency employees work; this 
includes any facility where the Federal government pays postage expenses 
even though few Federal employees are involved in processing the mail.
    Incoming mail means any mail that comes into the agency delivered by 
any service provider, such as the USPS, UPS, FedEx, or DHL.
    Internal mail means mail generated within a Federal facility that is 
delivered within that facility or to a nearby facility of the same 
agency, so long as it is delivered by agency personnel or a dedicated 
agency contractor (i.e., not a service provider).
    Large agency means a Federal agency whose total annual mail payments 
to all service providers exceeds $1 million. See appendix A to this part 
for a current list of the large agencies.
    Mail means the types of mail described in Sec. 102-192.30.
    Mail costs means allocations and expenses for postage and all other 
mail costs (e.g., payments to service providers, mail center personnel 
costs, mail center overhead, etc.).
    Mail piece design means laying out and printing items to be mailed 
such that they can be processed efficiently and effectively by automated 
mail-processing equipment.
    Mail system means all of the components of your mail operation 
including your methods for capturing data on your mail users, their 
volumes, and costs. The mail system includes the financial and 
accounting systems. It can be automated, manual or both.
    Official Mail Accounting System (OMAS) is the Postal Service's 
government-unique system used to track postage used by most Federal 
agencies. OMAS is used in conjunction with each agency's online payment 
and accounting system (OPAC) account at the Treasury.
    Outgoing mail means mail generated within a Federal facility that is 
going outside that facility and is delivered by a service provider.
    Postage means money due or paid to any service provider.
    Presort means a mail preparation used to receive a discounted 
mailing rate by sorting mail according to USPS standards.

generates a significant quantity of outgoing mail. It could apply to an 
agency organizational entity, program, or project. (See subpart H of 
this part for additional information.)
    Service provider means any agency or company that delivers mail. 
Some examples of service providers are USPS, UPS, FedEx, DHL, courier 
services, the Military Postal Service Agency, the State Department of 
Diplomatic Pouch and Mail Division and other Federal agencies providing 
mail services.
    Special services means those mail services that require extra 
payment over basic postage; e.g., certified mail, business reply mail, 
registered mail, insurance, merchandise return service, certificates of 
mailing, return receipts, and delivery confirmation.
    Unauthorized use of agency postage means the use of penalty or 
commercial mail stamps, meter impressions, or other postage indicia for 
personal or unofficial use.
    Worksharing means cost-effective ways of processing outgoing mail 
that qualify for reduced postage rates; examples include presorting, bar 
coding, consolidating, and commingling.

    (a) Have written security plans for mail operations at the agency 
level and in any facility where one or more full time personnel 
processes mail.
    (b) Ensure that mail costs are identified at the program level 
within the agency; each agency will have to determine the appropriate 
level for this requirement because the level at which it is cost-
beneficial differs widely. Program level costs can be identified from 
tracking mailing expenses by program areas, cost estimates, financial 
reports, reconciled Postal Service records, and reconciled vendor data.
    (c) Beginning December 31, 2003, all payments to the United States 
Postal Service must be made using commercial payment processes, not 
OMAS.
    (d) Have performance measures for mail operations at the agency 
level and in all subordinate locations that spend more than $250,000 per 
year on postage; it is up to each agency to select the actual 
performance measures used.

<R05>
Sec. 102-192.55  What are the additional requirements for large agencies?

<R04>
                      Subpart D_Security Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 102-192.85  Must I have a mail security plan?

    Every Federal agency and agency location where an agency has one or 
more full time personnel processing mail must implement a written mail 
security plan. The size and scope of the security plan should be 
commensurate with the size and responsibilities of each agency or 
location. The security plan should be updated whenever circumstances 
warrant. As a minimum, it should be reviewed annually.


<R05>
Sec. 102-192.90  What must I include in the mail security plan?

    Your security plan must include polices and procedures for safe and 
secure operations consistent with your agency's core mission. It must 
also include:

<R05>
Sec. 102-192.100  What financial system features does GSA 

recommend for finance systems to keep track of mail costs?

    Agencies should develop or use a financial accountability system 
that separately tracks all mail costs to the program area or below. The 
system should:
    (a) Show allocations and expenses for postage and all other mail 
costs (e.g., payments to service providers, mail center personnel costs, 
mail center overhead, etc.) separate from all other administrative 
expenses;
    (b) Assign control of funds for postage to the same person who has 
overall authority to control mail decisions for the program area;
    (c) Allow mail centers to establish systems to charge their 
customers for postage; and
    (d) Identify and charge mail costs that are part of printing 
contracts to the program level.


<R05>
Sec. 102-192.105  What performance goals and measures should we use?

    Section 102-192.50 requires all large agencies to have performance 
measures for mail operations at the agency level and in all subordinate 
locations that spend more than $250,000 per year on postage. All other 
agencies are also encouraged to identify performance goals and measures 
for incoming and outgoing mail operations. Your performance measurement 
efforts should be focused on the large facilities that generate most of 
your mail. The range of measures will depend on the size of your agency 
or facility, your mission, and the life cycle cost of data collection. 
GSA will provide suggested performance measures through its mail policy 
website.

[[Page 377]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-192.110  What should your agency-wide mail management 

plan include?

    Your agency-wide mail management plan should address:
    (a) The ways in which mail management supports your agency's 
mission;
    (b) Information about your agency's primary facilities;
    (c) Opportunities for reducing costs and/or enhancing your agency's 
ability to perform its mission through better mail management;
    (d) How you choose the lowest cost and/or best value service 
provider(s) for outgoing mail, while ensuring that the Private Express 
Statutes and all USPS regulations are followed;
    (e) Opportunities for centralized mail processing, worksharing, 
consolidation, and commingling to obtain postage savings;
    (f) How and to what extent you will move toward ensuring that the 
person who controls mail decisions is the same person who controls the 
funds for postage;
    (g) How and to what extent you will move toward ensuring that your 
financial systems show allocations and expenses for postage and all 
other mail costs separately from all other administrative expenses; and
    (h) How you are developing specific performance goals, maintaining 
performance data systems and relating mail management goals to your 
agency's mission-related goals.


<R05>
Sec. 102-192.115  What less costly alternatives to expedited 

mail and couriers should your agency-wide mail management
plan address?

    Your plan should address the following alternatives to expedited 
mail and couriers:
    (a) First Class and Priority Mail from the USPS;
    (b) Package delivery services from other service providers; and
    (c) Electronic transmission via e-mail, facsimile transmission, 
electronic commerce, the Internet, etc.


<R04>
             Subpart F_Agency Mail Manager Responsibilities


<R05>
Sec. 102-192.120  What is the appropriate managerial level 

for an agency mail manager?

    The agency mail manager should be at a managerial level that enables 
him or her to fulfill the requirements of Sec. Sec. 102-192.50 through 
102-192.65 and Sec. 102-192.125.


<R05>
Sec. 102-192.125  What are my general responsibilities as an 

agency mail manager?

    In addition to carrying out the responsibilities in Sec. 102-
192.50, an agency mail manager should:
    (a) Establish written policies and procedures to provide timely and 
cost effective dispatch and delivery of mail;
    (b) Ensure agency-wide awareness and compliance with standards and 
operational procedures established by all service providers used by the 
agency;
    (c) Monitor the agency's mailings and other mail management 
activities, especially expedited mail, mass mailings, mailing lists, and 
couriers, and seek opportunities to implement cost-effective 
improvements and/or to enhance performance of the agency's mission;
    (d) Develop and direct agency programs and plans for proper and 
cost-effective use of transportation, equipment, and supplies used for 
mail;
    (e) Although not required for other than large agencies, develop, 
implement and provide to GSA the agency's annual mail management and 
mail security plan (see subpart C of this part);
    (f) Ensure that facility mail managers receive the training they 
need to perform their assigned duties;
    (g) Ensure that users at the program level receive the training 
needed to reduce, track and budget for their mailing expenses;
    (h) Ensure that expedited mail and couriers are used only when 
authorized by the Private Express Statutes (39 U.S.C. 601-606) and when 
necessary and cost-effective;
    (i) Establish written policies and procedures to minimize personal 
mail in incoming, outgoing, and internal agency mail;

[[Page 378]]

    Note to paragraph (i): An agency may decide to accept and process 
personal mail for personnel living on a Federal facility, personnel 
stationed outside the United States, or personnel in other situations 
who would otherwise suffer hardship. Mailing costs associated with 
filing travel vouchers and payment of Government sponsored charge card 
billings are considered as ``incidental expenses'' as defined in the 
``Per Diem Allowance'' in the Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR 300-
3.1).
    (j) Establish and maintain a system that tracks the financial and 
other performance data discussed in Sec. Sec. 102-192.50 and 102-
192.100;
    (k) Work with agency executives to ensure that, to the maximum 
practical extent, the person who makes the decision to mail any 
significant number of pieces of mail is the same person who controls the 
funds for postage;
    (l) Work with agency accounting personnel to ensure that financial 
systems show allocations and expenses for postage and all other mail 
costs separately from all other administrative expenses; and

          Appendix B to Part 102-192--Mail Center Security Plan

                              Introduction

    I. The mail center is a major gateway into any business or 
government agency. Each day, the typical mail center handles hundreds or 
thousands of items from routine letters to confidential documents, high 
value parcels, and even money. Security is critical for this critical 
nerve center. An effective mail center security program should address:

A. Risk Analysis
B. Employee Safety
C. Physical Security
D. Inbound Mail Procedures
E. Postage Security
F. Contractors
G. Continuity of Operations Planning
H. Communications
I. Training
J. Plan Review

    II. Some agencies have satellite locations with no official mail 
centers. Responsibilities for processing mail are divided among 
administrative and support staff. Although the security plan for mail 
operations may be limited for these smaller sites, each of the sections 
A. through J. of the appendix should be adopted when appropriate.
    III. A strong plan supplemented with regular training and reviews 
will help instill a culture that emphasizes the importance of good 
security. Maximize the success of the security plan by involving all 
members of your team--managers, employees, security managers and union 
representatives--during development.

                            A. Risk Analysis

    The first step in effective security is to conduct a risk analysis 
for your mail operation. While there are minimum standards that every 
agency should follow, your particular posture should reflect the mission 
of your agency.

                           B. Employee Safety

    The anthrax attacks reminded us all how important employee safety 
is. We do not know whether there will be another attack, so we should 
take the proper steps to ensure the safety of our employees.
    1. Personal protection equipment should be made available for all 
employees. These include gloves and masks. When using any form of 
respiratory equipment, the manager must make sure that proper OSHA 
standards are met. See appendix D of OSHA's Respiratory Protection 
standard for information about the use of respirators when such use is 
voluntary (29 CFR 1910.134, appendix D).
    2. Also, instruct employees to wash hands regularly with soap and 
water. At a minimum, hands should be washed when gloves are removed, 
before eating, and at the end of a shift.

                          C. Physical Security

    Managers need to address the physical security of the mail center.
    1. Place the mail center in an enclosed room, with defined points of 
entry. Limit access to those employees who work in the mail center, or 
who have immediate need for access, such as known couriers.
    2. Where appropriate, install controlled access equipment; key 
control, card readers or buzz entry are a few options. Additionally, 
each access point should be alarmed and monitored for after hours 
activity. Secure areas, such as safes or locked cabinets, should be 
established inside the mail center for meters, express shipments and 
valuables.
    3. Managers should draft detailed procedures for opening and closing 
the mail center. Logs with checklists should be posted and signed daily.

                       D. Inbound Mail Procedures

    1. The inbound mail operation should be separate from the rest of 
the mail center. All incoming mail should be isolated in an area where 
it can be inspected. Delivery personnel

[[Page 381]]

should have limited access to the facility and should be serviced at a 
counter.
    2. Establish a closed-loop manifest system for all accountable 
letters and packages (e.g., certified mail, UPS, FedEx). Verify the 
delivery manifest sheet to ensure that you have received all packages 
listed. All accountable mail should be signed for whenever possession 
changes. Always require a signature at the final point of delivery. File 
copies of the manifest by date.
    3. If possible, acquire an x-ray machine to scan mail. All mail, 
regardless of carrier, should be x-rayed. If volume does not permit 
this, x-ray all packages.
    4. Mail center employees should be trained to recognize and report 
suspicious packages. Characteristics of a suspicious package or letter 
can vary depending upon the type of mail your operation regularly 
processes (see http://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel01/mail3.pdf for more 
information).

                           E. Postage Security

    Postage theft is a Federal offense and managers should be proactive 
in this area.
    1. Managers should integrate accounting procedures for all forms of 
postage--meters, stamps and permits. Meter logs must be accurately kept, 
and meters should be locked when not in use. Where feasible, the meter 
should be removed from the equipment and stored in a locked cabinet 
during off-hours.
    2. Establish additional controls to ensure proper access and 
accountability for permit envelopes and labels. Controls should be 
established for stamps and other carriers as well.

                             F. Contractors

    Some agencies use contractors to process their mail. This could be 
either an outsource provider that runs your mail center or a lettershop 
that handles your presort. It's important to remember that security of 
the mail is still the responsibility of the agency. Include the key 
points from your security plan in every contract, and conduct periodic 
reviews separate from the contract process.

                  G. Continuity of Operations Planning

    1. Managers should have a written continuity of operations plan 
(COOP) to deal with emergency situations. The plan should include:
    a. Name(s) of Mail Security Coordinator/Response Team
    b. Procedures on how to respond to a threat or incident
    c. Who to contact in the event of an emergency
    d. Location and contents of ``fly-away kit''
    e. Location/phone numbers of backup facility
    f. A list of critical documents and mail required for the agency to 
complete its mission
    2. Copies of this plan should be stored in easily accessible areas, 
including off-site.
    3. Also, you need to test the plan on a quarterly basis. Verify that 
all the information is up-to-date, that contacts, facilities access, and 
the call trees are correct.

                            H. Communications

    A good communications program is part of any successful mail 
operation and is critical for security issues. Make sure that the 
information being shared is factual, not opinion, and verify that it is 
up-to-date.
    1. Schedule regular meetings with a representative from the senior 
management of your agency (Executive Secretariat, Administrator, etc.). 
Review the steps you've taken to secure the mail, and address any 
outstanding issues.
    2. Develop a communications plan to be executed when responding to a 
threat. This plan should cover how to both acquire and distribute 
information. Prepare a list of trusted resources to acquire timely and 
accurate information (e.g., GSA, USPS, CDC, etc.). Organize a protocol 
for the approval and distribution of information on the status of the 
mail operation.

                               I. Training

    Education and awareness are the essential ingredients to 
preparedness. Employees must remain aware of their surroundings and the 
packages they handle. You must carefully design and vigorously monitor 
your security program to reduce the risk for all.
    1. Through training you can develop a culture of security awareness 
in your operation. Essential to ensuring employee confidence in their 
safety is the inclusion of union representatives or other employee 
representatives in developing and giving training. Managers should 
consider security training a critical element of their job.
    2. A complete training program will include:
    a. Basic security procedures;
    b. Recognizing and reporting suspicious packages;
    c. Proper use of personal protection equipment;
    d. Responding to a biological threat; and
    e. Responding to a bomb threat.
    3. Maintain a log of all employees and training attended, including 
the date completed. Follow up with refresher training on a regular 
basis.
    4. In addition to educating the employees who work for you, you must 
educate all employees who work in the facility on best mail practices 
including security measures. Employee awareness of the measures you have 
taken leads to confidence in the safety of the packages that are 
delivered to their desktops.

[[Page 382]]

                             J. Plan Review

    The General Services Administration strongly recommends external 
review of your security plan. This may include a review by a consultant, 
your agency security department, or a peer review.

Sec. 102-194.5  What is the Standard and Optional Forms 

Management Program?

    The Standard and Optional Forms Management Program is a 
Governmentwide program that promotes economies and efficiencies through 
the development, maintenance and use of common forms. The General 
Services Administration (GSA) provides additional guidance on the 
Standard and Optional Forms Management Program through an external 
handbook called Standard and Optional Forms Procedural Handbook. You may

<R05>
Sec. 102-194.10  What is a Standard form?

    A Standard form is a fixed or sequential order of data elements, 
prescribed by a Federal agency through regulation, approved by GSA for 
mandatory use, and assigned a Standard form number. This criterion is 
the same whether the form resides on paper or purely electronic.


<R05>
Sec. 102-194.15  What is an Optional form?

    An Optional form is approved by GSA for nonmandatory Governmentwide 
use and is used by two or more agencies. This criteria is the same 
whether the form resides on paper or purely electronic.


<R05>
Sec. 102-194.20  What is an electronic Standard or Optional form?

    An electronic Standard or Optional form is an officially prescribed 
set of data residing in an electronic medium that is used to produce a 
mirror-like image or as near to a mirror-like image as the creation 
software will allow of the officially prescribed form.


<R05>
Sec. 102-194.25  What is an automated Standard or Optional format?

    An automated Standard or Optional format is an electronic version of 
the officially prescribed form containing the same data elements and 
used for the electronic transaction of information in lieu of using a 
Standard or Optional form.


<R05>
Sec. 102-194.30  What role does my agency play in the Standard and

Optional Forms Management Program?

    Your agency head or designee's role is to:
    (a) Designate an agency-level Standard and Optional Forms Liaison 
representative and alternate, and notify GSA, in writing, of their 
names, titles, mailing addresses, telephone numbers, fax numbers, and e-
mail addresses within 30 days of the designation or redesignation.
    (b) Promulgate Governmentwide Standard forms under the agency's 
statutory or regulatory authority in the Federal Register, and issue 
procedures on the mandatory use, revision, or cancellation of these 
forms.
    (c) Ensure that the agency complies with the provisions of the 
Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA) (Public Law 105-277, 112 
Stat 2681), Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 
74d), as amended, the Architectural and Transportation Barriers 
Compliance Board (Access Board) Standards (36 CFR part 1194), and OMB 
implementing guidance. In particular, agencies should allow the 
submission of Standard and Optional forms in an electronic/automated 
version unless the form is specifically exempted by Sec. 102-194.40.
    (d) Issue Governmentwide Optional forms when needed by two or more 
agencies and announce the availability, revision, or cancellation of 
these forms. Forms prescribed through a regulation for use by the 
Federal Government must be issued as a Standard form.

[[Page 385]]

    (e) Obtain GSA approval for each new, revised or canceled Standard 
and Optional form, 60 days prior to planned implementation. Certify that 
the forms comply with all applicable laws and regulations. Provide an 
electronic form unless exempted by Sec. 102-194.40. Revised forms not 
approved by GSA will result in cancellation of the form.
    (f) Provide GSA with both an electronic (unless exempted by Sec. 
102-194.40) and paper version of the official image of the Standard or 
Optional form prior to implementation.
    (g) Obtain the prescribing agency's approval for exceptions to 
Standard and Optional forms, including electronic forms or automated 
formats prior to implementation.
    (h) Review annually agency prescribed Standard and Optional forms, 
including exceptions, for improvement, consolidation, cancellation, or 
possible automation. The review must include approved electronic 
versions of the forms.
    (i) Coordinate all health-care related Standard and Optional forms 
through GSA for the approval of the Interagency Committee on Medical 
Records (ICMR).
    (j) Promote the use of electronic forms within the agency by 
following what the Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA) 
prescribes and all guidance issued by the Office of Management and 
Budget and other responsible agencies. This guidance will promote the 
use of electronic transactions and electronic signatures.
    (k) Notify GSA of the replacement of any Standard or Optional form 
by an automated format or electronic form, and its impact on the need to 
stock the paper form. GSA's approval is not necessary for this change, 
but a one-time notification should be made.
    (l) Follow the specific instructions in the Standard and Optional 
Forms Procedural Handbook.


<R05>
Sec. 102-194.35  Should I create electronic Standard or Optional forms?

    Yes, you should create electronic Standard or Optional forms, 
especially when forms are used to collect information from the public. 
GSA will not approve a new or revision to a Standard or Optional form 
unless an electronic form is being made available. Only forms covered by 
Sec. 102-194.40 are exempt from this requirement. Furthermore, you 
should to the extent possible, use electronic form products and services 
that are based on open standards. However, the use of proprietary 
products is permitted, provided that the end user is not required to 
purchase a specific product or subscription to use the electronic 
Standard or Optional form.


<R05>
Sec. 102-194.40  For what Standard or Optional forms should an 

electronic version not be made available?

    All forms should include an electronic version unless it is not 
practicable to do so. Areas where it may not be practicable include 
where the form has construction features for specialized use (e.g., 
labels), to prevent unauthorized use or could otherwise risk a security 
violation, (e.g., classification cover sheets), or require unusual 
production costs (e.g., specialized paper or envelopes). Such forms can 
be made available as an electronic form only if the originating agency 
approves an exception to do so. (See the Standard and Optional Forms 
Procedural Handbook for procedures and a list of these forms).


<R05>
Sec. 102-194.45  Who should I contact about Standard and Optional forms?

    For Standard and Optional forms, you should contact the:

<R05>
Sec. 105-1.000-50  Scope of part.

    This part describes the method by which the General Services 
Administration (GSA) implements and supplements the Federal Property 
Management Regulations (FPMR) and implements certain regulations 
prescribed by other agencies. It contains procedures that implement and 
supplement part 101-1 of the FPMR.


<R04>
                   Subpart 105	1.1_Regulations System


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.100  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart establishes the General Services Administration 
Property Management Regulations (GSPMR) and provides certain 
introductory material.


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.101  General Services Administration Property 

Management Regulations.

    The General Services Administration Property Management Regulations 
(GSPMR) include the GSA property management policies and procedures 
which, together with the Federal Property Management Regulations, 
certain regulations prescribed by other agencies, and various GSA orders 
govern the management of property and records and certain related 
activities of GSA. They may contain policies and procedures of interest 
to other agencies and the general public and are prescribed by the 
Administrator of General Services in this chapter 105.


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.101-50  Exclusions.

    (a) Certain GSA property management and related policies and 
procedures which come within the scope of this chapter 105 nevertheless 
may be excluded therefrom when there is justification. These exclusions 
may include the following categories:
    (1) Subject matter that bears a security classification;
    (2) Policies and procedures that are expected to be effective for a 
period of less than 6 months;
    (3) Policies and procedures that are effective on an experimental 
basis for a reasonable period;
    (4) Policies and procedures pertaining to other functions of GSA as 
well as property management functions and there is need to make the 
issuance available simultaneously to all GSA employees involved; and
    (5) Where speed of issuance is essential, numerous changes are 
required in chapter 105, and all necessary changes cannot be made 
promptly.
    (b) Property management policies and procedures issued in other than 
the FPMR system format under paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) of this section, 
shall be codified into chapter 105 at the earliest practicable date, but 
in any event not later than 6 months from date of issuance.


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.102  Relationship of GSPMR to FPMR.

    (a) GSPMR implement and supplement the FPMR and implement certain 
other regulations. They are part of the General Services Administration 
Regulations System. Material published in the FPMR (which has 
Governmentwide applicability) becomes effective throughout GSA upon the 
effective date of the particular FPMR material. In general, the FPMR 
that are implemented and supplemented shall not be repeated, 
paraphrased, or otherwise restated in chapter 105.
    (b) Implementing is the process of expanding upon the FPMR or other 
Government-wide regulations.

[[Page 390]]

Supplementing is the process of prescribing material for which there is 
no counterpart in the Government-wide regulations.
    (c) GSPMR may deviate from the regulations that are implemented when 
a deviation (see Sec. 105-1.110) is authorized in and explicitly 
referenced to such regulations. Where chapter 105 contains no material 
implementing the FPMR, the FPMR shall govern.


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.104  Publication of GSPMR.

    (a) Most GSPMR are published in the Federal Register. This practice 
helps to ensure that interested business concerns, other agencies, and 
the public are apprised of GSA policies and procedures pertaining to 
property and records management and certain related activities.
    (b) Most GSPMR are published in cumulative form in chapter 105 of 
title 41 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The Federal Register and 
title 41 of the Code of Federal Regulations may be purchased from the 
Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, 
D.C. 20402.


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.106  Applicability.

    Chapter 105 applies to the management of property and records and to 
certain other programs and activities of GSA. Unless otherwise 
specified, chapter 105 applies to activities outside as well as within 
the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.109  Numbering.


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.109-50  General plan.

    Chapter 105 is divided into parts, subparts, and further 
subdivisions as necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.109-51  Arrangement.

    (a) Parts 105-2 through 105-49 are used for GSPMR that implement 
regulations in the corresponding parts of chapter 101. This practice 
results in comparable grouping by subject area without establishment of 
subchapters.
    (b) Parts 105-50 and above are used for GSPMR that supplement 
regulations in the FPMR and implement regulations of other agencies. 
Part numbers are assigned so as to accomplish a similar subject area 
grouping. Regulations on advisory committee management are recodified as 
part 105-54 to place them in the appropriate subject area category. 
Regulations on standards of conduct remain in part 105-735 because the 
number 735 identifies regulations of the U.S. Civil Service Commission 
and various civil agencies on this subject.


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.109-52  Cross-references.

    (a) Within chapter 105, cross-references to the FPMR shall be made 
in the same manner as used within the FPMR. Illustrations of cross-
references to the FPMR are:
    (1) Part 101-3;
    (2) Subpart 101-3.1;
    (3) Sec. 101-3.413-5.
    (b) Within chapter 105, cross-references to parts, subparts, 
sections, and subsections of chapter 105 shall be made in a manner 
generally similar to that used in making cross-references to the FPMR. 
For example, this paragraph would be referenced as Sec. 105-1.109-
52(b).


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.110  Deviation.

    (a) In the interest of establishing and maintaining uniformity to 
the greatest extent feasible, deviations; i.e., the use of any policy or 
procedure in any manner that is inconsistent with a policy or procedure 
prescribed in the Federal Property Management Regulations, are 
prohibited unless such deviations have been requested from and approved 
by the Administrator of General Services or his authorized designee. 
Deviations may be authorized by the Administrator of General Services or 
his authorized designee when so doing will be in the best interest of 
the Government. Request for deviations shall clearly state the nature of 
the deviation and the reasons for such special action.
    (b) Requests for deviations from the FPMR shall be sent to the 
General Services Administration for consideration in accordance with the 
following:
    (1) For onetime (individual) deviations, requests shall be sent to 
the address provided in the applicable regulation. Lacking such 
direction, requests shall be sent to the Administrator of General 
Services, Washington, DC 20405.

[[Page 391]]

    (2) For class deviations, requests shall be sent to only the 
Administrator of General Services.

[55 FR 1673, Jan. 18, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.150  Citation.

    (a) In formal documents, such as legal briefs, citations of chapter 
105 material shall include a citation to title 41 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations or other titles as appropriate; e.g., 41 CFR 105-1.150.
    (b) Any section of chapter 105, for purpose of brevity, may be 
informally identified as ``GSPMR'' followed by the section number. For 
example, this paragraph would be identified as ``GSPMR 105-1.150(b).''

requirements for the programs or activities of licenses or certified 
entities that subject qualified individuals with handicaps to 
discrimination on the basis of handicap. However, the programs or 
activities of entities that are licensed or certified by the agency are 
not, themselves, covered by part.

<R05>
Sec. 105-8.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.


<R05>
Sec. 105-8.150-1  General.

    The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the 
program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible 
to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This section does not--
    (a) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps; or
    (b) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the 
agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment 
of significant historic features of an historic property.


<R05>
Sec. 105-8.150-2  Methods.

    (a) General. The agency may comply with the requirements of Sec. 
105-8.150 through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of 
services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, 
home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, 
alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, 
use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in 
making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. The agency is not required to make 
structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are 
effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in 
making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility 
requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations 
implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the 
requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those 
methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with 
handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (b) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 105-8.105-1 in historic preservation programs, the agency shall 
give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals 
with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to a historic 
property is not required because of Sec. Sec. 105-8.105-1(b) or 105-
8.154 alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include--
    (1) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those 
portions of a historic property that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible;
    (2) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or 
through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible; or
    (3) Adopting other innovative methods.


<R05>
Sec. 105-8.150-3  Time period for compliance.

to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to 
interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or 
organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in 
the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral 
and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for 
public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (a) Identify physical obstacles in the facilities occupied by GSA 
that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to 
individuals with handicaps;

[[Page 396]]

    (b) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (c) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with Sec. 105-8.150 and, if the time period of the

in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this 
section.


<R05>
Sec. 105-8.152  Program accessibility: Assignment of space.

    (a) When GSA assigns or reassigns space to an agency, it shall 
consult with the agency to ensure that the assignment or reassignment 
will not result in one or more of the agency's programs or activities 
being inaccessible to individuals with handicaps.
    (b) Prior to the assignment or reassignment of space to an agency, 
GSA shall inform the agency of the accessibility, and/or the absence of 
accessibility features, of the space in which GSA intends to locate the 
agency. If the agency informs GSA that the use of the space will result 
in one or more of the agency's programs being inaccessible, GSA shall 
take one or more of the following actions to make the programs 
accessible:
    (1) Arrange for alterations, improvements, and repairs to buildings 
and facilities;
    (2) Locate and provide alternative space that will not result in one 
or more of the agency's programs being inaccessible; or
    (3) Take any other actions that result in making this agency's 
programs accessible.

The responsibility for payment to make the physical changes in the space 
shall be assigned on a case-by-case basis as agreed to by GSA and the 
user agency, dependent on individual circumstances.
    (c) GSA may not require the agency to accept space that results in 
one or more of the agency's programs being inaccessible.

Sec. 105-8.153-1  General.

    GSA, upon request from an occupant agency engaged in the development 
of a transition plan under section 504, shall participate with the 
occupant agency in the development and implementation of the transition 
plan and shall provide information and guidance to the occupant agency. 
Upon request, GSA shall conduct space inspections to assist the agency 
in determining whether a current assignment of space results in one or 
more of the occupant agency's programs or activities being inaccessible. 
GSA shall provide the occupant agency with a written summary of 
significant findings and recommendations, together with data concerning 
programmed repairs and alterations planned by GSA and alterations that 
can be effected by the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 105-8.153-2  Requests from occupant agencies.

    (a) Upon receipt of an occupant agency's request for new space, 
additional space, relocation to accessible space, alterations, or other 
actions under GSA's control that are needed to ensure program 
accessibility in the requesting agency's program(s) as required by the 
agency's section 504 transition plan, GSA shall assist or advise the 
requesting agency in providing or arranging for the requested action 
within the timeframes specified in the requesting agency's transition 
plan.
    (b) If the requested action cannot be completed within the time 
frame specified in an agency's transition plan, GSA shall so advise the 
requesting agency within 30 days of the request by submitting, after 
consultation with the agency, a revised schedule specifying the date by 
which the action shall be

[[Page 397]]

completed. If the delay in completing the action results in or continues 
the inaccessibility of the requesting agency's program, GSA and the 
agency shall, after consultation, take interim measures to make the 
agency's program accessible.
    (c) If GSA determines that it is unable to take the requested 
action, GSA shall--
    (1) Within 30 days, set forth in writing to the requesting agency 
the reasons for denying the agency's request, and
    (2) Within 90 days, propose to the requesting agency other methods 
for making the agency's program accessible.
    (d) Receipt of a copy of an occupant agency's transition plan under 
section 504 shall constitute notice to GSA of the requested actions in 
the transition plan and of the times frames which the actions are 
required to be completed.


<R05>
Sec. 105-8.154  Program accessibility: Exceptions.

    Sections 105-8.150, 105-8.152, and 105-8.153 do not require GSA to 
take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental 
alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial 
and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where GSA personnel 
believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program 
or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative 
burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance would 
result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would 
result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Administrator 
or his or her designee after considering all resources available for use 
in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and 
must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching 
that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in 
such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that 
individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the 
program or activity.

entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
individual with handicaps.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate 
with persons with impaired hearing.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 150.8.160 would 
result in such alteration or burdens.

[[Page 398]]

The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens 
must be made by the Administrator or his or her designee after 
considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and 
operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied 
by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If 
an action required to comply with Sec. 105-8.160 would result in such 
an alteration or such burdnes, the agency shall take any other action 
that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would 
nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals 
with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or 
activity.

    (a) This part 105-50 implements the provisions of Title III of the 
Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968 (82 Stat. 1102, 42 U.S.C.

    It is the purpose of this title to encourage intergovernmental 
cooperation in the conduct of specialized or technical services and 
provision of facilities essential to the administration of State or 
local governmental activities, many of which are nationwide in scope and 
financed in part by Federal funds; to enable state and local governments 
to avoid unnecessary duplication of special service functions; and to

subdivisions thereof, and combinations or associations of such 
governments or their agencies and instrumentalities.
    (b) Such services will be provided only upon the written request of 
a State or political subdivision thereof. Requests normally will be made 
by the chief executives of such entities and will be addressed to the

    (c) Such services will not be provided unless GSA is providing 
similar services for its own use under the policies set forth in the 
Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-76 Revised, dated August 
30, 1967, subject: Policies for acquiring commercial or industrial 
products and services for Government use. In addition, in accordance 
with the policies set forth in Circular No. A-76, the requesting entity 
must certify that such services cannot be procured reasonably and 
expeditiously through ordinary business channels.
    (d) Such services will not be provided if they require any additions 
of staff or

[[Page 404]]

involve outlays for additional equipment or other facilities solely for 
the purpose of providing such services, except where the costs thereof 
are charged to the user of such services. Further, no staff additions 
may be made which impede the implementation of, or adherence to, the 
employment ceilings contained in the Office of Management and Budget 
allowance letters.
    (e) Such services will be provided only upon payment or provision 
for reimbursement by the unit of government making the request of 
salaries and all other identifiable direct and indirect costs of 
performing such services. For cost determination purposes, GSA will be 
guided by the policies set forth in the Office of Management and Budget 
Circular No. A-25, dated September 23, 1959, subject: User charges.

Administration, shall serve as the central coordinator for such 
inquiries and shall assign them to the appropriate organizational 
element of GSA for expeditious handling.

<R05>
Sec. 105-50.301  Established fees.

developed and promulgated in conjunction with the Office of 
Administration. The fees so established shall cover all direct costs, 
such as salaries of personnel involved plus personnel benefits, travel, 
and other related expenses and all indirect costs such as management, 
supervisory, and staff support expenses determined or estimated from the 
best available records in GSA. Periodically, fees shall be reviewed for

basis, upon receipt of a request from a State or local government for 
such services, a written reply shall be prepared by the service or staff 
office receiving the request stating the basis for reimbursement for the 
services to be performed. The proposal shall be based on an estimate of 
all direct costs, such as salaries of personnel involved plus personnel 
benefits, travel, and other related expenses and on such indirect costs 
as management, supervisory, and staff support expenses. An appropriate 
surcharge may be developed to recover these indirect costs. The terms 
thereof shall be concurred in by the Director of Administration. 
Acceptance in writing by the requester shall constitute a binding 
agreement between GSA and the requesting governmental unit.


<R05>
Sec. 105-50.304  Services provided through revolving funds.

    Where the service furnished is of the type which GSA is now billing 
through revolving funds, reimbursement shall be obtained from State and 
local governments on the same basis; i.e., the same pricing method, 
billing forms, and billing support shall be used.


<R05>
Sec. 105-50.304a  Deposits.

    Reimbursements to GSA for furnishing special or technical services 
to State and local units of government will be deposited to the credit 
of the appropriation from which the cost of providing such services has 
been paid or is to be charged if such reimbursements are authorized. 
Otherwise, the reimbursements will be credited to miscellaneous receipts 
in the U.S. Treasury (42 U.S.C. 4223).


<R05>
Sec. 105-50.305  Exemptions.

    (a) Single copies of existing reports covering studies and

105-54.401 Reports on GSA Federal Advisory Committees.

    Authority: Pub. L. 92-463 dated October 6, 1972, as amended; and 5 
U.S.C. 552.

<R05>
Sec. 105-54.000  Scope of part.

    This part sets forth policies and procedures in GSA regarding the 
establishment, operation, termination, and control of advisory 
committees for which GSA has responsibility. It implements the Federal 
Advisory Committee Act (Pub. L. 92-463), which authorizes a system 
governing the establishment and operation of advisory committees in the 
executive branch of the Federal Government, and Executive Order 11686 of 
October 7, 1972, which directs the heads of all executive departments 
and agencies to take appropriate action to ensure their ability to 
comply with the provisions of the Act.


<R04>
                   Subpart 105	54.1_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.101  Applicability.

    This part 105-54 applies to all advisory committees for which GSA 
has responsibility. This part also applies to any committee that advises 
GSA officials even if the committee were not established for that 
purpose. This applicability, however, is limited to the period of the 
committee's use as an advisory body. This part does not apply to:
    (a) An advisory committee exempted by an Act of Congress;
    (b) A local civic group whose primary function is to render a public 
service in connection with a Federal program;
    (c) A State or local committee, council, board, commission, or 
similar group established to advise or make recommendations to State or 
local officials or agencies;
    (d) A meeting initiated by the President or one or more Federal 
official(s) for the purpose of obtaining advice or recommendations from 
one individual;
    (e) A meeting with a group initiated by the President or one or more 
Federal official(s) for the sole purpose of exchanging facts or 
information;
    (f) A meeting initiated by a group with the President or one or more 
Federal official(s) for the purpose of expressing the group's views, 
provided that the President or Federal official(s) does not use the 
group recurrently as a preferred source of advice or recommendations;
    (g) A committee that is established to perform primarily operational 
as opposed to advisory functions. Operational functions are those 
specifically provided by law, such as making or implementing Government 
decisions or policy. An operational committee would be covered by the 
Act if it becomes primarily advisory in nature;
    (h) A meeting initiated by a Federal official(s) with more than one 
individual for the purpose of obtaining the advice of individual 
attendees and not for the purpose of utilizing the group to obtain 
consensus advice or recommendations. However, such a group would be 
covered by the Act when an agency accepts the group's deliberations as a 
source of consensus advice or recommendations;
    (i) A meeting of two or more advisory committee or subcommittee 
members convened solely to gather information or conduct research for a 
chartered advisory committee, to analyze relevant issues and facts, or 
to draft proposed position papers for deliberation by the advisory 
committee or a subcommittee of the advisory committee; and
    (j) A committee composed wholly of full-time officers or employees 
of the Federal Government.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.102  Definitions.

    (a) The term ``advisory committee'' means any committee, board, 
commission, council, conference, panel, task force, or other similar 
group or any subcommittee thereof that is:
    (1) Established by statute,
    (2) Established or utilized by the President, or
    (3) Established or utilized by any agency official to obtain advice 
or recommendations that are within the scope of his/her responsibilies.

The term ``advisory committee'' excludes the Advisory Committee on 
Intergovernmental Relations and any

[[Page 416]]

committees composed wholly of full-time officers or employees of the 
Federal Government.
    (b) ``Presidential advisory committee'' means any committee that 
advises the President. It may be established by the President or by the 
Congress, or may be used by the President to obtain advice or 
recommendations.
    (c) ``Independent Presidential advisory committee'' means any 
Presidential advisory committee not assigned by the President, or the 
President's delegate, or by the Congress in law, to an agency for 
administrative and other support and for which the Administrator of 
General Services may provide administrative and other support on a 
reimbursable basis.
    (d) ``Committee member'' means an individual who serves by 
appointment on a committee and has the full right and obligation to 
participate in the activities of the committee, including voting on 
committee recommendations.
    (e) ``Staff member'' means any individual who serves in a support 
capacity to an advisory committee.
    (f) ``Secretariat'' means the General Services Administration's 
Committee Management Secretariat. Established pursuant to the Federal 
Advisory Committee Act, it is responsible for all matters relating to 
advisory committees, and carries out the Administrator's 
responsibilities under the Act and Executive Order 12024.
    (g) ``Utilized'' (or used), as stated in the definition of 
``advisory committee'' above, refers to a situation in which a GSA 
official adopts a committee or other group composed in whole or in part 
of other than full-time Federal officers or employees with an 
established existence outside GSA as a preferred source from which to 
obtain advice or recommendations on a specific issue or policy within 
the scope of his/her responsibilities in the same manner as that 
official would obtain advice or recommendations from an established 
advisory committee.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.103  Policy.

    The basic GSA policy on committee management is as follows:
    (a) Advisory committees will be formed or used by GSA only when 
specifically authorized by law, or by the President, or specifically 
determined as a matter of formal record by the Administrator of General 
Services to be in the public interest in connection with the performance 
of duties imposed on GSA by law;
    (b) Advisory committees will not be used to administer a function 
that is the assigned responsibility of a service or staff office;
    (c) The assigned responsibility of a GSA official may not be 
delegated to any committee;
    (d) No advisory committee may be used for functions that are not 
solely advisory unless specifically authorized by statute or 
Presidential directive. Making policy decisions and determining action 
to be taken with respect to any matter considered by an advisory 
committee is solely the responsibility of GSA; and
    (e) In carrying out its responsibilities, GSA will consult with and 
obtain the advice of interested groups substantially affected by its 
programs. The use of advisory committees for this purpose is considered 
to be in the public interest and necessary for the proper performance by 
GSA of its assigned functions.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.104  Responsibilities.

    (a) Responsibility for coordination and control of committee 
management in GSA is vested in the Associate Administrator for 
Administration, who serves as the GSA Committee Management Officer 
(CMO). This Officer carries out the functions prescribed in section 8(b) 
of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. In doing so, the Officer controls 
and supervises the establishment, procedures, and accomplishments of 
GSA-sponsored advisory committees. The Organization and Productivity 
Improvement Division, Office of Management Services, Office of 
Administration, provides staff resources and furnishes the Staff Contact 
Person (SCP) to the CMO.
    (b) The Head of each Service and Staff Office and each Regional 
Administrator selects a Committee Management Officer (CMO) to coordinate 
and control committee management within the service, staff office, or 
regional office and to act as liaison to the GSA

[[Page 417]]

Committee Management Officer. The duties of the CMOs are as follows:
    (1) Assemble and maintain the reports, records, and other papers of 
any GSA-sponsored committee during its existence (Arrangements may be 
made, however, for the Government chairperson or other GSA 
representative to retain custody of reports, records, and other papers 
to facilitate committee operations. After the committee is terminated, 
all committee records are disposed of following existing regulations.); 
and
    (2) Under agency regulations in 41 CFR 105-60, carry out the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552 with respect to the reports, records, and 
other papers of GSA-sponsored advisory committees.


<R04>
          Subpart 105	54.2_Establishment of Advisory Committees


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.200  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes the policy and procedures for establishing 
advisory committees within GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.201  Proposals for establishing advisory committees.

    (a) The Administrator approves the establishment of all GSA Federal 
Advisory Committees.
    (b) When it is decided that it is necessary to establish a 
committee, the appropriate Head of the Service or Staff Office (HSSO) 
must consider the functions of similar committees in GSA to ensure that 
no duplication of effort will occur.
    (c) The HSSO proposes the establishment of a Central Office or 
regional advisory committee within the scope of assigned program 
responsibilities. In doing so, the HSSO assures that advisory committees 
are established only if they are essential to the conduct of agency 
business. Advisory committees are established only if there is a 
compelling need for the committees, the committees have a truly balanced 
membership, and the committees conduct their business as openly as 
possible under the law and their mandate. Each proposal is submitted to 
the GSA Committee Management Officer for review and coordination and 
includes:
    (1) A letter addressed to the Committee Management Secretariat 
signed by the HSSO with information copies for the Administrator, Deputy 
Administrator, the Associate Administrator for Congressional and 
Industry Relations, and the Special Counsel for Ethics and Civil Rights, 
describing the nature and purpose of the proposed advisory committee; 
why it is essential to agency business and in the public interest; why 
its functions cannot be performed by an existing committee of GSA, by 
GSA, or other means such as a public hearing; and the plans to ensure 
balanced membership;
    (2) A notice for publication in the Federal Register containing the 
Administrator's certification that creation of the advisory committee is 
in the public interest and describing the nature and purpose of the 
committee; and
    (3) A draft charter for review by the Committee Management 
Secretariat.
    (d) Subcommittees that do not function independently of the full or 
parent advisory committee need not follow the requirements of paragraph 
(c) of this section. However, they are subject to all other requirements 
of the Federal Advisory Committee Act.
    (e) The requirements of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section 
apply to any subcommittee of a chartered committee, whether its members 
are drawn in whole or in part from the full or parent advisory 
committee, that functions independently of the parent advisory 
committee, such as by making recommendations directly to a GSA official 
rather than for consideration by the chartered advisory committee.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.202  Review and approval of proposals.

    (a) The GSA Committee Management Officer reviews each proposal to 
make sure it conforms with GSA policies and procedures. The Officer 
sends the letter of justification, including the draft charter, to the 
Committee Management Secretariat. The Secretariat reviews the proposal 
and provides its views within 15 calendar days of receipt, if possible. 
The Administrator retains final authority for establishing a particular 
advisory committee.

[[Page 418]]

    (b) When the Secretariat notifies the Officer that establishing the 
committee conforms with the Federal Advisory Committee Act, the Officer 
obtains the Administrator's approval of the charter and the Federal 
Register notice. The Officer publishes the notice in the Federal 
Register at least 15 calendar days before the filing of the charter 
under Sec. 105-54.203 with the standing committees of the Senate and 
the House of Representatives having legislative jurisdiction over GSA. 
The date of filing constitutes the date of establishment.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.203  Advisory committee charters.

    No advisory committee may operate, meet, or take any action until 
the Administrator approves its charter and the Committee Management 
Officer sends a copy of it to the standing committees of the Senate and 
the House of Representatives having legislative jurisdiction over GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.203-1  Preparation of charters.

    Each committee charter contains the following information:
    (a) The committee's official designation;
    (b) The committee's objectives and the scope of its activities;
    (c) The period of time necessary for the committee to carry out its 
purpose (if the committee is intended to function as a standing advisory 
committee, this should be made clear);
    (d) The official to whom the committee reports, including the 
official's name, title, and organization;
    (e) The agency and office responsible for providing the necessary 
support for the committee;
    (f) A description of the duties for which the committee is 
responsible (if the duties are not solely advisory, the statutory or 
Presidential authority for additional duties shall be specified);
    (g) The estimated annual operating costs in dollars and person-years 
for the committee;
    (h) The estimated number and frequency of committee meetings;
    (i) The committee's termination date, if it is less than 2 years 
from the date of its establishment; and
    (j) The date the charter is filed. This date is inserted by the GSA 
Committee Management Officer after the Administrator approves the 
charter.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.203-2  Active charters file.

    The GSA Committee Management Officer retains each original signed 
charter in a file of active charters.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.203-3  Submission to Library of Congress.

    The GSA Committee Management Officer furnishes a copy of each 
charter to the Library of Congress when or shortly after copies are 
filed with the requisite committees of the Congress. Copies for the 
Library are addressed: Library of Congress, Exchange and Gift Division, 
Federal Documents Section, Federal Advisory Committee Desk, Washington, 
DC 20540.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.204  Advisory committee membership.

    (a) Advisory committees that GSA establishes represent the points of 
view of the profession, industry, or other group to which it relates, 
taking into account the size, function, geographical location, 
affiliation, and other considerations affecting the character of a 
committee. To ensure balance, the agency considers for membership a 
cross-section of interested persons and groups with professional or 
personal qualifications or experience to contribute to the functions and 
tasks to be performed. This should be construed neither to limit the 
participation nor to compel the selection of any particular individual 
or group to obtain different points of view relevant to committee 
business. The Administrator designates members, alternates, and 
observers, as appropriate, of advisory committees. He/she designates a 
Federal officer or employee to chair or attend each meeting of each 
advisory committee. The Administrator also designates GSA employees to 
serve on advisory committees sponsored by other Government agencies. The 
HSSO or Regional Administrator submits nominations and letters of 
designation for the Administrator's signature to

[[Page 419]]

the GSA Committee Management Officer and to the Special Counsel for 
Ethics and Civil Rights for review and forwarding to the Administrator.
    (b) Discrimination is prohibited on the basis of race, color, age, 
national origin, religion, sex, or mental and physical handicap in 
selecting advisory committee members.
    (c) Nominees for membership must submit a Statement of Employment 
and Financial Interests (provided to the nominee by the HSSO or Regional 
Administrator) and may not be appointed until cleared by the Designated 
Agency Ethics Official.


<R04>
             Subpart 105	54.3_Advisory Committee Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.300  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart sets forth the procedures that will be followed in the 
operation of advisory committees within GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.301  Meetings.

    (a) Each GSA advisory committee meeting is open to the public unless 
the Administrator decides otherwise;
    (b) Each meeting is held at a reasonable time and in a place 
reasonably accessible to the public;
    (c) The meeting room size is sufficient to accommodate committee 
members, committee or GSA staff, and interested members of the public;
    (d) Any private citizen is permitted to file a written statement 
with the advisory committee;
    (e) Any private citizen is permitted to speak at the advisory 
committee meeting, at the chairperson's discretion;
    (f) All persons attending committee meetings at which classified 
information will be considered are required to have an adequate security 
clearance;
    (g) The Designated Federal Officer (who may be either full time or 
permanent part-time) for each advisory committee and its subcommittees 
does the following:
    (1) Approves or calls the meetings of the advisory committee;
    (2) Approves the meeting agenda, which lists the matters to be 
considered at the meeting and indicates whether any part of the meeting 
will be closed to the public under the Government in the Sunshine Act (5 
U.S.C. 552b(c)). Ordinarily, copies of the agenda are distributed to 
committee members before the date of the meeting;
    (3) Attends all meetings (no part of a meeting may proceed in the 
Designated Federal Officer's absence);
    (4) Adjourns the meeting when he or she determines that adjournment 
is in the public interest; and
    (5) Chairs the meeting when asked to do so.
    (h) The Committee Chairperson makes sure that detailed minutes of 
each meeting are kept and certifies to their accuracy. The minutes 
include:
    (1) Time, date, and place;
    (2) A list of the following persons who were present;
    (i) Advisory committee members and staff;
    (ii) Agency employees; and
    (iii) Private citizens who presented oral or written statements;
    (3) The estimated number of private citizens present;
    (4) An accurate description of each matter discussed and the 
resolution of the matter, if any; and
    (5) Copies of each report or other document the committee received, 
issued, or approved.
    (i) The responsible HSSO or the Regional Administrator publishes at 
least 15 calendar days before the meeting a notice in the Federal 
Register that includes:
    (1) The name of the advisory committee as chartered;
    (2) The time, date, place, and purpose of the meeting;
    (3) A summary of the agenda; and
    (4) A statement whether all or part of the meeting is open to the 
public of closed; and if closed, the reasons why, and citing the 
specific exemptions of the Government is the Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C. 
552b) as the basis for closure;
    (j) In exceptional circumstances and when approved by the General 
Counsel or designee, less than 15 calendar days notice may be given, 
provided the reasons for doing so are included in the committee meeting 
notice published in the Federal Register;
    (k) Notices to be published in the Federal Register are submitted to 
the Federal Register Liaison Officer

[[Page 420]]

(CAID). At least five workdays are needed for printing of the notice;
    (l) Meetings may also be announced by press release, direct mail, 
publication in trade and professional journals, or by notice to special 
interest and community groups affected by the Committee's deliberations. 
This procedure cannot be a substitute for Federal Register publication;
    (m) The fact that a meeting may be closed to the public under the 
exemptions of the Government in the Sunshine Act does not relieve GSA of 
the requirement to publish a notice of it in the Federal Register. The 
Administrator may authorize an exception to this requirement for reasons 
of national security if the HSSO requests it at least 30 calendar days 
before the meeting, with the concurrence of the General Counsel of 
designee.
    (n) An advisory committee meeting is not open to the public, nor is 
the attendance, appearance, or filing of statements by interested 
persons permitted, if the Administrator decides that the meeting is 
exempted under the Government in the Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C. 552b (c)) 
and there is sufficient reason to invoke the exemption. If only part of 
the meeting concerns exempted matters, only that part is closed. The 
HSSO or Regional Administrator submits any decisions concerning the 
closing of meetings in writing to the Administrator for approval at 
least 30 calendar days in advance of the meeting. These decisions 
clearly set forth the reasons for doing so, citing the specific 
exemptions used from the Government in the Sunshine Act in the meeting 
notice published in the Federal Register. They are made available to the 
public on request. The Administrator may waive the 30-day requirement 
when a lesser period of time is requested and adequately justified.
    (o) If any meeting or portion of a meeting is closed to public 
attendance, the advisory committee issues a report at lease annually 
setting forth a summary of its activities and such related matters as 
would be informative to the public, consistent with the policy of 5 
U.S.C. 552(b). Notice of the availability of the report and instructions 
on how to gain access to it are published in the Federal Register no 
later than 60 days after its completion. In addition, copies of the 
report are filed with the Library of Congress.
    (p) The General Counsel reviews all requests to close meetings.
    (q) The HSSO or Regional Administrator publishes the meeting notices 
in the Federal Register, including the reasons why all or part of the 
meeting is closed, citing the specified exemptions used from the 
Government in the Sunshine Act.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.302  Committee records and reports.

    (a) Subject to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), the 
records, reports, transcripts, minutes, appendixes, working papers, 
drafts, studies, agenda, or other documents that were available to or 
prepared for or by a GSA advisory committee are available (until the 
committee ceases to exist) for public inspection and copying in the 
office of the Government Chairperson or Designated Federal Officer. 
Requests to inspect or copy these records are processed under 41 CFR 
105-60.4. Except where prohibited by a contract entered into before 
January 5, 1973, copies of transcripts, if any, of committee meetings 
are made available by the Government chairperson or Designated Federal 
Officer to any person at the cost of duplication. After the committee's 
work ends, disposition of the committee documents and the release of 
information from them are made in accordance with Federal records, 
statutes, and regulations.
    (b) Subject to 5 U.S.C. 552(b) and instructions of the Committee 
Management Secretariat, the Government chairperson or Designated Federal 
Officer files at least eight copies of each report an advisory committee 
makes, including any report on closed meetings with the Library of 
Congress at the time of its issuance. Where appropriate, the chairperson 
also files copies of background papers that consultants to the advisory 
committee prepare with the Library of Congress. The transmittal letter 
identifies the materials being furnished, with a copy of the transmittal 
provided to the GSA Committee Management Officer.

[[Page 421]]


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.303  Fiscal and administrative provisions.

    (a) Each HSSO and each Regional Administrator ensures that under 
established GSA procedures, records are kept that fully disclose the 
disposition of funds at the disposal of an advisory committee and the 
nature and extent of the committee's activities.
    (b) When GSA is assigned to provide administrative support for a 
Presidential advisory committee, the Agency Liaison Coordinator in the 
Office of the Deputy Regional Administrator, National Capital Region, as 
a part of its support, arranges with the Office of Finance, Office of 
the Comptroller, for maintaining all financial records.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided in a Presidential order, statute, or 
other authority, the GSA service or staff office sponsoring an advisory 
committee provides support services for the committee.
    (d) The guidelines in paragraph (e) through (l) of this section are 
established under section 7(d) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 86 
Stat. 773. They apply to the pay of members, staff, and consultants of 
an advisory committee, except that nothing in this paragraph will affect 
a rate of pay or a limitation on a rate of pay that is established by 
statute or a rate of pay established under the General Schedule 
classification and pay system in Chapter 51 and Subchapter III of 
Chapter 53 of Title 5, U.S.C.
    (e) The members of GSA advisory committee established pursuant to 
the Administrator's authority under section 205(g) of the Federal 
Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 
486(g)), are not compensated, since, by law, members so appointed shall 
service without compensation. A person who (without regard to his or her 
service with an advisory committee) is a full-time Federal employee will 
normally receive compensation at the rate at which he or she would 
otherwise be compensated.
    (f) When required by law, the pay of the members of GSA advisory 
committees will be fixed to the daily equivalent of a rate of the 
General Schedule in 5 U.S.C. 5332 unless the members are appointed as 
consultants and compensated as provided in paragraph (h) of this 
section. In determining an appropriate rate of pay for the members, GSA 
must give consideration to the significance, scope, and technical 
complexity of the matters with which the advisory committee is concerned 
and the qualifications required of the members of the advisory 
committee. GSA may not fix the pay of the members of an advisory 
committee at a rate higher than the daily equivalent of the maximum rate 
for a GS-15 under the General Schedule, unless a higher rate is mandated 
by statute, or the Administrator has personally determined that a higher 
rate of pay under the General Schedule is justified and necessary. Such 
a determination must be reviewed by the Administrator annually. 
Accordingly, the Administrator may not fix the pay of the members of an 
advisory committee at a rate of pay higher than the daily equivalent of 
a rate for a GSA 18, as provided in 5 U.S.C. 5332.
    (g) The pay of each staff member of an advisory committee is fixed 
at a rate of the General Schedule, General Management Schedule, or 
Senior Executive Service pay rate in which the staff member's position 
would be placed (5 U.S.C. Chapter 51). GSA cannot fix the pay of a staff 
member higher than the daily equivalent of the maximum rate for GS-15 
unless the Administrator decides that under the General Schedule, 
General Management Schedule, or Senior Executive Service classification 
system, the staff member's position should be higher than GS-15. The 
Administrator must review this decision annually.
    (1) In establishing compensation rates, GSA must comply with 
applicable statutes, regulations, Executive Orders, and administrative 
guidelines.
    (2) A staff member who is a Federal employee serves with the 
knowledge of the Designated Federal Officer and the approval of the 
employee's direct supervisor. A staff member who is a non-Federal 
employee is appointed under agency procedures, after consultation with 
the advisory committee.
    (h) The pay of a consultant to an advisory committee will be fixed 
after giving consideration to the qualifications required of the 
consultant and the significance, scope, and technical complexity of the 
work. The rate of

[[Page 422]]

pay will not exceed the maximum rate of pay which the agency may pay 
experts and consultants under 5 U.S.C. 3109 and must be in accordance 
with any applicable statutes, regulations, Executive Orders, and 
administrative guidelines.
    (i) Advisory committee and staff members, while performing their 
duties away from their homes or regular places of business, may be 
allowed travel expenses, including per diem instead of subsistence, as 
authorized by 5 U.S.C. 5703 for persons employed intermittently in the 
Government service.
    (j) Members of an advisory committee and its staff who are blind or 
deaf or who otherwise qualify as handicapped persons (under section 501 
of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794)), and who do not 
otherwise qualify for assistance under 5 U.S.C. 3102, as an employee of 
an agency (under section 3102(a)(1) of Title 5), may be provided the 
services of a personal assistant.
    (k) Under this paragraph, GSA may accept the gratuitous services of 
a member, consultant, or staff member of an advisory committee who 
agrees in advance to serve without compensation.
    (l) A person who immediately before his or her service with an 
advisory committee was a full-time Federal employee may receive 
compensation at the rate at which he or she was compensated as a Federal 
employee.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.304  Cost guidelines.

    (a) The reporting and estimating of the costs of advisory committees 
include direct obligations for the following items:
    (1) Pay compensation of committee members; consultants to the 
committee; all permanent, temporary, or part-time (GM, GS, WB, or other) 
positions which are a part of or support the committee; and all overtime 
related to committee functions (Compensation should reflect actual or 
estimated Federal person-years or parts thereof devoted to a committee's 
activities. It includes the compensation of Federal employees assigned 
to committees, on a reimbursable or nonreimbursable basis, from agencies 
or departments other than to which the committee reports.);
    (2) Personnel benefits associated with the above compensation (13 
percent of basic payroll);
    (3) Travel costs (including per diem) of committee members; 
consultants; and all permanent, temporary, or part-time positions which 
are a part of or support the committee;
    (4) Transportation of things, communications, and printing and 
reproduction;
    (5) Rent for additional space acquired for committee use;
    (6) Other services required by the committee, including data 
processing services, management studies and evaluations, contractual 
services, and reimbursable services; and
    (7) Supplies, materials, and equipment acquired for committee use.
    (b) The reporting and estimating of the cost of advisory committees 
does not include indirect or overhead costs; e.g., the costs of the 
committee management system (committee management officers, etc.).


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.305  Renewal of advisory committees.

    (a) Each advisory committee being continued is renewed for 
successive 2-year periods beginning with the date when it was 
established according to the following, except for statutory advisory 
committees: (For renewal of statutory advisory committees, see paragraph 
(b) of this section.)
    (1) Advisory committees are not renewed unless there is a compelling 
need for them, they have balanced membership, and they conduct their 
business as openly as possible under the law.
    (2) The renewal of a committee requires that the responsible HSSO 
submit to the GSA Committee Management Officer the following:
    (i) An updated charter with an explanation of the need for the 
renewal of the committee. The charter and explanation are furnished 60 
calendar days before the 2-year anniversary date of the committee.);
    (ii) A letter signed by the HSSO to the Director, Committee 
Management Secretariat, with information copies to the Administrator and 
the Deputy Administrator, setting forth:

[[Page 423]]

    (A) An explanation of why the committee is essential to the conduct 
of agency business and is in the public interest;
    (B) GSA's plan to attain balanced membership of the committee; and
    (C) An explanation of why the committee's functions cannot be 
performed by GSA, another existing GSA advisory committee, or other 
means such as a public hearing;
    (iii) A notice for publication in the Federal Register describing 
the nature and purpose of the committee and containing a certification 
by the Administrator that renewing the advisory committee is in the 
public interest.
    (3) On receiving the above documents, the GSA Committee Management 
Officer submits the renewal letter to the Committee Management 
Secretariat not more than 60 calendar days nor less than 30 days before 
the committee expires. Following receipt of the Committee Management 
Secretariat's views on the committee renewal, the Officer obtains the 
Administrator's approval of the charter and the Federal Register notice. 
The Officer publishes notice of the renewal in the Federal Register and 
files copies of the updated charter. The 15-day notice requirement does 
not apply to committee renewals, notices of which may be published 
concurrently with the filing of the charter.
    (b) Each statutory advisory committee is renewed by the filing of a 
renewal charter upon the expiration of each successive 2-year period 
following the date of enactment of the statute establishing the 
committee according to the following:
    (1) The procedures in paragraph (a)(2) of this section apply to the 
renewal of a statutory committee except that neither prior consultation 
with the Committee Management Secretariat nor a Federal Register notice 
is required. Accordingly, the letter that paragraph a(2)(ii) requires is 
sent to the Administrator rather than the Committee Mangement 
Secretariat. Due to the nature of a committee the law established, the 
explanation of the need to continue the committee's existence is less 
extensive than the explanation for the continuation of a non-statutory 
committee; and
    (2) The GSA Committee Management Officer provides the Committee 
Management Secretariat with a copy of the filed charter.
    (c) An advisory commitee required to file a new charter may not take 
any action other than preparing the charter between the date it is to be 
filed and the date it is actually filed.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.306  Amendment of advisory committee charters.

    (a) A charter is amended when GSA decides that the existing charter 
no longer accurately reflects the objectives or functions of the 
committee. Changes may be minor, such as revising the name of the 
committee or modifying the estimated number or frequency of meetings, or 
they may be major dealing with the basic objectives or composition of 
the committee. The Administrator retains final authority for amending 
the charter of an advisory committee. Amending an existing advisory 
committee charter does not constitute renewal of the committee.
    (b) To make a minor amendment, the Administrator approves the 
amended charter and has it filed according to Sec. 105-54.203-1.
    (c) To make a major amendment, the Committee Management Officer 
submits an amended charter and a letter to the Committee Management 
Secretariat, signed by the HSSO with the concurrence of the General 
Counsel or designee, requesting the Secretariat's views on the amended 
language, along with an explanation of the purpose of the changes and 
why they are necessary. The Secretariat reviews the proposed changes and 
notifies the Committee Management Officer of its views within 15 
calendar days of receiving it, if possible. The Administrator has the 
charter filed according to Sec. 105-54.203-1.
    (d) Amending an existing charter does not constitute renewal of the 
committee.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.307  Termination of advisory committees.

    (a) The sponsoring HSSO terminates an advisory commitee that has 
fulfilled the purpose stated in its charter. The official takes action 
to rescind any existing orders relating to the committee and to notify 
committee members, the

[[Page 424]]

GSA Committee Management Officer, and the Committee Management 
Secretariat of the termination.
    (b) Failing to continue an advisory committee by the 2-year 
anniversary date terminates the committee, unless its duration is 
provided for by law.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.308  Responsibilities of the Administrator.

    The Administrator must ensure:

    (a) No later than the first meeting of an advisory committee, submit 
to committee members, committee staff, consultants, and appropriate 
agency management personnel a written statement of the purpose, 
objectives, and expected accomplishments of the committee;
    (b) Solicit in writing or in a formal meeting at least annually the 
views of committee members on the effectiveness, activities, and 
management of the committee, including recommendations for improvement. 
Review comments to determine whether improvements or corrective action 
is warranted. Retain recommendations until the committee is terminated 
or renewed.
    (c) Involve key management personnel of the agency whose interests 
are affected by the committee in committee meetings, including reviewing 
reports and establishing agendas.
    (d) Periodically, but not less than annually, review the level of

scheduled meetings.
    (f) Establish meeting dates and distribute agendas and other

<R05>
Sec. 105-55.001  Prescription of standards.

    (a) The Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General of the 
United States issued regulations for collecting debts owed the United 
States under the authority contained in 31 U.S.C. 3711(d)(2). The 
regulations in this part prescribe standards for the General Services 
Administration (GSA) use in the administrative collection, offset, 
compromise, and the suspension or termination of collection activity for 
civil claims for money, funds, or property, as defined by 31 U.S.C. 
3701(b), unless specific GSA statutes or regulations apply to such 
activities or, as provided for by Title 11 of the United States Code, 
when the claims involve bankruptcy. The regulations in this part

[[Page 426]]

also prescribe standards for referring debts to the Department of 
Justice for litigation. Additional guidance is contained in the Office 
of Management and Budget's Circular A-129 (Revised), ``Policies for 
Federal Credit Programs and Non-Tax Receivables,'' the Department of the 
Treasury's ``Managing Federal Receivables,'' and other publications 
concerning debt collection and debt management.
    (b) GSA is not limited to the remedies contained in this part and 
will use all authorized remedies, including alternative dispute 
resolution and arbitration, to collect civil claims, to the extent such 
remedies are not inconsistent with the Federal Claims Collection Act, as 
amended, Chapter 37 of Title 31, United States Code; the Debt Collection 
Act of 1982, 5 U.S.C. 5514; the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, 
31 U.S.C. 3701 et seq., or other relevant statutes. The regulations in 
this part are not intended to impair GSA's common law rights to collect 
debts.
    (c) Standards and policies regarding the classification of debt for 
accounting purposes (for example, write off of uncollectible debt) are 
contained in the Office of Management and Budget's Circular A-129 
(Revised), ``Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non-Tax 
Receivables.''


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.002  Definitions.

    (a) Administrative offset, as defined in 31 U.S.C. 3701(a)(1), means 
withholding funds payable by the United States (including funds payable 
by the United States on behalf of a State government) to, or held by the 
United States for, a person to satisfy a claim.
    (b) Compromise means the reduction of a debt as provided in 
Sec. Sec. 105-55.019 and 105-55.020.
    (c) Debt collection center means the Department of the Treasury or 
other Government agency or division designated by the Secretary of the 
Treasury with authority to collect debts on behalf of creditor agencies 
in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3711(g).
    (d) Debtor means an individual, organization, association, 
corporation, partnership, or a State or local government indebted to the

    (e) Delinquent or past-due non-tax debt means any non-tax debt that 
has not been paid by the date specified in GSA's initial written demand 
for payment or applicable agreement or instrument (including a post-
delinquency payment agreement), unless other satisfactory payment 
arrangements have been made.
    (f) For the purposes of the standards in this part, unless otherwise 
stated, the term Administrator refers to the Administrator of General 
Services or the Administrator's delegate.
    (g) For the purposes of the standards in this part, the terms claim 
and debt are synonymous and interchangeable. They refer to an amount of 
money, funds, or property that has been determined by GSA to be due the 
United States from any person, organization, or entity, except another 
Federal agency, from sources which include loans insured or guaranteed 
by the United States and all other amounts due the United States from 
fees, leases, rents, royalties, services, sales of real or personal 
property, overpayments, penalties, damages, interest, fines and 
forfeitures and all other similar sources, including debt administered 
by a third party as an agent for the Federal Government. For the 
purposes of administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716, the terms claim 
and debt include an amount of money, funds, or property owed by a person 
to a State (including past-due support being enforced by a State), the 
District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the United States Virgin 
Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
    (h) For the purposes of the standards in this part, unless otherwise 
stated, the terms GSA and Agency are synonymous and interchangeable.
    (i) For the purposes of the standards in this part, unless otherwise 
stated, Secretary means the Secretary of the Treasury or the Secretary's 
delegate.
    (j) For the standards in this part, Federal agencies include 
agencies of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the 
Government, including Government corporations.

[[Page 427]]

    (k) Hearing means a review of the documentary evidence concerning 
the existence and/or amount of a debt, and/or the terms of a repayment 
schedule, provided such repayment schedule is established other than by 
a written agreement entered into pursuant to this part. If the hearing 
official determines the issues in dispute cannot be resolved solely by 
review of the written record, such as when the validity of the debt 
turns on the issue of credibility or veracity, an oral hearing may be 
provided.
    (l) Hearing official means a Board Judge of the GSA Board of 
Contract Appeals.
    (m) In this part, words in the plural form shall include the 
singular and vice versa, and words signifying the masculine gender shall 
include the feminine and vice versa. The terms includes and including do 
not exclude matters not listed but do include matters that are in the 
same general class.
    (n) Reconsideration means a request by the employee to have a 
secondary review by GSA of the existence and/or amount of the debt, and/
or the proposed offset schedule.
    (o) Recoupment is a special method for adjusting debts arising under 
the same transaction or occurrence. For example, obligations arising 
under the same contract generally are subject to recoupment.
    (p) Taxpayer identifying number means the identifying number 
described under section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 
U.S.C. 6109). For an individual, the taxpayer identifying number is the 
individual's social security number.
    (q) Waiver means the cancellation, remission, forgiveness, or non-
recovery of a debt or debt-related charge as permitted or required by 
law.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.003  Antitrust, fraud, tax, interagency claims, and 

claims over $100,000 excluded.

    (a) The standards in this part relating to compromise, suspension, 
and termination of collection activity do not apply to any debt based in 
whole or in part on conduct in violation of the antitrust laws or to any 
debt involving fraud, the presentation of a false claim, or 
misrepresentation on the part of the debtor or any party having an 
interest in the claim. The standards of this part relating to the 
administrative collection of claims do apply, but only to the extent 
authorized by the Department of Justice (DOJ) in a particular case. Upon 
identification of a claim based in whole or in part on conduct in 
violation of the antitrust laws or any claim involving fraud, the 
presentation of a false claim, or misrepresentation on the part of the 
debtor or any party having an interest in the claim, the General 
Services Administration (GSA) will promptly refer the case to the GSA 
Office of Inspector General (OIG). The OIG has the responsibility for 
investigating or referring the matter, where appropriate, to DOJ for 
action. At its discretion, DOJ may return the claim to GSA for further 
handling in accordance with the standards of this part.
    (b) This part does not apply to tax debts.
    (c) This part does not apply to claims between GSA and other Federal 
agencies.
    (d) This part does not apply to claims over $100,000.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.004  Compromise, waiver, or disposition under other

statutes not precluded.

    Nothing in this part precludes the General Services Administration 
(GSA) disposition of any claim under statutes and implementing 
regulations other than subchapter II of chapter 37 of Title 31 of the 
United States Code (Claims of the United States Government) and the 
standards in this part. See, e.g., the Federal Medical Care Recovery 
Act, 42 U.S.C. 2651-2653, and applicable regulations, 28 CFR part 43. In 
such cases, the laws and regulations specifically applicable to claims 
collection activities of GSA generally take precedence.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.005  Form of payment.

    Claims may be paid in the form of money or, when a contractual basis 
exists, the General Services Administration may demand the return of 
specific property or the performance of specific services.

[[Page 428]]


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.006  Subdivision of claims not authorized.

    Debts will not be subdivided to avoid the monetary ceiling 
established by 31 U.S.C. 3711(a)(2). A debtor's liability arising from a 
particular transaction or contract shall be considered a single debt in 
determining whether the debt is one of less than $100,000 (excluding 
interest, penalties, and administrative costs) or such higher amount as 
the Attorney General shall from time to time prescribe for purposes of 
compromise, suspension or termination of collection activity.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.007  Required administrative proceedings.

    The General Services Administration is not required to omit, 
foreclose, or duplicate administrative proceedings required by contract 
or other laws or regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.008  No private rights created.

    The standards in this part do not create any right or benefit, 
substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by a party 
against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any other 
person, nor shall the failure of the General Services Administration to 
comply with any of the provisions of this part be available to any 
debtor as a defense.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.009  Aggressive agency collection activity.

    (a) The General Services Administration (GSA) will aggressively 
collect all debts arising out of activities of, or referred or 
transferred for collection services to, GSA. Collection activities will 
be undertaken promptly, including letters, telephone calls, electronic 
mail (e-mail), and Internet inquiries, with follow-up action taken as 
necessary.
    (b) Debts referred or transferred to Treasury, or Treasury-
designated debt collection centers under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 
3711(g), will be serviced, collected, or compromised, or the collection 
action will be suspended or terminated, in accordance with the statutory 
requirements and authorities applicable to the collection of such debts.
    (c) GSA will cooperate with other agencies in their debt collection 
activities.
    (d) GSA will consider referring debts that are less than 180 days 
delinquent to Treasury or to Treasury-designated ``debt collection 
centers'' to accomplish efficient, cost effective debt collection. 
Treasury is a debt collection center, is authorized to designate other 
Federal agencies as debt collection centers based on their performance 
in collecting delinquent debts, and may withdraw such designations. 
Referrals to debt collection centers shall be at the discretion of, and 
for a time period acceptable to, the Secretary. Referrals may be for 
servicing, collection, compromise, suspension, or termination of 
collection action.
    (e) GSA will transfer to the Secretary any debt that has been 
delinquent for a period of 180 days or more so the Secretary may take 
appropriate action to collect the debt or terminate collection action. 
See 31 CFR 285.12 (Transfer of Debts to Treasury for Collection). This 
requirement does not apply to any debt that--
    (1) Is in litigation or foreclosure;
    (2) Will be disposed of under an approved asset sale program;
    (3) Has been referred to a private collection contractor for a 
period of time acceptable to the Secretary;
    (4) Is at a debt collection center for a period of time acceptable 
to the Secretary (see paragraph (d) of this section);
    (5) Will be collected under internal offset procedures within three 
years after the debt first became delinquent;
    (6) Is exempt from this requirement based on a determination by the 
Secretary that exemption for a certain class of debt is in the best 
interest of the United States. GSA may request the Secretary to exempt 
specific classes of debts;
    (7) Is in bankruptcy (see Sec. 105-55.010(h));
    (8) Involves a deceased debtor;
    (9) Is owed to GSA by a foreign government; or
    (10) Is in an administrative appeals process, until the process is 
complete and the amount due is set.
    (f) Agencies operating Treasury-designated debt collection centers 
are authorized to charge a fee for services rendered regarding referred 
or transferred debts. The fee may be paid out of

[[Page 429]]

amounts collected and will be added to the debt as an administrative 
cost (see Sec. 105-55.016).


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.010  Demand for payment.

    (a) Written demand, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, 
will be made promptly upon a debtor of the United States in terms 
informing the debtor of the consequences of failing to cooperate with 
the General Services Administration (GSA) to resolve the debt. The 
specific content, timing, and number of demand letters (usually no more 
than three, thirty days apart) will depend upon the type and amount of 
the debt and the debtor's response, if any, to GSA's letters, telephone 
calls, electronic mail (e-mail) or Internet inquiries. In determining 
the timing of the demand letter(s), GSA will give due regard to the need 
to refer debts promptly to the Department of Justice for litigation, in 
accordance with Sec. 105-55.031. When necessary to protect the 
Government's interest (for example, to prevent the running of a statute 
of limitations), written demand may be preceded by other appropriate 
actions under this part, including immediate referral for litigation.
    (b) Demand letters will inform the debtor--
    (1) The basis and the amount of the indebtedness and the rights, if 
any, the debtor may have to seek review within GSA (see Sec. 105-
55.011(e));
    (2) The applicable standards for imposing any interest, penalties, 
or administrative costs (see Sec. 105-55.016);
    (3) The date by which payment should be made to avoid late charges 
(i.e., interest, penalties, and administrative costs) and enforced 
collection, which generally will not be more than 30 days from the date 
the demand letter is mailed or hand-delivered; and
    (4) The name, address, and phone number of a contact person or 
office within GSA.
    (c) GSA will exercise care to ensure that demand letters are mailed 
or hand-delivered on the same day they are dated. For the purposes of 
written demand, notification by electronic mail (e-mail) and/or Internet 
delivery is considered a form of written demand notice. There is no 
prescribed format for demand letters. GSA will utilize demand letters 
and procedures that will lead to the earliest practicable determination 
of whether the debt can be resolved administratively or must be referred 
for litigation.
    (d) GSA may include in demand letters such items as the willingness 
to discuss alternative methods of payment; Agency policies with respect 
to the use of credit bureaus, debt collection centers, and collection 
agencies; Agency remedies to enforce payment of the debt (including 
assessment of interest, administrative costs and penalties, 
administrative garnishment, the use of collection agencies, Federal 
salary offset, tax refund offset, administrative offset, and 
litigation); the requirement that any debt delinquent for more than 180 
days will be transferred to the Department of the Treasury for 
collection; and, depending on applicable statutory authority, the 
debtor's entitlement to consideration of a waiver.
    (e) GSA will respond promptly to communications from debtors, within 
30 days whenever feasible, and will advise debtors who dispute debts to 
furnish available evidence to support their contentions.
    (f) Prior to the initiation of the demand process or at any time 
during or after completion of the demand process, if GSA determines to 
pursue, or is required to pursue, offset, the procedures applicable to 
offset will be followed (see Sec. 105-55.011). The availability of 
funds or money for debt satisfaction by offset and GSA's determination 
to pursue collection by offset will release the Agency from the 
necessity of further compliance with paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) 
of this section.
    (g) Prior to referring a debt for litigation, GSA will advise each 
person determined to be liable for the debt that, unless the debt can be 
collected administratively, litigation may be initiated. This 
notification will comply with Executive Order 12988 (3 CFR, 1996 Comp. 
pp. 157-163) and may be given as part of a demand letter under paragraph 
(b) of this section or in a separate document.
    (h) When GSA learns a bankruptcy petition has been filed with 
respect to a debtor, before proceeding with further collection action, 
the Agency will

[[Page 430]]

ascertain the impact of the Bankruptcy Code on any pending or 
contemplated collection activities. Unless the Agency determines the 
automatic stay imposed at the time of filing pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 362 
has been lifted or is no longer in effect, in most cases collection 
activity against the debtor will stop immediately.
    (1) A proof of claim will be filed in most cases with the bankruptcy 
court or the Trustee. GSA will refer to the provisions of 11 U.S.C. 106 
relating to the consequences on sovereign immunity of filing a proof of 
claim.
    (2) If GSA is a secured creditor, it may seek relief from the 
automatic stay regarding its security, subject to the provisions and 
requirements of 11 U.S.C. 362.
    (3) Offset is stayed in most cases by the automatic stay. However, 
GSA will determine whether its payments to the debtor and payments of 
other agencies available for offset may be frozen by the Agency until 
relief from the automatic stay can be obtained from the bankruptcy 
court. GSA also will determine whether recoupment is available.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.011  Collection by administrative offset.

    (a) Scope. (1) The term ``administrative offset'' has the meaning 
provided in 31 U.S.C. 3701(a)(1).
    (2) This section does not apply to--
    (i) Debts arising under the Social Security Act, except as provided 
in 42 U.S.C. 404;
    (ii) Payments made under the Social Security Act, except as provided 
for in 31 U.S.C. 3716(c) (see 31 CFR 285.4, Federal Benefit Offset);
    (iii) Debts arising under, or payments made under, the Internal 
Revenue Code (see 31 CFR 285.2, Tax Refund Offset) or the tariff laws of 
the United States;
    (iv) Offsets against Federal salaries to the extent these standards 
are inconsistent with regulations published to implement such offsets 
under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 31 U.S.C. 3716 (see 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, 
and 31 CFR 285.7, Federal Salary Offset);
    (v) Offsets under 31 U.S.C. 3728 against a judgment obtained by a 
debtor against the United States;
    (vi) Offsets or recoupments under common law, State law, or Federal 
statutes specifically prohibiting offsets or recoupments of particular 
types of debts; or
    (vii) Offsets in the course of judicial proceedings, including 
bankruptcy.
    (3) Unless otherwise provided for by contract or law, debts or 
payments that are not subject to administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 
3716 may be collected by administrative offset under the common law or 
other applicable statutory authority.
    (4) Unless otherwise provided by law, administrative offset of 
payments under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 3716 to collect a debt may not 
be conducted more than 10 years after the General Services 
Administration's (GSA's) right to collect the debt first accrued, unless 
facts material to GSA's right to collect the debt were not known and 
could not reasonably have been known by the official or officials of GSA 
who were charged with the responsibility to discover and collect such 
debts. This limitation does not apply to debts reduced to a judgment.
    (5) In bankruptcy cases, GSA will ascertain the impact of the 
Bankruptcy Code, particularly 11 U.S.C. 106, 362, and 553, on pending or 
contemplated collections by offset.
    (b) Mandatory centralized administrative offset. (1) GSA is required 
to refer past due, legally enforceable non-tax debts that are over 180 
days delinquent to the Secretary for collection by centralized 
administrative offset. Debts that are less than 180 days delinquent also 
may be referred to the Secretary for this purpose. See paragraph (b)(5) 
of this section for debt certification requirements.
    (2) The names and taxpayer identifying numbers (TINs) of debtors who 
owe debts referred to the Secretary as described in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section will be compared to the names and TINs on payments to be 
made by Federal disbursing officials. Federal disbursing officials 
include disbursing officials of the Department of the Treasury, the 
Department of Defense, the United States Postal Service, other 
Government corporations, and disbursing officials of the United States 
designated by the Secretary. When the name and TIN of a debtor match the 
name and TIN of a payee and all other

[[Page 431]]

requirements for offset have been met, the payment will be offset to 
satisfy the debt.
    (3) Federal disbursing officials will notify the debtor/payee in 
writing that an offset has occurred to satisfy, in part or in full, a 
past due, legally enforceable delinquent debt. The notice will include a 
description of the type and amount of the payment from which the offset 
was taken, the amount of offset that was taken, the identity of GSA as 
the creditor agency requesting the offset, and a contact point within 
GSA who will respond to questions regarding the offset.
    (4)(i) Offsets may be initiated only after the debtor--
    (A) Has been sent written notice of the type and amount of the debt, 
the intention of GSA to use administrative offset to collect the debt, 
and an explanation of the debtor's rights under 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(7); 
and
    (B) The debtor has been given--
    (1) The opportunity to inspect and copy Agency records related to 
the debt;
    (2) The opportunity for a review within GSA of the determination of 
indebtedness (see paragraph (e) of this section); and
    (3) The opportunity to make a written agreement to repay the debt.
    (ii) The procedures set forth in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section 
may be omitted when--
    (A) The offset is in the nature of a recoupment;
    (B) The debt arises under a contract as set forth in Cecile 
Industries, Inc. v. Cheney, 995 F.2d 1052 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (notice and 
other procedural protections set forth in 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) do not 
supplant or restrict established procedures for contractual offsets 
accommodated by the Contracts Disputes Act); or
    (C) In the case of non-centralized administrative offsets conducted 
under paragraph (c) of this section, GSA first learns of the existence 
of the amount owed by the debtor when there is insufficient time before 
payment would be made to the debtor/payee to allow for prior notice and 
an opportunity for review. When prior notice and an opportunity for 
review are omitted, GSA will give the debtor such notice and an 
opportunity for review as soon as practicable and will promptly refund 
any money ultimately found not to have been owed to the Government.
    (iii) When GSA previously has given a debtor any of the required 
notice and review opportunities with respect to a particular debt (see, 
e.g., Sec. 105-55.010), the Agency need not duplicate such notice and 
review opportunities before administrative offset may be initiated.
    (5) When referring delinquent debts to the Secretary, GSA will 
certify, in a form acceptable to the Secretary, that--
    (i) The debt(s) is (are) past due and legally enforceable; and
    (ii) GSA has complied with all due process requirements under 31 
U.S.C. 3716(a) and Agency regulations.
    (6) Payments that are prohibited by law from being offset are exempt 
from centralized administrative offset. The Secretary shall exempt 
payments under means-tested programs from centralized administrative 
offset when requested in writing by the Administrator. Also, the 
Secretary may exempt other classes of payments from centralized offset 
upon the written request of the Administrator.
    (7) Benefit payments made under the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
301 et seq.), part B of the Black Lung Benefits Act (30 U.S.C. 921 et 
seq.), and any law administered by the Railroad Retirement Board (other 
than tier 2 benefits), may be offset only in accordance with Treasury 
regulations, issued in consultation with the Social Security 
Administration, the Railroad Retirement Board, and the Office of 
Management and Budget. See 31 CFR 285.4.
    (8) In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3716(f), the Secretary may waive 
the provisions of the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 
1988 concerning matching agreements and post-match notification and 
verification (5 U.S.C. 552a(o) and (p)) for centralized administrative 
offset upon receipt of a certification from GSA that the due process 
requirements enumerated in 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) have been met. The 
certification of a debt in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section will satisfy this requirement. If such a waiver is granted, only 
the Data Integrity

[[Page 432]]

Board of the Department of the Treasury is required to oversee any 
matching activities, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3716(g). This waiver 
authority does not apply to offsets conducted under paragraphs (c) and 
(d) of this section.
    (c) Non-centralized administrative offset. (1) Generally, non-
centralized administrative offsets are ad hoc case-by-case offsets that 
GSA conducts, at the Agency's discretion, internally or in cooperation 
with another agency certifying or authorizing payments to the debtor. 
Unless otherwise prohibited by law, when centralized administrative 
offset is not available or appropriate, past due, legally enforceable 
non-tax delinquent debts may be collected through non-centralized 
administrative offset. In these cases, GSA may make a request directly 
to a payment authorizing agency to offset a payment due a debtor to 
collect a delinquent debt. For example, it may be appropriate for GSA to 
request the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) offset a Federal 
employee's lump sum payment upon leaving Government service to satisfy 
an unpaid advance.
    (2) Such offsets will occur only after--
    (i) The debtor has been provided due process as set forth in 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section; and
    (ii) The payment authorizing agency has received written 
certification from GSA that the debtor owes the past due, legally 
enforceable delinquent debt in the amount stated, and that GSA has fully 
complied with its regulations concerning administrative offset.
    (3) Payment authorizing agencies will comply with offset requests by 
GSA to collect debts owed to the United States, unless the offset would 
not be in the best interests of the United States with respect to the 
program of the payment authorizing agency, or would otherwise be 
contrary to law.
    (4) When collecting multiple debts by non-centralized administrative 
offset, GSA will apply the recovered amounts to those debts in 
accordance with the best interests of the United States, as determined 
by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, particularly the 
applicable statute of limitations.
    (d) Requests to OPM to offset a debtor's anticipated or future 
benefit payments under the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. 
Upon providing OPM written certification that a debtor has been afforded 
the procedures provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, GSA may 
request OPM to offset a debtor's anticipated or future benefit payments 
under the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (Fund) in 
accordance with regulations codified at 5 CFR 831.1801 through 831.1808. 
Upon receipt of such a request, OPM will identify and ``flag'' a 
debtor's account in anticipation of the time when the debtor requests, 
or becomes eligible to receive, payments from the Fund. This will 
satisfy any requirement that offset be initiated prior to the expiration 
of the time limitations referenced in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
    (e) Review requirements. (1) A debtor may seek review of a debt by 
sending a signed and dated petition for review to the official named in 
the demand letter. A copy of the petition must also be sent to the GSA 
Board of Contract Appeals (GSBCA) at the address indicated in paragraph 
(e)(6) of this section.
    (2) For purposes of this section, whenever GSA is required to afford 
a debtor a review within the Agency, the hearing official will provide 
the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when the 
debtor requests reconsideration of the debt and the hearing official 
determines that the question of the indebtedness cannot be resolved by 
review of the documentary evidence; for example, when the validity of 
the debt turns on an issue of credibility or veracity.
    (3) Witnesses will be asked to testify under oath or affirmation, 
and a written transcript of the hearing will be kept and made available 
to either party in the event of an appeal under the Administrative 
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701-706. Arrangements for the taking of the 
transcript will be made by the hearing official, and all charges 
associated with the taking of the transcript will be the responsibility 
of GSA.
    (4) In those cases when an oral hearing is not required by this 
section, the

[[Page 433]]

hearing official will accord the debtor a ``paper hearing,'' that is, a 
determination of the request for reconsideration based upon a review of 
the written record.
    (5) Hearings will be conducted by a Board Judge of the GSBCA. GSA 
must provide proof that a valid non-tax debt exists, and the debtor must 
provide evidence that no debt exists or that the amount of the debt is 
incorrect.
    (6) If an oral hearing is provided, the debtor may choose to have it 
conducted in the hearing official's office located at GSA Central 
Office, 1800 F St., NW., Washington, DC 20405, at another location 
designated by the hearing official, or may choose a hearing by 
telephone. All personal and travel expenses incurred by the debtor in 
connection with an in-person hearing will be borne by the debtor. All 
telephonic charges incurred during a hearing will be the responsibility 
of GSA.
    (7) If the debtor is an employee of GSA, the employee may represent 
himself or herself or may be represented by another person of his or her 
choice at the hearing. GSA will not compensate the employee for 
representation expenses, including hourly fees for attorneys, travel 
expenses, and costs for reproducing documents.
    (8) A written decision will be issued by the hearing official no 
later than 60 days from the date the petition for review is received by 
GSA. The decision will state the--
    (i) Facts supporting the nature and origin of the debt;
    (ii) Hearing officials analysis, findings, and conclusions as to the 
debtor's and/or GSA's grounds;
    (iii) Amount and validity of the debt; and
    (iv) Repayment schedule, if applicable.
    (9) The hearing official's decision will be the final Agency action 
for the purposes of judicial review under the Administrative Procedure 
Act (5 U.S.C. 701 et seq.).
    (f) Waiver requirements. (1) Under certain circumstances, a waiver 
of a claim against an employee of GSA arising out of an erroneous 
payment of pay, allowances, travel, transportation, or relocation 
expenses and allowances may be granted in whole or in part.
    (2) GSA procedures for waiving a claim of erroneous payment of pay 
and allowances can be found in GSA Order CFO 4200.1, ``Waiver of Claims 
for Overpayment of Pay and Allowances''.
    (3) GSA will follow the procedures of 5 U.S.C. 5584 when considering 
a request for waiver of erroneous payment of travel, transportation, or 
relocation expenses and allowances.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.012  Contracting with private collection contractors 

and with entities that locate and recover unclaimed assets.

    (a) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, the 
General Services Administration (GSA) may contract with private 
collection contractors, as defined in 31 U.S.C. 3701(f), to recover 
delinquent debts provided that--
    (1) GSA retain the authority to resolve disputes, compromise debts, 
suspend or terminate collection activity, and refer debts for 
litigation;
    (2) The private collection contractor is not allowed to offer the 
debtor, as an incentive for payment, the opportunity to pay the debt 
less the private collection contractor's fee unless GSA has granted such 
authority prior to the offer;
    (3) The contract provides that the private collection contractor is 
subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 to the extent specified in 5 U.S.C. 
552a(m), and to applicable Federal and state laws and regulations 
pertaining to debt collection practices, including but not limited to 
the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. 1692; and
    (4) The private collection contractor is required to account for all 
amounts collected.
    (b) GSA will use Governmentwide debt collection contracts to obtain 
debt collection services provided by private collection contractors. 
However, GSA may refer debts to private collection contractors pursuant 
to a contract between the Agency and the private collection contractor 
only if such debts are not subject to the requirement to transfer debts 
to Treasury for debt collection. See 31 U.S.C. 3711(g); 31 CFR 
285.12(e).
    (c) GSA may fund private collection contractor contracts in 
accordance

[[Page 434]]

with 31 U.S.C. 3718(b), or as otherwise permitted by law.
    (d) GSA may enter into contracts for locating and recovering assets 
of the United States, such as unclaimed assets.
    (e) GSA may enter into contracts for debtor asset and income search 
reports. In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3718(b), such contracts may 
provide that the fee a contractor charges the Agency for such services 
may be payable from the amounts recovered, unless otherwise prohibited 
by statute.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.013  Suspension or revocation of eligibility for loans

and loan guaranties, licenses, permits, or privileges.

    (a) Unless waived by the Administrator, the General Services 
Administration (GSA) will not extend financial assistance in the form of 
a loan, loan guarantee, or loan insurance to any person delinquent on a 
non-tax debt owed to a Federal agency. This prohibition does not apply 
to disaster loans. The authority to waive the application of this 
section may be delegated to the Chief Financial Officer and re-delegated 
only to the Deputy Chief Financial Officer of GSA. GSA may extend credit 
after the delinquency has been resolved. The Secretary may exempt 
classes of debts from this prohibition and has prescribed standards 
defining when a ``delinquency'' is ``resolved'' for purposes of this 
prohibition. See 31 CFR 285.13.
    (b) In non-bankruptcy cases, GSA, when seeking the collection of 
statutory penalties, forfeitures, or other types of claims, will 
consider the suspension or revocation of licenses, permits, or other 
privileges for any inexcusable or willful failure of a debtor to pay 
such a debt in accordance with GSA regulations or governing procedures. 
The debtor will be advised in GSA's written demand for payment of the 
Agency's ability to suspend or revoke licenses, permits, or privileges. 
If GSA makes, guarantees, insures, acquires, or participates in loans, 
the Agency will consider suspending or disqualifying any lender, 
contractor, or broker from doing further business with the Agency or 
engaging in programs sponsored by the Agency if such lender, contractor, 
or broker fails to pay its debts to the Government within a reasonable 
time or if such lender, contractor, or broker has been suspended, 
debarred, or disqualified from participation in a program or activity by 
another Federal agency. The failure of any surety to honor its 
obligations in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 9305 will be reported to the 
Treasury. The Treasury will forward notification to all interested 
agencies that a surety's certificate of authority to do business with 
the Government has been revoked by the Treasury.
    (c) The suspension or revocation of licenses, permits, or privileges 
also may extend to GSA programs or activities administered by the states 
on behalf of GSA, to the extent they affect GSA's ability to collect 
money or funds owed by debtors.
    (d) In bankruptcy cases, before advising the debtor of GSA's 
intention to suspend or revoke licenses, permits, or privileges, the 
Agency will ascertain the impact of the Bankruptcy Code, particularly 11 
U.S.C. 362 and 525, which may restrict such action.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.014  Liquidation of collateral.

    (a) The General Services Administration (GSA) will liquidate 
security or collateral through the exercise of a power of sale in the 
security instrument or a non-judicial foreclosure, and apply the 
proceeds to the applicable debt(s), if the debtor fails to pay the 
debt(s) within a reasonable time after demand and if such action is in 
the best interest of the United States. Collection from other sources, 
including liquidation of security or collateral, is not a prerequisite 
to requiring payment by a surety, insurer, or guarantor unless such 
action is expressly required by statute or contract.
    (b) When GSA learns a bankruptcy petition has been filed with 
respect to a debtor, the Agency will ascertain the impact of the 
Bankruptcy Code, including, but not limited to, 11 U.S.C. 362, to 
determine the applicability of the automatic stay and the procedures for 
obtaining relief from such stay prior to proceeding under paragraph (a) 
of this section.

[[Page 435]]


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.015  Collection in installments.

    (a) Whenever feasible, the General Services Administration (GSA) 
will collect the total amount of a debt in one lump sum. If a debtor is 
financially unable to pay a debt in one lump sum, GSA may accept payment 
in regular installments. GSA may obtain financial statements from 
debtors who represent they are unable to pay in one lump sum and 
independently verify such representations whenever possible (see Sec. 
105-55.020(g)). When GSA agrees to accept payments in regular 
installments, a legally enforceable written agreement from the debtor 
will be obtained specifying all of the terms of the arrangement and 
containing a provision accelerating the debt in the event of default. If 
the debtor's financial statement discloses the ownership of assets which 
are free and clear of liens or security interests, or assets in which 
the debtor owns an equity, the debtor may be asked to secure the payment 
of an installment note by executing a Security Agreement and Financing 
Statement transferring to the United States a security interest in the 
asset until the debt is paid.
    (b) The size and frequency of installment payments will bear a 
reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the debtor's ability to 
pay. The installment payments will be sufficient in size and frequency 
to liquidate the debt in three years or less, unless circumstances 
warrant a longer period.
    (c) Security for deferred payments may be obtained in appropriate 
cases. GSA may accept installment payments notwithstanding the refusal 
of the debtor to execute a written agreement or to give security, at the 
Agency's option.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.016  Interest, penalties, and administrative costs.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this 
section, the General Services Administration (GSA) will charge interest, 
penalties, and administrative costs on debts owed to the United States 
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717. GSA will send by U.S. mail, overnight 
delivery service, or hand-delivery a written notice to the debtor, at 
the debtor's most recent address available to the Agency, explaining the 
Agency's requirements concerning these charges, except where these 
requirements are included in a contractual or repayment agreement. These 
charges will continue to accrue until the debt is paid in full or 
otherwise resolved through compromise, termination, or waiver of the 
charges.
    (b) GSA will charge interest on debts owed the United States as 
follows:
    (1) Interest will accrue from the date of delinquency, or as 
otherwise provided by law.
    (2) Unless otherwise established in a contract, repayment agreement, 
or by statute, the rate of interest charged will be the rate established 
annually by the Secretary in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717(a)(1). 
Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717, GSA may charge a higher rate of interest if 
it is reasonably determined that a higher rate is necessary to protect 
the rights of the United States. GSA will document the reason(s) for a 
determination that the higher rate is necessary.
    (3) The rate of interest, as initially charged, will remain fixed 
for the duration of the indebtedness. When a debtor defaults on a 
repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new agreement, GSA may 
require payment of interest at a new rate that reflects the Current 
Value of Funds Rate (CVFR) at the time the new agreement is executed. 
Interest will not be compounded, that is, interest will not be charged 
on interest, penalties, or administrative costs required by this 
section. If a debtor defaults on a previous repayment agreement, charges 
that accrued but were not collected under the defaulted agreement will 
be added to the principal under the new repayment agreement.
    (c) GSA will assess administrative costs incurred for processing and 
handling delinquent debts. The calculation of administrative costs will 
be based on actual costs incurred or upon estimated costs as determined 
by the Agency.
    (d) Unless otherwise established in a contract, repayment agreement, 
or by statute, GSA will charge a penalty, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 
3717(e)(2), not to exceed six percent a year on the amount due on a debt 
that is delinquent for more than 90 days. This

[[Page 436]]

charge will accrue from the date of delinquency.
    (e) GSA may increase an ``administrative debt'' by the cost of 
living adjustment in lieu of charging interest and penalties under this 
section. ``Administrative debt'' includes, but is not limited to, a debt 
based on fines, penalties, and overpayments, but does not include a debt 
based on the extension of Government credit, such as those arising from 
loans and loan guaranties. The cost of living adjustment is the 
percentage by which the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of 
the calendar year preceding the adjustment exceeds the Consumer Price 
Index for the month of June of the calendar year in which the debt was 
determined or last adjusted. Increases to administrative debts will be 
computed annually. GSA will use this alternative only when there is a 
legitimate reason to do so, such as when calculating interest and 
penalties on a debt would be extremely difficult because of the age of 
the debt.
    (f) When a debt is paid in partial or installment payments, amounts 
received by GSA will be applied first to outstanding penalties, second 
to administrative charges, third to interest, and last to principal.
    (g) GSA will waive the collection of interest, penalty and 
administrative charges imposed pursuant to this section on the portion 
of the debt that is paid within 30 days after the date on which interest 
began to accrue. GSA may extend this 30-day period on a case-by-case 
basis. In addition, GSA may waive interest, penalties, and 
administrative costs charged under this section, in whole or in part, 
without regard to the amount of the debt, either under the criteria set 
forth in these standards for the compromise of debts, or if the Agency 
determines that collection of these charges resulted from Agency error, 
is against equity and good conscience, or is not in the best interest of 
the United States.
    (h) Unless a statute or regulation specifically prohibits 
collection, interest, penalties and administrative costs will continue 
to accrue for periods during which collection activity has been 
suspended pending Agency review or waiver consideration.
    (i) GSA is authorized to impose interest and related charges on 
debts not subject to 31 U.S.C. 3717, in accordance with the common law.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.017  Use and disclosure of mailing addresses.

    (a) When attempting to locate a debtor in order to collect or 
compromise a debt under this part or other authority, the General 
Services Administration (GSA) may send a request to the Secretary (or 
designee) to obtain a debtor's mailing address from the records of the 
Internal Revenue Service.
    (b) GSA is authorized to use mailing addresses obtained under 
paragraph (a) of this section to enforce collection of a delinquent debt 
and may disclose such mailing addresses to other agencies and to 
collection agencies for collection purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.018  Exemptions.

    (a) The preceding sections of this part, to the extent they reflect 
remedies or procedures prescribed by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 and 
the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, such as administrative 
offset, use of credit bureaus, contracting for collection agencies, and 
interest and related charges, do not apply to debts arising under, or 
payments made under, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (26 
U.S.C. 1 et seq.); the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), 
except to the extent provided under 42 U.S.C. 404 and 31 U.S.C. 3716(c); 
or the tariff laws of the United States. These remedies and procedures, 
however, may be authorized with respect to debts that are exempt from 
the Debt Collection Act of 1982 and the Debt Collection Improvement Act 
of 1996, to the extent they are authorized under some other statute or 
the common law.
    (b) Claims arising from the audit of transportation accounts 
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3726 will be determined, collected, compromised, 
terminated or settled in accordance with regulation published under the 
authority of 31 U.S.C. 3726 (see 41 CFR part 101-41, administered by the 
Director, Office of Transportation Audits) and are otherwise exempted 
from this part.

<R05>
Sec. 105-55.019  Compromise of claims.

    (a) The standards set forth in this section apply to the compromise 
of debts pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3711. The General Services Administration 
(GSA) may exercise such compromise authority for debts arising out of 
activities of, or referred or transferred for collection services to, 
the Agency when the amount of the debt then due, exclusive of interest, 
penalties, and administrative costs, does not exceed $100,000 or any 
higher amount authorized by the Attorney General. The Administrator may 
designate other GSA officials to exercise the authorities in this 
section.
    (b) Unless otherwise provided by law, when the principal balance of 
a debt, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, 
exceeds $100,000 or any higher amount authorized by the Attorney 
General, the authority to accept the compromise rests with the 
Department of Justice. GSA will evaluate the compromise offer, using the 
factors set forth in Sec. 105-55.020. If an offer to compromise any 
debt in excess of $100,000 is acceptable to the Agency, GSA will refer 
the debt to the Civil Division or other appropriate litigating division 
in the Department of Justice using a Claims Collection Litigation 
Report. The referral will include appropriate financial information and 
a recommendation for the acceptance of the compromise offer. Justice 
Department approval is not required if GSA rejects a compromise offer.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.020  Bases for compromise.

    (a) The General Services Administration (GSA) may compromise a debt 
if the full amount cannot be collected because--
    (1) The debtor is unable to pay the full amount in a reasonable 
time, as verified through credit reports or other financial information.
    (2) GSA is unable to collect the debt in full within a reasonable 
time by enforced collection proceedings.
    (3) The cost of collecting the debt does not justify the enforced 
collection of the full amount.
    (4) There is significant doubt concerning the Government's ability 
to prove its case in court.
    (b) In determining the debtor's inability to pay, GSA will consider 
relevant factors such as the following:
    (1) Age and health of the debtor.
    (2) Present and potential income.
    (3) Inheritance prospects.
    (4) The possibility that assets have been concealed or improperly 
transferred by the debtor.
    (5) The availability of assets or income that may be realized by 
enforced collection proceedings.
    (c) GSA will verify the debtor's claim of inability to pay by using 
a credit report and other financial information as provided in paragraph 
(g) of this section. GSA will consider the applicable exemptions 
available to the debtor under State and Federal law in determining the 
Government's ability to enforce collection. GSA also may consider 
uncertainty as to the price that collateral or other property will bring 
at a forced sale in determining the Government's ability to enforce 
collection. A compromise effected under this section will be for an 
amount that bears a reasonable relation to the amount that can be 
recovered by enforced collection procedures, with regard to the 
exemptions available to the debtor and the time that collection will 
take.
    (d) If there is significant doubt concerning the Government's 
ability to prove its case in court for the full amount claimed, either 
because of the legal issues involved or because of a bona fide dispute 
as to the facts, then the amount accepted in compromise of such cases 
will fairly reflect the probabilities of successful prosecution to 
judgment, with due regard given to the availability of witnesses and 
other evidentiary support for the Government's claim. In determining the 
litigative risks involved, GSA will consider the probable amount of 
court costs and attorney fees pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice 
Act, 28 U.S.C. 2412 that may be imposed against the Government if it is 
unsuccessful in litigation.
    (e) GSA may compromise a debt if the cost of collecting the debt 
does not justify the enforced collection of the full amount. The amount 
accepted in compromise in such cases may reflect

[[Page 438]]

an appropriate discount for the administrative and litigative costs of 
collection, with consideration given to the time it will take to effect 
collection. Collection costs may be a substantial factor in the 
settlement of small debts. In determining whether the cost of collection 
justifies enforced collection of the full amount, GSA will consider 
whether continued collection of the debt, regardless of cost, is 
necessary to further an enforcement principle, such as the Government's 
willingness to pursue aggressively defaulting and uncooperative debtors.
    (f) GSA generally will not accept compromises payable in 
installments. This is not an advantageous form of compromise in terms of 
time and administrative expense. If, however, payment of a compromise in 
installments is necessary, GSA will obtain a legally enforceable written 
agreement providing that, in the event of default, the full original 
principal balance of the debt prior to compromise, less sums paid 
thereon, is reinstated. Whenever possible, GSA will obtain security for 
repayment in the manner set forth in Sec. 105-55.015.
    (g) To assess the merits of a compromise offer based in whole or in 
part on the debtor's inability to pay the full amount of a debt within a 
reasonable time, GSA may obtain a current financial statement from the 
debtor, executed under penalty of perjury, showing the debtor's assets, 
liabilities, income and expenses. GSA also may obtain credit reports or 
other financial information to assess compromise offers. GSA may use 
their own financial information form or may request suitable forms from 
the Department of Justice or the local United States Attorney's Office.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.021  Enforcement policy.

    Pursuant to this section, the General Services Administration may 
compromise statutory penalties, forfeitures, or claims established as an 
aid to enforcement and to compel compliance, if the Agency's enforcement 
policy in terms of deterrence and securing compliance, present and 
future, will be adequately served by the Agency's acceptance of the sum 
to be agreed upon.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.022  Joint and several liability.

    (a) When two or more debtors are jointly and severally liable, the 
General Services Administration (GSA) may pursue collection activity 
against all debtors, as appropriate. GSA will not attempt to allocate 
the burden of payment between the debtors but will proceed to liquidate 
the indebtedness as quickly as possible.
    (b) GSA will ensure that a compromise agreement with one debtor does 
not release the Agency's claim against the remaining debtors. The amount 
of a compromise with one debtor will not be considered a precedent or 
binding in determining the amount that will be required from other 
debtors jointly and severally liable on the claim.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.023  Further review of compromise offers.

    If the General Services Administration (GSA) is uncertain whether to 
accept a firm, written, substantive compromise offer on a debt that is 
within the Agency's delegated compromise authority, it may refer the 
offer to the Civil Division or other appropriate litigating division in 
the Department of Justice (DOJ), using a Claims Collection Litigation 
Report accompanied by supporting data and particulars concerning the 
debt. DOJ may act upon such an offer or return it to GSA with 
instructions or advice.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.024  Consideration of tax consequences to the Government.

    In negotiating a compromise, the General Services Administration 
(GSA) may consider the tax consequences to the Government. In 
particular, GSA may consider requiring a waiver of tax-loss-carry-
forward and tax-loss-carry-back rights of the debtor. For information on 
discharge of indebtedness reporting requirements see Sec. 105-55.030.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.025  Mutual releases of the debtor and the Government.

    In all appropriate instances, a compromise that is accepted by the 
General Services Administration may be implemented by means of a mutual 
release, in which the debtor is released from further non-tax liability 
on the compromised debt in consideration of

[[Page 439]]

payment in full of the compromise amount and the Government and its 
officials, past and present, are released and discharged from any and 
all claims and causes of action arising from the same transaction that 
the debtor may have. In the event a mutual release is not executed when 
a debt is compromised, unless prohibited by law, the debtor is still 
deemed to have waived any and all claims and causes of action against 
the Government and its officials related to the transaction giving rise 
to the compromised debt.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.026  Suspending or terminating collection activity.

    (a) The standards set forth in Sec. Sec. 105-55.027 and 105-55.028 
apply to the suspension or termination of collection activity pursuant 
to 31 U.S.C. 3711 on debts that do not exceed $100,000, or such other 
amount as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest, 
penalties, and administrative costs, after deducting the amount of 
partial payments or collections, if any. Prior to referring a debt to 
the Department of Justice (DOJ) for litigation, the General Services 
Administration (GSA) may suspend or terminate collection under this part 
with respect to debts arising out of activities of, or referred or 
transferred for collection services to, the Agency.
    (b) If, after deducting the amount of any partial payments or 
collections, the principal amount of a debt exceeds $100,000, or such 
other amount as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest, 
penalties, and administrative costs, the authority to suspend or 
terminate rests solely with DOJ. If GSA believes suspension or 
termination of any debt in excess of $100,000 may be appropriate, the 
Agency will refer the debt to the Civil Division or other appropriate 
litigating division in DOJ, using the Claims Collection Litigation 
Report. The referral will specify the reasons for the Agency's 
recommendation. If, prior to referral to DOJ, GSA determines a debt is 
plainly erroneous or clearly without legal merit, the Agency may 
terminate collection activity regardless of the amount involved without 
obtaining DOJ concurrence.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.027  Suspension of collection activity.

    (a) The General Services Administration (GSA) may suspend collection 
activity on a debt when--
    (1) The Agency cannot locate the debtor;
    (2) The debtor's financial condition is expected to improve; or
    (3) The debtor has requested a waiver or review of the debt.
    (b) Based on the current financial condition of the debtor, GSA may 
suspend collection activity on a debt when the debtor's future prospects 
justify retention of the debt for periodic review and collection 
activity and--
    (1) The applicable statute of limitations has not expired; or
    (2) Future collection can be effected by administrative offset, 
notwithstanding the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations 
for litigation of claims, with due regard to the 10-year limitation for 
administrative offset prescribed by 31 U.S.C. 3716(e)(1); or
    (3) The debtor agrees to pay interest on the amount of the debt on 
which collection will be suspended, and such suspension is likely to 
enhance the debtor's ability to pay the full amount of the principal of 
the debt with interest at a later date.
    (c)(1) GSA will suspend collection activity during the time required 
for consideration of the debtor's request for waiver or administrative 
review of the debt if the statute under which the request is sought 
prohibits the Agency from collecting the debt during that time.
    (2) If the statute under which the request is sought does not 
prohibit collection activity pending consideration of the request, GSA 
will use discretion, on a case-by-case basis, to suspend collection. 
Further, GSA ordinarily will suspend collection action upon a request 
for waiver or review if the Agency is prohibited by statute or 
regulation from issuing a refund of amounts collected prior to Agency 
consideration of the debtor's request. However, GSA will not suspend 
collection when the Agency determines the request for waiver or review 
is frivolous or was made primarily to delay collection.
    (d) When GSA learns a bankruptcy petition has been filed with 
respect to

[[Page 440]]

a debtor, in most cases the collection activity on a debt will be 
suspended, pursuant to the provisions of 11 U.S.C. 362, 1201, and 1301, 
unless the Agency can clearly establish the automatic stay has been 
lifted or is no longer in effect. GSA will, if legally permitted, take 
the necessary legal steps to ensure no funds or money are paid by the 
Agency to the debtor until relief from the automatic stay is obtained.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.028  Termination of collection activity.

    (a) The General Services Administration (GSA) may terminate 
collection activity when--
    (1) The Agency is unable to collect any substantial amount through 
its own efforts or through the efforts of others;
    (2) The Agency is unable to locate the debtor;
    (3) Costs of collection are anticipated to exceed the amount 
recoverable;
    (4) The debt is legally without merit or enforcement of the debt is 
barred by any applicable statute of limitations;
    (5) The debt cannot be substantiated; or
    (6) The debt against the debtor has been discharged in bankruptcy.
    (b) Before terminating collection activity, GSA will pursue all 
appropriate means of collection and determine, based upon the results of 
the collection activity, that the debt is uncollectible. Termination of 
collection activity ceases active collection of the debt. The 
termination of collection activity does not preclude GSA from retaining 
a record of the account for purposes of--
    (1) Selling the debt, if the Secretary determines that such sale is 
in the best interests of the United States;
    (2) Pursuing collection at a subsequent date in the event there is a 
change in the debtor's status or a new collection tool becomes 
available;
    (3) Offsetting against future income or assets not available at the 
time of termination of collection activity; or
    (4) Screening future applicants of loans and loan guaranties, 
licenses, permits, or privileges for prior indebtedness.
    (c) Generally, GSA will terminate collection activity on a debt that 
has been discharged in bankruptcy, regardless of the amount. GSA may 
continue collection activity, however, subject to the provisions of the 
Bankruptcy Code, for any payments provided under a plan of 
reorganization. Offset and recoupment rights may survive the discharge 
of the debtor in bankruptcy and, under some circumstances, claims also 
may survive the discharge. For example, the claims of GSA that it is a 
known creditor of a debtor may survive a discharge if the Agency did not 
receive formal notice of the proceedings.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.029  Exception to termination.

    When a significant enforcement policy is involved, or recovery of a 
judgment is a prerequisite to the imposition of administrative 
sanctions, the General Services Administration may refer debts for 
litigation even though termination of collection activity may otherwise 
be appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.030  Discharge of indebtedness; reporting requirements.

    (a) Before discharging a delinquent debt (also referred to as a 
close out of the debt), the General Services Administration (GSA) will 
take all appropriate steps to collect the debt in accordance with 31 
U.S.C. 3711(g), including, as applicable, administrative offset, tax 
refund offset, Federal salary offset, referral to Treasury, Treasury-
designated debt collection centers or private collection contractors, 
credit bureau reporting, wage garnishment, litigation, and foreclosure. 
Discharge of indebtedness is distinct from termination or suspension of 
collection activity and is governed by the Internal Revenue Code. When 
collection action on a debt is suspended or terminated, the debt remains 
delinquent and further collection action may be pursued at a later date 
in accordance with the standards set forth in this part. When GSA 
discharges a debt in full or in part, further collection action is 
prohibited. Therefore, GSA will make the determination that collection 
action is no longer warranted before discharging a debt. Before 
discharging a debt, GSA will terminate debt collection action.

[[Page 441]]

    (b) Section 3711(i), Title 31, United States Code, requires GSA to 
sell a delinquent non-tax debt upon termination of collection action if 
the Secretary determines such a sale is in the best interests of the 
United States. Since the discharge of a debt precludes any further 
collection action (including the sale of a delinquent debt), GSA may not 
discharge a debt until the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3711(i) have been 
met.
    (c) Upon discharge of a debt of more than $600, GSA must report the 
discharge to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in accordance with the 
requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6050P and 26 CFR 1.6050P-1. GSA may request 
Treasury or Treasury-designated debt collection centers to file such a 
discharge report to the IRS on the Agency's behalf.
    (d) When discharging a debt, GSA will request the GSA Office of 
General Counsel to release any liens of record securing the debt.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.031  Prompt referral to the Department of Justice.

    (a) The General Services Administration (GSA) will promptly refer to 
the Department of Justice (DOJ) for litigation debts on which aggressive 
collection activity has been taken in accordance with Sec. 105-55.009 
and that cannot be compromised, or on which collection activity cannot 
be suspended or terminated, in accordance with Sec. Sec. 105-55.027 and 
105-55.028. GSA may refer those debts arising out of activities of, or 
referred or transferred for collection services to, the Agency. Debts 
for which the principal amount is over $1,000,000, or such other amount 
as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest and penalties, 
will be referred to the Civil Division or other division responsible for 
litigating such debts at DOJ, Washington, DC. Debts for which the 
principal amount is $1,000,000, or less, or such other amount as the 
Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest or penalties, will be 
referred to DOJ's Nationwide Central Intake Facility as required by the 
Claims Collection Litigation Report instructions. Debts will be referred 
as early as possible, consistent with aggressive GSA collection activity 
and the observance of the standards contained in this part, and, in any 
event, well within the period for initiating timely lawsuits against the 
debtors. GSA will make every effort to refer delinquent debts to DOJ for 
litigation within one year of the date such debts last became 
delinquent. In the case of guaranteed or insured loans, GSA will make 
every effort to refer these delinquent debts to DOJ for litigation 
within one year from the date the loan was presented to the Agency for 
payment or re-insurance.
    (b) DOJ has exclusive jurisdiction over the debts referred to it 
pursuant to this section. GSA, as the referring agency, will immediately 
terminate the use of any administrative collection activities to collect 
a debt at the time of the referral of that debt to DOJ. GSA will advise 
DOJ of the collection activities which have been utilized to date, and 
their result. GSA will refrain from having any contact with the debtor 
and will direct all debtor inquiries concerning the debt to DOJ, except 
as otherwise agreed between GSA and DOJ. GSA will immediately notify DOJ 
of any payments credited by the Agency to the debtor's account after 
referral of a debt under this section. DOJ will notify GSA of any 
payments it receives from the debtor.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.032  Claims Collection Litigation Report.

    (a) Unless excepted by the Department of Justice (DOJ), the General 
Services Administration (GSA) will complete the Claims Collection 
Litigation Report (CCLR) (see Sec. 105-55.019(b)), accompanied by a 
signed Certificate of Indebtedness, to refer all administratively 
uncollectible claims to DOJ for litigation. GSA will complete all 
sections of the CCLR appropriate to each claim as required by the CCLR 
instructions and furnish such other information as may be required in 
specific cases.
    (b) GSA will indicate clearly on the CCLR the actions DOJ should 
take with respect to the referred claim. The CCLR permits the Agency to 
indicate specifically any of a number of litigative activities which DOJ 
may pursue, including enforced collection, judgment lien only, renew 
judgment

[[Page 442]]

lien only, renew judgment lien and enforce collection, program 
enforcement, foreclosure only, and foreclosure and deficiency judgment.
    (c) GSA also will use the CCLR to refer claims to DOJ to obtain 
approval of any proposals to compromise the claims or to suspend or 
terminate Agency collection activity.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.033  Preservation of evidence.

    The General Services Administration (GSA) will take care to preserve 
all files and records that may be needed by the Department of Justice 
(DOJ) to prove their claims in court. GSA ordinarily will include 
certified copies of the documents that form the basis for the claim in 
the packages referring their claims to DOJ for litigation. GSA will 
provide originals of such documents immediately upon request by DOJ.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.034  Minimum amount of referrals to the Department

of Justice.

    (a) The General Services Administration (GSA) will not refer for 
litigation claims of less than $2,500, exclusive of interest, penalties, 
and administrative costs, or such other amount as the Attorney General 
shall from time to time prescribe. The Department of Justice (DOJ) will 
notify GSA if the Attorney General changes this minimum amount.
    (b) GSA will not refer claims of less than the minimum amount 
unless--
    (1) Litigation to collect such smaller claims is important to ensure 
compliance with the Agency's policies or programs;
    (2) The claim is being referred solely for the purpose of securing a 
judgment against the debtor, which will be filed as a lien against the 
debtor's property pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 3201 and returned to GSA for 
enforcement; or
    (3) The debtor has the clear ability to pay the claim and the 
Government effectively can enforce payment, with due regard for the 
exemptions available to the debtor under State and Federal law and the 
judicial remedies available to the Government.
    (c) GSA will consult with the Financial Litigation Staff of the 
Executive Office for United States Attorneys in DOJ prior to referring 
claims valued at less than the minimum amount.

<R04>
  Subpart A_Salary Offset of General Services Administration Employees


<R05>
Sec. 105-56.001  Scope.

    (a) This subpart covers internal GSA collections under 5 U.S.C. 
5514. It applies when certain debts to the United States are recovered 
by administrative offset from the disposable pay of a GSA employee or a 
cross-serviced agency employee, except in situations where the employee 
consents to the recovery.
    (b) The collection of any amount under this subpart will be in 
accordance with the standards promulgated pursuant to the Debt 
Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA), 31 U.S.C. 3701 et seq., and 
the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 31 CFR parts 900 through 904 as 
amended, or in accordance with any other statutory authority for the 
collection of claims of the United States or any Federal agency.


<R05>
Sec. 105-56.002  Excluded debts or claims.

    This subpart does not apply to the following:
    (a) Debts or claims arising under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 
as amended (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301 
et seq.), or the tariff laws of the United States.
    (b) Any case where collection of a debt by salary offset is 
explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute. Debt 
collection procedures under other statutory authorities, however, must 
be consistent with the provisions of the Federal Claims Collection 
Standards, defined at paragraph (h) of Sec. 105-56.003.
    (c) An employee election of coverage or of a change of coverage 
under a Federal benefits program that requires periodic deductions from 
pay if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods 
or less. However, if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over

this subpart will apply.
    (d) Routine adjustment in pay or allowances that is made to correct 
an overpayment of pay attributable to clerical or administrative errors 
or delays in processing pay documents, if the overpayment occurred

written notice of the nature and amount of the adjustment.
    (e) Any adjustment to collect a debt amounting to $50 or less, if,

Benefits Insurance (HBI) premiums as the result of an employee's 
election to continue health insurance coverage during periods of leave 
without pay (LWOP), or when pay is insufficient to cover premiums. Debt 
collection procedures for unpaid HBI are covered under 5 CFR part 890,

any other applicable statutory authority;
    (m) Any other rights and remedies available to the employee under 
statutes or regulations governing the program for which the collection 
is being made;
    (n) The employee's right to a prompt refund if amounts paid or 
deducted are later waived or found not owed, unless otherwise provided 
by law (see Sec. 105-56.012 of this subpart);
    (o) The specific address to which all correspondence must be

<R05>
Sec. 105-56.005  Employee response.

    (a) Voluntary repayment agreement. An employee may submit a request 
to the appropriate program official who signed the pre-offset notice to 
enter into a written repayment agreement of the debt in lieu of offset. 
The request must be made within 7 days of receipt of notice under Sec. 
105-56.004 of this subpart. The agreement must be in writing, signed by 
both the employee and the appropriate program official making the 
notice, and a signed copy must be sent to the appropriate Finance Center 
serving the program activity. Acceptance of such an agreement is 
discretionary with the Agency. An employee who enters into such an 
agreement may, nevertheless, seek a waiver under paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (b) Waiver. An employee may submit a signed waiver request of 
overpayment

[[Page 446]]

of pay or allowances (e.g., 5 U.S.C. 5584, 10 U.S.C. 2774, or 32 U.S.C. 
716) to the GSA National Payroll Center (NPC). When an employee requests 
waiver consideration, further collection on the debt may be suspended 
until a final administrative decision is made on the waiver request. 
During the period of any suspension, interest, penalties and 
administrative charges may be held in abeyance. GSA will not duplicate, 
for purposes of salary offset, any of the notices/procedures already 
provided the debtor prior to a request for waiver.
    (c) Reconsideration. (1) An employee may seek a reconsideration of 
GSA's determination regarding the existence and/or amount of the debt. 
The request must be submitted to the appropriate program official 
indicated in the pre-offset notice, within 7 days of receipt of notice 
under Sec. 105-56.004 of this subpart. Within 20 days of receipt of 
this notice, the employee must submit a detailed statement of reasons 
for reconsideration that must be accompanied by supporting 
documentation.
    (2) An employee may request a reconsideration of the proposed offset 
schedule. The request must be submitted to the appropriate program 
official indicated in the pre-offset notice, within 7 days of receipt of 
notice under Sec. 105-56.004 of this subpart. Within 20 days of receipt 
of this notice, the employee must submit an alternative repayment 
schedule accompanied by a detailed statement, supported by 
documentation, evidencing financial hardship resulting from GSA's 
proposed schedule. Acceptance of the request is at GSA's discretion. GSA 
will notify the employee in writing of its decision concerning the 
request to reduce the rate of an involuntary deduction.


<R05>
Sec. 105-56.006  Petition for pre-offset hearing.

    (a) The employee may request a pre-offset hearing by filing a 
written petition with the appropriate program official indicated in the 
pre-offset notice, within 15 days of receipt of the written notice. The 
petition must state why the employee believes GSA's determination 
concerning the existence and/or amount of the debt is in error, set 
forth any objections to the involuntary repayment schedule, and, if the 
employee is seeking an oral hearing, set forth reasons for an oral 
hearing. The timely filing of a petition will suspend the commencement 
of collection proceedings.
    (b) The employee's petition or statement must be signed and dated by 
the employee.
    (c) Petitions for hearing made after the expiration of the 15-day 
period may be accepted if the employee can show that the delay was 
because of circumstances beyond his or her control or because of failure 
to receive notice of the time limit.
    (d) If the employee timely requests a pre-offset hearing or the 
timeliness is waived, the appropriate program official must--
    (1) Promptly notify the GSBCA and arrange for a hearing official 
(see Sec. 105-56.003(m) of this subpart). The hearing official will 
notify the employee whether he or she may have an oral or a ``paper 
hearing,'' i.e., a review on the written record (see 31 CFR 901.3(e)); 
and
    (2) Provide the hearing official with a copy of all records on which 
the determination of the debt and any involuntary repayment schedule are 
based.
    (e) If an oral hearing is to be held, the hearing official will 
notify the appropriate program official and the employee of the date, 
time, and location of the hearing. The debtor may choose to have the 
hearing conducted in the hearing official's office located at GSA 
Central Office, 1800 F St., NW., Washington, DC 20405, at another 
location designated by the hearing official, or by telephone. The debtor 
and any witnesses are responsible for any personal expenses incurred to 
arrive at a hearing official's office or other designated location (see 
Sec. 105-56.007(c)). All telephonic charges incurred during a hearing 
will be the responsibility of GSA.
    (f) If the employee later elects to have the hearing based only on 
the written submissions, notification must be given to the hearing 
official and the appropriate program official at least 3 days before the 
date of the oral hearing. The hearing official may waive the 3-day 
requirement for good cause.
    (g) If either party, without good cause as determined by the hearing 
official, does not appear at a scheduled oral hearing, the hearing 
official will

[[Page 447]]

make a determination on the claim which takes into account that party's 
position as presented in writing only.


<R05>
Sec. 105-56.007  Pre-offset oral hearing.

    (a) The Agency, represented by the appropriate program official or a 
representative of the Office of General Counsel, and the employee, and/
or his or her representative, will explain their case in the form of an 
oral presentation with reference to the documentation submitted. The 
employee may testify on his or her own behalf, subject to cross-
examination. Other witnesses may be called to testify when the hearing 
official determines the testimony to be relevant and not redundant. All 
witnesses will testify under oath, with the oath having been 
administered by the hearing official. A written transcript of the 
hearing will be kept and made available to either party in the event of 
an appeal under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701-706. 
Arrangements for the taking of the transcript will be made by the 
hearing official, and all charges associated with the taking of the 
transcript will be the responsibility of GSA.
    (b) The hearing official will--
    (1) Conduct a fair and impartial hearing; and
    (2) Preside over the course of the hearing, maintain decorum, and 
avoid delay in the disposition of the hearing.
    (c) The employee may represent himself or herself or may be 
represented by another person of his or her choice at the hearing. GSA 
will not compensate the employee for representation expenses, including 
hourly fees for attorneys, travel expenses, and costs for reproducing 
documents.
    (d) Oral hearings are open to the public. However, the hearing 
official may close all or any portion of the hearing when doing so is in 
the best interests of the employee or the Agency.
    (e) Oral hearings may be conducted by telephone at the request of 
the employee. All telephonic charges incurred during a hearing will be 
the responsibility of GSA.
    (f) The hearing official may request written submissions and 
documentation from the employee and the Agency, in addition to 
considering evidence offered at the hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 105-56.008  Pre-offset paper hearing.

    If a hearing is to be held only upon written submissions, the 
hearing official will issue a decision based upon the record and 
responses submitted by both the Agency and the employee. See Sec. 105-
56.006 of this subpart. If either party, without good cause as 
determined by the hearing official, does not provide written submissions 
and documentation requested by the hearing official, the hearing 
official will make a determination on the claim without reference to 
such submissions and documentation.


<R05>
Sec. 105-56.009  Written decision.

    (a) Within 60 days of the employee's filing of a petition for a pre-
offset hearing, the hearing official will issue a written decision 
setting forth--
    (1) The facts supporting the nature and origin of the debt;
    (2) The hearing official's analysis, findings and conclusions as to 
the employee's or Agency's grounds;
    (3) The amount and validity of the debt; and
    (4) The repayment schedule, if applicable.
    (b) The hearing official's decision will be the final Agency action 
for the purposes of judicial review under the Administrative Procedure 
Act (5 U.S.C. 701 et seq.).


<R05>
Sec. 105-56.010  Deductions.

    (a) When deductions may begin. Deductions may begin upon the 
issuance of an Agency decision on a request for reconsideration or 
waiver (except as provided in Sec. 105-56.005(b) of this subpart) or 
the issuance of a decision in a pre-offset hearing. In no event will 
deductions begin sooner than thirty days from the date of the notice 
letter. If the employee filed a petition for hearing with the 
appropriate program official before the expiration of the period 
provided for in Sec. 105-56.006 of this subpart, then deductions will 
begin after the hearing official has provided the employee with a 
hearing and the final written decision. The appropriate program official 
will coordinate with the National Payroll Center to begin offset in 
accordance with the final written decision.

[[Page 448]]

    (b) Retired or separated employees. If the employee retires, 
resigns, or is terminated before collection of the indebtedness is 
completed, the remaining indebtedness will be offset from any subsequent 
payments of any nature. If the debt cannot be satisfied from subsequent 
payments, then the debt will be collected according to the procedures 
for administrative offset pursuant to Sec. 105-55.011 of this subpart.
    (c) Types of collection. A debt may be collected in one lump sum or 
in installments. Collection will be by lump sum unless the employee is 
able to demonstrate to the program official who signed the notice letter 
that he or she is financially unable to pay in one lump sum. In these 
cases, collection will be by installment deductions. Involuntary 
deductions from pay may not exceed 15 percent of disposable pay.
    (d) Methods of collection. If the debt cannot be collected in one 
lump sum, the debt will be collected by deductions at officially 
established pay intervals from an employee's current pay account, unless 
the employee and the appropriate program official agree to an 
alternative repayment schedule. The alternative arrangement must be in 
writing and signed by both the employee and the appropriate program 
official.
    (1) Installment deductions. Installment deductions will be made over 
the shortest period possible. The size and frequency of installment 
deductions will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and 
the employee's ability to pay. However, the amount deducted for any 
period will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the 
deduction is made, unless the employee has agreed in writing to the 
deduction of a greater amount. The installment payment normally will be 
sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the debt in three (3) 
years or less, unless circumstances warrant a longer period. Installment 
payments of less than $100 per pay period will be accepted only in the 
most unusual circumstances.
    (2) Sources of deductions. GSA will make salary deductions only from 
basic pay, special pay, incentive pay, retired pay, retainer pay, or in 
the case of an employee not entitled to basic pay, other authorized pay.
    (e) Non-Salary payments. The receipt of collections from salary 
offsets does not preclude GSA from pursuing other debt collection 
remedies, including the offset of other Federal payments to satisfy 
delinquent non-tax debt owed to the United States. GSA will pursue, when 
appropriate, such debt collection remedies separately or in conjunction 
with salary offset.
    (f) Interest, penalties and administrative costs. Interest, 
penalties and administrative costs on debts under this subpart will be 
assessed according to the provisions of Sec. 105-55.016 of this 
subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 105-56.011  Non-waiver of rights.

    An employee's involuntary payment of all or any portion of a debt 
being collected under 5 U.S.C. 5514 will not be construed as a waiver of 
any rights which the employee may have under 5 U.S.C. 5514 or any other 
provision of contract or law unless there are statutory or contractual 
provisions to the contrary.


<R05>
Sec. 105-56.012  Refunds.

    (a) GSA will promptly refund to the employee any amounts offset 
under these regulations when a debt is waived or otherwise found not 
owing the United States (unless expressly prohibited by statute or 
regulation), or GSA is directed by an administrative or judicial order 
to refund amounts deducted from the employee's current pay or withheld 
from non-salary payments.
    (b) Unless required by Federal law or contract, refunds under this 
subpart will not bear interest.


<R05>
Sec. 105-56.013  Coordinating offset with another Federal agency.

    GSA participates in the Centralized Salary Offset (CSO) program (see 
subparts B and C of this part). In those instances when CSO cannot be 
utilized (i.e., when another agency does not participate in the 
program), the following procedures apply:
    (a) When GSA is the creditor agency. When GSA is owed a debt by an 
employee of another agency, GSA will provide the paying agency with a 
written certification that the debtor owes GSA a debt and that GSA has 
complied

[[Page 449]]

with these regulations. This certification will include the amount and 
basis of the debt, the due date of the payment, or the beginning date of 
installment payments, if any.
    (b) When another agency is the creditor agency. (1) GSA may use 
salary offset against one of its employees or cross-serviced agency 
employees who is indebted to another agency if requested to do so by 
that agency. Any such request must be accompanied by a certification 
from the requesting agency that the person owes the debt, the amount of 
the debt and that the employee has been given the procedural rights 
required by 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K.
    (2) The creditor agency must advise GSA of the number of 
installments to be collected, the amount of each installment, and the 
beginning date of the first installment if it is not the next 
established pay period.
    (3) If GSA receives an improperly completed request, the creditor 
agency will be requested to supply the required information before any 
salary offset begins.
    (4) If the claim procedures in paragraph (b)(1) of this section have 
been properly completed, deductions will begin on the next established 
pay period unless a different period is requested by the creditor 
agency.
    (5) GSA will not review the merits of the creditor agency's 
determinations with respect to the amount and/or validity of the debt as 
stated in the debt claim certification.
    (6) If the employee begins separation action before GSA collects the 
total debt due the creditor agency, the following actions will be taken:
    (i) When possible, the balance owed the creditor agency will be 
liquidated from subsequent payments of any nature due the employee from 
GSA in accordance with 41 CFR part 105-55.011;
    (ii) If the total amount of the debt cannot be recovered, GSA will 
certify the total amount collected to the creditor agency and the 
employee;
    (iii) If GSA is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from 
the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, or other similar 
payments, such information will be provided to the creditor agency so a 
certified claim can be made against the payments.
    (7) If the employee transfers to another Federal agency before GSA 
collects the total amount due the creditor agency, GSA will certify the 
total amount collected to the creditor agency and the employee. It is 
the responsibility of the creditor agency to ensure that collection 
action is resumed by the new employing agency.

  Subpart B_Centralized Salary Offset (CSO) Procedures_GSA as Creditor 
                                 Agency


<R05>
Sec. 105-56.014  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart establishes procedures for the offset of Federal 
salary payments, through the Financial Management Service's (FMS) 
administrative offset program, to collect delinquent debts owed to the 
Federal Government. This process is known as centralized salary offset. 
Rules issued by the Office of Personnel Management contain the 
requirements Federal agencies must follow prior to conducting salary 
offset and the procedures for requesting offsets directly from a paying 
agency. See 5 CFR parts 550.1101 through 550.1108.
    (b) This subpart implements the requirement under 5 U.S.C. 5514 
(a)(1) that all Federal agencies, using a process known as centralized 
salary offset computer matching, identify Federal employees who owe 
delinquent non-tax debt to the United States. Centralized salary offset 
computer matching is the computerized comparison of delinquent debt 
records with records of Federal employees. The purpose of centralized 
salary offset computer matching is to identify those debtors whose 
Federal salaries should be offset to collect delinquent debts owed to 
the Federal Government.
    (c) This subpart specifies the delinquent debt records and Federal 
employee records that must be included in the salary offset matching 
process. For purposes of this subpart, delinquent debt records consist 
of the debt information submitted to FMS for purposes of administrative 
offset as required under 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(6). Since GSA submits debts 
to FMS for purposes of administrative offset, the Agency is

[[Page 450]]

not required to submit duplicate information for purposes of centralized 
salary offset computer matching under 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1) and this 
subpart.
    (d) An interagency consortium was established to implement 
centralized salary offset computer matching on a Governmentwide basis as 
required under 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1). Federal employee records consist of 
records of Federal salary payments disbursed by members of the 
consortium.
    (e) The receipt of collections from salary offsets does not preclude 
GSA from pursuing other debt collection remedies, including the offset 
of other Federal payments to satisfy delinquent non-tax debt owed to the 
United States. GSA will pursue, when appropriate, such debt collection 
remedies separately or in conjunction with salary offset.


<R05>
Sec. 105-56.015  Definitions.

    The following definitions apply to this subpart:
    (a) Administrative offset means withholding funds payable by the 
United States to, or held by the United States for, a person to satisfy 
a debt owed by the payee.
    (b) Agency means a department, agency or sub-agency, court, court 
administrative office, or instrumentality in the executive, judicial, or 
legislative branch of the Federal government, including government 
corporations.
    (c) Centralized salary offset computer matching means the 
computerized comparison of Federal employee records with delinquent debt 
records to identify Federal employees who owe such debts.
    (d) Consortium means an interagency group established by the 
Secretary of the Treasury to implement centralized salary offset 
computer matching. The group includes all agencies that disburse Federal 
salary payments.
    (e) Creditor agency means any agency that is owed a debt, including 
a debt collection center when acting on behalf of a creditor agency in 
matters pertaining to the collection of a debt.
    (f) Debt means any amount of money, funds, or property that has been 
determined by an appropriate official of the Federal government to be 
owed to the United States by a person, including debt administered by a 
third party acting as an agent for the Federal Government. For purposes 
of this subpart, the term ``debt'' does not include debts arising under 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.).
    (g) Delinquent debt record means information about a past-due,

Sec. 105-56.024  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart establishes procedures for the offset of Federal 
salary payments, through the Financial Management Service's (FMS) 
administrative offset program, to collect delinquent debts owed to the 
Federal Government. This process is known as salary offset. Rules issued 
by the Office of Personnel Management contain the requirements Federal 
agencies must follow prior to conducting salary offset and the 
procedures for requesting offsets directly from a paying agency. See 5 
CFR parts 550.1101 through 550.1108.
    (b) This subpart implements the requirement under 5 U.S.C. 
5514(a)(1) that all Federal agencies, using a process known as 
centralized salary offset computer matching, identify Federal employees 
who owe delinquent non-tax debt to the United States. Centralized salary 
offset computer matching is the computerized comparison of delinquent 
debt records with records of Federal employees. The purpose of 
centralized salary offset computer matching is to identify those debtors 
whose Federal salaries should be offset to collect delinquent debts owed 
to the Federal Government.
    (c) This subpart specifies the delinquent debt records and Federal 
employee records that must be included in the salary offset matching 
process. For purposes of this subpart, delinquent debt records consist 
of the debt information submitted to FMS for purposes of administrative 
offset as required under 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(6).
    (d) An interagency consortium was established to implement 
centralized salary offset computer matching on a Governmentwide basis as 
required under 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1). Federal employee records consist of 
records of Federal salary payments disbursed by members of the 
consortium.

Sec. 105-57.001  Purpose, authority and scope.

    (a) This part provides standards and procedures for GSA to collect 
money from a debtor's disposable pay by means of administrative wage 
garnishment to satisfy delinquent non-tax debt owed to the United 
States.
    (b) These standards and procedures are authorized under the wage 
garnishment provisions of the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, 
codified at 31 U.S.C. 3720D, and Department of the Treasury Wage 
Garnishment Regulations at 31 CFR 285.11.
    (c) Scope. (1) This part applies to any GSA program that gives rise 
to a delinquent non-tax debt owed to the United States and that pursues 
recovery of such debt.
    (2) This part will apply notwithstanding any provision of State law.
    (3) Nothing in this part precludes the compromise of a debt or the 
suspension or termination of collection action in accordance with 
applicable law. See, for example, the Federal Claims Collection 
Standards (FCCS), 31 CFR parts 900 through 904.
    (4) The receipt of payments pursuant to this part does not preclude 
GSA from pursuing other debt collection remedies, including the offset 
of Federal payments to satisfy delinquent non-tax debt owed to the 
United States.
    GSA may pursue such debt collection remedies separately or in 
conjunction with administrative wage garnishment.
    (5) This part does not apply to the collection of delinquent non-tax 
debt owed to the United States from the wages of Federal employees from 
their Federal employment. Federal pay is subject to the Federal salary 
offset procedures set forth in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and other applicable laws. 
GSA standards and procedures for offsetting Federal wage payments are 
stated in 41 CFR part 105-56.
    (6) Nothing in this part requires GSA to duplicate notices or 
administrative proceedings required by contract or other laws or 
regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 105-57.002  Definitions.

    (a) Administrative offset, as defined in 31 U.S.C. 3701(a)(1), means 
withholding funds payable by the United States (including funds payable 
by the United States on behalf of a State government) to, or held by the 
United States for, a person to satisfy a claim.
    (b) Business day means Monday through Friday, excluding Federal 
legal holidays. For purposes of computation, the last day of the period 
will be included unless it is a Federal legal holiday.
    (c) Day means calendar day. For purposes of computation, the last 
day of the period will be included unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or 
a Federal legal holiday.
    (d) Debtor means an individual who owes a delinquent non-tax debt to 
the United States.
    (e) ``Delinquent'' or ``past-due'' non-tax debt means any non-tax 
debt that has not been paid by the date specified in GSA's initial 
written demand for payment or applicable agreement or instrument 
(including a post-delinquency payment agreement), unless other 
satisfactory payment arrangements have been made.
    (f) Disposable pay means that part of the debtor's compensation 
(including, but not limited to, salary, bonuses, commissions, and 
vacation pay) from an employer remaining after the deduction of health 
insurance premiums and any amounts required by law to be withheld. For 
purposes of this part,

[[Page 458]]

``amounts required by law to be withheld'' include amounts for 
deductions such as social security taxes and withholding taxes, but do 
not include any amount withheld pursuant to a court order.
    (g) Employer means a person or entity that employs the services of 
others and that pays their wages or salaries. The term employer 
includes, but is not limited to, State and local Governments, but does 
not include an agency of the Federal Government as defined by 31 CFR 
285.11(c).
    (h) Evidence of service means information retained by GSA indicating 
the nature of the document to which it pertains, the date of submission 
of the document, and to whom the document is being submitted. Evidence 
of service may be retained electronically or otherwise, so long as the 
manner of retention is sufficient for evidentiary purposes.
    (i) Financial hardship means an inability to meet basic living 
expenses for goods and services necessary for the survival of the debtor 
and his or her spouse and dependents. See Sec. 105-57.010 of this part.
    (j) For the purposes of the standards in this part, unless otherwise 
stated, the term ``Administrator'' refers to the Administrator of 
General Services or the Administrator's delegate.
    (k) For the purposes of the standards in this part, the terms 
``claim'' and ``debt'' are synonymous and interchangeable.
    They refer to an amount of money, funds, or property that has been 
determined by GSA to be due the United States from any person, 
organization, or entity, except another Federal agency, from sources 
which include loans insured or guaranteed by the United States and all 
other amounts due the United States from fees, leases, rents, royalties, 
services, sales of real or personal property, overpayments, penalties, 
damages, interest, fines and forfeitures and all other similar sources, 
including debt administered by a third party as an agent for the Federal 
Government. For the purposes of administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 
3716, the terms ``claim'' and ``debt'' include an amount of money, 
funds, or property owed by a person to a State (including past-due 
support being enforced by a State), the District of Columbia, American 
Samoa, Guam, the United States Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the 
Northern Mariana Islands, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
    (l) For the purposes of the standards in this part, unless otherwise 
stated, the terms ``GSA'' and ``Agency'' are synonymous and 
interchangeable.
    (m) For the purposes of the standards in this part, unless otherwise 
stated, ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the Treasury or the 
Secretary's delegate.
    (n) Garnishment means the process of withholding amounts from an 
employee's disposable pay and the paying of those amounts to GSA in 
satisfaction of a withholding order.
    (o) Hearing means a review of the documentary evidence concerning 
the existence and/or amount of a debt, and/or the terms of a repayment 
schedule, provided such repayment schedule is established other than by 
a written agreement entered into pursuant to this part. If the hearing 
official determines that the issues in dispute cannot be resolved solely 
by review of the written record, such as when the validity of the debt 
turns on the issue of credibility or veracity, an oral hearing may be 
provided.
    (p) Hearing official means a Board Judge of the GSA Board of 
Contract Appeals (GSBCA).
    (q) Withholding order means ``Wage Garnishment Order (SF 329B)'', 
issued by GSA. For purposes of this part, the terms ``wage garnishment 
order'' and ``garnishment order'' have the same meaning as ``withholding 
order.''
    (r) In this part, words in the plural form shall include the 
singular and vice versa, and words signifying the masculine gender shall 
include the feminine and vice versa. The terms ``includes'' and 
``including'' do not exclude matters not listed but do include matters 
that are in the same general class.


<R05>
Sec. 105-57.003  General rule.

    Whenever GSA determines a delinquent debt is owed by an individual, 
the Agency may initiate administrative proceedings to garnish the wages 
of the delinquent debtor.

[[Page 459]]


<R05>
Sec. 105-57.004  Notice requirements.

    (a) At least 30 days before the initiation of garnishment 
proceedings, GSA will send, by first class mail, overnight delivery 
service, or hand delivery to the debtor's last known address a written 
notice informing the debtor of--
    (1) The nature and amount of the debt;
    (2) The intention of GSA to initiate proceedings to collect the debt 
through deductions from pay until the debt and all accumulated interest, 
penalties and administrative costs are paid in full; and
    (3) The debtor's rights, including those set forth in paragraph (b) 
of this section, and the time frame within which the debtor may exercise 
his or her rights.
    (b) The debtor will be afforded the opportunity--
    (1) To inspect and copy Agency records related to the debt;
    (2) To enter into a written repayment agreement with GSA under terms 
agreeable to the Agency; and
    (3) To request a hearing in accordance with Sec. 105-57.005 of this 
part concerning the existence and/or amount of the debt, and/or the 
terms of the proposed repayment schedule under the garnishment order. 
However, the debtor is not entitled to a hearing concerning the terms of 
the proposed repayment schedule if these terms have been established by 
written agreement under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (c) The notice required by this section may be included with GSA's 
demand letter required by 41 CFR 105-55.010.
    (d) GSA will keep a copy of the evidence of service indicating the 
date of submission of the notice. The evidence of service may be 
retained electronically so long as the manner of retention is sufficient 
for evidentiary purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 105-57.005  Hearing.

    (a) GSA will provide a hearing, which at the hearing official's 
option may be oral or written, if within fifteen (15) business days of 
submission of the notice by GSA, the debtor submits a signed and dated 
written request for a hearing, to the official named in the notice, 
concerning the existence and/or amount of the debt, and/or the terms of 
the repayment schedule (for repayment schedules established other than 
by written agreement under Sec. 105-57.004(b)(2) of this part). A copy 
of the request for a hearing must also be sent to the GSA Board of 
Contract Appeals (GSBCA) at the address indicated in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section.
    (b) Types of hearing or review. (1) For purposes of this section, 
whenever GSA is required to afford a debtor a hearing, the hearing 
official will provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an 
oral hearing when he/she determines that the issues in dispute cannot be 
resolved by review of the documentary evidence, for example, when the 
validity of the claim turns on the issue of credibility or veracity.
    (2) If the hearing official determines that an oral hearing is 
appropriate, he/she will establish the time and location of the hearing. 
An oral hearing may, at the debtor's option, be conducted either in-
person or by telephone conference. In-person hearings will be conducted 
in the hearing official's office located at GSA Central Office, 1800 F 
St., NW., Washington, DC 20405, or at another location designated by the 
hearing official. All personal and travel expenses incurred by the 
debtor in connection with an in-person hearing will be borne by the 
debtor. All telephonic charges incurred during a hearing will be the 
responsibility of GSA.
    (3) The debtor may represent himself or herself or may be 
represented by another person of his or her choice at the hearing. GSA 
will not compensate the debtor for representation expenses, including 
hourly fees for attorneys, travel expenses, or costs for reproducing 
documents.
    (4) In those cases when an oral hearing is not required by this 
section, the hearing official will nevertheless conduct a ``paper 
hearing'', that is, the hearing official will decide the issues in 
dispute based upon a review of the written record. The hearing official 
will establish a reasonable deadline for the submission of evidence.
    (c) Subject to paragraph (k) of this section, if the debtor's 
written request is received by GSA on or before the 15th business day 
after the submission of the notice described in Sec. 105-57.004(a)

[[Page 460]]

of this part, the Agency will not issue a withholding order under Sec. 
105-57.006 of this part until the debtor has been provided the requested 
hearing and a decision in accordance with paragraphs (h) and (i) of this 
section has been rendered.
    (d) If the debtor's written request for a hearing is received by GSA 
after the 15th business day following the mailing of the notice 
described in Sec. 105-57.004(a) of this part, GSA may consider the 
request timely filed and provide a hearing if the debtor can show that 
the delay was because of circumstances beyond his or her control. 
However, GSA will not delay issuance of a withholding order unless the 
Agency determines that the delay in filing the request was caused by 
factors over which the debtor had no control, or GSA receives 
information that the Agency believes justifies a delay or cancellation 
of the withholding order.
    (e) After the debtor requests a hearing, the hearing official will 
notify the debtor of--
    (1) The date and time of a telephonic hearing;
    (2) The date, time, and location of an in-person oral hearing; or
    (3) The deadline for the submission of evidence for a written 
hearing.
    (f) Burden of proof. (1) GSA will have the burden of establishing 
the existence and/or amount of the debt.
    (2) Thereafter, if the debtor disputes the existence and/or amount 
of the debt, the debtor must prove by a preponderance of the evidence 
that no debt exists or that the amount of the debt is incorrect. In 
addition, the debtor may present evidence that the terms of the 
repayment schedule are unlawful, would cause a financial hardship to the 
debtor, or that collection of the debt may not be pursued due to 
operation of law.
    (g) The hearing official will arrange and maintain a written 
transcript of any hearing provided under this section. The transcript 
will be made available to either party in the event of an appeal under 
the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 through 706. All charges 
associated with the taking of the transcript will be the responsibility 
of GSA. A hearing is not required to be a formal evidentiary-type 
hearing; however, witnesses who testify in oral hearings will do so 
under oath or affirmation.
    (h) The hearing official will issue a written opinion stating his or 
her decision, as soon as practicable, but not later than sixty (60) days 
after the date on which the request for such hearing was received by 
GSA. If the hearing official is unable to provide the debtor with a 
hearing and render a decision within 60 days after the receipt of the 
request for such hearing--
    (1) GSA will not issue a withholding order until the hearing is held 
and a decision rendered; or
    (2) If GSA had previously issued a withholding order to the debtor's 
employer, the Agency will suspend the withholding order beginning on the 
61st day after the receipt of the hearing request and continuing until a 
hearing is held and a decision is rendered.
    (i) The written decision will include--
    (1) A summary of the facts presented;
    (2) The hearing official's findings, analysis and conclusions; and
    (3) The terms of any repayment schedules, if applicable.
    (j) The hearing official's decision will be the final Agency action 
for the purposes of judicial review under the Administrative Procedure 
Act (5 U.S.C. 701 et seq.).
    (k) In the absence of good cause shown, a debtor who fails to appear 
at a hearing scheduled pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, or to 
provide written submissions within the time set by the hearing official, 
will be deemed to have waived his or her right to appear and present 
evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 105-57.006  Wage garnishment order.

    (a) Unless GSA receives information it believes justifies a delay or 
cancellation of the withholding order, the Agency will send, by first 
class mail, overnight delivery service or hand delivery, a SF 329A 
(Letter to Employer & Important Notice to Employer), a SF 329B (Wage 
Garnishment Order), a SF 329C (Wage Garnishment Worksheet), and a SF 
329D (Employer Certification), to the debtor's employer--
    (1) Within 30 days after the debtor fails to make a timely request 
for a hearing (i.e., within 15 business days

[[Page 461]]

after the mailing of the notice described in Sec. 105-57.004(a) of this 
part); or
    (2) If a timely request for a hearing is made by the debtor, within 
30 days after a final decision is made by the hearing official to 
proceed with garnishment.
    (b) The withholding order sent to the employer under paragraph (a) 
of this section will contain the signature of, or the image of the 
signature of, the Administrator or his or her delegate. The order will 
contain only the information necessary for the employer to comply with 
the withholding order. Such information includes the debtor's name, 
address, and social security number, as well as instructions for 
withholding and information as to where payments are to be sent.
    (c) GSA will retain a copy of the evidence of service indicating the 
date of submission of the order. The evidence of service may be retained 
electronically so long as the manner of retention is sufficient for 
evidentiary purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 105-57.007  Certification by employer.

    The employer must complete and return the SF 329D (Employer 
Certification) to GSA within the time frame prescribed in the 
instructions to the form. The certification will address matters such as 
information about the debtor's employment status and disposable pay 
available for withholding.


<R05>
Sec. 105-57.008  Amounts withheld.

    (a) After receipt of the garnishment order issued under this part, 
the employer shall deduct from all disposable pay paid to the applicable 
debtor during each pay period the amount of garnishment described in 
paragraph (b) of this section. The employer may use the SF 329C (Wage 
Garnishment Worksheet) to calculate the amount to be deducted from the 
debtor's disposable pay.
    (b) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this 
section, the amount of garnishment will be the lesser of--
    (1) The amount indicated on the garnishment order up to 15 percent 
of the debtor's disposable pay; or
    (2) The amount set forth in 15 U.S.C. 1673(a)(2) (Restriction on 
Garnishment), which is the amount by which a debtor's disposable pay 
exceeds an amount equivalent to thirty times the minimum wage. See 29 
CFR 870.10.
    (c) When a debtor's pay is subject to withholding orders with 
priority, the following will apply:
    (1) Unless otherwise provided by Federal law, withholding orders 
issued under this part will be paid in the amounts set forth under 
paragraph (b) of this section and will have priority over other 
withholding orders which are served later in time. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, withholding orders for family support will have priority over 
withholding orders issued under this part.
    (2) If amounts are being withheld from a debtor's pay pursuant to a 
withholding order served on an employer before a withholding order 
issued pursuant to this part, or if a withholding order for family 
support is served on an employer at any time, the amounts withheld 
pursuant to the withholding order issued under this part will be the 
lesser of--
    (i) The amount calculated under paragraph (b) of this section; or
    (ii) An amount equal to 25 percent of the debtor's disposable pay 
less the amount(s) withheld under the withholding order(s) with 
priority.
    (3) If a debtor owes more than one debt to GSA, the Agency may issue 
multiple withholding orders provided the total amount garnished from the 
debtor's pay for such orders does not exceed the amount set forth in 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) An amount greater than that set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) 
of this section may be withheld upon the written consent of the debtor.
    (e) The employer shall promptly pay to GSA all amounts withheld in 
accordance with the withholding order issued pursuant to this part.
    (f) An employer will not be required to vary its normal pay and 
disbursement cycles in order to comply with the withholding order.
    (g) Any assignment or allotment by an employee of his or her 
earnings will be void to the extent it interferes with or prohibits 
execution of the withholding order issued under this part, except for 
any assignment or allotment

[[Page 462]]

made pursuant to a family support judgment or order.
    (h) The employer will withhold the appropriate amount from the 
debtor's wages for each pay period until the employer receives 
notification from GSA to discontinue wage withholding. The garnishment 
order will indicate a reasonable period of time within which the 
employer is required to commence wage withholding, usually the first 
payday after the employer receives the order. However, if the first 
payday is within ten (10) days after the receipt of the garnishment 
order, the employer may begin deductions on the second payday.
    (i) Payments received through a wage garnishment order will be 
applied in the following order:
    (1) To outstanding penalties.
    (2) To administrative costs incurred by GSA to collect the debt.
    (3) To interest accrued on the debt at the rate established by the 
terms of the obligation under which it arose or by applicable law.
    (4) To outstanding principal.


<R05>
Sec. 105-57.009  Exclusions from garnishment.

    GSA will not garnish the wages of a debtor who it knows has been 
involuntarily separated from employment until the debtor has been 
reemployed continuously for at least 12 months. The debtor has the 
burden of informing GSA of the circumstances surrounding an involuntary 
separation from employment.


<R05>
Sec. 105-57.010  Financial hardship.

    (a) A debtor whose wages are subject to a wage withholding order 
under this part, may, at any time, request a review by GSA of the amount 
garnished, based on materially changed circumstances such as disability, 
divorce, or catastrophic illness which result in financial hardship.
    (b) A debtor requesting a review under paragraph (a) of this section 
shall submit the basis for claiming the current amount of garnishment 
results in a financial hardship to the debtor, along with supporting 
documentation.
    (c) If a financial hardship is found, GSA will downwardly adjust, by 
an amount and for a period of time agreeable to the Agency, the amount 
garnished to reflect the debtor's financial condition. GSA will notify 
the employer of any adjustments to the amounts to be withheld.


<R05>
Sec. 105-57.011  Ending garnishment.

    (a) Once GSA has fully recovered the amounts owed by the debtor, 
including interest, penalties, and administrative costs consistent with 
the FCCS, the Agency will send the debtor's employer notification to 
discontinue wage withholding.
    (b) At least annually, GSA will review its debtors' accounts to 
ensure that garnishment has been terminated for accounts that have been 
paid in full.


<R05>
Sec. 105-57.012  Actions prohibited by the employer.

    An employer may not discharge, refuse to employ, or take 
disciplinary action against the debtor due to the issuance of a 
withholding order under this part. See 31 U.S.C. 3720D(e).


<R05>
Sec. 105-57.013  Refunds.

    (a) If a hearing official, at a hearing held pursuant to Sec. 105-
57.005 of this part, determines that a debt is not legally due and owing 
to the United States, GSA will promptly refund any amount collected by 
means of administrative wage garnishment.
    (b) Unless required by Federal law or contract, refunds under this 
part will not bear interest.


<R05>
Sec. 105-57.014  Right of action.

    GSA may sue any employer for any amount that the employer fails to 
withhold from wages owed and payable to an employee in accordance with 
Sec. Sec. 105-057.006 and 105-57.008 of this part, plus attorney's 
fees, costs, and if applicable, punitive damages. However, a suit may 
not be filed before the termination of the collection action involving a 
particular debtor, unless earlier filing is necessary to avoid 
expiration of any applicable statute of limitations period. For purposes 
of this part, ``termination of the collection action'' occurs when GSA 
has terminated collection action in accordance with the FCCS or other 
applicable standards. In

[[Page 463]]

any event, termination of the collection action will have been deemed to 
occur if GSA has not received any payments to satisfy the debt from the 
particular debtor whose wages were subject to garnishment, in whole or 
in part, for a period of one (1) year.

<R05>
Sec. 105-60.000  Scope of part.

    (a) This part sets forth policies and procedures of the General 
Services Administration (GSA) regarding public access to records 
documenting:
    (1) Agency organization, functions, decisionmaking channels, and 
rules and regulations of general applicability;
    (2) Agency final opinions and orders, including policy statements 
and staff manuals;
    (3) Operational and other appropriate agency records; and
    (4) Agency proceedings.
    (b) This part also covers exemptions from disclosure of these 
records; procedures for the public to inspect or obtain copies of GSA 
records; and instructions to current and former GSA

[[Page 464]]

employees on the response to a subpoena or other legal demand for 
material or information received or generated in the performance of 
official duty or because of the person's official status.
    (c) Any policies and procedures in any GSA internal or external 
directive inconsistent with the policies and procedures set forth in 
this part are superseded to the extent of that inconsistency.


<R04>
                   Subpart 105	60.1_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.101  Purpose.

    This part 105-60 implements the provisions of the Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA), as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552. The regulations in 
this part also implement Executive Order 12600, Predisclosure 
Notification Procedures for Confidential Commercial Information, of June 
23, 1987 (3 CFR, 1987 Comp., p. 235). This part prescribes procedures by 
which the public may inspect and obtain copies of GSA records under the 
FOIA, including administrative procedures which must be exhausted before 
a requester invokes the jurisdiction of an appropriate United States 
District Court for GSA's failure to respond to a proper request within 
the statutory time limits, for a denial of agency records or challenge 
to the adequacy of a search, or for a denial of a fee waiver.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.102  Application.

    This part applies to all records and informational materials 
generated, maintained, and controlled by GSA that come within the scope 
of 5 U.S.C. 552.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.103  Policy.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.103-1  Availability of records.

    The policies of GSA with regard to the availability of records to 
the public are:
    (a) GSA records are available to the greatest extent possible in 
keeping with the spirit and intent of the FOIA. GSA will disclose 
information in any existing GSA record, with noted exceptions, 
regardless of the form or format of the record. GSA will provide the 
record in the form or format requested if the record is reproducible by 
the agency in that form or format without significant expenditure of 
resources. GSA will make reasonable efforts to maintain its records in 
forms or formats that are reproducible for purposes of this section.
    (b) The person making the request does not need to demonstrate an 
interest in the records or justify the request.
    (c) The FOIA does not give the public the right to demand that GSA 
compile a record that does not already exist. For example, FOIA does not 
require GSA to collect and compile information from multiple sources to 
create a new record. GSA may compile records or perform minor 
reprogramming to extract records from a database or system when doing so 
will not significantly interfere with the operation of the automated 
system in question or involve a significant expenditure of resources.
    (d) Similarly, FOIA does not require GSA to reconstruct records that 
have been destroyed in compliance with disposition schedules approved by 
the Archivist of the United States. However, GSA will not destroy 
records after a member of the public has requested access to them and 
will process the request even if destruction would otherwise be 
authorized.
    (e) If the record requested is not complete at the time of the 
request, GSA may, at its discretion, inform the requester that the 
complete record will be provided when it is available, with no 
additional request required, if the record is not exempt from 
disclosure.
    (f) Requests must be addressed to the office identified in Sec. 
105-60.402-1.
    (g) Fees for locating and duplicating records are listed in Sec. 
105-60,305-10.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.103-2  Applying exemptions.

    GSA may deny a request for a GSA record if it falls within an 
exemption under the FOIA outlined in subpart 105-60.5 of this part. 
Except when a record is classified or when disclosure would violate any 
Federal statute, the authority to withhold a record from disclosure is 
permissive rather than mandatory. GSA will not withhold a

[[Page 465]]

record unless there is a compelling reason to do so; i.e., disclosure 
will likely cause harm to a Governmental or private interest. In the 
absence of a compelling reason, GSA will disclose a record even if it 
otherwise is subject to exemption. GSA will cite the compelling 
reason(s) to requesters when any record is denied under FOIA.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.104  Records of other agencies.

    If GSA receives a request for access to records that are known to be 
the primary responsibility of another agency, GSA will refer the request 
to the agency concerned for appropriate action. For example, GSA will 
refer requests to the appropriate agency in cases in which GSA does not 
have sufficient knowledge of the action or matter that is the subject of 
the requested records to determine whether the records must be released 
or may be withheld under one of the exemptions listed in Subpart 105-
60.5 of this part. If GSA does not have the requested records, the 
agency will attempt to determine whether the requested records exist at 
another agency and, if possible, will forward the request to that 
agency. GSA will inform the requester that GSA has forwarded the request 
to another agency.

<R05>
Sec. 105-60.304  Public information handbook and index.

    GSA publishes a handbook for the public that identifies information 
regarding any matter described in Sec. 105-60.302. This handbook also 
lists published information available from GSA and describes the 
procedures the public may use to obtain information using the Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA). This handbook may be obtained without charge 
from any of the GSA FOIA offices listed in Sec. 105-60.303(a), or at 
the GSA Internet Homepage (http://www.gsa.gov/staff/c/ca/cai/links.htm).


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305  Fees.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-1  Definitions.

    For the purpose of this part:
    (a) A statute specifically providing for setting the level of fees 
for particular types of records (5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(vii)) means any 
statute that specifically requires a Government agency to set the level 
of fees for particular types of records, as opposed to a statute that 
generally discusses such fees. Fees are required by statute to:
    (1) Make Government information conveniently available to the public 
and to private sector organizations;
    (2) Ensure that groups and individuals pay the cost of publications 
and other services which are for their special use so that these costs 
are not borne by the general taxpaying public;
    (3) Operate an information dissemination activity on self-sustaining 
basis to the maximum extent possible; or
    (4) Return revenue to the Treasury for defraying, wholly or in part, 
appropriated funds used to pay the cost of disseminating Government 
information.
    (b) The term direct costs means those expenditures which GSA 
actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and in the case of 
commercial requesters, reviewing and redacting) documents to respond to 
a FOIA request. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the 
employee performing the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee 
plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits), and the cost of 
operating duplicating machinery. Overhead expenses such as costs of 
space, and heating or lighting the facility where the records are stored 
are not included in direct costs.
    (c) The term search includes all time spent looking for material 
that is responsive to a request, including line-by-line identification 
of material within documents. Searches will be performed in the most 
efficient and least expensive manner so as to minimize costs for both 
the agency and the requester. Line-by-line searches will not be 
undertaken when it would be more efficient to duplicate the entire 
document. Search for responsive material is not the same as review of a 
record to determine whether it is exempt from disclosure in whole or in 
part (see paragraph (e) of this section. Searches may be done manually 
or by computer using existing programming or new programming when this 
would not significantly interfere with the operation of the automated 
system in question.
    (d) The term duplication means the process of making a copy of a 
document in response to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of 
paper,

[[Page 468]]

microform audiovisual materials, or magnetic types or disks. To the 
extent practicable, GSA will provide a copy of the material in the form 
specified by the requester.
    (e) The term review means the process of examining documents located 
in response to a request to determine if any portion of that document is 
permitted to be withheld and processing any documents for disclosure. 
See Sec. 105-60.305-6.
    (f) The term commercial-use request means a request from or on 
behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers 
the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or person on 
whose behalf the request is made. GSA will determine whether a requester 
properly belongs in this category by determining how the requester will 
use the documents.
    (g) The term educational institution means a preschool, a public or 
private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate 
higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an 
institution of professional education, or an institution of vocational 
education which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.
    (h) The term noncommercial scientific institution means an 
institution that is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis as that term 
is used in paragraph (f) of this section and which is operated solely 
for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which 
are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.
    (i) The term representative of the news media means any person 
actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to 
publish or broadcast news to the public. The term news means information 
that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the 
public. Examples of news media include television or radio stations 
broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but 
only in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of 
``news'') who make their products available for purchase or subscription 
by the general public. ``Freelance'' journalists will be regarded as 
working for a news organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis 
for expecting publication through that organization even though they are 
not actually employed by it.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-2  Scope of this subpart.

    This subpart sets forth policies and procedures to be followed in 
the assessment and collection of fees from a requester for the search, 
review, and reproduction of GSA records.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-3  GSA records available without charge.

    GSA records available to the public are displayed in the Business 
Service Center for each GSA region. The address and phone number of the 
Business Service Centers are listed in Sec. 105-60.303. Certain 
material related to bids (excluding construction plans and 
specifications) and any material displayed are available without charge 
upon request.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-4  GSA records available at a fee.

    (a) GSA will make a record not subject to exemption available at a 
time and place mutually agreed upon by GSA and the requester at fees 
shown in Sec. 105-60.305-10. Waivers of these fees are available under 
the conditions described in Sec. 105-60.305-13. GSA will agree to:
    (1) Show the originals to the requester;
    (2) Make one copy available at a fee; or
    (3) A combination of these alternatives.
    (b) GSA will make copies of voluminous records as quickly as 
possible. GSA may, in its discretion, make a reasonable number of 
additional copies for a fee when commercial reproduction services are 
not available to the requester.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-5  Searches.

    (a) GSA may charge for the time spent in the following activities in 
determining ``search time'' subject to applicable fees as provided in 
Sec. 105-60.305-10:
    (1) Time spent in trying to locate GSA records which come within the 
scope of the request;
    (2) Time spent in either transporting a necessary agency searcher to 
a place

[[Page 469]]

of record storage, or in transporting records to the locations of a 
necessary agency searcher; and
    (3) Direct costs of the use of computer time to locate and extract 
requested records.
    (b) GSA will not charge for the time spent in monitoring a 
requester's inspection of disclosed agency records.
    (c) GSA may assess fees for search time even if the search proves 
unsuccessful or if the records located are exempt from disclosure.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-6  Reviews.

    (a) GSA will charge only commercial-use requesters for review time.
    (b) GSA will charge for the time spent in the following activities 
in determining ``review time'' subject to applicable fees as provided in 
Sec. 105-60.305-10:
    (1) Time spent in examining a requested record to determine whether 
any or all of the record is exempt from disclosure, including time spent 
consulting with submitters of requested information; and
    (2) Time spent in deleting exempt matter being withheld from records 
otherwise made available.
    (c) GSA will not charge for:
    (1) Time spent in resolving issues of law or policy regarding the 
application of exemptions; or
    (2) Review at the administrative appeal level of an exemption 
already applied. However, records or portions of records withheld in 
full under an exemption which is subsequently determined not to apply 
may be reviewed again to determine the applicability of other exemptions 
not previously considered. GSA will charge for such subsequent review.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-7  Assurance of payment.

    If fees for search, review, and reproduction will exceed $25 but 
will be less than $250, the requester must provide written assurance of 
payment before GSA will process the request. If this assurance is not 
included in the initial request, GSA will notify the requester that 
assurance of payment is required before the request is processed. GSA 
will offer requesters an opportunity to modify the request to reduce the 
fee.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-8  Prepayment of fees.

    (a) Fees over $250. GSA will require prepayment of fees for search, 
review, and reproduction which are likely to exceed $250. When the 
anticipated total fee exceeds $250, the requester will receive notice to 
prepay and at the same time will be given an opportunity to modify his 
or her request to reduce the fee. When fees will exceed $250, GSA will 
notify the requester that it will not start processing a request until 
payment is received.
    (b) Delinquent payments. As noted in Sec. 105-6.305-12(d), 
requesters who are delinquent in paying for previous requests will be 
required to repay the old debt and to prepay for any subsequent request. 
GSA will inform the requester that it will process no additional 
requests until all fees are paid.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-9  Form of payment.

    Requesters should pay fees by check or money order made out to the 
General Services Administration and addressed to the official named by 
GSA in its correspondence. Payment may also be made by means of 
Mastercard or Visa. For information concerning payment by credit cards, 
call 816-926-7551.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-10  Fee schedule.

    (a) When GSA is aware that documents responsive to a request are 
maintained for distribution by an agency operating a statutory fee based 
program, GSA will inform the requester of the procedures for obtaining 
records from those sources.
    (b) GSA will consider only the following costs in fees charged to 
requesters of GSA records:
    (1) Review and search fees.

    Manual searches by clerical staff: $13 per hour or fraction of an 
hour.
    Manual searches and reviews by professional staff in cases in which 
clerical staff would be unable to locate the requested records: $29 per 
hour or fraction of an hour.
    Computer searches: Direct cost to GSA.
    Transportation or special handling of records: Direct cost to GSA.

    (2) Reproduction fees.

    Pages no larger than 8\1/2\ by 14 inches, when reproduced by routine 
electrostatic copying: 10[cent] per page.
    Pages over 8\1/2\ by 14 inches: Direct cost of reproduction to GSA.

[[Page 470]]

    Pages requiring reduction, enlargement, or other special services: 
Direct cost of reproduction to GSA.
    Reproduction by other than routine electrostatic copying: Direct 
cost of reproduction to GSA.

    (c) Any fees not provided for under paragraph (b) of this section, 
shall be calculated as direct costs, in accordance with Sec. 105-
60.305-1(b).
    (d) GSA will assess fees based on the category of the requester as 
defined in Sec. 105-60.305-1(f)-(1); i.e., commercial-use, educational 
and noncommercial scientific institutions, news media, and all other. 
The fees listed in paragraph (b) of this section apply with the 
following exceptions:
    (1) GSA will not charge the requester if the fee is $25 or less as 
the cost of collection is greater than the fee.
    (2) Educational and noncommercial scientific institutions and the 
news media will be charged for the cost of reproduction alone. These 
requesters are entitled to the first 100 pages (paper copies) of 
duplication at no cost. The following are examples of how these fees are 
calculated:
    (i) A request that results in 150 pages of material. No fee would be 
assessed for duplication of 150 pages. The reason is that these 
requesters are entitled to the first 100 pages at no charge. The charge 
for the remaining 50 pages would be $5.00. This amount would not be 
billed under the preceding section.
    (ii) A request that results in 450 pages of material. The requester 
in this case would be charged $35.00. The reason is that the requester 
is entitled to the first 100 pages at no charge. The charge for the 
remaining 350 pages would be $35.
    (3) Noncommercial requesters who are not included under paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section will be entitled to the first 100 pages (page 
copies) of duplication at not cost and two hours of search without 
charge. The term search time generally refers to manual search. To apply 
this term to searches made by computer, GSA will determine the hourly 
cost of operating the central processing unit and the operator's hourly 
salary plus 16 percent. When the cost of search (including the operator 
time and the cost of operating the computer to process a request) 
reaches the equivalent dollar amount of two hours of the salary of the 
person performing a manual search, i.e., the operator, GSA will begin 
assessing charges for computer search.
    (4) GSA will charge commercial-use requesters fees which recover the 
full direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release, and 
duplicating the records sought. Commercial-use requesters are not 
entitled to two hours of free search time.
    (e) Determining category of requester. GSA may ask any requester to 
provide additional information at any time to determine what fee 
category he or she falls under.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-11  Fees for authenticated and attested copies.

    The fees set forth in Sec. 105-60.305-10 apply to requests for 
authenticated and attested copies of GSA records.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-12  Administrative actions to improve assessment 

and collection of fees.

    (a) Charging interest. GSA may charge requesters who fail to pay 
fees interest on the amount billed starting on the 31st day following 
the day on which the billing was sent. Interest will be at the rate 
prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717.
    (b) Effect of the Debt Collection Act of 1982. GSA will take any 
action authorized by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 
Stat. 1749), including disclosure to consumer reporting agencies, use of 
collection agencies, and assessment of penalties and administrative 
costs, where appropriate, to encourage payment.
    (c) Aggregating requests. When GSA reasonably believes that a 
requester, or group of requesters acting in concert, is attempting to 
break down a request into a series of requests related to the same 
subject for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, GSA will 
combine any such requests and charge accordingly, including fees for 
previous requests where charges were not assessed. GSA will presume that 
multiple requests of this type within a 30-day period are made to avoid 
fees.
    (d) Advanced payments. Whenever a requester is delinquent in paying 
the fee for a previous request (i.e., within 30 days of the date of the 
billing), GSA

[[Page 471]]

will require the requester to pay the full amount owed plus any 
applicable interest penalties and administrative costs as provided in 
paragraph (a) of this section or to demonstrate that he or she has, in 
fact, paid the fee. In such cases, GSA will also require advance payment 
of the full amount of the estimated fee before the agency begins to 
process a new request or a pending request from that requester. When 
advance payment is required under this selection, the administrative 
time limits in subsection (a)(6) of the FOIA (i.e., 10 working days from 
receipt of appeals from initial denial plus permissible time extensions) 
will begin only after GSA has received the fee payments described in 
Sec. 105-60.305-8.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-13  Waiver of fee.

    (a) Any request for a waiver or the reduction of a fee should be 
included in the initial letter requesting access to GSA records under 
Sec. 105-60.402-1. The waiver request should explain how disclosure of 
the information would contribute significantly to public's understanding 
of the operations or activities of the Government and would not be 
primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. In responding to 
a requester, GSA will consider the following factors:
    (1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns ``the 
operations or activities of the Government.'' The subject matter of the 
requested records must specifically concern identifiable operations or 
activities of the Federal Government. The connection between the records 
and the operations or activities must be direct and clear, not remote or 
attenuated.
    (2) Whether the disclosure is ``likely to contribute'' to an 
understanding of Government operations or activities. In this 
connection, GSA will consider whether the requested information is 
already in the public domain. If it is, then disclosure of the 
information would not be likely to contribute to an understanding of 
Government operations or activities, as nothing new would be added to 
the public record.
    (3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute 
to ``public's understanding.'' The focus here must be on the 
contribution to public's understanding rather than personal benefit to 
be derived by the requester. For purposes of this analysis, the identity 
and qualifications of the requester should be considered to determine 
whether the requester is in a position to contribute to public's 
understanding through the requested disclosure.
    (4) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be 
furthered by the requested disclosure; and if so: whether the magnitude 
of the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently 
large, in comparison with the public's interest in disclosure, that 
disclosure is ``primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.''
    (b) GSA will ask the requester to furnish additional information if 
the initial request is insufficient to evaluate the merits of the 
request. GSA will not start processing a request until the fee waiver 
issue has been resolved unless the requester has provided written 
assurance of payment in full if the fee waiver is denied by the agency.


<R04>
                   Subpart 105	60.4_Described Records


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.401  General.

    (a) Except for records made available in accordance with subparts 
105-60.2 and 105-60.3 of this part, GSA will make records available to a 
requester promptly when the request reasonably describes the records 
unless GSA invokes an exemption in accordance with subpart 105-60.5 of 
this part. Although the burden of reasonable description of the records 
rests with the requester, whenever practical GSA will assist requesters 
to describe records more specifically.
    (b) Whenever a request does not reasonably describe the records 
requested, GSA may contact the requester to seek a more specific 
description. The 20-workday time limit set forth in Sec. 105-60.402-2 
will not start until the official identified in Sec. 105-60.402-1 or 
other responding official receives a request reasonably describing the 
records.

[[Page 472]]


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.402  Procedures for making records available.

    This subpart sets forth initial procedures for making records 
available when they are requested, including administrative procedures 
to be exhausted prior to seeking judicial review by an appropriate 
United States District Court.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.402-1  Submission of requests.

    For records located in the GSA Central Office, the requester must 
submit a request in writing to the GSA FOIA Officer, General Services 
Administration (CAI), Washington, DC 20405. Requesters may FAX requests 
to (202) 501-2727, or submit a request by electronic mail to 
gsa.foi@gsa.gov. For records located in the Office of Inspector General, 
the requester must submit a request to the FOIA Officer, Office of 
Inspector General, General Services Administration, 1800 F Street NW., 
Room 5324, Washington, DC 20405. For records located in the GSA regional 
offices, the requester must submit a request to the FOIA Officer for the 
relevant region, at the address listed in Sec. 105-60.303(a). Requests 
should include the words ``Freedom of Information Act Request'' 
prominently marked on both the face of the request letter and the 
envelope. The 20-workday time limit for agency decisions set forth in 
Sec. 105-60.402-2 begins with receipt of a request in the office of the 
official identified in this section, unless the provisions under 
Sec. Sec. 105-60.305-8 and 105-60.305-12(d) apply. Failure to include 
the words ``Freedom of Information Act Request'' or to submit a request 
to the official identified in this section will result in processing 
delays. A requester with questions concerning a FOIA request should 
contact the GSA FOIA Office, General Services Administration (CAI), 18th 
and F Streets, NW., Washington, DC 20405, (202) 501-2262.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.402-2  Response to initial requests.

    (a) GSA will respond to an initial FOIA request that reasonably 
describes requested records, including a fee waiver request, within 20 
workdays (that is, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) 
after receipt of a request by the office of the appropriate official 
specified in Sec. 105-60.402-1. This letter will provide the agency's 
decision with respect to disclosure or nondisclosure of the requested 
records, or, if appropriate, a decision on a request for a fee waiver. 
If the records to be disclosed are not provided with the initial letter, 
the records will be sent as soon as possible thereafter.
    (b) In unusual circumstances, as described in Sec. 105-60.404, GSA 
will inform the requester of the agency's need to take an extension of 
time, not to exceed an additional 10 workdays. This notice will afford 
requesters an opportunity to limit the scope of the request so that it 
may be processed within prescribed time limits or an opportunity to 
arrange an alternative time frame for processing the request or a 
modified request. Such mutually agreed time frames will supersede the 10 
day limit for extensions.
    (c) GSA will consider requests for expedited processing from 
requesters who submit a statement describing a compelling need and 
certifying that this need is true and correct to the best of such 
person's knowledge and belief. A compelling need means:
    (1) Failure to obtain the records on an expedited basis could 
reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or 
physical safety of an individual; or
    (2) The information is urgently needed by an individual primarily 
engaged in disseminating information in order to inform the public 
concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity. An individual 
primarily engaged in dissmeninating information means a person whose 
primary activity involves publishing or otherwise disseminating 
information to the public. ``Urgently needed'' information has a 
particular value that will be lost if not disseminated quickly, such as 
a breaking news story or general public interest. Information of 
historical interest only, or information sought for litigation or 
commercial activities would not qualify, nor would a news media 
publication or broadcast deadline unrelated to the newsbreaking nature 
of the information.
    (d) GSA will decide whether to grant expedited processing within 
five working days of receipt of the request. If the

[[Page 473]]

request is granted, GSA will process the request ahead of non-expedited 
requests, as soon as practicable. If the request is not granted, GSA 
will give expeditious consideration to administrative appeals of this 
denial.
    (e) GSA may, at its discretion, establish three processing queues 
based on whether any requests have been granted expedited status and on 
the difficulty and complexity of preparing a response. Within each 
queue, responses will be prepared on a ``first in, first out'' basis. 
One queue will be made up of expedited requests; the second, of simple 
responses that clearly can be prepared without requesting an extension 
of time; the third, of responses that will require an extension of time.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.403  Appeal within GSA.

    (a) A requester who receives a denial of a request, in whole or in 
part, a denial of a request for expedited processing or of a fee waiver 
request may appeal that decision within GSA. A requester may also appeal 
the adequacy of the search if GSA determines that it has searched for 
but has not requested records. The requester must send the appeal to the 
GSA FOIA Officer, General Services Administration (CAI), Washington, DC 
20405, regardless of whether the denial being appealed was made in the 
Central Office or in a regional office. For denials which originate in 
the Office of Inspector General, the requester must send the appeal to 
the Inspector General, General Services Administration, 1800 F Street 
NW., Washington, DC 20405.
    (b) The GSA FOIA Officer must receive an appeal no later than 120 
calendar days after receipt by the requester of the initial denial of 
access or fee waiver.
    (c) An appeal must be in writing and include a brief statement of 
the reasons he or she thinks GSA should release the records or provide 
expedited processing and enclose copies of the initial request and 
denial. The appeal letter must include the words ``Freedom of 
Information Act Appeal'' on both the face of the appeal letter and on 
the envelope. Failure to follow these procedures will delay processing 
of the appeal. GSA has 20 workdays after receipt of a proper appeal of 
denial of records to issue a determination with respect to the appeal. 
The 20-workday time limit shall not begin until the GSA FOIA Officer 
receives the appeal. As noted in Sec. 105-60.404, the GSA FOIA Officer 
may extend this time limit in unusual circumstances. GSA will process 
appeals of denials of expedited processing as soon as possible after 
receiving them.
    (d) A requester who receives a denial of an appeal, or who has not 
received a response to an appeal or initial request within the statutory 
time frame may seek judicial review in the United States District Court 
in the district in which the requester resides or has a principal place 
of business, or where the records are situated, or in the United States 
District Court for the District of Columbia.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.404  Extension of time limits.

    (a) In unusual circumstances, the GSA FOIA Officer or the regional 
FOIA Officer may extend the time limits prescribed in Sec. Sec. 105-
60.402 and 105-60.403. For purposes of this section, the term unusual 
circumstances means:
    (1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from 
field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the 
office processing the request;
    (2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a 
voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are described 
in a single request;
    (3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all 
practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in 
the determination of the request or among two or more components of GSA 
having substantial subject-matter interest therein; or
    (4) The need to consult with the submitter of the requested 
information.
    (b) If necessary, GSA may take more than one extension of time. 
However, the total extension of time to respond to any single request 
shall not exceed 10 workdays. The extension may be divided between the 
initial and appeal stages or within a single stage. GSA will provide 
written notice to the requester of any extension of time limits.

[[Page 474]]


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.405  Processing requests for confidential commercial

information.

    (a) General. The following additional procedures apply when 
processing requests for confidential commercial information.
    (b) Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following 
definitions apply:
    (1) Confidential commercial information means records provided to 
the Government by a submitter that contain material arguably exempt from 
release under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), because disclosure could reasonably be 
expected to cause substantial competitive harm.
    (2) Submitter means a person or entity which provides to the 
Government information which may constitute confidential commercial 
information. The term submitter includes, but is not limited to, 
individuals, partnerships, corporations, State governments, and foreign 
governments.
    (c) Designating confidential commercial information. Since January 
1, 1988, submitters have been required to designate confidential 
commercial information as such when it is submitted to GSA or at a 
reasonable time thereafter. For information submitted in connection with 
negotiated procurements, the requirements of Federal Acquisition 
Regulation 48 CFR 15.407(c)(8) and 52.215-12 also apply.
    (d) Procedural requirements--consultation with the submitter.(1) If 
GSA receives a FOIA request for potentially confidential commercial 
information, it will notify the submitter immediately by telephone and 
invite an opinion whether disclosure will or will not cause substantial 
competitive harm.
    (2) GSA will follow up the telephonic notice promptly in writing 
before releasing any records unless paragraph (f) of this section 
applies.
    (3) If the submitter indicates an objection to disclosure GSA will 
give the submitter seven workdays from receipt of the letter to provide 
GSA with a detailed written explanation of how disclosure of any 
specified portion of the records would be competitively harmful.
    (4) If the submitter verbally states that there is no objection to 
disclosure, GSA will confirm this fact in writing before disclosing any 
records.
    (5) At the same time GSA notifies the submitter, it will also advise 
the requester that there will be a delay in responding to the request 
due to the need to consult with the submitter.
    (6) GSA will review the reasons for nondisclosure before 
independently deciding whether the information must be released or 
should be withheld. If GSA decides to release the requested information, 
it will provide the submitter with a written statement explaining why 
his or her objections are not sustained. The letter to the submitter 
will contain a copy of the material to be disclosed or will offer the 
submitter an opportunity to review the material in none of GSA's 
offices. If GSA decides not to release the material, it will notify the 
submitter orally or in writing.
    (7) If GSA determines to disclose information over a submitter's 
objections, it will inform the submitter the GSA will delay disclosure 
for 5 workdays from the estimated date the submitter receives GSA's 
decision before it releases the information. The decision letter to the 
requester shall state that GSA will delay disclosure of material it has 
determined to disclose to allow for the notification of the submitter.
    (e) When notice is required. (1) For confidential commercial 
information submitted prior to January 1, 1988, GSA will notify a 
submitter whenever it receives a FOIA request for such information:
    (i) If the records are less than 10 years old and the information 
has been designated by the submitter as confidential commercial 
information; or
    (ii) If GSA has reason to believe that disclosure of the information 
could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.
    (2) For confidential commercial information submitted on or after 
January 1, 1988, GSA will notify a submitter whenever it determines that 
the agency may be required to disclose records:
    (i) That the submitter has previously designated as privileged or 
confidential; or

[[Page 475]]

    (ii) That GSA believes could reasonably be expected to cause 
substantial competitive harm if disclosed.
    (3) GSA will provide notice to a submitter for a period of up to 10 
years after the date of submission.
    (f) When notice is not required. The notice requirements of this 
section will not apply if:
    (1) GSA determines that the information should not be disclosed;
    (2) The information has been published or has been officially made 
available to the public;
    (3) Disclosure of the information is required by law other than the 
FOIA;
    (4) Disclosure is required by an agency rule that
    (i) Was adopted pursuant to notice and public comment;
    (ii) Specifies narrow classes of records submitted to the agency 
that are to be released under FOIA; and
    (iii) Provides in exceptional circumstances for notice when the 
submitter provides written justification, at the time the information is 
submitted for a reasonable time thereafter, that disclosure of the 
information could reasonably be expected to cause substantial 
competitive harm;
    (5) The information is not designated by the submitter as exempt 
from disclosure under paragraph (c) of this section, unless GSA has 
substantial reason to believe that disclosure of the information would 
be competitively harmful; or
    (6) The designation made by the submitter in accordance with 
paragraph (c) of this section appears obviously frivolous; except that, 
in such cases, the agency must provide the submitter with written notice 
of any final administrative decision five workdays prior to disclosing 
the information.
    (g) Lawsuits. If a FOIA requester sues the agency to compel 
disclosure of confidential commercial information, GSA will notify the 
submitter as soon as possible. If the submitter sues GSA to enjoin 
disclosure of the records, GSA will notify the requester.


<R04>
                       Subpart 105	60.5_Exemptions


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.501  Categories of records exempt from disclosure

under the FOIA.

    (a) 5 U.S.C. 552(b) provides that the requirements of the FOIA do 
not apply to matters that are:
    (1) Specifically authorized under the criteria established by an 
executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or 
foreign policy and are in fact properly classified pursuant to such 
executive order;
    (2) Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of 
an agency;
    (3) Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than 
section 552b of this title), provided that such statute
    (i) Requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a 
manner as to leave no discretion on the issue; or
    (ii) Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to 
particular types of matters to be withheld;
    (4) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained 
from a person and privileged or confidential;
    (5) Interagency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would 
not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation 
with the agency;
    (6) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of 
which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy;
    (7) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, 
but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement 
records or information
    (i) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement 
proceedings;
    (ii) Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an 
impartial adjudication;
    (iii) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted 
invasion of personal privacy;
    (iv) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a 
confidential

[[Page 476]]

source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority or any 
private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis, 
and, in the case of a record or information compiled by a criminal law 
enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation or by an 
agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, 
information furnished by a confidential source;
    (v) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement 
investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law 
enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could 
reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or
    (vi) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical 
safety of any individual;
    (8) Contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition 
reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency 
responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; 
or
    (9) Geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, 
concerning wells.
    (b) GSA will provide any reasonably segregable portion of a record 
to a requester after deletion of the portions that are exempt under this 
section. If GSA must delete information from a record before disclosing 
it, this information, and the reasons for withholding it, will be 
clearly described in the cover letter to the requester or in an 
attachment. Unless indicating the extent of the deletion would harm an 
interest protected by an exemption, the amount of deleted information 
shall be indicated on the released portion of paper records by use of 
brackets or darkened areas indicating removal of information. In the 
case of electronic deletion, the amount of redacted information shall be 
indicated at the place in the record where such deletion was made, 
unless including the indication would harm an interest protected by the 
exemption under which the exemption was made.
    (c) GSA will invoke no exemption under this section to deny access 
to records that would be available pursuant to a request made under the 
Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) and implementing regulations, 41 CFR 
part 105-64, or if disclosure would cause no demonstrable harm to any 
governmental or private interest.
    (d) Pursuant to National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 
1997, Pub. L. No. 104-201, section 821, 110 Stat. 2422, GSA will invoke 
Exemption 3 to deny access to any proposal submitted by a vendor in 
response to the requirements of a solicitation for a competitive 
proposal unless the proposal is set forth or incorporated by reference 
in a contract entered into between the agency and the contractor that 
submitted the proposal.
    (e) Whenever a request is made which involves access to records 
described in Sec. 105-60.501(a)(7)(i) and the investigation or 
proceeding involves a possible violation of criminal law, and there is 
reason to believe that the subject of the investigation or proceeding is 
not aware of it, and disclosure of the existence of the records could 
reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings, the 
agency may, during only such time as that circumstance continues, treat 
the records as not subject to the requirements of this section.
    (f) Whenever informant records maintained by a criminal law 
enforcement agency under an informant's name or personal identifier are 
requested by a third party according to the informant's name or personal 
identifier, the agency may treat the records as not subject to the 
requirements of this section unless the informant's status as an 
informant has been officially confirmed.
    (g) Whenever a request is made that involves access to records 
maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation pertaining to foreign 
intelligence or counterintelligence, or international terrorism, and the 
existence of the records is classified information as provided in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Bureau may, as long as the 
existence of the records remains classified information, treat the 
records are not subject to the requirements of this section.

 Subpart 105	60.6_Production or Disclosure by Present or Former General 
 Services Administration Employees in Response to Subpoenas or Similar 
            Demands in Judicial or Administrative Proceedings


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.601  Purpose and scope of subpart.

    (a) By virtue of the authority vested in the Administrator of 
General Services by 5 U.S.C. 301 and 40 U.S.C. 486(c) this subpart 
establishes instructions and procedures to be followed by current and 
former employees of the General Services Administration in response to 
subpoenas or similar demands issued in judicial or administrative 
proceedings for production or disclosure of material or information 
obtained as part of the performance of a person's official duties or 
because of the person's official status. Nothing in these instructions 
applies to responses to subpoenas or demands issued by the Congress or 
in Federal grand jury proceedings.
    (b) This subpart provides instructions regarding the internal 
operations of GSA and the conduct of its employees, and is not intended 
and does not, and may not, be relied upon to create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party 
against GSA.

employee by reason of the performance of that person's official duties 
or because of the person's official status, or any other tangible item, 
e.g., personal property possessed or controlled by GSA.
    (b) Information means any knowledge or facts contained in material, 
and any knowledge or facts acquired by current or former GSA employee as 
part of the performance of that person's official duties or because of 
that person's official status.
    (c) Demand means any subpoena, order, or similar demand for the 
production or disclosure of material, information or testimony regarding 
such material or information, issued by a court or other authority in a 
judicial or administrative proceeding, excluding congressional subpoenas 
or demands in Federal grand jury proceedings, and served upon a present 
or former GSA employee.
    (d) Appropriate Authority means the following officials who are 
delegated authority to approve or deny responses to demands for 
material, information or testimony:
    (1) The Counsel to the Inspector General for material and 
information which is the responsibility of the GSA Office of Inspector 
General or testimony of current or former employees of the Office of the

and information which is the responsibility of the Board of Contract 
Appeals or testimony of current or former Board of Contract Appeals 
employees;
    (3) The GSA General Counsel, Associate General Counsel(s) or 
Regional Counsel for all material, information, or testimony not covered 
by paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.603  Acceptance of service of a subpoena duces tecum or

subpoena or other legal demand on behalf of GSA: The GSA General Counsel 
and Associate General Counsel(s) and, with respect to material or 
information which is the responsibility of a regional office, the 
Regional Administrator and Regional Counsel. The Inspector General and 
Counsel to the Inspector General, as well as the Chairman and Vice 
Chairman of the Board of Contract Appeals, are authorized to accept 
service for material or information which are the responsibility of 
their respective organizations.

[[Page 478]]

    (b) A present or former GSA employee not authorized to accept 
service of a subpoena or other demand for material, information or 
testimony obtained in an official capacity shall respectfully inform the 
process server that he or she is not authorized to accept service on 
behalf of GSA and refer the process server to an appropriate official 
listed in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) A Regional Administrator or Regional Counsel shall notify the 
General Counsel of a demand which may raise policy concerns or affect 
multiple regions.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.604  Production or disclosure prohibited unless approved 

by the Appropriate Authority.

    No current or former GSA employee shall, in response to a demand, 
produce any material or disclose, through testimony or other means, any 
information covered by this subpart, without prior approval of the 
Appropriate Authority.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.605  Procedure in the event of a demand for production 

or disclosure.

    (a) Whenever service of a demand is attempted in person or via mail 
upon a current or former GSA employee for the production of material or 
the disclosure of information covered by this subpart, the employee or 
former employee shall immediately notify the Appropriate Authority

material or testimony provide the Appropriate Authority with an 
affidavit, declaration, statement, and/or a plan as described in 
paragraphs (c) (1), (2), and (3) of this section if not included with or 
described in the demand. The Appropriate Authority may waive this 
requirement for a demand arising out of proceedings to which GSA or the 
United States is a party. Any waiver will be coordinated with the United 
States Department of Justice (DOJ) in proceedings in which GSA, its 
current or former employees, or the United States are represented by 
DOJ.
    (c)(1) Oral testimony. If oral testimony is sought by a demand, the 
Appropriate Authority shall require the party seeking the testimony or 
the party's attorney to provide, by affidavit or other statement, a 
detailed summary of the testimony sought and its relevance to the 
proceedings. Any authorization for the testimony of a current or former 
GSA employee shall be limited to the scope of the demand as summarized 
in such statement or affidavit.
    (2) Production of material. When information other than oral 
testimony is sought by a demand, the Appropriate Authority shall require 
the party seeking production or the party's attorney to provide a 
detailed summary, by affidavit or other statement, of the information 
sought and its relevance to the proceeding.
    (3) The Appropriate Authority may require a plan or other 
information from the party seeking testimony or production of material 
of all demands reasonably foreseeable, including, but not limited to, 
names of all current and former GSA employees from whom testimony or 
production is or will likely be sought, areas of inquiry, for current 
employees the length of time away from duty anticipated, and 
identification of documents to be used in each deposition or other 
testimony, where appropriate.
    (d) The Appropriate Authority will notify the current or former 
employee, the appropriate supervisor, and such other persons as 
circumstances may warrant, whether disclosure or production is 
authorized, and of any conditions or limitations to disclosure or 
production.
    (e) Factors to be considered by the Appropriate Authority in 
responding to demands:
    (1) Whether disclosure or production is appropriate under rules of 
procedure governing the proceeding out of which the demand arose;
    (2) The relevance of the testimony or documents to the proceedings;

[[Page 479]]

    (3) The impact of the relevant substantive law concerning applicable 
privileges recognized by statute, common law, judicial interpretation or 
similar authority;
    (4) The information provided by the issuer of the demand in response 
to requests by the Appropriate Authority pursuant to paragraphs (b) and 
(c) of this section;
    (5) The steps taken by the issuer of the demand to minimize the 
burden of disclosure or production on GSA, including but not limited to 
willingness to accept authenticated copies of material in lieu of 
personal appearance by GSA employees;
    (6) The impact on pending or potential litigation involving GSA or 
the United States as a party;
    (7) In consultation with the head of the GSA organizational 
component affected, the burden on GSA which disclosure or production 
would entail; and
    (8) Any additional factors unique to a particular demand or 
proceeding.
    (f) The Appropriate Authority shall not approve a disclosure or 
production which would:
    (1) Violate a statute or a specific regulation;
    (2) Reveal classified information, unless appropriately declassified 
by the originating agency;
    (3) Reveal a confidential source or informant, unless the 
investigative agency and the source or informant consent;
    (4) Reveal records or information compiled for law enforcement 
purposes which would interfere with enforcement proceedings or disclose 
investigative techniques and procedures the effectiveness of which would 
be impaired;
    (5) Reveal trade secrets or commercial or financial information 
which is privileged or confidential without prior consultation with the 
person from whom it was obtained; or
    (6) Be contrary to a recognized privilege.
    (g) The Appropriate Authority's determination, including any reasons 
for denial or limitations on disclosure or production, shall be made as 
expeditiously as possible and shall be communicated in writing to the 
issuer of the demand and appropriate current or former GSA employee(s). 
In proceedings in which GSA, its current or former employees, or the 
United States are represented by DOJ, the determination shall be 
coordinated with DOJ which may respond to the issuer of the subpoenas or 
demand in lieu of the Appropriate Authority.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.606  Procedure where response to demand is required prior 

to receiving instructions.

    (a) If a response to a demand is required before the Appropriate 
Authority's decision is issued, a GSA attorney designated by the 
Appropriate Authority for the purpose shall appear with the employee or 
former employee upon whom the demand has been made, and shall furnish 
the judicial or other authority with a copy of the instructions 
contained in this subpart. The attorney shall inform the court or other 
authority that the demand has been or is being referred for the prompt 
consideration by the Appropriate Authority. The attorney shall 
respectfully request the judicial or administrative authority to stay 
the demand pending receipt of the requested instructions.
    (b) The designated GSA attorney shall coordinate GSA's response with 
DOJ's Civil Division or the relevant Office of the United States 
Attorney and may request that a DOJ or Assistant United States Attorney 
appear with the employee in addition to or in lieu of a designated GSA 
attorney.
    (c) If an immediate demand for production or disclosure is made in 
circumstances which preclude the appearance of a GSA or DOJ attorney on 
the behalf of the employee or the former employee, the employee or 
former employee shall respectfully make a request to the demanding 
authority for sufficient time to obtain advice of counsel.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.607  Procedure in the event of an adverse ruling.

    If the court or other authority declines to stay the effect of the 
demand in response to a request made in accordance with Sec. 105-60.606 
pending receipt of instructions, or if the court or other authority 
rules that the demand must be complied with irrespective of instructions 
by the Appropriate Authority not to produce the material or

[[Page 480]]

disclose the information sought, the employee or former employee upon 
whom the demand has been made shall respectfully decline to comply, 
citing these instructions and the decision of the United States Supreme 
Court in United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951).


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.608  Fees, expenses, and costs.

    (a) In consultation with the Appropriate Authority, a current 
employee who appears as a witness pursuant to a demand shall ensure that 
he or she receives all fees and expenses, including travel expenses, to 
which witnesses are entitled pursuant to rules applicable to the 
judicial or administrative proceedings out of which the demand arose.
    (b) Witness fees and reimbursement for expenses received by a GSA 
employee shall be disposed of in accordance with rules applicable to 
Federal employees in effect at the time.
    (c) Reimbursement to the GSA for costs associated with producing

Sec. 105-62.000  Scope of part.

    This part prescribes procedures for safeguarding national security 
information and material within GSA. They explain how to identify, 
classify, downgrade, declassify, disseminate, and protect such 
information in the interests of national security. They also supplement 
and conform with Executive Order 12065 dated June 28, 1978, subject: 
National Security Information, and the Implementing Directive dated 
September 29, 1978, issued through the Information Security Oversight 
Office.


<R04>
                  Subpart 105	62.1_Classified Materials


<R05>
Sec. 105-62.101  Security classification categories.

    As set forth in Executive Order 12065, official information or 
material which requires protection against unauthorized disclosure in 
the interests of the national defense or foreign relations of the United 
States (hereinafter collectively termed ``national security'') shall be 
classified in one of three categories: Namely, Top Secret, Secret, or 
Confidential, depending on its degree of significance to the national 
security. No other categories shall be used to identify official 
information or material as requiring protection in the interests of 
national security except as otherwise expressly provided by statute. The 
three classification categories are defined as follows:
    (a) Top Secret. Top Secret refers to that national security 
information which requires the highest degree of protection, and shall 
be applied only to such information as the unauthorized disclosure of 
which could reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage 
to the national security. Examples of exceptionally grave damage include 
armed hostilities against the United States or its allies, disruption of 
foreign relations vitally affecting the national security, intelligence 
sources and methods, and the compromise of vital national defense plans 
or complex cryptologic and communications systems. This classification 
shall be used with the utmost restraint.
    (b) Secret. Secret refers to that national security information or 
material which requires a substantial degree of protection, and shall be 
applied only to such information as the unauthorized

[[Page 481]]

disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to cause serious damage 
to the national security. Examples of serious damage include disruption 
of foreign relations significantly affecting the national security, 
significant impairment of a program or policy directly related to the 
national security, and revelation of significant military plans or 
intelligence operations. This classification shall be used sparingly.
    (c) Confidential. Confidential refers to other national security 
information which requires protection, and shall be applied only to such 
information as the unauthorized disclosure of which could reasonably be 
expected to cause identifiable damage to the national security.


<R05>
Sec. 105-62.102  Authority to originally classify.

    (a) Top secret, secret, and confidential. The authority to 
originally classify information as Top Secret, Secret, or Confidential 
may be exercised only by the Administrator and is delegable only to the 
Director, Information Security Oversight Office.
    (b) Limitations on delegation of classification authority. 
Delegations of original classification authority are limited to the 
minimum number absolutely required for efficient administration. 
Delegated original classification authority may not be redelegated.

[47 FR 5416, Feb. 5, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 105-62.103  Access to GSA-originated materials.

    Classified information shall not be disseminated outside the 
executive branch of the Government without the express permission of the 
GSA Security Officer except as otherwise provided in this Sec. 105-
62.103.
    (a) Access by historical researchers. Persons outside the executive 
branch who are engaged in historical research projects, may be 
authorized access to classified information or material, provided that:
    (1) A written determination is made by the Administrator of General 
Services that such access is clearly consistent with the interests of 
national security.
    (2) Access is limited to that information over which GSA has 
classification jurisdiction.
    (3) The material requested is reasonably accessible and can be 
located with a reasonable amount of effort.
    (4) The person agrees to safeguard the information and to authorize 
a review of his or her notes and manuscript for determination that no 
classified information is contained therein by signing a statement 
entitled ``Conditions Governing Access to Official Records for 
Historical Research Purposes.''
    (5) An authorization for access shall be valid for a period of 2 
years from the date of issuance and may be renewed under the provisions 
of this Sec. 105-62.103(a).
    (b) Access by former Presidential appointees. Persons who previously 
occupied policymaking positions to which they were appointed by the 
President may not remove classified information or material upon 
departure from office as all such material must remain under the 
security control of the U.S. Government. Such persons may be authorized 
access to classified information or material which they originated, 
received, reviewed, signed, or which was addressed to them while in 
public office, provided that the GSA element having classification 
jurisdiction for such information or material makes a written 
determination that access is consistent with the interests of national 
security, approval is granted by the GSA Security Officer, and the 
individual seeking access agrees:
    (1) To safeguard the information,
    (2) To authorize a review of his or her notes for determination that 
no classified information is contained therein, and
    (3) To ensure that no classified information will be further 
disseminated or published.
    (c) Access during judicial proceedings. Classified information will 
not normally be released in the course of any civilian judicial 
proceeding. In special circumstances however, and upon the receipt of an 
order or subpoena issued by a Federal court, the Administrator may 
authorize the limited release of classified information if he or she 
determines that the interests of justice cannot otherwise be served. 
Appropriate safeguards will be established to protect such classified 
material released for use in judicial proceedings.

[[Page 482]]

    (d) Access to material in NARS custody. The Archivist of the United 
States prepares procedures governing access to materials transferred to 
NARS custody. These procedures are issued by the Administrator of 
General Services in 41 CFR part 105-61.
    (e) Access by the General Accounting Office and congressional 
committees. Classified information may be released to the General 
Accounting Office (GAO) and congressional committees when specifically 
authorized by the GSA Security Officer except as otherwise provided by 
law.


<R04>
            Subpart 105	62.2_Declassification and Downgrading


<R05>
Sec. 105-62.201  Declassification and downgrading.

    (a) Authority to downgrade and declassify. The authority to 
downgrade and declassify national security information or material shall 
be exercised as follows:
    (1) Information or material may be downgraded or declassified by the 
GSA official authorizing the original classification, by a successor in 
capacity, by a supervisory official of either, or by the Information 
Security Oversight Committee on appeal.
    (2) Downgrading and declassification authority may also be exercised 
by an official specifically authorized by the Administrator.
    (3) In the case of classified information or material officially 
transferred to GSA by or under statute or Executive order in conjunction 
with a transfer of functions and not merely for storage purposes, GSA 
shall be deemed the originating agency for all purposes under these 
procedures including downgrading and declassification.
    (4) In the case of classified information or material held in GSA 
not officially transferred under paragraph (a)(3) of this section but 
originated in an agency which has since ceased to exist, GSA is deemed 
the originating agency. Such information or material may be downgraded 
and declassified 30 calendar days after consulting with any other 
agencies having an interest in the subject matter.
    (5) Classified information or material under the final 
declassification jurisdiction of GSA which has been transferred to NARS 
for accession into the Archives of the United States may be downgraded 
and declassified by the Archivist of the United States in accordance 
with Executive Order 12065, directives of the Information Security 
Oversight Office, and the systematic review guidelines issued by the 
Administrator of General Services.
    (6) It is presumed that information which continues to meet 
classification requirements requires continued protection. In some 
cases, however, the need to protect such information may be outweighed 
by the public interest in disclosure of the information, and in these 
cases the information should be declassified. When such questions arise 
they shall be referred to the Administrator, the Director of the 
Information Security Oversight Office, or in accordance with the 
procedures for mandatory review described in Sec. 105-62.202(b).
    (b) Declassification. Declassification of information shall be given 
emphasis comparable to that acccorded classification. Information 
classified under Executive Order 12065 and prior orders shall be 
declassified as early as national security considerations permit. 
Decisions concerning declassification shall be based on the loss of 
sensitivity of the information with the passage of time or on the 
occurrence of an event which permits declassification. When information 
is reviewed for declassification it shall be declassified unless the 
declassification authority established in Sec. 105-62.202 determines 
that the information continues to meet the classification requirements 
prescribed despite the passage of time.
    (c) Downgrading. Classified information that is marked for automatic 
downgrading is downgraded accordingly without notification to holders. 
Classified information that is not marked for automatic downgrading may 
be assigned a lower classification designation by the originator or by 
an official authorized to declassify the same information. Notice of 
downgrading shall be provided to known holders of the information.

[[Page 483]]


<R05>
Sec. 105-62.202  Review of classified materials for 

declassification purposes.

    (a) Systematic review for declassification. Except for foreign 
government information, classified information constituting permanently 
valuable records of GSA as defined by 44 U.S.C. 2103, and information in 
the possession and under control of NARA, under 44 U.S.C. 2107 or 2107 
note, shall be reviewed for declassification as it becomes 20 years old. 
Transition to systematic review at 20 years shall be implemented as 
rapidly as practicable and shall be completed by December 1, 1988. 
Foreign government information shall be reviewed for declassification as 
it becomes 30 years old.
    (b) Mandatory review for declassification. All classified 
information upon request by a member of the public or a Government 
employee or agency to declassify and release such information under the 
provisions of Executive Order 12065 shall be reviewed by the responsible 
GSA element for possible declassification in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section.
    (c) Submission of requests for review. Requests for mandatory review 
of classified information shall be submitted in accordance with the 
following:
    (1) Requests originating within GSA shall in all cases be submitted 
directly to the service or staff office that originated the information.
    (2) For expeditious action, requests from other governmental 
agencies or from members of the public should be submitted directly to 
the service or staff office that originated the material, or, if the 
originating element is not known, or no longer exists, the requester 
shall submit the request to the GSA Security Officer who shall cause 
such request to be reviewed.
    (d) Requirements for processing. Requests for declassification 
review and release of information shall be processed in accordance with 
the provisions set forth in paragraphs (e) through (h) of this section 
subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The request is in writing and reasonably describes the 
information sought with sufficient particularity to enable the element 
to identify it.
    (2) The requester shall be asked to correct a request that does not 
comply with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to provide additional 
information.
    (3) If within 30 days the requester does not correct the request, 
describe the information sought with sufficient particularity or narrow 
the scope of the request, the element that received the request shall 
notify the requester and state the reason why no action will be taken on 
the request.
    (e) Processing of requests. Requests that meet the foregoing 
requirements for processing will be acted upon as follows:
    (1) GSA action upon the initial request shall be completed within 60 
days.
    (2) Receipt of the request shall be acknowledged within 7 days.
    (3) The designated service or staff office shall determine if the 
requested information may be declassified and shall make such 
information available to the requester, unless withholding it is 
otherwise warranted under applicable law. If the information may not be 
released in whole or in part, the requester shall be given a brief 
statement as to the reasons for denial, a notice of the right to appeal 
the determination to the Deputy Administrator (the notice shall include 
the Deputy Administrator's name, title, and address), and a notice that 
such an appeal must be filed with the Deputy Administrator within 60 
days in order to be considered.
    (f) Foreign government information. Except as provided hereinafter, 
requests for mandatory review for the declassification of classified 
documents that contain foreign government information shall be processed 
and acted upon in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (c) 
through (e) of this section. If the request involves information that 
was initially received or classified by GSA, then the corresponding 
service or staff office shall be designated by the GSA Security Officer 
to determine whether the foreign government information in the document 
may be declassified and released in accordance with GSA policy or 
guidelines, after consulting with other agencies that have subject 
matter interest as necessary. If GSA is not the agency

[[Page 484]]

that received or classified the foreign government information, it shall 
refer the request to the appropriate agency. In those cases where agency 
policy or guidelines do not apply, consultation with the foreign 
originator, through the GSA Security Officer, may be made prior to final 
action on the request.
    (g) Information classified outside the service or staff office. When 
a service or staff office receives a request for declassification of 
information in a document which is in the custody of the service or 
staff office but was classified by another service or staff office or by 
another Government agency, the service or staff office shall refer the 
request to the classifying service or staff office or Government agency, 
together with a copy of the document containing the information 
requested when practicable, and shall notify the requester of the 
referral, unless the agency that classified the information objects on 
the grounds that its association with the information requires 
protection. When a GSA service or staff office receives such a referral, 
it shall process the request in accordance with the requirements of this 
paragraph and, if so requested, shall notify the referring service, 
staff office, or agency of the determination made on the request.
    (h) Action on appeal. The following procedures shall be followed 
when denials of requests for declassification are appealed:
    (1) The Deputy Administrator shall, within 15 days of the date of 
the appeal, convene a meeting of the GSA Information Security Oversight 
Committee (ISOC) that shall include the GSA Security Officer, or his or 
her representative, and the GSA official who denied the original request 
(and, at the option of that official, any subordinates or personnel from 
other agencies that participated in the decision for denial).
    (2) The ISOC shall learn from the official the reasons for denying 
the request, concentrating in particular upon which requirement 
continued classification is based and the identifiable damage that would 
result if the information were declassified. The ISOC shall also learn 
from the official the part or parts of the information that is 
classified and if by deleting minor segments of the information it might 
not then be declassified.
    (3) The ISOC's decision to uphold or deny the appeal, in whole or in 
part, shall be based upon the unanimous opinion of its membership. In 
the event that unanimity cannot be attained, the matter shall be 
referred to the Administrator, whose decision shall be final.
    (4) Based upon the outcome of the appeal, a reply shall be made to 
the person making the appeal that either encloses the requested 
information or part of the information, or explains why the continued 
classification of the information is required. A copy of the reply shall 
be sent to the GSA official who originally denied the request for 
declassification, to the GSA Security Officer, and to any other agency 
expressing an interest in the decision.
    (5) Final action on appeals shall be completed within 30 days of the 
date of the appeal.
    (i) Prohibition. No service of staff office in possession of a 
classified document may refuse to confirm the existence of the document 
in response to a request for the document under the provisions for 
mandatory review, unless the fact of its existence would itself be 
classifiable.
    (j) Presidential papers. Information less than 10 years old which 
was originated by the President, by the White House staff, or by 
committees or commissions appointed by the President, or by others 
acting on behalf of the President, is exempted from mandatory review for 
declassification. Such information 10 years old or older is subject to 
mandatory review for declassification in accordance with procedures 
developed by the Archivist of the United States which provide for 
consultation with GSA on matters of primary subject interest to this 
agency.

             Subpart 105	64.1_Policies and Responsibilities


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.101  Who is responsible for enforcing these rules?

    GSA Heads of Services and Staff Offices and Regional Administrators 
are responsible for ensuring that all systems of records under their 
jurisdiction meet the provisions of the Privacy Act and these rules. 
System managers are responsible for the system(s) of records assigned to 
them. The GSA Privacy Act Officer oversees the GSA Privacy Program and 
establishes privacy-related policy and procedures for the agency under 
the direction of the GSA Senior Agency Official for Privacy.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.102  What is GSA's policy on disclosure of information 

in a system of records?

    No information contained in a Privacy Act system of records will be 
disclosed to third parties without the written consent of you, the 
individual of record, except under the conditions cited in Sec. 105-
64.501.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.103  What is GSA's policy on collecting and using 

information in a system of records?

    System managers must collect information that is used to determine 
your rights, benefits, or privileges under GSA programs directly from 
you whenever practical, and use the information only for the intended 
purpose(s).


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.104  What must the system manager tell me when 

soliciting personal information?

    When soliciting information from you or a third party for a system 
of records, system managers must: cite the authority for collecting the 
information; say whether providing the information is mandatory or 
voluntary; give the purpose for which the information will be used; 
state the routine uses

[[Page 487]]

of the information; and describe the effect on you, if any, of not 
providing the information. Any information solicitation forms will 
contain this information.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.105  When may Social Security Numbers (SSNs) be collected?

    Statutory or regulatory authority must exist for collecting Social 
Security Numbers for record systems that use the SSNs as a method of 
identification. Systems without statutory or regulatory authority 
implemented after January 1, 1975, will not collect Social Security 
Numbers.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.106  What is GSA's policy on information accuracy

in a system of records?

    System managers will ensure that all Privacy Act records are 
accurate, relevant, necessary, timely, and complete.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.107  What standards of conduct apply to employees

with privacy-related responsibilities?

    Employees who design, develop, operate, or maintain Privacy Act 
record systems will protect system security, avoid unauthorized 
disclosure of information, both verbal and written, and ensure that no 
system of records is maintained without public notice. All such 
employees will follow the standards of conduct in 5 CFR part 2635, 5 CFR 
part 6701, 5 CFR part 735, and 5 CFR part 2634 to protect personal 
information.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.108  How is personal information safeguarded?

    System managers will establish administrative, technical, and 
physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of 
records, protect the records against possible threats or hazards, and 
permit access only to authorized persons. Automated systems will 
incorporate security controls such as password protection, verification 
of identity of authorized users, detection of break-in attempts, 
firewalls, or encryption, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.109  How does GSA handle other agencies' records?

    In cases where GSA has either permanent or temporary custody of 
other agencies' records, system managers will coordinate with those 
agencies on any release of information. Office of Personnel Management 
(OPM) records that are in GSA's custody are subject to OPM's Privacy Act 
rules.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.110  When may GSA establish computer matching programs?

    System managers will establish computer matching programs or 
agreements for sharing information with other agencies only with the 
consent and under the direction of the GSA Data Integrity Board that 
will be established when and if computer matching programs are used at 
GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.111  What is GSA's policy on directives that may 

conflict with these rules?

    These rules take precedence over any GSA directive that may conflict 
with the requirements stated here. GSA officials will ensure that no 
such conflict exists in new or existing directives.


<R04>
                   Subpart 105	64.2_Access to Records


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.201  How do I get access to my records?

    You may request access to your record in person or by writing to the 
system manager or, in the case of geographically dispersed records, to 
the office maintaining the records (see Appendix A). Parents or 
guardians may obtain access to records of minors or when a court has 
determined that the individual of record is incompetent.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.202  How do I request access in person?

    If appearing in person, you must properly identify yourself through 
photographic identification such as an agency identification badge, 
passport, or driver's license. Records will be available during normal 
business hours at the offices where the records are maintained. You may 
examine the record and be provided a copy on request. If you want 
someone else to accompany you when reviewing a record, you must first 
sign a statement authorizing the disclosure of the record; the statement 
will be maintained with your record.

[[Page 488]]


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.203  How do I request access in writing?

    If you request access in writing, mark both the envelope and the 
request letter ``Privacy Act Request.'' Include in the request your full 
name and address; a description of the records you seek; the title and 
number of the system of records as published in the Federal Register; a 
brief description of the nature, time, and place of your association 
with GSA; and any other information you believe will help in locating 
the record.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.204  How do parents or guardians obtain access to records?

    If you are the parent or guardian of a minor, or of a person 
judicially determined to be incompetent, you must provide full 
information about the individual of record. You also must properly 
identify yourself and provide a copy of the birth certificate of the 
individual, or a court order establishing guardianship, whichever 
applies.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.205  Who will provide access to my record?

    The system manager will make a record available to you on request, 
unless special conditions apply, such as for medical, law enforcement, 
and security records.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.206  How long will it take to get my record?

    The system manager will make a record available within 10 workdays 
after receipt of your request. If a delay of more than 10 workdays is 
expected, the system manager will notify you in writing of the reason 
for the delay and when the record will be available. The system manager 
may ask you for additional information to clarify your request. The 
system manager will have an additional 10 workdays after receipt of the 
new information to provide the record to you, or provide another 
acknowledgment letter if a delay in locating the record is expected.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.207  Are there any fees?

    No fees are charged for records when the total fee is less than $25. 
The system manager may waive the fee above this amount if providing 
records without charge is customary or in the public interest. When the 
cost exceeds $25, the fee for a paper copy is 10 cents per page, and the 
fee for materials other than paper copies is the actual cost of 
reproduction. For fees above $250, advance payment is required. You 
should pay by check or money order made payable to the General Services 
Administration, and provide it to the system manager.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.208  What special conditions apply to release of

medical records?

    Medical records containing information that may have an adverse 
effect upon a person will be released only to a physician designated in 
writing by you, or by your guardian or conservator. Medical records in 
an Official Personnel Folder (OPF) fall under the jurisdiction of the 
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and will be referred to OPM for a 
response.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.209  What special conditions apply to access of 

law enforcement and security records?

    Law enforcement and security records are generally exempt from 
disclosure to individuals except when the system manager, in 
consultation with legal counsel and the Head of the Service or Staff 
Office or Regional Administrator or their representatives, determines 
that information in a record has been used or is being used to deny you 
any right, privilege, or benefit for which you are eligible or entitled 
under Federal law. If so, the system manager will notify you of the 
existence of the record and disclose the information, but only to the 
extent that the information does not identify a confidential source. If 
disclosure of information could reasonably be expected to identify a 
confidential source, the record will not be disclosed to you unless it 
is possible to delete all such information. A confidential source is a 
person or persons who furnished information during Federal 
investigations with the understanding that his or her identity would 
remain confidential.

[[Page 489]]


<R04>
              Subpart 105	64.3_Denial of Access to Records


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.301  Under what conditions will I be denied

access to a record?

    The system manager will deny access to a record that is being 
compiled in the reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding 
or to records that are specifically exempted from disclosure by GSA in 
its system of records notices, published in the Federal Register. 
Exempted systems include the Investigation Case Files, Internal 
Evaluation Case Files, and Security Files. These systems are exempted to 
maintain the effectiveness and integrity of investigations conducted by 
the Office of Inspector General, and others, as part of their duties and 
responsibilities involving Federal employment, contracts, and security.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.302  How will I be denied access?

    If you request access to a record in an exempt system of records, 
the system manager will consult with the Head of Service or Staff Office 
or Regional Administrator or their representatives, legal counsel, and 
other officials as appropriate, to determine if all or part of the 
record may be disclosed. If the decision is to deny access, the system 
manager will provide a written notice to you giving the reason for the 
denial and your appeal rights.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.303  How do I appeal a denial to access a record?

    If you are denied access to a record in whole or in part, you may 
file an administrative appeal within 30 days of the denial. The appeal 
should be in writing and addressed to: GSA Privacy Act Officer (CIB), 
General Services Administration, 1800 F Street NW, Washington DC 20405. 
Mark both the envelope and the appeal letter ``Privacy Act Appeal.''


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.304  How are administrative appeal decisions made?

    The GSA Privacy Act Officer will conduct a review of your appeal by 
consulting with legal counsel and appropriate officials. The Privacy Act 
Officer may grant record access if the appeal is granted. If the 
decision is to reject the appeal, the Privacy Act Officer will provide 
all pertinent information about the case to the Deputy Administrator and 
ask for a final administrative decision. The Deputy Administrator may 
grant access to a record, in which case the Privacy Act Officer will 
notify you in writing, and the system manager will make the record 
available to you. If the Deputy Administrator denies the appeal, he or 
she will notify you in writing of the reason for rejection and of your 
right to a judicial review. The administrative appeal review will take 
no longer than 30 workdays after the Privacy Act Officer receives the 
appeal. The Deputy Administrator may extend the time limit by notifying 
you in writing of the extension and the reason for it before the 30 days 
are up.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.305  What is my recourse to an appeal denial?

    You may file a civil action to have the GSA administrative decision 
overturned within two years after the decision is made. You may file in 
a Federal District Court where you live or have a principal place of 
business, where the records are maintained, or in the District of 
Columbia.


<R04>
                   Subpart 105	64.4_Amending a Record


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.401  Can I amend my record?

    You may request to amend your record by writing to the system 
manager with the proposed amendment. Mark both the envelope and the

    You may not amend the following records under the law:
    (a) Transcripts of testimony given under oath or written statements 
made under oath.
    (b) Transcripts of grand jury proceedings, judicial proceedings, or 
quasi-judicial proceedings which constitute the official record of the

    The system manager will consult with the Head of Service or Staff 
Office or Regional Administrator or their representatives, and legal 
counsel. They will determine whether to amend an existing record by 
comparing its accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness with the 
amendment you propose. The system manager will notify you within 10 
workdays whether your proposed amendment is approved or denied. In case 
of an expected delay, the system manager will acknowledge receipt of 
your request in writing and provide an estimate of when you may expect a 
decision. If your request to amend is approved, the system manager will 
amend the record and send an amended copy to you and to anyone who had 
previously received the record. If your request to amend is denied, the 
system manager will advise you in writing, giving the reason for denial, 
a proposed alternative amendment if possible, and your appeal rights. 
The system manager also will notify the GSA Privacy Act Officer of any 
request for amendment and its disposition.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.404  What must I do if I agree to an alternative amendment?

    If you agree to the alternative amendment proposed by the system 
manager, you must notify the manager in writing of your concurrence. The 
system manager will amend the record and send an amended copy to you and 
to anyone else who had previously received the record.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.405  Can I appeal a denial to amend a record?

    You may file an appeal within 30 workdays of a denial to amend your 
record by writing to the: GSA Privacy Act Officer (CIB), General 
Services Administration, 1800 F Street NW, Washington DC 20405. Mark 
both the envelope and the appeal letter ``Privacy Act Amendment 
Appeal.'' Appeals to amend records in a GSA employee's official 
personnel file will be sent to the Office of Personnel Management, 
Washington DC 20415.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.406  How will my appeal be handled?

    The GSA Privacy Act Officer will consult with legal counsel and 
appropriate GSA officials concerning your appeal. If they decide to 
reject your appeal, the Privacy Act Officer will provide the Deputy 
Administrator with all pertinent information about the case and request 
a final administrative decision. The Deputy Administrator may approve 
your amendment, in which case the Privacy Act Officer will notify you in 
writing, and the system manager will amend the record and send an 
amended copy to you and anyone who had previously been provided with the 
record. If the Deputy Administrator denies the appeal, he or she will 
notify you in writing of the reason for denial, of your right to a 
judicial review, and of your right to file a Statement of Disagreement. 
The amendment appeal review will be made within 30 workdays after the 
Privacy Act Officer receives your appeal. The Deputy Administrator may 
extend the time limit by notifying you in writing of the reason for the 
extension before the 30 days are up.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.407  How do I file a Statement of Disagreement?

    You may file a Statement of Disagreement with the system manager 
within 30 days of the denial to amend a record. The statement should

the performance of their official duties; required by the Freedom of 
Information Act; for a routine use stated in a Federal Register notice; 
to the Bureau of the Census for use in fulfilling its duties; for 
statistical research or reporting, and only when the record is not 
individually identifiable; to the National Archives and Records 
Administration (NARA) when the record has been determined to be of 
historical or other value that warrants permanent retention; to a U.S. 
law enforcement agency or instrumentality for a civil or criminal law 
enforcement purpose; under compelling circumstances affecting an 
individual's health and safety, and upon disclosure a notification will

<R05>
Sec. 105-64.502  How do I find out if my record has been disclosed?

    You may request an accounting of the persons or agencies to whom 
your record has been disclosed, including the date and purpose of each 
disclosure, by writing to the system manager. Mark both the envelope and 
the letter ``Privacy Act Accounting Request.'' The system manager will 
provide the requested information in the same way as that for granting 
access to records, see Subpart 105-64.2, providing no restrictions to 
disclosure or accounting of disclosures applies.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.503  What is an accounting of disclosures?

    The system manager maintains an account of each record disclosure 
for five years or for the life of the record, whichever is longer. The 
accounting of disclosure information includes the name of the person or 
agency to whom your record has been provided, the date, the type of 
information disclosed, and the reason for disclosure. Other pertinent 
information, such as justifications for disclosure and any written 
consent that you may have provided, is also included. No accounting 
needs to be maintained for disclosures to GSA officials or employees in 
the performance of their duties, or disclosures under the Freedom of 
Information Act.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.504  Under what conditions will I be denied an 

accounting of disclosures?

    The system manager will deny your request for an accounting of 
disclosures when the disclosures are to GSA officials or employees in 
the performance of their duties or disclosures under the Freedom of 
Information Act, for which no accounting is required; law enforcement 
agencies for law enforcement activities; and systems of records exempted 
by notice in the Federal Register. You may appeal a denial using the

<R05>
Sec. 105-68.50  How is this part written?

    (a) This part uses a ``plain language'' format to make it easier for 
the general public and business community to use. The section headings 
and text, often in the form of questions and answers, must be read 
together.
    (b) Pronouns used within this part, such as ``I'' and ``you,'' 
change from subpart to subpart depending on the audience being 
addressed. The pronoun ``we'' always is the General Services 
Administration.
    (c) The ``Covered Transactions'' diagram in the appendix to this 
part shows the levels or ``tiers'' at which the General Services 
Administration enforces an exclusion under this part.

[[Page 496]]


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.75  Do terms in this part have special meanings?

    This part uses terms throughout the text that have special meaning. 
Those terms are defined in Subpart I of this part. For example, three 
important terms are--
    (a) Exclusion or excluded, which refers only to discretionary 
actions taken by a suspending or debarring official under this part or 
the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4);
    (b) Disqualification or disqualified, which refers to prohibitions 
under specific statutes, executive orders (other than Executive Order 
12549 and Executive Order 12689), or other authorities. 
Disqualifications frequently are not subject to the discretion of an 
agency official, may have a different scope than exclusions, or have 
special conditions that apply to the disqualification; and
    (c) Ineligibility or ineligible, which generally refers to a person 
who is either excluded or disqualified.


<R04>
                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.100  What does this part do?

    This part adopts a governmentwide system of debarment and suspension 
for GSA nonprocurement activities. It also provides for reciprocal 
exclusion of persons who have been excluded under the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation, and provides for the consolidated listing of all 
persons who are excluded, or disqualified by statute, executive order, 
or other legal authority. This part satisfies the requirements in 
section 3 of Executive Order 12549, ``Debarment and Suspension'' (3 CFR 
1986 Comp., p. 189), Executive Order 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension'' 
(3 CFR 1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Section 2455, Public 
Law 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327).


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.105  Does this part apply to me?

    Portions of this part (see table at Sec. 105-68.25(b)) apply to you 
if you are a(n)--
    (a) Person who has been, is, or may reasonably be expected to be, a 
participant or principal in a covered transaction;
    (b) Respondent (a person against whom the General Services 
Administration has initiated a debarment or suspension action);
    (c) GSA debarring or suspending official; or
    (d) GSA official who is authorized to enter into covered 
transactions with non-Federal parties.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.110  What is the purpose of the nonprocurement

debarment and suspension system?

    (a) To protect the public interest, the Federal Government ensures 
the integrity of Federal programs by conducting business only with 
responsible persons.
    (b) A Federal agency uses the nonprocurement debarment and 
suspension system to exclude from Federal programs persons who are not 
presently responsible.
    (c) An exclusion is a serious action that a Federal agency may take 
only to protect the public interest. A Federal agency may not exclude a 
person or commodity for the purposes of punishment.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.115  How does an exclusion restrict a person's 

involvement in covered transactions?

    With the exceptions stated in Sec. Sec. 105-68.120, 105-68.315, and 
105-68.420, a person who is excluded by the General Services 
Administration or any other Federal agency may not:
    (a) Be a participant in a(n) GSA transaction that is a covered 
transaction under subpart B of this part;
    (b) Be a participant in a transaction of any other Federal agency 
that is a covered transaction under that agency's regulation for 
debarment and suspension; or
    (c) Act as a principal of a person participating in one of those 
covered transactions.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.120  May we grant an exception to let an excluded 

person participate in a covered transaction?

    (a) The Administrator of General Services may grant an exception 
permitting an excluded person to participate in a particular covered 
transaction. If the Administrator of General Services grants an 
exception, the exception must be in writing and state the reason(s) for 
deviating from the

[[Page 497]]

governmentwide policy in Executive Order 12549.
    (b) An exception granted by one agency for an excluded person does 
not extend to the covered transactions of another agency.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.125  Does an exclusion under the nonprocurement system

affect a person's eligibility for Federal procurement contracts?

    If any Federal agency excludes a person under its nonprocurement 
common rule on or after August 25, 1995, the excluded person is also 
ineligible to participate in Federal procurement transactions under the 
FAR. Therefore, an exclusion under this part has reciprocal effect in 
Federal procurement transactions.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.130  Does exclusion under the Federal procurement system

affect a person's eligibility to participate in nonprocurement 
transactions?

    If any Federal agency excludes a person under the FAR on or after 
August 25, 1995, the excluded person is also ineligible to participate 
in nonprocurement covered transactions under this part. Therefore, an 
exclusion under the FAR has reciprocal effect in Federal nonprocurement 
transactions.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.135  May the General Services Administration exclude a

person who is not currently participating in a nonprocurement 
transaction?

    Given a cause that justifies an exclusion under this part, we may 
exclude any person who has been involved, is currently involved, or may 
reasonably be expected to be involved in a covered transaction.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.140  How do I know if a person is excluded?

    Check the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) to determine whether a 
person is excluded. The General Services Administration (GSA) maintains 
the EPLS and makes it available, as detailed in subpart E of this part. 
When a Federal agency takes an action to exclude a person under the 
nonprocurement or procurement debarment and suspension system, the 
agency enters the information about the excluded person into the EPLS.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.145  Does this part address persons who are disqualified,

as well as those who are excluded from nonprocurement transactions?

    Except if provided for in Subpart J of this part, this part--
    (a) Addresses disqualified persons only to--
    (1) Provide for their inclusion in the EPLS; and
    (2) State responsibilities of Federal agencies and participants to 
check for disqualified persons before entering into covered 
transactions.
    (b) Does not specify the--
    (1) GSA transactions for which a disqualified person is ineligible. 
Those transactions vary on a case-by-case basis, because they depend on 
the language of the specific statute, Executive order, or regulation 
that caused the disqualification;
    (2) Entities to which the disqualification applies; or
    (3) Process that the agency uses to disqualify a person. Unlike 
exclusion, disqualification is frequently not a discretionary action 
that a Federal agency takes.


<R04>
                     Subpart B_Covered Transactions


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.200  What is a covered transaction?

    A covered transaction is a nonprocurement or procurement transaction 
that is subject to the prohibitions of this part. It may be a 
transaction at--
    (a) The primary tier, between a Federal agency and a person (see 
appendix to this part); or
    (b) A lower tier, between a participant in a covered transaction and 
another person.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.205  Why is it important if a particular transaction is a 

covered transaction?

    The importance of a covered transaction depends upon who you are.
    (a) As a participant in the transaction, you have the 
responsibilities laid out in Subpart C of this part. Those include 
responsibilities to the person or Federal agency at the next higher tier 
from whom you received

[[Page 498]]

the transaction, if any. They also include responsibilities if you 
subsequently enter into other covered transactions with persons at the 
next lower tier.
    (b) As a Federal official who enters into a primary tier 
transaction, you have the responsibilities laid out in subpart D of this 
part.
    (c) As an excluded person, you may not be a participant or principal 
in the transaction unless--
    (1) The person who entered into the transaction with you allows you 
to continue your involvement in a transaction that predates your 
exclusion, as permitted under Sec. 105-68.310 or Sec. 105-68.415; or
    (2) A(n) GSA official obtains an exception from the Administrator of 
General Services to allow you to be involved in the transaction, as 
permitted under Sec. 105-68.120.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.210  Which nonprocurement transactions are covered 

transactions?

    All nonprocurement transactions, as defined in Sec. 105-68.970, are 
covered transactions unless listed in Sec. 105-68.215. (See appendix to 
this part.)


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.215  Which nonprocurement transactions are not covered 

transactions?

    The following types of nonprocurement transactions are not covered 
transactions:
    (a) A direct award to--
    (1) A foreign government or foreign governmental entity;
    (2) A public international organization;
    (3) An entity owned (in whole or in part) or controlled by a foreign 
government; or
    (4) Any other entity consisting wholly or partially of one or more 
foreign governments or foreign governmental entities.
    (b) A benefit to an individual as a personal entitlement without 
regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received 
in an individual's business capacity are not excepted). For example, if 
a person receives social security benefits under the Supplemental 
Security Income provisions of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1301 et 
seq., those benefits are not covered transactions and, therefore, are 
not affected if the person is excluded.
    (c) Federal employment.
    (d) A transaction that the General Services Administration needs to 
respond to a national or agency-recognized emergency or disaster.
    (e) A permit, license, certificate, or similar instrument issued as 
a means to regulate public health, safety, or the environment, unless 
the General Services Administration specifically designates it to be a 
covered transaction.
    (f) An incidental benefit that results from ordinary governmental 
operations.
    (g) Any other transaction if the application of an exclusion to the 
transaction is prohibited by law.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.220  Are any procurement contracts included as covered 

transactions?

    (a) Covered transactions under this part--
    (1) Do not include any procurement contracts awarded directly by a 
Federal agency; but
    (2) Do include some procurement contracts awarded by non-Federal 
participants in nonprocurement covered transactions (see appendix to 
this part).
    (b) Specifically, a contract for goods or services is a covered 
transaction if any of the following applies:
    (1) The contract is awarded by a participant in a nonprocurement 
transaction that is covered under Sec. 105-68.210, and the amount of 
the contract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.
    (2) The contract requires the consent of a(n) GSA official. In that 
case, the contract, regardless of the amount, always is a covered 
transaction, and it does not matter who awarded it. For example, it 
could be a subcontract awarded by a contractor at a tier below a 
nonprocurement transaction, as shown in the appendix to this part.
    (3) The contract is for federally-required audit services.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.225  How do I know if a transaction in which I may 

participate is a covered transaction?

    As a participant in a transaction, you will know that it is a 
covered transaction because the agency regulations governing the 
transaction, the

[[Page 499]]

appropriate agency official, or participant at the next higher tier who 
enters into the transaction with you, will tell you that you must comply 
with applicable portions of this part.

    Subpart C_Responsibilities of Participants Regarding Transactions

                    Doing Business With Other Persons


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.300  What must I do before I enter into a covered 

transaction with another person at the next lower tier?

    When you enter into a covered transaction with another person at the 
next lower tier, you must verify that the person with whom you intend to 
do business is not excluded or disqualified. You do this by:
    (a) Checking the EPLS; or
    (b) Collecting a certification from that person if allowed by this 
rule; or
    (c) Adding a clause or condition to the covered transaction with 
that person.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.305  May I enter into a covered transaction with an 

excluded or disqualified person?

    (a) You as a participant may not enter into a covered transaction 
with an excluded person, unless the General Services Administration 
grants an exception under Sec. 105-68.120.
    (b) You may not enter into any transaction with a person who is 
disqualified from that transaction, unless you have obtained an 
exception under the disqualifying statute, Executive order, or 
regulation.

person with whom I am already doing business in a covered 
transaction?

    (a) You as a participant may continue covered transactions with an 
excluded person if the transactions were in existence when the agency 
excluded the person. However, you are not required to continue the 
transactions, and you may consider termination. You should make a 
decision about whether to terminate and the type of termination action, 
if any, only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper 
and appropriate.
    (b) You may not renew or extend covered transactions (other than no-
cost time extensions) with any excluded person, unless the General 
Services Administration grants an exception under Sec. 105-68.120.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.315  May I use the services of an excluded person as a 

principal under a covered transaction?

    (a) You as a participant may continue to use the services of an 
excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction if you were 
using the services of that person in the transaction before the person 
was excluded. However, you are not required to continue using that 
person's services as a principal. You should make a decision about 
whether to discontinue that person's services only after a thorough 
review to ensure that the action is proper and appropriate.
    (b) You may not begin to use the services of an excluded person as a 
principal under a covered transaction unless the General Services 
Administration grants an exception under Sec. 105-68.120.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.320  Must I verify that principals of my covered

transactions are eligible to participate?

    Yes, you as a participant are responsible for determining whether 
any of your principals of your covered transactions is excluded or 
disqualified from participating in the transaction. You may decide the 
method and frequency by which you do so. You may, but you are not 
required to, check the EPLS.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.325  What happens if I do business with an excluded 

person in a covered transaction?

    If as a participant you knowingly do business with an excluded 
person, we may disallow costs, annul or terminate the transaction, issue 
a stop work order, debar or suspend you, or take other remedies as 
appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.330  What requirements must I pass down to persons at 

lower tiers with whom I intend to do business?

    Before entering into a covered transaction with a participant at the 
next lower tier, you must require that participant to--

[[Page 500]]

    (a) Comply with this subpart as a condition of participation in the 
transaction. You may do so using any method(s), unless Sec. 105-68.440 
requires you to use specific methods.
    (b) Pass the requirement to comply with this subpart to each person 
with whom the participant enters into a covered transaction at the next 
lower tier.

that covered transaction:
    (a) Are presently excluded or disqualified;
    (b) Have been convicted within the preceding three years of any of

<R05>
Sec. 105-68.340  If I disclose unfavorable information required 

under Sec. 105-68.335, will I be prevented from participating in 
the transaction?

    As a primary tier participant, your disclosure of unfavorable 
information about yourself or a principal under Sec. 105-68.335 will 
not necessarily cause us to deny your participation in the covered 
transaction. We will consider the information when we determine whether 
to enter into the covered transaction. We also will consider any 
additional information or explanation that you elect to submit with the 
disclosed information.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.345  What happens if I fail to disclose information 

required under Sec. 105-68.335?

    If we later determine that you failed to disclose information under 
Sec. 105-68.335 that you knew at the time you entered into the covered 
transaction, we may--
    (a) Terminate the transaction for material failure to comply with 
the terms and conditions of the transaction; or
    (b) Pursue any other available remedies, including suspension and 
debarment.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.350  What must I do if I learn of information required 

under Sec. 105-68.335 after entering into a covered transaction with 
the General Services 
          Administration?

    At any time after you enter into a covered transaction, you must 
give immediate written notice to the GSA office with which you entered 
into the transaction if you learn either that--
    (a) You failed to disclose information earlier, as required by Sec. 
105-68.335; or
    (b) Due to changed circumstances, you or any of the principals for 
the transaction now meet any of the criteria in Sec. 105-68.335.

             Disclosing Information--Lower Tier Participants


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.355  What information must I provide to a higher tier

participant before entering into a covered transaction with that 
participant?

    Before you enter into a covered transaction with a person at the 
next higher tier, you as a lower tier participant must notify that 
person if you know that you or any of the principals are presently 
excluded or disqualified.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.360  What happens if I fail to disclose the information

required under Sec. 105-68.355?

    If we later determine that you failed to tell the person at the 
higher tier that you were excluded or disqualified at the time you 
entered into the covered transaction with that person, we may pursue any 
available remedies, including suspension and debarment.

[[Page 501]]

with a higher tier 
          participant?

an excluded person, or under which an excluded person is a principal, if 
the transactions were in existence when the person was excluded. You are

the type of termination action, if any, only after a thorough review to 
ensure that the action is proper.
    (b) You may not renew or extend covered transactions (other than no-

in lower-tier covered transactions.

[68 FR 66627, Nov. 26, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.445  What action may I take if a primary tier participant 

knowingly does business with an excluded or disqualified person?

<R04>
                 Subpart E_Excluded Parties List System


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.500  What is the purpose of the Excluded Parties

List System (EPLS)?

    The EPLS is a widely available source of the most current 
information about persons who are excluded or disqualified from covered 
transactions.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.505  Who uses the EPLS?

    (a) Federal agency officials use the EPLS to determine whether to 
enter into a transaction with a person, as required under Sec. 105-
68.430.
    (b) Participants also may, but are not required to, use the EPLS to 
determine if--
    (1) Principals of their transactions are excluded or disqualified, 
as required under Sec. 105-68.320; or
    (2) Persons with whom they are entering into covered transactions at 
the next lower tier are excluded or disqualified.

<R05>
Sec. 105-68.510  Who maintains the EPLS?

    In accordance with the OMB guidelines, the General Services 
Administration (GSA) maintains the EPLS. When

[[Page 503]]

a Federal agency takes an action to exclude a person under the 
nonprocurement or procurement debarment and suspension system, the 
agency enters the information about the excluded person into the EPLS.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.515  What specific information is in the EPLS?

    (a) At a minimum, the EPLS indicates--
    (1) The full name (where available) and address of each excluded or 
disqualified person, in alphabetical order, with cross references if 
more than one name is involved in a single action;
    (2) The type of action;
    (3) The cause for the action;
    (4) The scope of the action;
    (5) Any termination date for the action;

available.
    (b)(1) The database for the EPLS includes a field for the Taxpayer 
Identification Number (TIN) (the social security number (SSN) for an 
individual) of an excluded or disqualified person.
    (2) Agencies disclose the SSN of an individual to verify the 
identity of an individual, only if permitted under the Privacy Act of 
1974 and, if appropriate, the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection 
Act of 1988, as codified in 5 U.S.C. 552(a).


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.520  Who places the information into the EPLS?

    Federal officials who take actions to exclude persons under this 
part or officials who are responsible for identifying disqualified 
persons must enter the following information about those persons into 
the EPLS:
    (a) Information required by Sec. 105-68.515(a);
    (b) The Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) of the excluded or 
disqualified person, including the social security number (SSN) for an 
individual, if the number is available and may be disclosed under law;
    (c) Information about an excluded or disqualified person, generally 
within five working days, after--
    (1) Taking an exclusion action;
    (2) Modifying or rescinding an exclusion action;
    (3) Finding that a person is disqualified; or
    (4) Finding that there has been a change in the status of a person 
who is listed as disqualified.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.525  Whom do I ask if I have questions about a person 

in the EPLS?

    If you have questions about a person in the EPLS, ask the point of 
contact for the Federal agency that placed the person's name into the 
EPLS. You may find the agency point of contact from the EPLS.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.530  Where can I find the EPLS?

    (a) You may access the EPLS through the Internet, currently at 
http://epls.arnet.gov.
    (b) As of November 26, 2003, you may also subscribe to a printed 
version. However, we anticipate discontinuing the printed version. Until 
it is discontinued, you may obtain the printed version by purchasing a 
yearly subscription from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S.

   Subpart F_General Principles Relating to Suspension and Debarment 
                                 Actions


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.600  How do suspension and debarment actions start?

    When we receive information from any source concerning a cause for 
suspension or debarment, we will promptly report and investigate it. We 
refer the question of whether to suspend or debar you to our suspending 
or debarring official for consideration, if appropriate.

[[Page 504]]


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.605  How does suspension differ from debarment?

    Suspension differs from debarment in that--

------------------------------------------------------------------------
      A suspending official . . .           A debarring official . . .
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) Imposes suspension as a temporary    Imposes debarment for a

------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.610  What procedures does the General Services

Administration use in suspension and debarment actions?

    In deciding whether to suspend or debar you, we handle the actions 
as informally as practicable, consistent with principles of fundamental 
fairness.
    (a) For suspension actions, we use the procedures in this subpart 
and subpart G of this part.
    (b) For debarment actions, we use the procedures in this subpart and 
subpart H of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.615  How does the General Services Administration notify a 

person of a suspension or debarment action?

    (a) The suspending or debarring official sends a written notice to 
the last known street address, facsimile number, or e-mail address of--
    (1) You or your identified counsel; or
    (2) Your agent for service of process, or any of your partners, 
officers, directors, owners, or joint venturers.
    (b) The notice is effective if sent to any of these persons.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.620  Do Federal agencies coordinate suspension and 
debarment actions?

    Yes, when more than one Federal agency has an interest in a 
suspension or debarment, the agencies may consider designating one 
agency as the lead agency for making the decision. Agencies are 
encouraged to establish methods and procedures for coordinating their 
suspension and debarment actions.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.625  What is the scope of a suspension or debarment?

    If you are suspended or debarred, the suspension or debarment is 
effective as follows:
    (a) Your suspension or debarment constitutes suspension or debarment 
of all of your divisions and other organizational elements from all 
covered transactions, unless the suspension or debarment decision is 
limited--
    (1) By its terms to one or more specifically identified individuals, 
divisions, or other organizational elements; or
    (2) To specific types of transactions.
    (b) Any affiliate of a participant may be included in a suspension 
or debarment action if the suspending or debarring official--
    (1) Officially names the affiliate in the notice; and
    (2) Gives the affiliate an opportunity to contest the action.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.630  May the General Services Administration impute 

conduct of one person to another?

    For purposes of actions taken under this rule, we may impute conduct 
as follows:
    (a) Conduct imputed from an individual to an organization. We may 
impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of any 
officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee, or other individual 
associated with an organization, to that organization when the improper 
conduct occurred in connection with the individual's performance of

[[Page 505]]

duties for or on behalf of that organization, or with the organization's 
knowledge, approval or acquiescence. The organization's acceptance of 
the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval 
or acquiescence.
    (b) Conduct imputed from an organization to an individual, or 
between individuals. We may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other 
improper conduct of any organization to an individual, or from one 
individual to another individual, if the individual to whom the improper 
conduct is imputed either participated in, had knowledge of, or reason 
to know of the improper conduct.
    (c) Conduct imputed from one organization to another organization. 
We may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of one 
organization to another organization when the improper conduct occurred 
in connection with a partnership, joint venture, joint application, 
association or similar arrangement, or when the organization to whom the 
improper conduct is imputed has the power to direct, manage, control or 
influence the activities of the organization responsible for the 
improper conduct. Acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct is 
evidence of knowledge, approval or acquiescence.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.635  May the General Services Administration settle a 

debarment or suspension action?

    Yes, we may settle a debarment or suspension action at any time if 
it is in the best interest of the Federal Government.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.640  May a settlement include a voluntary exclusion?

    Yes, if we enter into a settlement with you in which you agree to be 
excluded, it is called a voluntary exclusion and has governmentwide 
effect.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.645  Do other Federal agencies know if the General

Services Administration agrees to a voluntary exclusion?

    (a) Yes, we enter information regarding a voluntary exclusion into 
the EPLS.
    (b) Also, any agency or person may contact us to find out the 
details of a voluntary exclusion.


<R04>
                          Subpart G_Suspension


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.700  When may the suspending official issue a suspension?

    Suspension is a serious action. Using the procedures of this subpart 
and subpart F of this part, the suspending official may impose 
suspension only when that official determines that--
    (a) There exists an indictment for, or other adequate evidence to 
suspect, an offense listed under Sec. 105-68.800(a), or
    (b) There exists adequate evidence to suspect any other cause for 
debarment listed under Sec. 105-68.800(b) through (d); and
    (c) Immediate action is necessary to protect the public interest.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.705  What does the suspending official consider in

issuing a suspension?

    (a) In determining the adequacy of the evidence to support the 
suspension, the suspending official considers how much information is 
available, how credible it is given the circumstances, whether or not 
important allegations are corroborated, and what inferences can 
reasonably be drawn as a result. During this assessment, the suspending 
official may examine the basic documents, including grants, cooperative 
agreements, loan authorizations, contracts, and other relevant 
documents.
    (b) An indictment, conviction, civil judgment, or other official 
findings by Federal, State, or local bodies that determine factual and/
or legal matters, constitutes adequate evidence for purposes of 
suspension actions.
    (c) In deciding whether immediate action is needed to protect the 
public interest, the suspending official has wide discretion. For 
example, the suspending official may infer the necessity for immediate 
action to protect the public interest either from the nature of the 
circumstances giving rise to a cause for suspension or from potential 
business relationships or involvement with a program of the Federal 
Government.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.710  When does a suspension take effect?

<R05>
Sec. 105-68.715  What notice does the suspending official give 

me if I am suspended?

    After deciding to suspend you, the suspending official promptly 
sends you a Notice of Suspension advising you--
    (a) That you have been suspended;
    (b) That your suspension is based on--
    (1) An indictment;
    (2) A conviction;
    (3) Other adequate evidence that you have committed irregularities 
which seriously reflect on the propriety of further Federal Government 
dealings with you; or
    (4) Conduct of another person that has been imputed to you, or your 
affiliation with a suspended or debarred person;
    (c) Of any other irregularities in terms sufficient to put you on 
notice without disclosing the Federal Government's evidence;
    (d) Of the cause(s) upon which we relied under Sec. 105-68.700 for 
imposing suspension;
    (e) That your suspension is for a temporary period pending the 
completion of an investigation or resulting legal or debarment 
proceedings;
    (f) Of the applicable provisions of this subpart, Subpart F of this 
part, and any other GSA procedures governing suspension decision making; 
and
    (g) Of the governmentwide effect of your suspension from procurement 
and nonprocurement programs and activities.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.720  How may I contest a suspension?

    If you as a respondent wish to contest a suspension, you or your 
representative must provide the suspending official with information in 
opposition to the suspension. You may do this orally or in writing, but 
any information provided orally that you consider important must also be 
submitted in writing for the official record.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.725  How much time do I have to contest a suspension?

the suspending official within 30 days after you receive the Notice of 
Suspension.
    (b) We consider the notice to be received by you--
    (1) When delivered, if we mail the notice to the last known street

<R05>
Sec. 105-68.730  What information must I provide to the suspending

official if I contest a suspension?

    (a) In addition to any information and argument in opposition, as a 
respondent your submission to the suspending official must identify--
    (1) Specific facts that contradict the statements contained in the 
Notice of Suspension. A general denial is insufficient to raise a 
genuine dispute over facts material to the suspension;
    (2) All existing, proposed, or prior exclusions under regulations 
implementing E.O. 12549 and all similar actions taken by Federal, state, 
or local agencies, including administrative agreements that affect only

    (1) Your suspension is based upon an indictment, conviction, civil 
judgment, or other finding by a Federal, State, or local body for which 
an opportunity to contest the facts was provided;

[[Page 507]]

    (2) Your presentation in opposition contains only general denials to 
information contained in the Notice of Suspension;
    (3) The issues raised in your presentation in opposition to the 
suspension are not factual in nature, or are not material to the 
suspending official's initial decision to suspend, or the official's 
decision whether to continue the suspension; or
    (4) On the basis of advice from the Department of Justice, an office 
of the United States Attorney, a State attorney general's office, or a 
State or local prosecutor's office, that substantial interests of the 
government in pending or contemplated legal proceedings based on the 
same facts as the suspension would be prejudiced by conducting fact-
finding.
    (b) You will have an opportunity to challenge the facts if the 
suspending official determines that--
    (1) The conditions in paragraph (a) of this section do not exist; 
and
    (2) Your presentation in opposition raises a genuine dispute over 
facts material to the suspension.

suspension decision.
    (b) You as a respondent or your representative must submit any 
documentary evidence you want the suspending official to consider.

record.
    (b) A transcribed record of fact-finding proceedings must be made, 
unless you as a respondent and the General Services Administration agree 
to waive it in advance. If you want a copy of the transcribed record, 
you may purchase it.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.750  What does the suspending official consider in 

deciding whether to continue or terminate my suspension?

    (a) The suspending official bases the decision on all information 
contained in the official record. The record includes--
    (1) All information in support of the suspending official's initial 
decision to suspend you;
    (2) Any further information and argument presented in support of, or 
opposition to, the suspension; and
    (3) Any transcribed record of fact-finding proceedings.
    (b) The suspending official may refer disputed material facts to 
another official for findings of fact. The suspending official may 
reject any resulting findings, in whole or in part, only after 
specifically determining them to be arbitrary, capricious, or clearly 
erroneous.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.755  When will I know whether the suspension is 

continued or terminated?

    The suspending official must make a written decision whether to 
continue, modify, or terminate your suspension within 45 days of closing 
the official record. The official record closes upon the suspending 
official's receipt of final submissions, information and findings of 
fact, if any. The suspending official may extend that period for good 
cause.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.760  How long may my suspension last?

    (a) If legal or debarment proceedings are initiated at the time of, 
or during your suspension, the suspension may continue until the

initiated, a suspension may not exceed 12 months.

[[Page 508]]

    (b) The suspending official may extend the 12 month limit under 
paragraph (a) of this section for an additional 6 months if an office of 
a U.S. Assistant Attorney General, U.S. Attorney, or other responsible 
prosecuting official requests an extension in writing. In no event may a 
suspension exceed 18 months without initiating proceedings under 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) The suspending official must notify the appropriate officials 
under paragraph (b) of this section of an impending termination of a 
suspension at least 30 days before the 12 month period expires to allow 
the officials an opportunity to request an extension.

deciding whether to debar me?

    (a) The debarring official may debar you for any of the causes in 
Sec. 105-68.800. However, the official need not debar you even if a 
cause for debarment exists. The official may consider the seriousness of 
your acts or omissions and the mitigating or aggravating factors set

    (b) The debarring official bases the decision on all information 
contained in the official record. The record includes--

necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.860  What factors may influence the debarring official's 

decision?

    This section lists the mitigating and aggravating factors that the 
debarring official may consider in determining whether to debar you and 
the length of your debarment period. The debarring official may consider 
other factors if appropriate in light of the circumstances of a 
particular case. The existence or nonexistence of any factor, such as 
one of those set forth in this section, is not necessarily determinative 
of your present responsibility. In making a debarment decision, the 
debarring official may consider the following factors:
    (a) The actual or potential harm or impact that results or may 
result from the wrongdoing.
    (b) The frequency of incidents and/or duration of the wrongdoing.
    (c) Whether there is a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing. For 
example, if you have been found by another Federal agency or a State 
agency to have engaged in wrongdoing similar to that found in the 
debarment action, the existence of this fact may be used by the 
debarring official in determining that you have a pattern or prior 
history of wrongdoing.

[[Page 511]]

    (d) Whether you are or have been excluded or disqualified by an 
agency of the Federal Government or have not been allowed to participate 
in State or local contracts or assistance agreements on a basis of 
conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in 
this part.
    (e) Whether you have entered into an administrative agreement with a 
Federal agency or a State or local government that is not governmentwide 
but is based on conduct similar to one or more of the causes for 
debarment specified in this part.
    (f) Whether and to what extent you planned, initiated, or carried 
out the wrongdoing.
    (g) Whether you have accepted responsibility for the wrongdoing and 
recognize the seriousness of the misconduct that led to the cause for 
debarment.
    (h) Whether you have paid or agreed to pay all criminal, civil and 
administrative liabilities for the improper activity, including any 
investigative or administrative costs incurred by the government, and 
have made or agreed to make full restitution.
    (i) Whether you have cooperated fully with the government agencies 
during the investigation and any court or administrative action. In 
determining the extent of cooperation, the debarring official may 
consider when the cooperation began and whether you disclosed all 
pertinent information known to you.
    (j) Whether the wrongdoing was pervasive within your organization.
    (k) The kind of positions held by the individuals involved in the 
wrongdoing.
    (l) Whether your organization took appropriate corrective action or 
remedial measures, such as establishing ethics training and implementing 
programs to prevent recurrence.
    (m) Whether your principals tolerated the offense.
    (n) Whether you brought the activity cited as a basis for the 
debarment to the attention of the appropriate government agency in a 
timely manner.
    (o) Whether you have fully investigated the circumstances 
surrounding the cause for debarment and, if so, made the result of the 
investigation available to the debarring official.
    (p) Whether you had effective standards of conduct and internal 
control systems in place at the time the questioned conduct occurred.
    (q) Whether you have taken appropriate disciplinary action against 
the individuals responsible for the activity which constitutes the cause 
for debarment.
    (r) Whether you have had adequate time to eliminate the 
circumstances within your organization that led to the cause for the 
debarment.
    (s) Other factors that are appropriate to the circumstances of a 
particular case.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.865  How long may my debarment last?

    (a) If the debarring official decides to debar you, your period of 
debarment will be based on the seriousness of the cause(s) upon which 
your debarment is based. Generally, debarment should not exceed three 
years. However, if circumstances warrant, the debarring official may 
impose a longer period of debarment.
    (b) In determining the period of debarment, the debarring official 
may consider the factors in Sec. 105-68.860. If a suspension has 
preceded your debarment, the debarring official must consider the time 
you were suspended.
    (c) If the debarment is for a violation of the provisions of the 
Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, your period of debarment may not exceed 
five years.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.870  When do I know if the debarring official debars me?

closes upon the debarring official's receipt of final submissions, 
information and findings of fact, if any. The debarring official may 
extend that period for good cause.

Sec. 105-68.615 that the official decided, either--

    (i) Refers to the Notice of Proposed Debarment;
    (ii) Specifies the reasons for your debarment;

[[Page 512]]

    (iii) States the period of your debarment, including the effective 
dates; and
    (iv) Advises you that your debarment is effective for covered 
transactions and contracts that are subject to the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (48 CFR chapter 1), throughout the executive branch of the 
Federal Government unless an agency head or an authorized designee 
grants an exception.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.875  May I ask the debarring official to reconsider a

decision to debar me?

    Yes, as a debarred person you may ask the debarring official to 
reconsider the debarment decision or to reduce the time period or scope 
of the debarment. However, you must put your request in writing and 
support it with documentation.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.880  What factors may influence the debarring official

during reconsideration?

    The debarring official may reduce or terminate your debarment based 
on--
    (a) Newly discovered material evidence;
    (b) A reversal of the conviction or civil judgment upon which your 
debarment was based;
    (c) A bona fide change in ownership or management;
    (d) Elimination of other causes for which the debarment was imposed; 
or
    (e) Other reasons the debarring official finds appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.885  May the debarring official extend a debarment?

    (a) Yes, the debarring official may extend a debarment for an 
additional period, if that official determines that an extension is 
necessary to protect the public interest.
    (b) However, the debarring official may not extend a debarment 
solely on the basis of the facts and circumstances upon which the 
initial debarment action was based.
    (c) If the debarring official decides that a debarment for an 
additional period is necessary, the debarring official must follow the 
applicable procedures in this subpart, and subpart F of this part, to 
extend the debarment.

<R05>
Sec. 105-69.200  Agency and legislative liaison.

    (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in Sec. 105-
69.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable 
compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or 
receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if 
the payment is for agency and legislative liaison activities not 
directly related to a covered Federal action.
    (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, providing any 
information specifically requested by an agency or Congress is allowable 
at any time.
    (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following 
agency and legislative liaison activities are allowable at any time only 
where they are not related to a specific solicitation for any covered 
Federal action:
    (1) Discussing with an agency (including individual demonstrations) 
the qualities and characteristics of the person's products or services, 
conditions or terms of sale, and service capabilities; and,
    (2) Technical discussions and other activities regarding the 
application or adaptation of the person's products or services for an 
agency's use.
    (d) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following 
agencies and legislative liaison activities are allowable only where 
they are prior to formal solicitation of any covered Federal action:
    (1) Providing any information not specifically requested but 
necessary for an agency to make an informed decision about initiation of 
a covered Federal action;
    (2) Technical discussions regarding the preparation of an 
unsolicited proposal prior to its official submission; and,
    (3) Capability presentations by persons seeking awards from an 
agency pursuant to the provisions of the Small Business Act, as amended

    (e) Only those activities expressly authorized by this section are

<R05>
Sec. 105-69.205  Professional and technical services.

    (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in Sec. 105-
69.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable 
compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or 
receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or 
an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a 
Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is 
for professional or technical services rendered directly in the 
preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or 
application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative 
agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a 
condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or 
cooperative agreement.
    (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, ``professional 
and technical services'' shall be limited to advice and analysis 
directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, 
drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer 
is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the 
performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered 
directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, 
communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such 
as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed 
accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide 
advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical 
expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and 
solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered 
Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to 
influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis 
directly and

[[Page 520]]

solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but 
generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under 
this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal 
services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by 
an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation 
or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section 
since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in 
the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.
    (c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for 
receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or 
regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, 
and any other requirements in the actual award documents.
    (d) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are 
allowable under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 105-69.210  Reporting.

    No reporting is required with respect to payments of reasonable 
compensation made to regularly employed officers or employees of a

<R05>
Sec. 105-69.300  Professional and technical services.

    (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in Sec. 105-
69.100 (a), does not apply in the case of any reasonable payment to a 
person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or 
receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional 
or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, 
or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal 
contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting 
requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving 
that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.
    (b) The reporting requirements in Sec. 105-69.110 (a) and (b) 
regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall 
not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered 
directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any 
commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a 
loan.
    (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, ``professional 
and technical services'' shall be limited to advice and analysis 
directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, 
drafting or a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer 
is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the 
performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered 
directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, 
communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such 
as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed 
accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide 
advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical 
expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and 
solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered 
Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to 
influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis 
directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's 
proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not 
allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing 
professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent 
to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior 
to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable 
under this section since the engineer is providing technical services 
but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a 
covered Federal action.
    (d) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for 
receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or 
regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, 
and any other requirements in the actual award documents.

[[Page 521]]

    (e) Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting 
or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade 
associations.
    (f) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are 
allowable under this section.

<R05>
Sec. 105-69.400  Penalties.

    (a) Any person who makes an expenditure prohibited herein shall be 
subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than 
$100,000 for each such expenditure.
    (b) Any person who fails to file or amend the disclosure form (see 
appendix B) to be filed or amended if required herein, shall be subject 
to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 
for each such failure.
    (c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an 
administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced 
does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure 
occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with 
respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in 
writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.
    (d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount 
of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency 
shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the 
violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in 
business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability 
of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such 
other matters as may be appropriate.
    (e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section 
shall be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating 
circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be 
subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as 
determined by the agency head or his or her designee.
    (f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not 
prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply 
to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil 
penalty.


<R05>
Sec. 105-69.405  Penalty procedures.

    Agencies shall impose and collect civil penalties pursuant to the 
provisions of the Program Fraud and Civil Remedies Act, 31 U.S.C. 
sections 3803 (except subsection (c)), 3804, 3805, 3806, 3807, 3808, and 
3812, insofar as these provisions are not inconsistent with the 
requirements herein.


<R05>
Sec. 105-69.410  Enforcement.

    The head of each agency shall take such actions as are necessary to 
ensure that the provisions herein are vigorously implemented and 
enforced in that agency.

<R05>
Sec. 105-69.500  Secretary of Defense.

    (a) The Secretary of Defense may exempt, on a case-by-case basis, a

determines, in writing, that such an exemption is in the national 
interest. The Secretary shall transmit a copy of each such written 
exemption to Congress immediately after making such a determination.
    (b) The Department of Defense may issue supplemental regulations to 
implement paragraph (a) of this section.

submit to the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of 
Representatives a report containing a compilation of the information

    (b) The report, including the compilation, shall be available for 
public inspection 30 days after receipt of the report by the Secretary 
and the Clerk.

[[Page 522]]

    (c) Information that involves intelligence matters shall be reported 
only to the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate, the 
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of 
Representatives, and the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and 
the House of Representatives in accordance with procedures agreed to by 
such committees. Such information shall not be available for public 
inspection.
    (d) Information that is classified under Executive Order 12356 or 
any successor order shall be reported only to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the 
House of Representatives or the Committees on Armed Services of the 
Senate and the House of Representatives (whichever such committees have 
jurisdiction of matters involving such information) and to the 
Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of 
Representatives in accordance with procedures agreed to by such 
committees. Such information shall not be available for public 
inspection.
    (e) The first semi-annual compilation shall be submitted on May 31,

paragraph (b) of this section, of each agency shall prepare and submit 
to Congress each year, commencing with submission of the President's 
Budget in 1991, an evaluation of the compliance of that agency with, and 
the effectiveness of, the requirements herein. The evaluation may 
include any recommended changes that may be necessary to strengthen or 
improve the requirements.
    (b) In the case of an agency that does not have an Inspector 
General, the agency official comparable to an Inspector General shall 
prepare and submit the annual report, or, if there is no such comparable 
official, the head of the agency shall prepare and submit the annual 
report.
    (c) The annual report shall be submitted at the same time the agency 
submits its annual budget justifications to Congress.
    (d) The annual report shall include the following: All alleged 
violations relating to the agency's covered Federal actions during the 
year covered by the report, the actions taken by the head of the agency 
in the year covered by the report with respect to those alleged

    (d) Except as otherwise provided in this section, by failing to file 
a timely answer, the defendant waives any right to further review of the

and the initial decision shall become final and binding upon the parties 
30 days after it is issued.

[[Page 532]]

answer, the initial decision shall be stayed pending the ALJ's decision 
on the motion.
    (f) If, on such motion, the defendant can demonstrate extraordinary

opportunity to answer the complaint.

extraordinary circumstances excuse the defendant's failure to file a 
timely answer based solely on the record before the ALJ.

excused the defendant's failure to file a timely answer, the Authority 
Head shall remand the case to the ALJ with instructions to grant the 
defendant an opportunity to answer.
    (l) If the Authority Head decides that the defendant's failure to 
file a timely answer is not excused, the Authority Head shall reinstate

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, testimony 
at the hearing shall be given orally by witnesses under oath or 
affirmation.
    (b) At the discretion of the ALJ, testimony may be admitted in the 
form of a written statement or deposition. Any such written statement 
must be provided to all other parties along with the last known address 
of such witness, in a manner which allows sufficient time for other 
parties to subpoena such witness for cross-examination at the hearing. 
Prior written statements of witnesses proposed to testify at the hearing 
and deposition transcripts shall be exchanged as provided in Sec. 105-
70.022(a).
    (c) The ALJ shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and 
order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to--
    (1) Make the interrogation and presentation effective for the 
ascertainment of the truth,
    (2) Avoid needless consumption of time, and
    (3) Protect witnesses from harrassment or undue embarrassment.
    (d) The ALJ shall permit the parties to conduct such cross-
examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the 
facts.
    (e) To the extent permitted by the ALJ, cross-examination on matters 
outside the scope of direct examination shall be conducted in the manner 
of direct examination and may proceed by leading questions only if the 
witness is a hostile witness, an adverse party, or a witness identified 
with an adverse party.
    (f) Upon motion of any party, the ALJ shall order witnesses excluded 
so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses. This rule 
does not authorize exclusion of--
    (1) A party who is an individual;
    (2) In the case of a party that is not an individual, an officer or 
employee of the party appearing for the entity pro se or designated by 
the party's representative; or
    (3) An individual whose presence is shown by a party to be essential 
to the presentation of its case, including an individual employed by the

Rules of Evidence where appropriate, e.g., to exclude unreliable 
evidence.
    (c) The ALJ shall exclude irrelevant and immaterial evidence.
    (d) Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative 
value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, 
confusion of the issues, or by considerations of undue delay or needless 
presentation of cumulative evidence.
    (e) Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if it is privileged 
under Federal law.
    (f) Evidence concerning offers of compromise or settlement shall be 
inadmissible to the extent provided in Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of 
Evidence.
    (g) The ALJ shall permit the parties to introduce rebuttal witnesses 
and evidence.
    (h) All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record

admitted at the hearing, and all papers and requests filed in the 
proceeding constitute the record for the decision by the ALJ and the 
Authority Head.

delay and shall set a new deadline.
    (d) Unless the initial decision of the ALJ is timely appealed to the

the parties 30 days after it is issued, unless it is timely appealed to 
the Authority Head in accordance with Sec. 105-70.039.

to raise the objection.
    (i) If any party demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Authority 
Head that additional evidence not presented at such hearing is material

remand, or settle any penalty or assessment, determined by the ALJ in 
any initial decision.

Sec. 105-71.102  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    Accrued expenditures mean the charges incurred by the grantee during 
a given period requiring the provision of funds for: (1) Goods and other 
tangible property received; (2) services performed by employees, 
contractors, subgrantees, subcontractors, and other payees; and (3) 
other amounts becoming owed under programs for which no current services 
or performance is required, such as annuities, insurance claims, and 
other benefit payments.
    Accrued income means the sum of: (1) Earnings during a given period 
from services performed by the grantee and goods and other tangible 
property delivered to purchasers, and (2) amounts becoming owed to the 
grantee for which no current services or performance is required by the 
grantee.
    Acquisition cost of an item of purchased equipment means the net 
invoice unit price of the property including the cost of modifications, 
attachments, accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessary to make the 
property usable for the purpose for which it was acquired. Other charges 
such as the cost of installation, transportation, taxes, duty or 
protective in-transit insurance, shall be included or excluded from the 
unit acquisition cost in accordance with the grantee's regular 
accounting practices.
    Administrative requirements mean those matters common to grants in 
general, such as financial management,

[[Page 543]]

kinds and frequency of reports, and retention of records. These are 
distinguished from programmatic requirements, which concern matters that 
can be treated only on a program-by-program or grant-by-grant basis, 
such as kinds of activities that can be supported by grants under a 
particular program.
    Awarding agency means (1) with respect to a grant, the Federal 
agency, and (2) with respect to a subgrant, the party that awarded the 
subgrant.
    Cash contributions means the grantee's cash outlay, including the 
outlay of money contributed to the grantee or subgrantee by other public 
agencies and institutions, and private organizations and individuals. 
When authorized by Federal legislation, Federal funds received from 
other assistance agreements may be considered as grantee or subgrantee 
cash constributions.
    Contract means (except as used in the definitions for grant and 
subgrant in this section and except where qualified by Federal) a 
procurement contract under a grant or subgrant, and means a procurement 
subcontract under a contract.

contributions and the portion of the costs of a federally assisted 
project or program not borne by the Federal Government.
    Cost-type contract means a contract or subcontract under a grant in 
which the contractor or subcontractor is paid on the basis of the costs 
it incurs, with or without a fee.
    Equipment means tangible, nonexpendable, personal property having a 
useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or 
more per unit. A grantee may use its own definition of equipment 
provided that such definition would at least include all equipment 
defined above.
    Expenditure report means: (1) For non-construction grants, the SF-
269 ``Financial Status Report'' (or other equivalent report); (2) for 
construction grants, the SF-271 ``Outlay Report and Request for 
Reimbursement'' (or other equivalent report).
    Federally recognized Indian tribal government means the governing 
body or a governmental agency of any Indian tribe, band, nation, or 
other organized group or community (including any Native village as 
defined in section 3 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, 85 
Stat. 688) certified by the Secretary of the Interior as eligible for 
the special programs and services provided by him through the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs.
    Government means a State or local government or a federally 
recognized Indian tribal government.
    Grant means an award of financial assistance, including cooperative

does not include assistance, such as a fellowship or other lump sum 
award, which the grantee is not required to account for.
    Grantee means the government to which a grant is awarded and which 
is accountable for the use of the funds provided. The grantee is the 
entire legal entity even if only a particular component of the entity is 
designated in the grant award document.
    Local government means a county, municipality, city, town, township, 
local public authority (including any public and Indian housing agency 
under the United States Housing Act of 1937) school district, special 
district, intrastate district, council of governments (whether or not 
incorporated as a nonprofit corporation under State law), any other 
regional or interstate government entity, or any agency or 
instrumentality of a local government.
    Obligations means the amounts of orders placed, contracts and 
subgrants awarded, goods and services received, and similar transactions 
during a given period that will require payment by the grantee during 
the same or a future period.
    OMB means the United States Office of Management and Budget.
    Outlays (expenditures) mean charges made to the project or program. 
They may be reported on a cash or accrual basis. For reports prepared on 
a cash

[[Page 544]]

basis, outlays are the sum of actual cash disbursement for direct 
charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect expense incurred, 
the value of in-kind contributions applied, and the amount of cash 
advances and payments made to contractors and subgrantees. For reports 
prepared on an accrued expenditure basis, outlays are the sum of actual 
cash disbursements, the amount of indirect expense incurred, the value 
of in-kind contributions applied, and the new increase (or decrease) in 
the amounts owed by the grantee for goods and other property received, 
for services performed by employees, contractors, subgrantees, 
subcontractors, and other payees, and other amounts becoming owed under 
programs for which no current services or performance are required, such 
as annuities, insurance claims, and other benefit payments.
    Percentage of completion method refers to a system under which 
payments are made for construction work according to the percentage of 
completion of work, rather than to the grantee's cost incurred.
    Prior approval means documentation evidencing consent prior to 
incurring specific cost.
    Real property means land, including land improvements, structures 
and appurtenances thereto, excluding movable machinery and equipment.
    Share, when referring to the awarding agency's portion of real 
property, equipment or supplies, means the same percentage as the 
awarding agency's portion of the acquiring party's total costs under the 
grant to which the acquisition costs under the grant to which the 
acquisition cost of the property was charged. Only costs are to be 
counted--not the value of the third-party in-kind contributions.
    State means any of the several States of the United States, the 
District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or 
possession of the United States, or any agency or instrumentality of a 
State exclusive of local governments. The term does not include any 
public and Indian housing under United States Housing Act of 1937.
    Subgrant means an award of financial assistance in the form of 
money, or property in lieu of money, made under a grant by a grantee to 
an eligible subgrantee. The term includes financial assistance when 
provided by contractual legal agreement, but does not include 
procurement purchases, nor does it include any form of assistance which 
is excluded from the definition of grant in this part.
    Subgrantee means the government or other legal entity to which a 
subgrant is awarded and which is accountable to the grantee for the use 
of the funds provided.
    Supplies means all tangible personal property other than equipment 
as defined in this part.
    Suspension means depending on the context, either (1) temporary 
withdrawal of the authority to obligate grant funds pending corrective 
action by the grantee or subgrantee or a decision to terminate the 
grant, or (2) an action taken by a suspending official in accordance 
with agency regulations implementing E.O. 12549 to immediately exclude a 
person from participating in grant transactions for a period, pending 
completion of an investigation and such legal or debarment proceedings 
as may ensue.
    Termination means permanent withdrawal of the authority to obligate 
previously-awarded grant funds before that authority would otherwise 
expire. It also means the voluntary relinquishment of that authority by 
the grantee or subgrantee.
    Termination does not include: (1) Withdrawal of funds awarded on the 
basis of the grantee's underestimate of the unobligated balance in a 
prior period; (2) Withdrawal of the unobligated balance as of the 
expiration of a grant; (3) Refusal to extend a grant or award additional 
funds, to make a competing or noncompeting continuation, renewal, 
extension, or supplemental award; or (4) voiding of a grant upon 
determination that the award was obtained fraudulently, or was otherwise 
illegal or invalid from inception.
    Terms of a grant or subgrant mean all requirements of the grant or 
subgrant whether in statute, regulations, or the award document.
    Third party in-kind contributions mean property or services which 
benefit a federally assisted project or program

[[Page 545]]

and which are contributed by non-Federal third parties without charge to 
the grantee, or a cost-type contractor under the grant agreement.
    Unliquidated obligations for reports prepared on a cash basis mean 
the amount of obligations incurred by the grantee that has not been 
paid. For reports prepared on an accrued expenditure basis, they 
represent the amount of obligations incurred by the grantee for which an 
outlay has not been recorded.
    Unobligated balance means the portion of the funds authorized by the 
Federal agency that has not been obligated by the grantee and is 
determined by deducting the cumulative obligations from the cumulative 
funds authorized.

<R04>
                Subpart 105	71.11_Pre-Award Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.110  Forms for applying for grants.

    (a) Scope. (1) This section prescribes forms and instructions to be 
used by governmental organizations (except hospitals and institutions of 
higher education operated by a government) in applying for grants. This 
section is not applicable, however, to formula grant programs which do 
not require applicants to apply for funds on a project basis.
    (2) This section applies only to applications to Federal agencies 
for grants, and is not required to be applied by grantees in dealing 
with applicants for subgrants. However, grantees are encouraged to avoid 
more detailed or burdensome application requirements for subgrants.
    (b) Authorized forms and instructions for governmental 
organizations. (1) In applying for grants, applicants shall only use 
standard application forms or those prescribed by the granting agency 
with the approval of OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.
    (2) Applicants are not required to submit more than the original and 
two copies of preapplications or applications.
    (3) Applicants must follow all applicable instructions that bear OMB 
clearance numbers. Federal agencies may specify and describe the 
programs, functions, or activities that will be used to plan, budget, 
and evaluate the work under a grant. Other supplementary instructions 
may be issued only with the approval of OMB to the extent required under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. For any standard form, except the 
SF-424 facesheet, Federal agencies may shade out or instruct the 
applicant to disregard any line item that is not needed.
    (4) When a grantee applies for additional funding (such as a 
continuation or supplemental award) or amends a previously submitted 
application, only the affected pages need be submitted. Previously 
submitted pages with information that is still current need not be 
resubmitted.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.111  State plans.

    (a) Scope. The statutes for some programs require States to submit 
plans before receiving grants. Under regulations implementing Executive 
Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,'' States 
are allowed to simplify, consolidate and substitute plans. This section 
contains additional provisions for plans that are subject to regulations 
implementing the Executive order.
    (b) Requirements. A State need meet only Federal administrative or 
programmatic requirements for a plan that are in statutes or codified 
regulations.
    (c) Assurances. In each plan the State will include an assurance 
that the State shall comply with all applicable Federal statutes and 
regulations in effect with respect to the periods for

[[Page 547]]

which it receives grant funding. For this assurance and other assurances 
required in the plan, the State may:
    (1) Cite by number the statutory or regulatory provisions requiring 
the assurances and affirm that it gives the assurances required by those 
provisions,
    (2) Repeat the assurance language in the statutes or regulations, or
    (3) Develop its own language to the extent permitted by law.
    (d) Amendments. A State will amend a plan whenever necessary to 
reflect:
    (1) New or revised Federal statutes or regulations or
    (2) A material change in any State law, organization, policy, or 
State agency operation.

The State will obtain approval for the amendment and its effective date 
but need submit for approval only the amended portions of the plan.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.112  Special grant or subgrant conditions for 

``high-risk'' grantees.

    (a) A grantee or subgrantee may be considered ``high risk'' if an 
awarding agency determines that a grantee or subgrantee:
    (1) Has a history of unsatisfactory performance, or
    (2) Is not financially stable, or
    (3) Has a management system which does not meet the management 
standards set forth in this part, or
    (4) Has not conformed to terms and conditions of previous awards, or
    (5) Is otherwise not responsible, and if the awarding agency 
determines that an award will be made, special conditions and/or 
restrictions shall correspond to the high risk condition and shall be 
included in the award.
    (b) Special conditions or restrictions may include:
    (1) Payment on a reimbursement basis;
    (2) Withholding authority to proceed to the next phase until receipt 
of evidence of acceptable performance within a given funding period;
    (3) Requiring additional, more detailed financial reports;
    (4) Additional project monitoring;
    (5) Requiring the grantee or subgrantee to obtain technical or 
management assistance; or
    (6) Establishing additional prior approvals.
    (c) If an awarding agency decides to impose such conditions, the 
awarding official will notify the grantee or subgrantee as early as 
possible, in writing, of:
    (1) The nature of the special conditions/restrictions;
    (2) The reason(s) for imposing them;
    (3) The corrective actions which must be taken before they will be 
removed and the time allowed for completing the corrective actions and
    (4) The method of requesting reconsideration of the conditions/
restrictions imposed.


<R04>
   Subpart 105	71.12_Post-Award Requirements/Financial Administration


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.120  Standards for financial management systems.

    (a) A State must expand and account for grant funds in accordance 
with State laws and procedures for expending and accounting for its own 
funds. Fiscal control and accounting procedures of the State, as well as 
its subgrantees and cost-type contractors, must be sufficient to--
    (1) Permit preparation of reports required by this part and the 
statutes authorizing the grant, and
    (2) Permit the tracing of funds to a level of expenditures adequate 
to establish that such funds have not been used in violation of the 
restrictions and prohibitions of applicable statutes.
    (b) The financial management systems of other grantees and 
subgrantees must meet the following standards:
    (1) Financial reporting. Accurate, current, and complete disclosure 
of the financial result of financially assisted activities must be made 
in accordance with the financial reporting requirements of the grant or 
subgrant.
    (2) Accounting records. Grantees and subgrantees must maintain 
records which adequately identify the source and application of funds 
provided for financially-assisted activities. These records must contain 
information pertaining to grant or subgrant awards and authorizations, 
obligations, unobligated balances, assets, liabilities, outlays or 
expenditures, and income.

[[Page 548]]

    (3) Internal control. Effective control and accountability must be 
maintained for all grant and subgrant cash, real and personal property, 
and other assets. Grantees and subgrantees must adequately safeguard all 
such property and must assure that it is used solely for authorized 
purposes.
    (4) Budget control. Actual expenditures or outlays must be compared 
with budgeted amounts for each grant or subgrant. Financial information 
must be related to performance or productivity data, including the 
development of unit cost information whenever appropriate or 
specifically required in the grant or subgrant agreement. If unit cost 
data are required, estimates based on available documentation will be 
accepted whenever possible.
    (5) Allowable cost. Applicable OMB cost principles, agency program 
regulations, and the terms of grant and subgrant agreements will be 
followed in determining the reasonableness, allowability and 
allocability of costs.
    (6) Source documentation. Accounting records must be supported by 
such source documentation as cancelled checks, paid bills, payrolls, 
time and attendance records, contract and subgrant award documents, etc.
    (7) Cash management. Procedures for minimizing the time elapsing 
between the transfer of funds from the U.S. Treasury and disbursement by 
grantees and subgrantees must be followed whenever advance payment 
procedures are used. Grantees must establish reasonable procedures to 
ensure the receipt of reports on subgrantees' cash balances and cash 
disbursements in sufficient time to enable them to prepare complete and 
accurate cash transactions reports to the awarding agency. When advances 
are made by letter-of-credit or electronic transfer of funds methods, 
the grantee must make drawdowns as close as possible to the time of 
making disbursements. Grantees must monitor cash drawdowns by their 
subgrantees to assure that they conform substantially to the same 
standards of timing and amount as apply to advances to the grantees.
    (c) An awarding agency may review the adequacy of the financial 
management system of any applicant for financial assistance as part of a 
preaward review or at any time subsequent to award.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.121  Payment.

    (a) Scope. This section prescribes the basic standard and the 
methods under which a Federal agency will make payments to grantees, and 
grantees will make payments to subgrantees and contractors.
    (b) Basic standard. Methods and procedures for payment shall 
minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and 
disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee, in accordance with Treasury 
regulations at 31 CFR part 205.
    (c) Advances. Grantees and subgrantees shall be paid in advance, 
provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness and ability to 
maintain procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer 
of the funds and their disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee.
    (d) Reimbursement. Reimbursement shall be the preferred method when 
the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section are not met. Grantees 
and subgrantees may also be paid by reimbursement for any construction 
grant. Except as otherwise specified in regulation, Federal agencies 
shall not use the percentage of completion method to pay construction 
grants. The grantee or subgrantee may use that method to pay its 
construction contractor, and if it does, awarding agency's payments to 
the grantee or subgrantee will be based on the grantee's or subgrantee's 
actual rate of disbursement.
    (e) Working capital advances. If a grantee cannot meet the criteria 
for advance payments described in paragraph (c) of this section, and the 
Federal agency has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because 
the grantee lacks sufficient working capital the awarding agency may 
provide cash or a working capital, advance basis. Under this procedure 
the awarding agency shall advance cash to the grantee to cover its 
estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to 
the grantee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the awarding agency shall 
reimburse the grantee for its actual cash disbursements. The

[[Page 549]]

working capital advance method of payment shall not be used by grantees 
or subgrantees if the reason for using such method is the unwillingness 
or inability of the grantee to provide timely advances to the subgrantee 
to meet the subgrantee's actual cash disbursements.
    (f) Effect of program income, refunds and audit recoveries on 
payment. (1) Grantees and subgrantees shall disburse repayments to and 
interest earned on a revolving fund before requesting additional cash 
payments for the same activity.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, grantees 
and subgrantees shall disburse program income, rebates, refunds, 
contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned on such funds 
before requesting additional cash payments.
    (g) Withholding payments. (1) Unless otherwise required by Federal 
statute, awarding agencies shall not withhold payments for proper 
charges incurred by grantees or subgrantees unless--
    (i) The grantee or subgrantee has failed to comply with grant award 
conditions or
    (ii) The grantee or subgrantee is indebted to the United States.
    (2) Cash withheld for failure to comply with grant award conditions, 
but without suspension of the grant, shall be released to the grantee 
upon subsequent compliance. When a grant is suspended, payment 
adjustments will be made in accordance with Sec. 105-71.143(c).
    (3) A Federal agency shall not make payment to grantees for amounts 
that are withheld by grantees or subgrantees from payment to contractors 
to assure satisfactory completion of work. Payments shall be made by the 
Federal agency when the grantees or subgrantees actually disburse the 
withheld funds to the contractors or to escrow accounts established to 
assure satisfactory completion of work.
    (h) Cash depositories. (1) Consistent with the national goal of 
expanding the opportunities for minority business enterprises, grantees 
and subgrantees are encouraged to use minority banks (a bank which is 
owned at least 50 percent by minority group members). A list of minority 
owned banks can be obtained from the Minority Business Development 
Agency, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230.
    (2) A grantee or subgrantee shall maintain a separate bank account 
only when required by Federal-State agreement.
    (i) Interest earned on advances. Except for interest earned on 
advances of funds exempt under the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (31 
U.S.C. 6501 et seq.) and the Indian Self-Determination Act (23 U.S.C. 
450), grantees and subgrantees shall promptly, but at least quarterly, 
remit interest earned on advances to the Federal agency. The grantee or 
subgrantee may keep interest amounts up to $100 per year for 
administrative expenses.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.122  Allowable costs.

    (a) Limitation on use of funds. Grant funds may be used only for:
    (1) The allowable costs of the grantees, subgrantees and cost-type 
contractors, including allowable costs in the form of payments to fixed-
price contractors; and
    (2) Reasonable fees or profit to cost-type contractors but not any 
fee or profit (or other increment above allowable costs) to the grantee 
or subgrantee.
    (b) Applicable cost principles. For each kind of organization, there 
is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. 
Allowable costs will be determined in accordance with the cost 
principles applicable to the organization incurring the costs. The 
following chart lists the kinds of organizations and the applicable cost 
principles:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
           For the costs of a--                Use the principles in--

 circular.                                   accounting standards that
                                             comply with cost principles
                                             acceptable to the Federal
                                             agency.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


[[Page 550]]


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.123  Period of availability of funds.

    (a) General. Where a funding period is specified, a grantee may 
charge to the award only costs resulting from obligations of the funding 
period unless carryover or unobligated balances are permitted, in which 
case the carryover balances may be charged for costs resulting from 
obligations of the subsequent funding period.
    (b) Liquidation of obligations. A grantee must liquidate all 
obligations incurred under the award not later than 90 days after the 
end of the funding period (or as specified in a program regulation) to 
coincide with the submission of the annual Financial Status Report (SF-
269). The Federal agency may extend this deadline at the request of the 
grantee.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.124  Matching or cost sharing.

    (a) Basic rule: Costs and contributions acceptable. With the 
qualifications and exceptions listed in paragraph (b) of this section, a 
matching or cost sharing requirement may be satisfied by either or both 
of the following:
    (1) Allowable costs incurred by the grantee, subgrantee or cost-type 
contractor under the assistance agreement. This includes allowable costs 
borne by non-Federal grants or by other cash donations from non-Federal 
third parties.
    (2) The value of third party in-kind contributions applicable to the 
period to which the cost sharing or matching requirements apply.
    (b) Qualifications and exceptions--(1) Costs borne by other Federal 
grant agreements. Except as provided by Federal statute, a cost sharing 
or matching requirement may not be met by costs borne by another Federal 
grant. This prohibition does not apply to income earned by a grantee or 
subgrantee from a contract awarded under another Federal grant.
    (2) General revenue sharing. For the purpose of this section, 
general revenue sharing funds distributed under 31 U.S.C. 6702 are not 
considered Federal grant funds.
    (3) Cost or contributions counted towards other Federal costs-
sharing requirements. Neither costs nor the values of third party in-
kind contributions may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or 
matching requirement of a grant agreement if they have been or will be 
counted towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement of 
another Federal grant agreement, a Federal procurement contract or any 
other award of Federal funds.
    (4) Costs financed by program income. Costs financed by program 
income, as defined in Sec. 105-71.125, shall not count towards 
satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement unless they are 
expressly permitted in the terms of the assistance agreement. (This use 
of general program income is described in Sec. 105-71.125(g).)
    (5) Services or property financed by income earned by contractors. 
Contractors under a grant may earn income from the activities carried 
out under the contract in addition to the amounts earned from the party 
awarding the contract. No costs of services or property supported by 
this income may count toward satisfying a cost sharing or matching 
requirement unless other provisions of the grant agreement expressly 
permit this kind of income to be used to meet the requirement.
    (6) Records. Costs and third party in-kind contributions counting 
towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement must be 
verifiable from the records of grantees and subgrantee or cost-type 
contractors. These records must show how the value placed on third party 
in-kind contributions was derived. To the extent feasible, volunteer 
services will be supported by the same methods that the organization 
uses to support the allocability of regular personnel costs.
    (7) Special standards for third party in-kind contributions. (i) 
Third party in-kind contributions count towards satisfying a cost 
sharing or matching requirement only where, if the party receiving the 
contributions were to pay for them, the payments would be allowable 
costs.
    (ii) Some third party in-kind contributions are goods and services 
that, if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor receiving the 
contribution had to pay for them, the payments would have been an 
indirect cost. Costs sharing or matching credit for such contributions 
shall be given only if the

[[Page 551]]

grantee, subgrantee, or contractor has established, along with its 
regular indirect cost rate, a special rate for allocating to individual 
projects or programs the value of contributions.
    (iii) A third party in-kind contribution to a fixed price contract 
may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement only 
if it results in:
    (A) An increase in the services or property provided under the 
contract (without additional cost to the grantee or subgrantee) or
    (B) A cost savings to the grantee or subgrantee.
    (iv) The values placed on third party in-kind contributions for cost 
sharing or matching purposes will conform to the rules in the succeeding 
sections of this part. If a third party in-kind contribution is a type 
not treated in those sections, the value placed upon it shall be fair 
and reasonable.
    (c) Valuation of donated services--(1) Volunteer services. Unpaid 
services provided to a grantee or subgrantee by individuals will be 
valued at rates consistent with those ordinarily paid for similar work 
in the grantee's or subgrantee's organization. If the grantee or 
subgrantee does not have employees performing similar work, the rates 
will be consistent with those ordinarily paid by other employers for 
similar work in the same labor market. In either case, a reasonable 
amount for fringe benefits may be included in the valuation.
    (2) Employees of other organizations. When an employer other than a 
grantee, subgrantee, or cost-type contractor furnishes free of charge 
the services of an employee in the employee's normal line of work, the 
services will be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay exclusive 
of the employee's fringe benefits and overhead costs. If the services 
are in a different line of work, paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
applies.
    (d) Valuation of third party donated supplies and loaned equipment 
or space. (1) If a third party donates supplies, the contribution will 
be valued at the market value of the supplies at the time of donation.
    (2) If a third party donates the use of equipment or space in a 
building but retains title, the contribution will be valued at the fair 
rental rate of the equipment or space.
    (e) Valuation of third party donated equipment, buildings, and land. 
If a third party donates equipment, buildings, or land, and the title 
passes to a grantee or subgrantee, the treatment of the donated property 
will depend upon the purpose of the grant or subgrant as follows:
    (1) Awards for capital expenditures. If the purpose of the grant or 
subgrant is to assist the grantee or subgrantee in the acquisition of 
property, the market value of that property at the time of donation may 
be counted as cost sharing or matching.
    (2) Other awards. If assisting in the acquisition of property is not 
the purpose of the grant or subgrant, paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (ii) of 
this section apply.
    (i) If approval is obtained from the awarding agency, the market 
value at the time of donation of the donated equipment or buildings and 
the fair rental rate of the donated land may be counted as cost sharing 
or matching. In the case of a subgrant, the terms of the grant agreement 
may require that the approval be obtained from the Federal agency as 
well as the grantee. In all cases, the approval may be given only if a 
purchase of the equipment or rental of the land would be approved as an 
allowable direct cost. If any part of the donated property was acquired 
with Federal funds, only the non-Federal share of the property may be 
counted as cost sharing or matching.
    (ii) If approval is not obtained under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this 
section, no amount may be counted for donated land, and only 
depreciation or use allowances may be counted for donated equipment and 
buildings. The depreciation or use allowances for this property are not 
treated as third party in-kind contributions. Instead, they are treated 
as costs incurred by the grantee or subgrantee. They are computed and 
allocated (usually as indirect costs) in accordance with the cost 
principles specified in Sec. 105-71.122, in the same way as 
depreciation or use allowances for purchased equipment and buildings. 
The amount of depreciation or use allowances for donated equipment and 
buildings is based on the property's

[[Page 552]]

market value at the time it was donated.
    (f) Valuation of grantee or subgrantee donated real property for 
construction/acquisition. If a grantee or subgrantee donates real 
property for a construction or facilities acquisition project, the 
current market value of that property may be counted as cost sharing or 
matching. If any part of the donated property was acquired with Federal 
funds, only the non-Federal share of the property may be counted as cost 
sharing or matching.
    (g) Appraisal of real property. In some cases under paragraphs (d), 
(e) and (f) of this section, it will be necessary to establish the 
market value of land or a building or the fair rental rate of land or of 
space in the building. In these cases, the Federal agency may require 
the market value or fair rental value be set by an independent 
appraiser, and that the value or rate be certified by the grantee. This 
requirement will also be imposed by the grantee on subgrantees.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.125  Program income.

    (a) General. Grantees are encouraged to earn income to defray 
program costs. Program income includes income from fees for services 
performed, from the use or rental of real or personal property acquired 
with grant funds, from the sale of commodities or items fabricated under 
a grant agreement, and from payments of principal and interest on loans 
made with grant funds. Except as otherwise provided in regulations of 
the Federal agency, program income does not include interest on grant 
funds, rebates, credits, discounts, refunds, etc. and interest earned on 
any of them.
    (b) Definition of program income. Program income means gross income 
received by the grantee or subgrantee directly generated by a grant 
supported activity, or earned only as a result of the grant agreement 
during the grant period. ``During the grant period'' is the time between 
the effective date of the award and the ending date of the award 
reflected in the final financial report.
    (c) Cost of generating program income. If authorized by Federal 
regulations or the grant agreement, costs incident to the generation of 
program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program 
income.
    (d) Government revenues. Taxes, special assessments, levies, fines, 
and other such revenues raised by a grantee or subgrantee are not 
program income unless the revenues are specifically identified in the 
grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as program income.
    (e) Royalties. Income from royalties and license fees for 
copyrighted material, patents, and inventions developed by a grantee or 
subgrantee is program income only if the revenues are specifically 
identified in the grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as 
program income. (See Sec. 105-71.134.)
    (f) Property. Proceeds from the sale of real property or equipment 
will be handled in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 105-71.131 
and Sec. 105-71.132.
    (g) Use of program income. Program income shall be deducted from 
outlays which may be both Federal and non-Federal as described below, 
unless the Federal agency regulations or the grant agreement specify 
another alternative (or a combination of the alternatives). In 
specifying alternatives, the Federal agency may distinguish between 
income earned by the grantee and income earned by subgrantees and 
between the sources, kinds, or amounts of income. When Federal agencies 
authorize the alternatives in paragraphs (g) (2) and (3) of this 
section, program income in excess of any limits stipulated shall also be 
deducted from outlays.
    (1) Deduction. Ordinarily program income shall be deducted from 
total allowable costs to determine the net allowable costs. Program 
income shall be used for current costs unless the Federal agency 
authorizes otherwise. Program income which the grantee did not 
anticipate at the time of the award shall be used to reduce the Federal 
agency and grantee contributions rather than to increase the funds 
committed to the project.
    (2) Addition. When authorized, program income may be added to the 
funds committed to the grant agreement by the Federal agency and the 
grantee. The program income shall be

[[Page 553]]

used for the purposes and under the conditions of the grant agreement.
    (3) Cost sharing or matching. When authorized, program income may be 
used to meet the cost sharing or matching requirement of the grant 
agreement. The amount of the Federal grant award remains the same.
    (h) Income after the award period. There are no Federal requirements 
governing the disposition of program income earned after the end of the 
award period (i.e., until the ending date of the final financial report, 
see paragraph (a) of this section), unless the terms of the agreement or 
the Federal agency regulations provide otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.126  Non-Federal audit.

    (a) Basic rule. Grantees and subgrantees are responsible for 
obtaining audits in accordance with the Single Audit Act Amendments of 
1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507) and revised OMB Circular A-133, ``Audits of 
States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.'' The audits 
shall be made by an independent auditor in accordance with generally 
accepted government auditing standards covering financial audits.
    (b) Subgrantees. State or local governments, as those terms are 
defined for purposes of the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, that 
provide Federal awards to a subgrantee, which expends $300,000 or more 
(or other amount as specified by OMB) in Federal awards in a fiscal 
year, shall:
    (1) Determine whether State or local subgrantees have met the audit 
requirements of the Act and whether subgrantees covered by OMB Circular 
A-110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements 
with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit 
Organizations,'' have met the audit requirements of the Act. Commercial 
contractors (private for-profit and private and governmental 
organizations) providing goods and services to State and local 
governments are not required to have a single audit performed. State and 
local governments should use their own procedures to ensure that the 
contractor has complied with laws and regulations affecting the 
expenditure of Federal funds;
    (2) Determine whether the subgrantee spent Federal assistance funds 
provided in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. This may be 
accomplished by reviewing an audit of the subgrantee made in accordance 
with the Act, Circular A-110, or through other means (e.g., program 
reviews) if the subgrantee has not had such an audit;
    (3) Ensure the appropriate corrective action is taken within six 
months after receipt of the audit report in instance of noncompliance 
with Federal laws and regulations;
    (4) Consider whether subgrantee audits necessitate adjustment of the 
grantee's own records; and
    (5) Require each subgrantee to permit independent auditors to have 
access to the records and financial statements.
    (c) Auditor selection. In arranging for audit services, Sec. 105-
71.136 shall be followed.

    Subpart 105	71.13_Post-Award Requirements/Changes, Property, and 
                                Subawards


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.130  Changes.

    (a) General. Grantees and subgrantees are permitted to rebudget 
within the approved direct cost budget to meet unanticipated 
requirements and may make limited program changes to the approved 
project. However, unless waived by the awarding agency, certain types of 
post-award changes in budgets and projects shall require the prior 
written approval of the awarding agency.
    (b) Relation to cost principles. The applicable cost principles (see 
Sec. 105-71.122) contain requirements for prior approval of certain 
types of costs. Except where waived, those requirements apply to all 
grants and subgrants even if paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section 
do not.
    (c) Budget changes--(1) Non-construction projects. Except as stated 
in other regulations or an award document, grantees or subgrantees shall 
obtain the prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the 
following

[[Page 554]]

changes is anticipated under a non-construction award:
    (i) Any revision which would result in the need for additional 
funding.
    (ii) Unless waived by the awarding agency, cumulative transfers 
among direct cost categories, or, if applicable, among separately 
budgeted programs, projects, functions, or activities which exceed or 
are expected to exceed ten percent of the current total approved budget, 
whenever the awarding agency's share exceeds $100,000.
    (iii) Transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (i.e., from 
direct payments to trainees to other expense categories).
    (2) Construction projects. Grantees and subgrantees shall obtain 
prior written approval for any budget revision which would result in the 
need for additional funds.
    (3) Combined construction and non-construction projects. When a 
grant or subgrant provides funding for both construction and non-
construction activities, the grantee or subgrantee must obtain prior 
written approval from the awarding agency before making any fund or 
budget transfer from non-construction to construction or vice versa.
    (d) Programmatic changes. Grantees or subgrantees must obtain the 
prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the following 
actions is anticipated:
    (1) Any revision of the scope or objectives of the project 
(regardless of whether there is an associated budget revision requiring 
prior approval).
    (2) Need to extend the period of availability of funds.
    (3) Changes in key persons in cases where specified in an 
application or a grant award. In research projects, a change in the 
project director or principal investigator shall always require approval 
unless waived by the awarding agency.
    (4) Under non-construction projects, contracting out, subgranting 
(if authorized by law) or otherwise obtaining the services of a third 
party to perform activities which are central to the purposes of the 
award. This approval requirement is in addition to the approval 
requirements of Sec. 105-71.136 but does not apply to the procurement 
of equipment, supplies, and general support services.
    (e) Additional prior approval requirements. The awarding agency may 
not require prior approval for any budget revision which is not 
described in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (f) Requesting prior approval. (1) A request for prior approval of 
any budget revision will be in the same budget format the grantee used 
in its application and shall be accomplished by a narrative 
justification for the proposed revision.
    (2) A request for a prior approval under the applicable Federal cost 
principles (see Sec. 105-71.122) may be made by letter.
    (3) A request by a subgrantee for prior approval will be addressed 
in writing to the grantee. The grantee will promptly review such request 
and shall approve or disapprove the request in writing. A grantee will 
not approve any budget or project revision which is inconsistent with 
the purpose or terms and conditions of the Federal grant to the grantee. 
If the revision, requested by the subgrantee would result in a change to 
the grantee's approved project which requires Federal prior approval, 
the grantee will obtain the Federal agency's approval before approving 
the subgrantee's request.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.131  Real property.

    (a) Title. Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in 
this section, title to real property acquired under a grant or subgrant 
will vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) Use. Except as otherwise provided by Federal statutes, real 
property will be used for the originally authorized purposes as long as 
needed for that purpose, and the grantee or subgrantee shall not dispose 
of or encumber its title or other interests.
    (c) Disposition. When real property is no longer needed for the 
originally authorized purpose, the grantee or subgrantee will request 
disposition instructions from the awarding agency. The instructions will 
provide for one of the following alternatives.
    (1) Retention of title. Retain title after compensating the awarding 
agency.

[[Page 555]]

The amount paid to the awarding agency will be computed by applying the 
awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost of the 
original purchase to the fair market value of the property. However, in 
those situations where a grantee or subgrantee is disposing of real 
property acquired with grant funds and acquiring replacement real 
property under the same program, the net proceeds from the disposition 
may be used as an offset to the cost of the replacement property.
    (2) Sale of property. Sell the property and compensate the awarding 
agency. The amount due to the awarding agency will be calculated by 
applying the awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost 
of the original purchase to the proceeds of the sale after deduction of 
any actual and reasonable selling and fixing-up expenses. If the grant 
is still active, the net proceeds from the sale may be offset against 
the original cost of the property. When a grantee or subgrantee is 
directed to sell property, sales procedures shall be followed that 
provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the 
highest possible return.
    (3) Transfer of title. Transfer title to the awarding agency or to a 
third-party designated/approved by the awarding agency. The grantee or 
subgrantee shall be paid an amount calculated by applying the grantee or 
subgrantee's percentage of participation in the purchase of the real 
property to the current fair market value of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.132  Equipment.

    (a) Title. Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in 
this section, title to equipment acquired under a grant or subgrant will 
vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) States. A State will use, manage, and dispose of equipment 
acquired under a grant by the State in accordance with State laws and 
procedures. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow paragraphs (c) 
through (e) of this section.
    (c) Use. (1) Equipment shall be used by the grantee or subgrantee in 
the program or project for which it was acquired as long as needed, 
whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by 
Federal funds. When no longer needed for the original program or 
project, the equipment may be used in other activities currently or 
previously supported by a Federal agency.
    (2) The grantee or subgrantee shall also make equipment available 
for use on other projects or programs currently or previously supported 
by the Federal Government, providing such use will not interfere with 
the work on the projects or program for which it was originally 
acquired. First preference for other use shall be given to other 
programs or projects supported by the awarding agency. User fees should 
be considered if appropriate.
    (3) Notwithstanding the encouragement in Sec. 105-71.125(a) to earn 
program income, the grantee or subgrantee must not use equipment 
acquired with grant funds to provide services for a fee to compete 
unfairly with private companies that provide equivalent services, unless 
specifically permitted or contemplated by Federal statute.
    (4) When acquiring replacement equipment, the grantee or subgrantee 
may use the equipment to be replaced as a trade-in or sell the property 
and use the proceeds to offset the cost of the replacement property, 
subject to the approval of the awarding agency.
    (d) Management requirements. Procedures for managing equipment 
(including replacement equipment), whether acquired in whole or in part 
with grant funds, until disposition takes place will, as a minimum, meet 
the following requirements:
    (1) Property records must be maintained that include a description 
of the property, a serial number or other identification number, the 
source of property, who holds the title, the acquisition date, and cost 
of the property, percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the 
property, the location, use and condition of the property, and any 
ultimate disposition data including the data of disposal and sale price 
of the property.
    (2) A physical inventory of the property must be taken and the 
results reconciled with the property records at least once every two 
years.

[[Page 556]]

    (3) A control system must be developed to ensure adequate safeguards 
to prevent loss, damage or theft of the property. Any loss, damage or 
theft shall be investigated.
    (4) Adequate maintenance procedures must be developed to keep the 
property in good condition.
    (5) If the grantee or subgrantee is authorized or required to sell 
the property, proper sales procedures must be established to ensure the 
highest possible return.
    (e) Disposition. When original or replacement equipment acquired 
under a grant or subgrant is no longer needed for the original project 
or program or for other activities currently or previously supported by 
a Federal agency, disposition of the equipment will be made as follows:
    (1) Items of equipment with a current per-unit fair market value of 
less than $5,000 may be retained, sold or otherwise disposed of with no 
further obligation to the awarding agency.
    (2) Items of equipment with a current per unit fair market value in 
excess of $5,000 may be retained or sold and the awarding agency shall 
have a right to an amount calculated by multiplying the current market 
value or proceeds from sale by the awarding agency's share of the 
equipment.
    (3) In cases where a grantee or subgrantee fails to take appropriate 
disposition actions, the awarding agency may direct the grantee or 
subgrantee to take excess and disposition actions.
    (f) Federal equipment. In the event grantee or subgrantee is 
provided federally-owned equipment:
    (1) Title will remain vested in the Federal Government.
    (2) Grantees or subgrantees will manage the equipment in accordance 
with Federal agency rules and procedures, and submit an annual inventory 
listing.
    (3) When the equipment is no longer needed, the grantee or 
subgrantee will request disposition instructions from the Federal 
agency.
    (g) Right to transfer title. The Federal awarding agency may reserve 
the right to transfer title to the Federal Government or a third party 
named by the awarding agency when such a third party is otherwise 
eligible under existing statutes. Such transfers shall be subject to the 
following standards:
    (1) The property shall be identified in the grant or otherwise made 
known to the grantee in writing.
    (2) The Federal awarding agency shall issue disposition instruction 
within 120 calendar days after the end of the Federal support of the 
project for which it was acquired. If the Federal awarding agency fails 
to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar-day period the 
grantee shall follow Sec. 105-71.132(e).
    (3) When title to equipment is transferred, the grantee shall be 
paid an amount calculated by applying the percentage of participation in 
the purchase to the current fair market value of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.133  Supplies.

    (a) Title. Title to supplies acquired under a grant or subgrant will 
vest, upon acquisition, in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) Disposition. If there is a residual inventory of unused supplies 
exceeding $5,000 in total aggregate fair market value upon termination 
or completion of the award, and if the supplies are not needed for any 
other federally sponsored programs or projects, the grantee or 
subgrantee shall compensate the awarding agency for its share.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.134  Copyrights.

    The Federal awarding agency reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive, 
and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish or otherwise use, and to 
authorize others to use, for Federal Government purposes:
    (a) The copyright in any work developed under a grant, subgrant, or 
contract under a grant or subgrant; and
    (b) Any rights of copyright to which a grantee, subgrantee or a 
contractor purchases ownership with grant support.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.135  Subawards to debarred and suspended parties.

    Grantees and subgrantees must not make any award or permit any award 
(subgrant or contract) at any tier to any party which is debarred or 
suspended or is otherwise excluded from or

[[Page 557]]

ineligible for participation in Federal assistance programs under 
Executive Order 12549, ``Debarment and Suspension''.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.136  Procurement.

    (a) States. When procuring property and services under a grant, a 
State will allow the same policies and procedures it uses for 
procurements from its non-Federal funds. The State will ensure that 
every purchase order or other contract includes any clauses required by 
Federal statutes and executive orders and their implementing 
regulations. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow paragraphs (b) 
through (i) in this section.
    (b) Procurement standards. (1) Grantees and subgrantees will use 
their own procurement procedures which reflect applicable State and 
local laws and regulations, provided that the procurements conform to 
applicable Federal law and the standards identified in this section.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a contract administration 
system which ensures that contractors perform in accordance with the 
terms, conditions and specifications of their contracts or purchase 
orders.
    (3) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a written code of 
standards of conduct governing the performance of their employees 
engaged in the award and administration of contracts. No employee, 
officer or agent of the grantee or subgrantee shall participate in 
selection, or in the award or administration of a contract supported by 
Federal funds if a conflict of interest, real or apparent, would be 
involved. Such a conflict would arise when:
    (i) The employee, officer or agent,
    (ii) Any member of his immediate family,
    (iii) His or her partner, or
    (iv) An organization which employs, or is about to employ, any of 
the above, has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for 
award. The grantee's or subgrantee's officers, employees or agent will 
neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors or anything of monetary 
value from contractors, potential contractors, or parties to 
subagreements. Grantees and subgrantees may set minimum rules where the 
financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item 
of nominal intrinsic value. To the extent permitted by State or local 
law or regulations, such standards of conduct will provide for 
penalties, sanctions, or other disciplinary actions for violations of 
such standards by the grantee's officers, employees, or agents, or by 
contractors or their agents. The awarding agency may in regulation 
provide additional prohibitions relative to real, apparent, or potential 
conflicts of interest.
    (4) Grantee and subgrantee procedures will provide for a review of 
proposed procurements to avoid purchase of unnecessary or duplicative 
items. Consideration should be given to consolidating or breaking out 
procurements to obtain a more economical purchase. Where appropriate, an 
analysis will be made of lease versus purchase alternatives, and any 
other appropriate analysis to determine the most economical approach.
    (5) To foster greater economy and efficiency, grantees and 
subgrantees are encouraged to enter into State and local 
intergovernmental agreements for procurement or use of common goods and 
services.
    (6) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use Federal excess 
and surplus property in lieu of purchasing new equipment and property 
whenever such use is feasible and reduces project costs.
    (7) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use value engineering 
clauses in contracts for construction projects of sufficient size to 
offer reasonable opportunities for cost reductions. Value engineering is 
a systematic and creative analysis of each contract item or task to 
ensure that its essential function is provided at the overall lower 
cost.
    (8) Grantees and subgrantees will make awards only to responsible 
contractors possessing the ability to perform successfully under the 
terms and conditions of a proposed procurement. Consideration will be 
given to such matters as contractor integrity, compliance with public 
policy, record of past performance, and financial and technical 
resources.

[[Page 558]]

    (9) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain records sufficient to 
detail the significant history of a procurement. These records will 
include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: Rationale for 
the method of procurement, selection of contract type, contractor 
selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price.
    (10) Grantees and subgrantees will use time and material type 
contracts only--
    (i) After a determination that no other contract is suitable, and
    (ii) If the contract includes a ceiling price that the contractor 
exceeds at its own risk.
    (11) Grantees and subgrantees alone will be responsible, in 
accordance with good administrative practice and sound business 
judgment, for the settlement of all contractual and administrative 
issues arising out of procurements. These issues include, but are not 
limited to source evaluation, protests, disputes and claims. These 
standards do not relieve the grantee or subgrantee of any contractual 
responsibilities under its contracts. Federal agencies will not 
substitute their judgment for that of the grantee or subgrantee unless 
the matter is primarily a Federal concern. Violations of law will be 
referred to the local, State or Federal authority having proper 
jurisdiction.
    (12) Grantees and subgrantees will have protest procedures to handle 
and resolve disputes relating to their procurements and shall in all 
instances disclose information regarding the protests to the awarding 
agency. A protestor must exhaust all administrative remedies with the 
grantee and subgrantee before pursuing a protest with the Federal 
agency. Reviews of protests by the Federal agency will be limited to:
    (i) Violations of Federal law or regulations and the standards of 
this section (violations of State or local law will be under the 
jurisdiction of State or local authorities) and
    (ii) Violations of grantee's or subgrantee's protest procedures for 
failure to review a complaint or protest. Protests received by the 
Federal agency other than those specified above will be referred to the 
grantee or subgrantee.
    (c) Competition. (1) All procurement transactions will be conducted 
in a manner providing full and open competition consistent with the 
standards of Sec. 105-71.136. Some of the situations considered to be 
restrictive of competition include but are not limited to:
    (i) Placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to 
qualify to do business,
    (ii) Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive bonding,
    (iii) Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between 
affiliated companies,
    (iv) Noncompetitive awards to consultants that are on retainer 
contracts,
    (v) Organizational conflicts of interest,
    (vi) Specifying only a ``brand name'' product instead of allowing 
``an equal'' product to be offered and describing the performance of 
other relevant requirements of the procurement, and
    (vii) Any arbitrary action in the procurement process.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will conduct procurements in a manner 
that prohibits the use of statutorily or administratively imposed in-
State or local geographical preferences in the evaluation of bids or 
proposals, except in those cases where applicable Federal statutes 
expressly mandate or encourage geographic preference. Nothing in this 
section preempts State licensing laws. When contracting for 
architectural and engineering (A/E) services, geographic location may be 
a selection criteria provided its application leaves an appropriate 
number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project, to 
compete for the contract.
    (3) Grantees will have written selection procedures for procurement 
transactions. These procedures will ensure that all solicitations:
    (i) Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical 
requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured. Such 
description shall not, in competitive procurements, contain features 
which unduly restrict competition. The description may include a 
statement of the qualitative nature of the material, product or service 
to be procured, and when necessary, shall set forth those minimum 
essential characteristics and

[[Page 559]]

standards to which it must conform if it is to satisfy its intended use. 
Detailed product specifications should be avoided if at all possible. 
When it is impractical or uneconomical to make a clear and accurate 
description of the technical requirements, a ``brand name or equal'' 
description may be used as a means to define the performance or other 
salient requirements of a procurement. The specific features of the 
named brand which must be met by offerors shall be clearly stated; and
    (ii) Identify all requirements which the offerors must fulfill and 
all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.
    (4) Grantees and subgrantees will ensure that all prequalified lists 
of persons, firms, or products which are used in acquiring goods and 
services are current and include enough qualified sources to ensure 
maximum open and free competition. Also, grantees and subgrantees will 
not preclude potential bidders from qualifying during the solicitation 
period.
    (d) Methods of procurement to be followed--(1) Procurement by small 
purchase procedures. Small purchase procedures are those relatively 
simple and informal procurement methods for securing services, supplies, 
or other property that do not cost more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) (currently set at $100,000). If 
small purchase procedures are used, price or rate quotations shall be 
obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources.
    (2) Procurement by sealed bids (formal advertising). Bids are 
publicly solicited and a firm-fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit 
price) is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with 
all the material terms and conditions of the invitation for bids, is the 
lowest in price. The sealed bid method is the preferred method for 
procuring construction, if the conditions in Sec. 105-71.136(d)(2)(i) 
apply.
    (i) In order for sealed bidding to be feasible, the following 
conditions should be present:
    (A) A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase 
description is available;
    (B) Two or more responsible bidders are willing and able to compete 
effectively and for the business; and
    (C) The procurement lends itself to a firm fixed price contract and 
the selection of the successful bidder can be made principally on the 
basis of price.
    (ii) If sealed bids are used, the following requirements apply:
    (A) The invitation for bids will be publicly advertised and bids 
shall be solicited from an adequate number of known suppliers, providing 
them sufficient time prior to the date set for opening the bids;
    (B) The invitation for bids, which will include any specifications 
and pertinent attachments, shall define the items or services in order 
for the bidder to properly respond;
    (C) All bids will be publicly opened at the time and place 
prescribed in the invitation for bids;
    (D) A firm fixed-price contract award will be made in writing to the 
lowest responsive and responsible bidder. Where specified in bidding 
documents, factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and life 
cycle costs shall be considered in determining which bid is lowest. 
Payment discounts will only be used to determine the low bid when prior 
experience indicates that such discounts are usually taken advantage of; 
and
    (E) Any or all bids may be rejected if there is a sound documented 
reason.
    (3) Procurement by competitive proposals. The technique of 
competitive proposals is normally conducted with more than one source 
submitting an offer, and either a fixed-price or cost-reimbursement type 
contract is awarded. It is generally used when conditions are not 
appropriate for the use of sealed bids. If this method is used, the 
following requirements apply:
    (i) Requests for proposals will be publicized and identify all 
evaluation factors and their relative importance. Any response to 
publicized requests for proposals shall be honored to the maximum extent 
practical;
    (ii) Proposals will be solicited from an adequate number of 
qualified sources;

[[Page 560]]

    (iii) Grantees and subgrantees will have a method for conducting 
technical evaluations of the proposals received and for selecting 
awardees;
    (iv) Awards will be made to the responsible firm whose proposal is 
most advantageous to the program, with price and other factors 
considered; and
    (v) Grantees and subgrantees may use competitive proposal procedures 
for qualifications-based procurement of architectural/engineering (A/E) 
professional services whereby competitors' qualifications are evaluated 
and the most qualified competitor is selected, subject to negotiation of 
fair and reasonable compensation. The method, where price is not used as 
a selection factor, can only be used in procurement of A/E professional 
services. It cannot be used to purchase other types of services though 
A/E firms are a potential source to perform the proposed effort.
    (4) Procurement by noncompetitive proposals is procurement through 
solicitation of a proposal from only one source, or after solicitation 
of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate.
    (i) Procurement by noncompetitive proposals may be used only when 
the award of a contract is infeasible under small purchase procedures, 
sealed bids or competitive proposals and one of the following 
circumstances applies:
    (A) The item is available only from a single source;
    (B) The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not 
permit a delay resulting from competitive solicitation;
    (C) The awarding agency authorizes noncompetitive proposals; or
    (D) After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is 
determined inadequate.
    (ii) Cost analysis, i.e., verifying the proposed cost data, the 
projections of the data, and the evaluation of the specific elements of 
costs and profits, is required.
    (iii) Grantees and subgrantees may be required to submit the 
proposed procurement to the awarding agency for pre-award review in 
accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
    (e) Contracting with small and minority firms, women's business 
enterprise and labor surplus area firms. (1) The grantee and subgrantee 
will take all necessary affirmative steps to assure that minority firms, 
women's business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms are used when 
possible.
    (2) Affirmative steps shall include:
    (i) Placing qualified small and minority businesses and women's 
business enterprises on solicitation lists;
    (ii) Assuring that small and minority businesses, and women's 
business enterprises are solicited whenever they are potential sources;
    (iii) Dividing total requirements, when economically feasible, into 
smaller tasks or quantities to permit maximum participation by small and 
minority business, and women's business enterprises;
    (iv) Establishing delivery schedules, where the requirement permits, 
which encourage participation by small and minority business, and 
women's business enterprises;
    (v) Using the services and assistance of the Small Business 
Administration, and the Minority Business Development Agency of the 
Department of Commerce; and
    (vi) Requiring the prime contractor, if subcontracts are to be let, 
to take the affirmative steps listed in paragraphs (e)(2) (i) through 
(v) of this section.
    (f) Contract cost and price. (1) Grantees and subgrantees must 
perform a cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement 
action including contract modifications. The method and degree of 
analysis is dependent on the facts surrounding the particular 
procurement situation, but as a starting point, grantees must make 
independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals. A cost 
analysis must be performed when the offeror is required to submit the 
elements of his estimated cost, e.g., under professional, consulting, 
and architectural engineering services contracts. A cost analysis will 
be necessary when adequate price competition is lacking, and for sole 
source procurements, including contract modifications or change orders, 
unless price reasonableness can be established on the basis of a catalog 
or market price of a commercial product sold in substantial quantities 
to the

[[Page 561]]

general public or based on prices set by law or regulation. A price 
analysis will be used in all other instances to determine the 
reasonableness of the proposed contract price.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will negotiate profit as a separate 
element of the price for each contract in which there is no price 
competition and in all cases where cost analysis is performed. To 
establish a fair and reasonable profit, consideration will be given to 
the complexity of the work to be performed, the risk borne by the 
contractor, the contractor's investment, the amount of subcontracting, 
the quality of its record of past performance, and industry profit rates 
in the surrounding geographical area for similar work.
    (3) Costs or prices based on estimated costs for contracts under 
grants will be allowable only to the extent that costs incurred or cost 
estimates included in negotiated prices are consistent with Federal cost 
principles (see Sec. 105-71.122). Grantees may reference their own cost 
principles that comply with the applicable Federal cost principles.
    (4) The cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of 
construction cost methods of contracting shall not be used.
    (g) Awarding agency review. (1) Grantees and subgrantees must make 
available, upon request of the awarding agency, technical specifications 
on proposed procurements where the awarding agency believes such review 
is needed to ensure that the item and/or service specified is the one 
being proposed for purchase. This review generally will take place prior 
to the time the specification is incorporated into a solicitation 
document. However, if the grantee or subgrantee desires to have the 
review accomplished after a solicitation has been developed, the 
awarding agency may still review the specifications, with such review 
usually limited to the technical aspects of the proposed purchase.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees must on request make available for 
awarding agency pre-award review procurement documents, such as requests 
for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc. 
when:
    (i) A grantee's or subgrantee's procurement procedures or operation 
fails to comply with the procurement standards in this section; or
    (ii) The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified 
acquisition threshold and is to be awarded without competition or only 
one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation; or
    (iii) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the simplified 
acquisition threshold, specifies a ``brand name'' product; or
    (iv) The proposed award is more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold and is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder 
under a sealed bid procurement; or
    (v) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract 
or increases the contract amount by more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold.
    (3) A grantee or subgrantee will be exempt from the pre-award review 
in paragraph (g)(2) of this section if the awarding agency determines 
that its procurement systems comply with the standards of this section.
    (i) A grantee or subgrantee may request that its procurement system 
be reviewed by the awarding agency to determine whether its system meets 
these standards in order for its system to be certified. Generally, 
these reviews shall occur where there is a continuous high-dollar 
funding, and third-party contracts are awarded on a regular basis.
    (ii) A grantee or subgrantee may self-certify its procurement 
system. Such self-certification shall not limit the awarding agency's 
right to survey the system. Under a self-certification procedure, 
awarding agencies may wish to rely on written assurances from the 
grantee or subgrantee that it is complying with these standards. A 
grantee or subgrantee will cite specific procedures, regulations, 
standards, etc., as being in compliance with these requirements and have 
its system available for review.
    (h) Bonding requirements. For construction or facility improvement 
contracts or subcontracts exceeding the simplified acquisition 
threshold, the

[[Page 562]]

awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the 
grantee or subgrantee provided the awarding agency has made a 
determination that the awarding agency's interest is adequately 
protected. If such a determination has not been made, the minimum 
requirements shall be as follows:
    (1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of 
the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist of a firm commitment 
such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument 
accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder will, upon acceptance of 
his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within 
the time specified.
    (2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent 
of the contract price. A ``performance bond'' is one executed in 
connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's 
obligations under such contract.
    (3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of 
the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed in connection 
with a contract to assure payment as required by law of all persons 
supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for 
in the contract.
    (i) Contract provisions. A grantee's and subgrantee's contracts must 
contain provisions in paragraph (i) of this section. Federal agencies 
are permitted to require changes, remedies, changed conditions, access 
and records retention, suspension of work, and other clauses approved by 
the Office of Federal Procurement Policy.
    (1) Administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances 
where contractors violate or breach contract terms, and provide for such 
sanctions and penalties as may be appropriate. (Contracts more than the 
simplified acquisition threshold)
    (2) Termination for cause and for convenience by the grantee or 
subgrantee including the manner by which it will be effected and the 
basis for settlement. (All contracts in excess of $10,000)
    (3) Compliance with Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, 
entitled ``Equal Employment Opportunity,'' as amended by Executive Order 
11375 of October 13, 1967, and as supplemented in Department of Labor 
regulations (41 CFR chapter 60). (All construction contracts awarded in 
excess of $10,000 by grantees and their contractors or subgrantees)
    (4) Compliance with the Copeland ``Anti-Kickback'' Act (18 U.S.C. 
874) as supplemented in Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 3).

    (5) Compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a to 276a-7) 
as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 5). 
(Construction contracts in excess of $2000 awarded by grantees and 
subgrantees when required by Federal grant program legislation)
    (6) Compliance with sections 103 and 107 of the Contract Work Hours 
and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-330) as supplemented by 
Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 5). (Construction contracts 
awarded by grantees and subgrantees in excess of $2000, and in excess of 
$2500 for other contracts which involve the employment of mechanics or 
laborers)
    (7) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations 
pertaining to reporting.
    (8) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations 
pertaining to patent rights with respect to any discovery or invention 
which arises or is developed in the course of or under such contract.
    (9) Awarding agency requirements and regulations pertaining to 
copyrights and rights in data.
    (10) Access by the grantee, the subgrantee, the Federal grantor 
agency, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their 
duly authorized representatives to any books, documents, papers, and 
records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to that specific 
contract for the purpose of making audit, examination, excerpts, and 
transcriptions.
    (11) Retention of all required records for three years after 
grantees or subgrantees make final payments and all other pending 
matters are closed.
    (12) Compliance with all applicable standards, orders, or

Sec. 105-71.137  Subgrants.

    (a) States. States shall follow State law and procedures when 
awarding and administering subgrants (whether on a cost reimbursement or 
fixed amount basis) of financial assistance to local and Indian tribal 
governments. States shall:
    (1) Ensure that every subgrant includes any clauses required by 
Federal statute and executive orders and their implementing regulations;
    (2) Ensure that subgrantees are aware of requirements imposed upon 
them by Federal statute and regulation;
    (3) Ensure that a provision for compliance with Sec. 105-71.142 is 
placed in every cost reimbursement subgrant; and
    (4) Conform any advances of grant funds to subgrantees substantially 
to the same standards of timing and amount that apply to cash advances 
by Federal agencies.
    (b) All other grantees. All other grantees shall follow the 
provisions of this part which are applicable to awarding agencies when 
awarding and administering subgrants (whether on a cost reimbursement or 
fixed amount basis) of financial assistance to local and Indian tribal 
governments. Grantees shall:
    (1) Ensure that every subgrant includes a provision for compliance 
with this part;
    (2) Ensure that every subgrant includes any clauses required by 
Federal statute and executive orders and their implementing regulations; 
and
    (3) Ensure that subgrantees are aware of requirements imposed upon 
them by Federal statutes and regulations.
    (c) Exceptions. By their own terms, certain provisions of this part

                             and Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.140  Monitoring and reporting program performance.

    (a) Monitoring by grantees. Grantees are responsible for managing 
the day-to-day operations of grant and subgrant supported activities. 
Grantees must monitor grant and subgrant supported activities to assure 
compliance with applicable Federal requirements and that performance 
goals are being achieved. Grantee monitoring must cover each program, 
function or activity.
    (b) Non-construction performance reports. The Federal agency may, if 
it decides that performance information available from subsequent 
applications contains sufficient information to meet its programmatic 
needs, require the grantee to submit a performance report only upon 
expiration or termination of grant support. Unless waived by the Federal 
agency this report will be due on the same date as the final Financial 
Status Report.
    (1) Grantees shall submit annual performance reports unless the 
awarding agency requires quarterly or semiannual reports. However, 
performance reports will not be required more frequently than quarterly. 
Annual reports shall be due 90 days after the grant year, quarterly or 
semiannual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. The 
final performance report will be due 90 days after the expiration or 
termination of grant support. If a justified request is submitted by a

[[Page 564]]

grantee, the Federal agency may extend the due date for any performance 
report. Additionally, requirements for unnecessary performance reports 
may be waived by the Federal agency.
    (2) Performance reports will contain, for each grant, brief 
information on the following:
    (i) A comparison of actual accomplishments to the objectives 
established for the period. Where the output of the project can be 
quantified, a computation of the cost per unit of output may be required 
if that information will be useful.
    (ii) The reasons for slippage if established objectives were not 
met.
    (iii) Additional pertinent information including, when appropriate, 
analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.
    (3) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original 
and two copies of performance reports.
    (4) Grantees will adhere to the standards in this section in 
prescribing performance reporting requirements for subgrantees.
    (c) Construction performance reports. For the most part, on-site 
technical inspections and certified percentage-of-completion data are 
relied on heavily by Federal agencies to monitor progress under 
construction grants and subgrants. The Federal agency will require 
additional formal performance reports only when considered necessary, 
and never more frequently than quarterly.
    (d) Significant developments. Events may occur between the scheduled 
performance reporting dates which have significant impact upon the grant 
or subgrant supported activity. In such cases, the grantee must inform 
the Federal agency as soon as the following types of conditions become 
known:
    (1) Problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will materially 
impair the ability to meet the objective of the award. This disclosure 
must include a statement of the action taken, or contemplated, and any 
assistance needed to resolve the situation.
    (2) Favorable developments which enable meeting time schedules and 
objectives sooner or at less cost than anticipated or producing more 
beneficial results than originally planned.
    (e) Federal agencies may make site visits as warranted by program 
needs.
    (f) Waivers, extensions. (1) Federal agencies may waive any 
performance report required by this part if not needed.
    (2) The grantee may waive any performance report from a subgrantee 
when not needed. The grantee may exend the due date for any performance 
report from a subgrantee if the grantee will still be able to meet its 
performance reporting obligations to the Federal agency.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.141  Financial reporting.

    (a) General. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a) (2) and (5) of 
this section, grantees will use only the forms specified in paragraphs 
(a) through (e) of this section, and such supplementary or other forms 
as may from time to time be authorized by OMB, for:
    (i) Submitting financial reports to Federal agencies, or
    (ii) Requesting advances or reimbursements when letters of credit 
are not used.
    (2) Grantees need not apply the forms prescribed in this section in 
dealing with their subgrantees. However, grantees shall not impose more 
burdensome requirements on subgrantees.
    (3) Grantees shall follow all applicable standard and supplemental 
Federal agency instructions approved by OMB to the extent required under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 for use in connection with forms 
specified in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. Federal 
agencies may issue substantive supplementary instructions only with the 
approval of OMB. Federal agencies may shade out or instruct the grantee 
to disregard any line item that the Federal agency finds unnecessary for 
its decision making purposes.
    (4) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original 
and two copies of forms required under this part.
    (5) Federal agencies may provide computer outputs to grantees to 
expedite or contribute to the accuracy of reporting. Federal agencies 
may accept the required information from grantees in machine usable 
format or computer printouts instead of prescribed forms.

[[Page 565]]

    (6) Federal agencies may waive any report required by this section 
if not needed.
    (7) Federal agencies may extend the due date on any financial report 
upon receiving a justified request from a grantee.
    (b) Financial Status Report--(1) Form. Grantees will use Standard 
Form 269 or 269A, Financial Status Report, to report the status of funds 
for all non-construction grants and for construction grants when 
required in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (2) Accounting basis. Each grantee will report program outlays and 
program income on a cash or accrual basis as prescribed by the awarding 
agency. If the Federal agency requires accrual information and the 
grantee's accounting records are not normally kept on the accrual basis, 
the grantee shall not be required to convert its accounting system but 
shall develop such accrual information through an analysis of the 
documentation on hand.
    (3) Frequency. The Federal agency may prescribe the frequency of the 
report for each project or program. However, the report will not be 
required more frequently than quarterly. If the Federal agency does not 
specify the frequency of the report, it will be submitted annually. A 
final report will be required upon expiration or termination of grant 
support.
    (4) Due date. When reports are required on a quarterly or semiannual 
basis, they will be due 30 days after the reporting period. When 
required on an annual basis, they will be due 90 days after the grant 
year. Final reports will be due 90 days after the expiration or 
termination of grant support.
    (c) Federal Cash Transactions Report--(1) Form. (i) For grants paid 
by letter of credit, Treasury check advances or electronic transfer of 
funds, the grantee will submit the Standard Form 272, Federal Cash 
Transactions Report, and when necessary, its continuation sheet, 
Standard Form 272A, unless the terms of the award exempt the grantee 
from this requirement.
    (ii) These reports will be used by the Federal agency to monitor 
cash advanced to grantees and to obtain disbursement or outlay 
information for each grant from grantees. The format of the report may 
be adapted as appropriated when reporting is to be accomplished with the 
assistance of automatic data processing equipment provided that the 
information to be submitted is not changed in substance.
    (2) Forecasts of Federal cash requirements. Forecasts of Federal 
cash requirements may be required in the ``Remarks'' section of the 
report.
    (3) Cash in hands of subgrantees. When considered necessary and 
feasible by the Federal agency, grantees may be required to report the 
amount of cash advances in excess of three days' needs in the hands of 
their subgrantees or contractors and to provide short narrative 
explanations of actions taken by the grantee to reduce the excess 
balances.
    (4) Frequency and due date. Grantees must submit the report no later 
than 15 working days following the end of each quarter. However, where 
an advance either by letter of credit or electronic transfer of funds is 
authorized at an annualized rate of one million dollars or more, the 
Federal agency may require the report to be submitted within 15 working 
days following the end of each month.
    (d) Request for advance or reimbursement--(1) Advance payments. 
Requests for Treasury check advance payments will be submitted on 
Standard Form 270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. (This form will 
not be used for drawdowns under a letter of credit, electronic funds 
transfer or when Treasury check advance payments are made to the grantee 
automatically on a predetermined basis.)
    (2) Reimbursements. Requests for reimbursement under non-
construction grants will also be submitted on Standard Form 270. (For 
reimbursement requests under construction grants, see paragraph (e)(1) 
of this section.)
    (3) The frequency for submitting payment requests is treated in 
Sec. 105-71.141(b)(3).
    (e) Outlay report and request for reimbursement for construction 
programs. (1) Grants that support construction activities paid by 
reimbursement method.
    (i) Requests for reimbursement under construction grants will be 
submitted

[[Page 566]]

on Standard Form 271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for 
Construction Programs. Federal agencies may, however, prescribe the 
Request for Advance or Reimbursement form, specified in Sec. 105-
71.141(d), instead of this form.
    (ii) The frequency for submitting reimbursement requests is treated 
in Sec. 105-71.141(b)(3).
    (2) Grants that support construction activities paid by letter of 
credit, electronic funds transfer or Treasury check advance.
    (i) When a construction grant is paid by letter of credit, 
electronic funds transfer or Treasury check advances, the grantee will 
report its outlays to the Federal agency using Standard Form 271, Outlay 
Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. The 
Federal agency will provide any necessary special instruction. However, 
frequency and due date shall be governed by Sec. 105-71.141(b) (3) and 
(4).
    (ii) When a construction grant is paid by Treasury check advances 
based on periodic requests from the grantee, the advances will be 
requested on the form specified in Sec. 105-71.141(d).
    (iii) The Federal agency may substitute the Financial Status Report 
specified in Sec. 105-71.141(b) for the Outlay Report and Request for 
Reimbursement for Construction Programs.
    (3) Accounting basis. The accounting basis for the Outlay Report and 
Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs shall be governed by 
Sec. 105-71.141(b)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.142  Retention and access requirements for records.

    (a) Applicability. (1) This section applies to all financial and 
programmatic records, supporting documents, statistical records, and 
other records of grantees of subgrantees or subgrantees which are:
    (i) Required to be maintained by the terms of this part, program 
regulations or the grant agreement, or
    (ii) Otherwise reasonably considered as pertinent to program 
regulations or the grant agreement.
    (2) This section does not apply to records maintained by contractors 
or subcontractors. For a requirement to place a provision concerning 
records in certain kinds of contracts, see Sec. 105-71.136(i)(10).
    (b) Length of retention period. (1) Except as otherwise provided, 
records must be retained for three years from the starting date 
specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or other action 
involving the records has been started before the expiration of the 3-
year period, the records must be retained until completion of the action 
and resolution of all issues which arise from it, or until the end of 
the regular 3-year period, whichever is later.
    (3) To avoid duplicate recordkeeping, awarding agencies may make 
special arrangements with grantees and subgrantees to retain any records 
which are continuously needed for joint use. The awarding agency will 
request transfer of records to its custody when it determines that the 
records possess long-term retention value. When the records are 
transferred to or maintained by the Federal agency, the 3-year retention 
requirement is not applicable to the grantee or subgrantee.
    (c) Starting date of retention period--(1) General. When grant 
support is continued or renewed at annual or other intervals, the 
retention period for the records of each funding period starts on the 
day the grantee or subgrantee submits to the awarding agency its single 
or last expenditure report for that period. However, if grant support is 
continued or renewed quarterly, the retention period for each year's 
records starts on the day the grantee submits its expenditure report for 
the last quarter of the Federal fiscal year. In all other cases, the 
retention period starts on the day the grantee submits its final 
expenditure report. If an expenditure report has been waived, the 
retention period starts on the day the report would have been due.
    (2) Real property and equipment records. The retention period for 
real property and equipment records starts from the date of the 
disposition or replacement or transfer at the direction of the awarding 
agency.
    (3) Records for income transactions after grant or subgrant support. 
In some cases grantees must report income after the period of grant 
support.

[[Page 567]]

Where there is such a requirement, the retention period for the records 
pertaining to the earning of the income starts from the end of the 
grantee's fiscal year in which the income is earned.
    (4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. This 
paragraph applies to the following types of documents, and their 
supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost 
allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rates 
at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer 
usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).
    (i) If submitted for negotiation. If the proposal, plan, or other 
computation is required to be submitted to the Federal Government (or to 
the grantee) to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-
year retention period for its supporting records starts from the date of 
such submission.
    (ii) If not submitted for negotiation. If the proposal, plan, or 
other computations are not required to be submitted to the Federal 
Government (or to the grantee) for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year 
retention period for the proposal plan, or computation and its 
supporting records starts from end of the fiscal year (or other 
accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.
    (d) Substitution of microfilm. Copies made by microfilming, 
photocopying, or similar methods may be substituted for the original 
records.
    (e) Access to records--(1) Records of grantees and subgrantees. The 
awarding agency and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any 
of their authorized representatives, shall have the right of access to 
any pertinent books, documents, papers, or other records of grantees and 
subgrantees which are pertinent to the grant, in order to make audits, 
examinations, excerpts, and transcripts.
    (2) Expiration of right of access. The rights of access in this 
section must not be limited to the required retention period but shall 
last as long as the records are retained.
    (f) Restrictions on public access. The Federal Freedom of 
Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) does not apply to records. Unless 
required by Federal, State, or local law, grantees and subgrantees are 
not required to permit public access to their records.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.143  Enforcement.

    (a) Remedies for noncompliance. If a grantee or subgrantee 
materially fails to comply with any term of an award, whether stated in 
a Federal statute or regulation, an assurance, in a State plan or 
application, a notice of award, or elsewhere, the awarding agency may 
take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the 
circumstances:
    (1) Temporary withhold cash payments pending correction of the 
deficiency by the grantee or subgrantee or more severe enforcement 
action by the awarding agency,
    (2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and matching credit 
for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in 
compliance,
    (3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award for the 
grantee's or subgrantee's program,
    (4) Without further awards for the program, or
    (5) Take other remedies that may be legally available,
    (b) Hearings, appeals. In taking an enforcement action, the awarding 
agency will provide the grantee or subgrantee an opportunity for such 
hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the grantee 
or subgrantee is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to 
the action involved.
    (c) Effects of suspension and termination. Costs of grantee or 
subgrantee resulting from obligations incurred by the grantee or 
subgrantee during a suspension or after termination of an award are not 
allowable unless the awarding agency expressly authorizes them in the 
notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. Other grantee or 
subgrantee costs during suspension or after termination which are 
necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if:
    (1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred 
by the grantee or subgrantee before the effective date of suspension or 
termination, are not in anticipation of it, and, in

[[Page 568]]

case of a termination, are noncancellable, and,
    (2) The cost would be allowable if the award were not suspended or 
expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the 
termination takes effect.
    (d) Relationship to debarment and suspension. The enforcement 
remedies identified in this section, including suspension and 
termination, do not preclude grantee or subgrantee from being subject to 
``Debarment and Suspension'' under E.O. 12549 (see Sec. 105-71.135).


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.144  Termination for convenience.

    Except as provided in Sec. 105-71.143 awards may be terminated in 
whole or in part only as follows:
    (a) By the awarding agency with the consent of the grantee or 
subgrantee in which case the two parties shall agree upon the 
termination conditions, including the effective date and in the case of 
partial termination, the portion to be terminated, or
    (b) By the grantee or subgrantee upon written notification to the 
awarding agency, setting forth the reasons for such termination, the 
effective date, and in the case of partial termination, the portion to 
be terminated. However, if, in the case of a partial termination, the 
awarding agency determines that the remaining portion of the award will 
not accomplish the purposes for which the award was made, the awarding 
agency may terminate the award in its entirety under either Sec. 105-
71.143 or paragraph (a) of this section.


<R04>
             Subpart 105	71.15_After-the-Grant Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.150  Closeout.

    (a) General. The Federal agency will close out the award when it 
determines that all applicable administrative actions and all required 
work of the grant has been completed.
    (b) Reports. Within 90 days after the expiration or termination of 
the grant, the grantee must submit all financial, performance, and other 
reports required as a condition of the grant. Upon request by the 
grantee, Federal agencies may extend this timeframe. These may include 
but are not limited to:
    (1) Final performance or progress report.
    (2) Financial Status Report (SF 269) or Outlay Report and Request 
for Reimbursement for Construction Programs (SF-271) (as applicable).
    (3) Final request for payment (SF-270) (if applicable).
    (4) Invention disclosure (if applicable).
    (5) Federally-owned property report: In accordance with Sec. 105-
71.132(f), a grantee must submit an inventory of all federally owned 
property (as distinct from property acquired with grant funds) for which 
it is accountable and request disposition instructions from the Federal 
agency of property no longer needed.
    (c) Cost adjustment. The Federal agency will, within 90 days after 
receipt of reports in paragraph (b) of this section, make upward or 
downward adjustments to the allowable costs.
    (d) Cash adjustments. (1) The Federal agency will make prompt 
payment to the grantee for allowable reimbursable costs.
    (2) The grantee must immediately refund to the Federal agency any 
balance of unobligated (unencumbered) cash advanced that is not 
authorized to be retained for use on other grants.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.151  Later disallowances and adjustments.

    The closeout of a grant does not affect:
    (a) The Federal agency's right to disallow costs and recover funds 
on the basis of a later audit or other review;
    (b) The grantee's obligation to return any funds due as a result of 
later refunds, corrections, or other transactions;
    (c) Records retention as required in Sec. 105-71.142;
    (d) Property management requirements in Sec. 105-71.131 and Sec. 
105-71.132; and
    (e) Audit requirements in Sec. 105-71.126.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.152  Collection of amounts due.

    (a) Any funds paid to a grantee in excess of the amount to which the 
grantee is finally determined to be entitled

[[Page 569]]

under the terms of the award constitute a debt to the Federal 
Government. If not paid within a reasonable period after demand, the 
Federal agency may reduce the debt by:
    (1) Making an administrative offset against other requests for 
reimbursement,
    (2) Withholding advance payments otherwise due to the grantee, or
    (3) Other action permitted by law.
    (b) Except where otherwise provided by statutes or regulations, the 
Federal agency will charge interest on an overdue debt in accordance 
with the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR Ch. II). The date 
from which interest is computed is not extended by litigation or the 
filing of any form of appeal.

                        Subpart 105	72.1_General


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.100  Purpose.

    This part establishes uniform administrative requirements for 
Federal grants and agreements awarded to institutions of higher 
education, hospitals, and other non-profit organizations. Federal 
awarding agencies shall not impose additional or inconsistent 
requirements, except as provided in Sec. 105-72.103, and Sec. 105-
72.204 or unless specifically required by Federal statute or executive 
order. Non-profit organizations that implement Federal programs for the 
States are also subject to State requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.101  Definitions.

    (a) Accrued expenditures means the charges incurred by the recipient 
during a given period requiring the provision of funds for:
    (1) Goods and other tangible property received;
    (2) Services performed by employees, contractors, subrecipients, and 
other payees; and
    (3) Other amounts becoming owed under programs for which no current 
services or performance is required.
    (b) Accrued income means the sum of:
    (1) Earnings during a given period from
    (i) Services performed by the recipient, and
    (ii) Goods and other tangible property delivered to purchasers, and
    (2) Amounts becoming owed to the recipient for which no current 
services or performance is required by the recipient.
    (c) Acquisition cost of equipment means the net invoice price of the 
equipment, including the cost of modifications, attachments, 
accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessary to make the property 
usable for the purpose for which it was acquired. Other charges, such as 
the cost of installation, transportation, taxes, duty or protective in-
transit insurance, shall be included or excluded from the unit 
acquisition cost in accordance with the recipient's regular accounting 
practices.
    (d) Advance means a payment made by Treasury check or other 
appropriate payment mechanism to a recipient upon its request either 
before outlays are made by the recipient or through the use of 
predetermined payment schedules.
    (e) Award means financial assistance that provides support or 
stimulation to accomplish a public purpose. Awards include grants and 
other agreements in the form of money or property in lieu of money, by 
the Federal Government to an eligible recipient. The term does not 
include: technical assistance, which provides services instead of money; 
other assistance in the form of loans, loan guarantees, interest 
subsidies, or insurance; direct payments of any kind to individuals; 
and, contracts which are required to be entered into and administered 
under procurement laws and regulations.
    (f) Cash contributions means the recipient's cash outlay, including 
the outlay of money contributed to the recipient by third parties.
    (g) Closeout means the process by which a Federal awarding agency 
determines that all applicable administrative actions and all required 
work of the award have been completed by the recipient and Federal 
awarding agency.
    (h) Contract means a procurement contract under an award or 
subaward, and a procurement subcontract under a recipient's or 
subrecipient's contract.
    (i) Cost sharing or matching means that portion of project or 
program costs not borne by the Federal Government.
    (j) Date of completion means the date on which all work under an 
award is completed or the date on the award document, or any supplement 
or amendment thereto, on which Federal sponsorship ends.
    (k) Disallowed costs means those charges to an award that the 
Federal awarding agency determines to be unallowable, in accordance with 
the applicable Federal cost principles or other terms and conditions 
contained in the award.
    (l) Equipment means tangible nonexpendable personal property 
including exempt property charged directly to the award having a useful 
life of more than one year and an acquisition cost

[[Page 571]]

of $5000 or more per unit. However, consistent with recipient policy, 
lower limits may be established.
    (m) Excess property means property under the control of any Federal 
awarding agency that, as determined by the head thereof, is no longer 
required for its needs or the discharge of its responsibilities.
    (n) Exempt property means tangible personal property acquired in 
whole or in part with Federal funds, where the Federal awarding agency 
has statutory authority to vest title in the recipient without further 
obligation to the Federal Government. An example of exempt property 
authority is contained in the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement 
Act (31 U.S.C. 6306), for property acquired under an award to conduct 
basic or applied research by a non-profit institution of higher 
education or non-profit organization whose principal purpose is 
conducting scientific research.

    (t) Obligations means the amounts of orders placed, contracts and 
grants awarded, services received and similar transactions during a 
given period that require payment by the recipient during the same or a 
future period.
    (u) Outlays or expenditures means charges made to the project or 
program. They may be reported on a cash or accrual basis. For reports 
prepared on a cash basis, outlays are the sum of cash disbursements for 
direct charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect expense 
charged, the value of third party in-kind contributions applied and the 
amount of cash advances and payments made to subrecipients. For reports 
prepared on an accrual basis, outlays are the sum of cash disbursements 
for direct charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect 
expense incurred, the value of in-kind contributions applied, and the 
net increase (or decrease) in the amounts owed by the recipient for 
goods and other property received, for services performed by employees, 
contractors, subrecipients and other payees and other amounts becoming 
owed under programs for which no current services or performance are 
required.

income includes, but is not limited to, income from fees for services 
performed, the use or rental of real or personal property acquired under 
federally-funded projects, the sale of commodities or items fabricated 
under an award, license fees and royalties on patents and copyrights, 
and interest on loans made with award funds. Interest earned on advances 
of Federal funds is not program income. Except as otherwise provided in 
Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the 
award, program income does not include the receipt of principal on 
loans, rebates, credits, discounts, etc., or interest earned on any of 
them.

[[Page 572]]

    (y) Project costs means all allowable costs, as set forth in the 
applicable Federal cost principles, incurred by a recipient and the 
value of the contributions made by third parties in accomplishing the 
objectives of the award during the project period.
    (z) Project period means the period established in the award 
document during which Federal sponsorship begins and ends.
    (aa) Property means, unless otherwise stated, real property, 
equipment, intangible property and debt instruments.
    (bb) Real property means land, including land improvements, 
structures and appurtenances thereto, but excludes movable machinery and 
equipment.
    (cc) Recipient means an organization receiving financial assistance 
directly from Federal awarding agencies to carry out a project or 
program. The term includes public and private institutions of higher 
education, public and private hospitals, and other quasi-public and 
private non-profit organizations such as, but not limited to, community 
action agencies, research institutes, educational associations, and 
health centers. The term may include commercial organizations, foreign 
or international organizations (such as agencies of the United Nations) 
which are recipients, subrecipients, or contractors or subcontractors of 
recipients or subrecipients at the discretion of the Federal awarding 
agency. The term does not include government-owned contractor-operated 
facilities or research centers providing continued support for mission-
oriented, large-scale programs that are government-owned or controlled, 
or are designated as federally-funded research and development centers.
    (dd) Research and development means all research activities, both 
basic and applied, and all development activities that are supported at 
universities, colleges, and other non-profit institutions. ``Research'' 
is defined as a systematic study directed toward fuller scientific 
knowledge or understanding of the subject studied. ``Development'' is 
the systematic use of knowledge and understanding gained from research 
directed toward the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or 
methods, including design and development of prototypes and processes. 
The term research also includes activities involving the training of 
individuals in research techniques where such activities utilize the 
same facilities as other research and development activities and where 
such activities are not included in the instruction function.
    (ee) Small awards means a grant or cooperative agreement not 
exceeding the small purchase threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) 
(currently $25,000).
    (ff) Subaward means an award of financial assistance in the form of 
money, or property in lieu of money, made under an award by a recipient 
to an eligible subrecipient or by a subrecipient to a lower tier 
subrecipient. The term includes financial assistance when provided by 
any legal agreement, even if the agreement is called a contract, but 
does not include procurement of goods and services nor does it include 
any form of assistance which is excluded from the definition of 
``award'' in paragraph 105-72.101(e).
    (gg) Subrecipient means the legal entity to which a subaward is made 
and which is accountable to the recipient for the use of the funds 
provided. The term may include foreign or international organizations 
(such as agencies of the United Nations) at the discretion of the 
Federal awarding agency.
    (hh) Supplies means all personal property excluding equipment, 
intangible property, and debt instruments as defined in this section, 
and inventions of a contractor conceived or first actually reduced to 
practice in the performance of work under a funding agreement (``subject 
inventions''), as defined in 37 CFR part 401, ``Rights to Inventions 
Made by Nonprofit Organizations and Small Business Firms Under 
Government Grants, Contracts, and Cooperative Agreements.''
    (ii) Suspension means an action by a Federal awarding agency that 
temporarily withdraws Federal sponsorship under an award, pending 
corrective action by the recipient or pending a decision to terminate 
the award by the Federal awarding agency. Suspension of an award is a 
separate action from

[[Page 573]]

suspension under Federal agency regulations implementing E.O.s 12549 and 
12689, ``Debarment and Suspension.''
    (jj) Termination means the cancellation of Federal sponsorship, in 
whole or in part, under an agreement at any time prior to the date of 
completion.
    (kk) Third party in-kind contributions means the value of noncash 
contributions provided by non-Federal third parties. Third party in-kind 
contributions may be in the form of real property, equipment, supplies 
and other expendable property, and the value of goods and services 
directly benefiting and specifically identifiable to the project or 
program.
    (ll) Unliquidated obligations, for financial reports prepared on a 
cash basis, means the amount of obligations incurred by the recipient 
that have not been paid. For reports prepared on an accrued expenditure 
basis, they represent the amount of obligations incurred by the 
recipient for which an outlay has not been recorded.
    (mm) Unobligated balance means the portion of the funds authorized 
by the Federal awarding agency that has not been obligated by the 
recipient and is determined by deducting the cumulative obligations from 
the cumulative funds authorized.
    (nn) Unrecovered indirect cost means the difference between the 
amount awarded and the amount which could have been awarded under the 
recipient's approved negotiated indirect cost rate.
    (oo) Working capital advance means a procedure where by funds are 
advanced to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for 
a given initial period.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.102  Effect on other issuances.

    For awards subject to this regulation, all administrative 
requirements of codified program regulations, program manuals, handbooks 
and other nonregulatory materials which are inconsistent with the 
requirements of this regulation shall be superseded, except to the 
extent they are required by statute, or authorized in accordance with 
the deviations provision in Sec. 105-72.103.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.103  Deviations.

    The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) may grant exceptions for 
classes of grants or recipients subject to the requirements of this 
regulation when exceptions are not prohibited by statute. However, in 
the interest of maximum uniformity, exceptions from the requirements of 
this regulation shall be permitted only in unusual circumstances. 
Federal awarding agencies may apply more restrictive requirements to a 
class of recipients when approved by OMB. Federal awarding agencies may 
apply less restrictive requirements when awarding small awards, except 
for those requirements which are statutory. Exceptions on a case-by-case 
basis may also be made by Federal awarding agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.104  Subawards.

    Unless sections of this regulation specifically exclude 
subrecipients from coverage, the provisions of this regulation shall be 
applied to subrecipients performing work under awards if such 
subrecipients are institutions of higher education, hospitals or other 
non-profit organizations. State and local government subrecipients are 
subject to the provisions of regulations implementing the grants 
management common rule, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants 
and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments,'' 41 CFR 105-
71.


<R04>
                 Subpart 105	72.2_Pre-Award Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.200  Purpose.

    Sections 105-72.201 through 105-72.207 prescribes forms and 
instructions and other pre-award matters to be used in applying for 
Federal awards.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.201  Pre-award policies.

    (a) Use of grants and cooperative agreements, and contracts. In each 
instance, the Federal awarding agency shall decide on the appropriate 
award instrument (i.e., grant, cooperative agreement, or contract). The 
Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. 6301-08) governs 
the use of grants, cooperative agreements and contracts. A grant or 
cooperative

[[Page 574]]

agreement shall be used only when the principal purpose of a transaction 
is to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized 
by Federal statute. The statutory criterion for choosing between grants 
and cooperative agreements is that for the latter, ``substantial 
involvement is expected between the executive agency and the State, 
local government, or other recipient when carrying out the activity 
contemplated in the agreement.'' Contracts shall be used when the 
principal purpose is acquisition of property or services for the direct 
benefit or use of the Federal Government.
    (b) Public notice and priority setting. Federal awarding agencies 
shall notify the public of its intended funding priorities for 
discretionary grant programs, unless funding priorities are established 
by Federal statute.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.202  Forms for applying for Federal assistance.

    (a) Federal awarding agencies shall comply with the applicable 
report clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320, ``Controlling 
Paperwork Burdens on the Public,'' with regard to all forms used by the 
Federal awarding agency in place of or as a supplement to the Standard 
Form 424 (SF-424) series.
    (b) Applicants shall use the SF-424 series or those forms and 
instructions prescribed by the Federal awarding agency.
    (c) For Federal programs covered by E.O. 12372, ``Intergovernmental 
Review of Federal Programs,'' the applicant shall complete the 
appropriate sections of the SF-424 (Application for Federal Assistance) 
indicating whether the application was subject to review by the State 
Single Point of Contact (SPOC). The name and address of the SPOC for a 
particular State can be obtained from the Federal awarding agency or the 
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance. The SPOC shall advise the 
applicant whether the program for which application is made has been 
selected by that State for review.
    (d) Federal awarding agencies that do not use the SF-424 form should 
indicate whether the application is subject to review by the State under 
E.O. 12372.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.203  Debarment and suspension.

    Federal awarding agencies and recipients shall comply with the 
nonprocurement debarment and suspension common rule implementing E.O.s 
12549 and 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension.'' This common rule 
restricts subawards and contracts with certain parties that are 
debarred, suspended or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for 
participation in Federal assistance programs or activities.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.204  Special award conditions.

    If an applicant or recipient:
    (a) Has a history of poor performance,
    (b) Is not financially stable,
    (c) Has a management system that does not meet the standards 
prescribed in this regulation,
    (d) Has not conformed to the terms and conditions of a previous 
award, or
    (e) Is not otherwise responsible;

Federal awarding agencies may impose additional requirements as needed, 
provided that such applicant or recipient is notified in writing as to: 
the nature of the additional requirements, the reason why the additional 
requirements are being imposed, the nature of the corrective action 
needed, the time allowed for completing the corrective actions, and the 
method for requesting reconsideration of the additional requirements 
imposed. Any special conditions shall be promptly removed once the 
conditions that prompted them have been corrected.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.205  Metric system of measurement.

    The Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and 
Competitiveness Act (15 U.S.C. 205) declares that the metric system is 
the preferred measurement system for U.S. trade and commerce. The Act 
requires each Federal agency to establish a date or dates in 
consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, when the metric system of 
measurement will be used in the agency's procurements, grants, and other 
business-related activities. Metric implementation may take longer where 
the use of the system is initially

impractical or likely to cause significant inefficiencies in the 
accomplishment of federally-funded activities. Federal awarding agencies 
shall follow the provisions of E.O. 12770, ``Metric Usage in Federal 
Government Programs.''

Sec. 105-72.206  Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

    Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (Pub. L. 94-
580 codified at 42 U.S.C. 6962), any State agency or agency of a 
political subdivision of a State which is using appropriated Federal 
funds must comply with section 6002. Section 6002 requires that 
preference be given in procurement programs to the purchase of specific 
products containing recycled materials identified in guidelines 
developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (40 CFR parts 247 
through 254). Accordingly, State and local institutions of higher 
education, hospitals, and non-profit organizations that receive direct 
Federal awards or other Federal funds shall give preference in their 
procurement programs funded with Federal funds to the purchase of 
recycled products pursuant to the EPA guidelines.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.207  Certifications and representations.

    Unless prohibited by statute or codified regulation, each Federal 
awarding agency is authorized and encouraged to allow recipients to 
submit certifications and representations required by statute, executive 
order, or regulation on an annual basis, if the recipients have ongoing 
and continuing relationships with the agency. Annual certifications and 
representations shall be signed by responsible officials with the 
authority to ensure recipients' compliance with the pertinent 
requirements.

    Subpart 105	72.30_Post-Award Requirements/Financial and Program 
                               Management


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.300  Purpose of financial and program management.

    Sections 105-72.301 through 105-72.308 prescribe standards for 
financial management systems, methods for making payments and rules for: 
satisfying cost sharing and matching requirements, accounting for 
program income, budget revision approvals, making audits, determining 
allowability of cost, and establishing fund availability.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.301  Standards for financial management systems.

    (a) Federal awarding agencies shall require recipients to relate 
financial data to performance data and develop unit cost information 
whenever practical.
    (b) Recipients' financial management systems shall provide for the 
following.
    (1) Accurate, current and complete disclosure of the financial 
results of each federally-sponsored project or program in accordance 
with the reporting requirements set forth in Sec. 105-72.602. If a 
Federal awarding agency requires reporting on an accrual basis from a 
recipient that maintains its records on other than an accrual basis, the 
recipient shall not be required to establish an accrual accounting 
system. These recipients may develop such accrual data for its reports 
on the basis of an analysis of the documentation on hand.
    (2) Records that identify adequately the source and application of 
funds for federally-sponsored activities. These records shall contain 
information pertaining to Federal awards, authorizations, obligations, 
unobligated balances, assets, outlays, income and interest.
    (3) Effective control over and accountability for all funds, 
property and other assets. Recipients shall adequately safeguard all 
such assets and assure they are used solely for authorized purposes.
    (4) Comparison of outlays with budget amounts for each award. 
Whenever appropriate, financial information should be related to 
performance and unit cost data.
    (5) Written procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the 
transfer of funds to the recipient from the U.S. Treasury and the 
issuance or redemption of checks, warrants or payments by other means 
for program purposes by the recipient. To the extent that the provisions 
of the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) (Pub. L. 101-453) govern, 
payment methods of State

[[Page 576]]

agencies, instrumentalities, and fiscal agents shall be consistent with 
CMIA Treasury-State Agreements or the CMIA default procedures codified 
at 31 CFR part 205, ``Withdrawal of Cash from the Treasury for Advances 
under Federal Grant and Other Programs.''
    (6) Written procedures for determining the reasonableness, 
allocability and allowability of costs in accordance with the provisions 
of the applicable Federal cost principles and the terms and conditions 
of the award.
    (7) Accounting records including cost accounting records that are 
supported by source documentation.
    (c) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment 
of money borrowed by the recipient, the Federal awarding agency, at its 
discretion, may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding 
and insurance requirements of the recipient are not deemed adequate to 
protect the interest of the Federal Government.
    (d) The Federal awarding agency may require adequate fidelity bond 
coverage where the recipient lacks sufficient coverage to protect the 
Federal Government's interest.
    (e) Where bonds are required in the situations described above, the 
bonds shall be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority 
as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety 
Companies Doing Business with the United States.''


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.302  Payment.

    (a) Payment methods shall minimize the time elapsing between the 
transfer of funds from the United States Treasury and the issuance or 
redemption of checks, warrants, or payment by other means by the 
recipients. Payment methods of State agencies or instrumentalities shall 
be consistent with Treasury-State CMIA agreements or default procedures 
codified at 31 CFR part 205.
    (b)(1) Recipients are to be paid in advance, provided they maintain 
or demonstrate the willingness to maintain:
    (i) Written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the 
transfer of funds and disbursement by the recipient, and
    (ii) Financial management systems that meet the standards for fund 
control and accountability as established in Sec. 105-72.301.
    (2) Cash advances to a recipient organization shall be limited to 
the minimum amounts needed and be timed to be in accordance with the 
actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient organization in 
carrying out the purpose of the approved program or project. The timing 
and amount of cash advances shall be as close as is administratively 
feasible to the actual disbursements by the recipient organization for 
direct program or project costs and the proportionate share of any 
allowable indirect costs.
    (c) Whenever possible, advances shall be consolidated to cover 
anticipated cash needs for all awards made by the Federal awarding 
agency to the recipient.
    (1) Advance payment mechanisms include, but are not limited to, 
Treasury check and electronic funds transfer.
    (2) Advance payment mechanisms are subject to 31 CFR part 205.
    (3) Recipients shall be authorized to submit requests for advances 
and reimbursements at least monthly when electronic fund transfers are 
not used.
    (d) Requests for Treasury check advance payment shall be submitted 
on SF-270, ``Request for Advance or Reimbursement,'' or other forms as 
may be authorized by OMB. This form is not to be used when Treasury 
check advance payments are made to the recipient automatically through 
the use of a predetermined payment schedule or if precluded by special 
Federal awarding agency instructions for electronic funds transfer.
    (e) Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in 
paragraph (b) cannot be met. Federal awarding agencies may also use this 
method on any construction agreement, or if the major portion of the 
construction project is accomplished through private market financing or 
Federal loans, and the Federal assistance constitutes a minor portion of 
the project.
    (1) When the reimbursement method is used, the Federal awarding 
agency shall make payment within 30 days after receipt of the billing, 
unless the billing is improper.

[[Page 577]]

    (2) Recipients shall be authorized to submit request for 
reimbursement at least monthly when electronic funds transfers are not 
used.
    (f) If a recipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and 
the Federal awarding agency has determined that reimbursement is not 
feasible because the recipient lacks sufficient working capital, the 
Federal awarding agency may provide cash on a working capital advance 
basis. Under this procedure, the Federal awarding agency shall advance 
cash to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an 
initial period generally geared to the awardee's disbursing cycle. 
Thereafter, the Federal awarding agency shall reimburse the recipient 
for its actual cash disbursements. The working capital advance method of 
payment shall not be used for recipients unwilling or unable to provide 
timely advances to their subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual 
cash disbursements.
    (g) To the extent available, recipients shall disburse funds 
available from repayments to and interest earned on a revolving fund, 
program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries 
and interest earned on such funds before requesting additional cash 
payments.
    (h) Unless otherwise required by statute, Federal awarding agencies 
shall not withhold payments for proper charges made by recipients at any 
time during the project period unless paragraphs (h)(1) or (2) of this 
section apply.
    (1) A recipient has failed to comply with the project objectives, 
the terms and conditions of the award, or Federal reporting 
requirements.
    (2) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the 
United States as defined in OMB Circular A-129, ``Managing Federal 
Credit Programs.'' Under such conditions, the Federal awarding agency 
may, upon reasonable notice, inform the recipient that payments shall 
not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date until the 
conditions are corrected or the indebtedness to the Federal Government 
is liquidated.
    (i) Standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as 
depositories of funds advanced under awards are as follows:
    (1) Except for situations described in paragraph (i)(2), Federal 
awarding agencies shall not require separate depository accounts for 
funds provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility requirements 
for depositories for funds provided to a recipient. However, recipients 
must be able to account for the receipt, obligation and expenditure of 
funds.
    (2) Advances of Federal funds shall be deposited and maintained in 
insured accounts whenever possible.
    (j) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities 
for women-owned and minority-owned business enterprises, recipients 
shall be encouraged to use womenowned and minority-owned banks (a bank 
which is owned at least 50 percent by women or minority group members).
    (k) Recipients shall maintain advances of Federal funds in interest 
bearing accounts, unless paragraph (k)(1), (2) or (3) of this section 
apply.
    (1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per 
year.
    (2) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not 
be expected to earn interest in excess of $250 per year on Federal cash 
balances.
    (3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so 
high that it would not be feasible within the expected Federal and non-
Federal cash resources.
    (l) For those entities where CMIA and its implementing regulations 
do not apply, interest earned on Federal advances deposited in interest 
bearing accounts shall be remitted annually to Department of Health and 
Human Services, Payment Management System, P.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD 
20852. Interest amounts up to $250 per year may be retained by the 
recipient for administrative expense. State universities and hospitals 
shall comply with CMIA, as it pertains to interest. If an entity subject 
to CMIA uses its own funds to pay pre-award costs for discretionary 
awards without prior written approval from the Federal awarding agency, 
it waives its right to recover the interest under CMIA.
    (m) Except as noted elsewhere in this regulation, only the following 
forms

[[Page 578]]

shall be authorized for the recipients in requesting advances and 
reimbursements. Federal agencies shall not require more than an original 
and two copies of these forms.
    (1) SF-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. Each Federal 
awarding agency shall adopt the SF-270 as a standard form for all 
nonconstruction programs when electronic funds transfer or predetermined 
advance methods are not used. Federal awarding agencies, however, have 
the option of using this form for construction programs in lieu of the 
SF-271, ``Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction 
Programs.''
    (2) SF-271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for 
Construction Programs. Each Federal awarding agency shall adopt the SF-
271 as the standard form to be used for requesting reimbursement for 
construction programs. However, a Federal awarding agency may substitute 
the SF-270 when the Federal awarding agency determines that it provides 
adequate information to meet Federal needs.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.303  Cost sharing or matching.

    (a) All contributions, including cash and third party in-kind, shall 
be accepted as part of the recipient's cost sharing or matching when 
such contributions meet all of the following criteria.
    (1) Are verifiable from the recipient's records.
    (2) Are not included as contributions for any other federally-
assisted project or program.
    (3) Are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient 
accomplishment of project or program objectives.
    (4) Are allowable under the applicable cost principles.
    (5) Are not paid by the Federal Government under another award, 
except where authorized by Federal statute to be used for cost sharing 
or matching.
    (6) Are provided for in the approved budget when required by the 
Federal awarding agency.
    (7) Conform to other provisions of this regulation, as applicable.
    (b) Unrecovered indirect costs may be included as part of cost 
sharing or matching only with the prior approval of the Federal awarding 
agency.
    (c) Values for recipient contributions of services and property 
shall be established in accordance with the applicable cost principles. 
If a Federal awarding agency authorizes recipients to donate buildings 
or land for construction/facilities acquisition projects or long-term 
use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing or matching 
shall be the lesser of paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
    (1) The certified value of the remaining life of the property 
recorded in the recipient's accounting records at the time of donation.
    (2) The current fair market value. However, when there is sufficient 
justification, the Federal awarding agency may approve the use of the 
current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds 
the certified value at the time of donation to the project.
    (d) Volunteer services furnished by professional and technical 
personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor may be 
counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an integral and 
necessary part of an approved project or program. Rates for volunteer 
services shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the 
recipient's organization. In those instances in which the required 
skills are not found in the recipient organization, rates shall be 
consistent with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which 
the recipient competes for the kind of services involved. In either 
case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable 
may be included in the valuation.
    (e) When an employer other than the recipient furnishes the services 
of an employee, these services shall be valued at the employee's regular 
rate of pay (plus an amount of fringe benefits that are reasonable, 
allowable, and allocable, but exclusive of overhead costs), provided 
these services are in the same skill for which the employee is normally 
paid.
    (f) Donated supplies may include such items as expendable equipment, 
office supplies, laboratory supplies or workshop and classroom supplies. 
Value assessed to donated supplies included in the cost sharing or 
matching share shall be reasonable and shall not

[[Page 579]]

exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of the 
donation.
    (g) The method used for determining cost sharing or matching for 
donated equipment, buildings and land for which title passes to the 
recipient may differ according to the purpose of the award, if paragraph 
(g)(1) or (2) of this section apply.
    (1) If the purpose of the award is to assist the recipient in the 
acquisition of equipment, buildings or land, the total value of the 
donated property may be claimed as cost sharing or matching.
    (2) If the purpose of the award is to support activities that 
require the use of equipment, buildings or land, normally only 
depreciation or use charges for equipment and buildings may be made. 
However, the full value of equipment or other capital assets and fair 
rental charges for land may be allowed, provided that the Federal 
awarding agency has approved the charges.
    (h) The value of donated property shall be determined in accordance 
with the usual accounting policies of the recipient, with the following 
qualifications.
    (1) The value of donated land and buildings shall not exceed its 
fair market value at the time of donation to the recipient as 
established by an independent appraiser (e.g., certified real property 
appraiser or General Services Administration representative) and 
certified by a responsible official of the recipient.
    (2) The value of donated equipment shall not exceed the fair market 
value of equipment of the same age and condition at the time of 
donation.
    (3) The value of donated space shall not exceed the fair rental 
value of comparable space as established by an independent appraisal of 
comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the 
same locality.
    (4) The value of loaned equipment shall not exceed its fair rental 
value.
    (5) The following requirements pertain to the recipient's supporting 
records for in-kind contributions from third parties.
    (i) Volunteer services shall be documented and, to the extent 
feasible, supported by the same methods used by the recipient for its 
own employees.
    (ii) The basis for determining the valuation for personal service, 
material, equipment, buildings and land shall be documented.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.304  Program income.

    (a) Federal awarding agencies shall apply the standards set forth in 
this section in requiring recipient organizations to account for program 
income related to projects financed in whole or in part with Federal 
funds.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, program 
income earned during the project period shall be retained by the 
recipient and, in accordance with Federal awarding agency regulations or 
the terms and conditions of the award, shall be used in one or more of 
the ways listed in the following.
    (1) Added to funds committed to the project by the Federal awarding 
agency and recipient and used to further eligible project or program 
objectives.
    (2) Used to finance the non-Federal share of the project or program.
    (3) Deducted from the total project or program allowable cost in 
determining the net allowable costs on which the Federal share of costs 
is based.
    (c) When an agency authorizes the disposition of program income as 
described in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2), program income in excess of 
any limits stipulated shall be used in accordance with paragraph (b)(3).
    (d) In the event that the Federal awarding agency does not specify 
in its regulations or the terms and conditions of the award how program 
income is to be used, paragraph (b)(3) shall apply automatically to all 
projects or programs except research. For awards that support research, 
paragraph (b)(1) shall apply automatically unless the awarding agency 
indicates in the terms and conditions another alternative on the award 
or the recipient is subject to special award conditions, as indicated in 
Sec. 105-72.204.
    (e) Unless Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and 
conditions of the award provide otherwise, recipients shall have no 
obligation to the Federal Government regarding program income earned 
after the end of the project period.

[[Page 580]]

    (f) If authorized by Federal awarding agency regulations or the 
terms and conditions of the award, costs incident to the generation of 
program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program 
income, provided these costs have not been charged to the award.
    (g) Proceeds from the sale of property shall be handled in 
accordance with the requirements of the Property Standards (See Sec. 
105-72.400 through Sec. 105-72.407).
    (h) Unless Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and 
condition of the award provide otherwise, recipients shall have no 
obligation to the Federal Government with respect to program income 
earned from license fees and royalties for copyrighted material, 
patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions produced under 
an award. However, Patent and Trademark Amendments (35 U.S.C. 18) apply 
to inventions made under an experimental, developmental, or research 
award.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.305  Revision of budget and program plans.

    (a) The budget plan is the financial expression of the project or 
program as approved during the award process. It may include either the 
Federal and non-Federal share, or only the Federal share, depending upon 
Federal awarding agency requirements. It shall be related to performance 
for program evaluation purposes whenever appropriate.
    (b) Recipients are required to report deviations from budget and 
program plans, and request prior approvals for budget and program plan 
revisions, in accordance with this section.
    (c) For nonconstruction awards, recipients shall request prior 
approvals from Federal awarding agencies for one or more of the 
following program or budget related reasons.
    (1) Change in the scope or the objective of the project or program 
(even if there is no associated budget revision requiring prior written 
approval).
    (2) Change in a key person specified in the application or award 
document.
    (3) The absence for more than three months, or a 25 percent 
reduction in time devoted to the project, by the approved project 
director or principal investigator.
    (4) The need for additional Federal funding.
    (5) The transfer of amounts budgeted for indirect costs to absorb 
increases in direct costs, or vice versa, if approval is required by the 
Federal awarding agency.
    (6) The inclusion, unless waived by the Federal awarding agency, of 
costs that require prior approval in accordance with OMB Circular A-21, 
``Cost Principles for Institutions of Higher Education,'' OMB Circular 
A-122, ``Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations,'' or 45 CFR part 
74 appendix E, ``Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research 
and Development under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals,'' or 48 CFR 
part 31, ``Contract Cost Principles and Procedures,'' as applicable.
    (7) The transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (direct 
payment to trainees) to other categories of expense.
    (8) Unless described in the application and funded in the approved 
awards, the subaward, transfer or contracting out of any work under an 
award. This provision does not apply to the purchase of supplies, 
material, equipment or general support services.
    (d) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be 
imposed unless a deviation has been approved by OMB.
    (e) Except for requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(4) 
of this section, Federal awarding agencies are authorized, at their 
option, to waive cost-related and administrative prior written approvals 
required by this regulation and OMB Circulars A-21 and A-122. Such 
waivers may include authorizing recipients to do any one or more of the 
following.
    (1) Incur pre-award costs 90 calendar days prior to award or more 
than 90 calendar days with the prior approval of the Federal awarding 
agency. All pre-award costs are incurred at the recipient's risk (i.e., 
the Federal awarding agency is under no obligation to reimburse such 
costs if for any reason the recipient does not receive an award or if 
the award is less than anticipated and inadequate to cover such costs).

[[Page 581]]

    (2) Initiate a one-time extension of the expiration date of the 
award of up to 12 months unless one or more of the following conditions 
apply. For one-time extensions, the recipient must notify the Federal 
awarding agency in writing with the supporting reasons and revised 
expiration date at least 10 days before the expiration date specified in 
the award. This one-time extension may not be exercised merely for the 
purpose of using unobligated balances.
    (i) The terms and conditions of award prohibit the extension.
    (ii) The extension requires additional Federal funds.
    (iii) The extension involves any change in the approved objectives 
or scope of the project.
    (3) Carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent funding 
periods.
    (4) For awards that support research, unless the Federal awarding 
agency provides otherwise in the award or in the agency's regulations, 
the prior approval requirements described in paragraph (e) are 
automatically waived (i.e., recipients need not obtain such prior 
approvals) unless one of the conditions included in paragraph (e)(2) 
applies.
    (f) The Federal awarding agency may, at its option, restrict the 
transfer of funds among direct cost categories or programs, functions 
and activities for awards in which the Federal share of the project 
exceeds $100,000 and the cumulative amount of such transfers exceeds or 
is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget as last approved by 
the Federal awarding agency. No Federal awarding agency shall permit a 
transfer that would cause any Federal appropriation or part thereof to 
be used for purposes other than those consistent with the original 
intent of the appropriation.
    (g) All other changes to nonconstruction budgets, except for the 
changes described in paragraph (j), do not require prior approval.
    (h) For construction awards, recipients shall request prior written 
approval promptly from Federal awarding agencies for budget revisions 
whenever paragraphs (h)(1), (2) or (3) of this section apply.
    (1) The revision results from changes in the scope or the objective 
of the project or program.
    (2) The need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the 
project.
    (3) A revision is desired which involves specific costs for which 
prior written approval requirements may be imposed consistent with 
applicable OMB cost principles listed in Sec. 105-72.307.
    (i) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be 
imposed unless a deviation has been approved by OMB.
    (j) When a Federal awarding agency makes an award that provides 
support for both construction and nonconstruction work, the Federal 
awarding agency may require the recipient to request prior approval from 
the Federal awarding agency before making any fund or budget transfers 
between the two types of work supported.
    (k) For both construction and nonconstruction awards, Federal 
awarding agencies shall require recipients to notify the Federal 
awarding agency in writing promptly whenever the amount of Federal 
authorized funds is expected to exceed the needs of the recipient for 
the project period by more than $5000 or five percent of the Federal 
award, whichever is greater. This notification shall not be required if 
an application for additional funding is submitted for a continuation 
award.
    (l) When requesting approval for budget revisions, recipients shall 
use the budget forms that were used in the application unless the 
Federal awarding agency indicates a letter of request suffices.
    (m) Within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request 
for budget revisions, Federal awarding agencies shall review the request 
and notify the recipient whether the budget revisions have been 
approved. If the revision is still under consideration at the end of 30 
calendar days, the Federal awarding agency shall inform the recipient in 
writing of the date when the recipient may expect the decision.

Sec. 105-72.306  Non-Federal audits.

    (a) Recipients and subrecipients that are institutions of higher 
education or

[[Page 582]]

other non-profit organizations (including hospitals) shall be subject to 
the audit requirements contained in the Single Audit Act Amendments of 
1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507) and revised OMB Circular A-133, ``Audits of 
States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.''
    (b) State and local governments shall be subject to the audit 
requirements contained in the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 
U.S.C. 7501-7507) and revised OMB Circular A-133, ``Audits of States, 
Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.''
    (c) For-profit hospitals not covered by the audit provisions of 
revised OMB Circular A-133 shall be subject to the audit requirements of 
the Federal awarding agencies.
    (d) Commercial organizations shall be subject to the audit 
requirements of the Federal awarding agency or the prime recipient as 
incorporated into the award document.

<R05>
Sec. 105-72.307  Allowable costs.

    For each kind of recipient, there is a set of Federal principles for 
determining allowable costs. Allowability of costs shall be determined 
in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity 
incurring the costs. Thus, allowability of costs incurred by State, 
local or federally-recognized Indian tribal governments is determined in 
accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-87, ``Cost Principles 
for State and Local Governments.'' The allowability of costs incurred by 
non-profit organizations is determined in accordance with the provisions 
of OMB Circular A-122, ``Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations.'' 
The allowability of costs incurred by institutions of higher education 
is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21, 
``Cost Principles for Educational Institutions.'' The allowability of 
costs incurred by hospitals is determined in accordance with the 
provisions of appendix E of 45 CFR part 74, ``Principles for Determining 
Costs Applicable to Research and Development Under Grants and Contracts 
with Hospitals.'' The allowability of costs incurred by commercial 
organizations and those non-profit organizations listed in Attachment C 
to Circular A-122 is determined in accordance with the provisions of the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR part 31.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.308  Period of availability of funds.

    Where a funding period is specified, a recipient may charge to the 
grant only allowable costs resulting from obligations incurred during 
the funding period and any pre-award costs authorized by the Federal 
awarding agency.


<R04>
      Subpart 105	72.40_Post-Award Requirements/Property Standards


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.400  Purpose of property standards.

    Sections 105-72.401 through 105-72.407 set forth uniform standards 
governing management and disposition of property furnished by the 
Federal Government whose cost was charged to a project supported by a 
Federal award. Federal awarding agencies shall require recipients to 
observe these standards under awards and shall not impose additional 
requirements, unless specifically required by Federal statute. The 
recipient may use its own property management standards and procedures 
provided it observes the provisions of Sec. 105-72.401 through Sec. 
105-72.407.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.401  Insurance coverage.

    Recipients shall, at a minimum, provide the equivalent insurance 
coverage for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds as 
provided to property owned by the recipient. Federally-owned property 
need not be insured unless required by the terms and conditions of the 
award.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.402  Real property.

    Each Federal awarding agency shall prescribe requirements for 
recipients concerning the use and disposition of real property acquired 
in whole or in part under awards. Unless otherwise provided by statute, 
such requirements, at a minimum, shall contain the following.
    (a) Title to real property shall vest in the recipient subject to 
the condition that the recipient shall use the real property for the 
authorized purpose of

[[Page 583]]

the project as long as it is needed and shall not encumber the property 
without approval of the Federal awarding agency.
    (b) The recipient shall obtain written approval by the Federal 
awarding agency for the use of real property in other federally-
sponsored projects when the recipient determines that the property is no 
longer needed for the purpose of the original project. Use in other 
projects shall be limited to those under federally-sponsored projects 
(i.e., awards) or programs that have purposes consistent with those 
authorized for support by the Federal awarding agency.
    (c) When the real property is no longer needed as provided in 
paragraphs (a) and (b), the recipient shall request disposition 
instructions from the Federal awarding agency or its successor Federal 
awarding agency. The Federal awarding agency shall observe one or more 
of the following disposition instructions.
    (1) The recipient may be permitted to retain title without further 
obligation to the Federal Government after it compensates the Federal 
Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the 
property attributable to the Federal participation in the project.
    (2) The recipient may be directed to sell the property under 
guidelines provided by the Federal awarding agency and pay the Federal 
Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the 
property attributable to the Federal participation in the project (after 
deducting actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any, 
from the sales proceeds). When the recipient is authorized or required 
to sell the property, proper sales procedures shall be established that 
provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the 
highest possible return.
    (3) The recipient may be directed to transfer title to the property 
to the Federal Government or to an eligible third party provided that, 
in such cases, the recipient shall be entitled to compensation for its 
attributable percentage of the current fair market value of the 
property.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.403  Federally-owned and exempt property.

    (a) Federally-owned property. (1) Title to federally-owned property 
remains vested in the Federal Government. Recipients shall submit 
annually an inventory listing of federally-owned property in their 
custody to the Federal awarding agency. Upon completion of the award or 
when the property is no longer needed, the recipient shall report the 
property to the Federal awarding agency for further Federal agency 
utilization.
    (2) If the Federal awarding agency has no further need for the 
property, it shall be declared excess and reported to the General 
Services Administration, unless the Federal awarding agency has 
statutory authority to dispose of the property by alternative methods 
(e.g., the authority provided by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 
U.S.C. 3710 (I)) to donate research equipment to educational and non-
profit organizations in accordance with E.O. 12821, ``Improving 
Mathematics and Science Education in Support of the National Education 
Goals.'') Appropriate instructions shall be issued to the recipient by 
the Federal awarding agency.
    (b) Exempt property. When statutory authority exists, the Federal 
awarding agency has the option to vest title to property acquired with 
Federal funds in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal 
Government and under conditions the Federal awarding agency considers 
appropriate. Such property is ``exempt property.'' Should a Federal 
awarding agency not establish conditions, title to exempt property upon 
acquisition shall vest in the recipient without further obligation to 
the Federal Government.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.404  Equipment.

    (a) Title to equipment acquired by a recipient with Federal funds 
shall vest in the recipient, subject to conditions of this section.
    (b) The recipient shall not use equipment acquired with Federal 
funds to provide services to non-Federal outside organizations for a fee 
that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, 
unless specifically authorized by Federal statute, for as long

[[Page 584]]

as the Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment.
    (c) The recipient shall use the equipment in the project or program 
for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project 
or program continues to be supported by Federal funds and shall not 
encumber the property without approval of the Federal awarding agency. 
When no longer needed for the original project or program, the recipient 
shall use the equipment in connection with its other federally-sponsored 
activities, in the following order of priority:
    (1) Activities sponsored by the Federal awarding agency which funded 
the original project, then
    (2) Activities sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies.
    (d) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program 
for which it was acquired, the recipient shall make it available for use 
on other projects or programs if such other use will not interfere with 
the work on the project or program for which the equipment was 
originally acquired. First preference for such other use shall be given 
to other projects or programs sponsored by the Federal awarding agency 
that financed the equipment; second preference shall be given to 
projects or programs sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. If 
the equipment is owned by the Federal Government, use on other 
activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible 
if authorized by the Federal awarding agency. User charges shall be 
treated as program income.
    (e) When acquiring replacement equipment, the recipient may use the 
equipment to be replaced as trade-in or sell the equipment and use the 
proceeds to offset the costs of the replacement equipment subject to the 
approval of the Federal awarding agency.
    (f) The recipient's property management standards for equipment 
acquired with Federal funds and federally-owned equipment shall include 
all of the following.
    (1) Equipment records shall be maintained accurately and shall 
include the following information.
    (i) A description of the equipment.
    (ii) Manufacturer's serial number, model number, Federal stock 
number, national stock number, or other identification number.
    (iii) Source of the equipment, including the award number.
    (iv) Whether title vests in the recipient or the Federal Government.
    (v) Acquisition date (or date received, if the equipment was 
furnished by the Federal Government) and cost.
    (vi) Information from which one can calculate the percentage of 
Federal participation in the cost of the equipment (not applicable to 
equipment furnished by the Federal Government).
    (vii) Location and condition of the equipment and the date the 
information was reported.
    (viii) Unit acquisition cost.
    (ix) Ultimate disposition data, including date of disposal and sales 
price or the method used to determine current fair market value where a 
recipient compensates the Federal awarding agency for its share.
    (2) Equipment owned by the Federal Government shall be identified to 
indicate Federal ownership.
    (3) A physical inventory of equipment shall be taken and the results 
reconciled with the equipment records at least once every two years. Any 
differences between quantities determined by the physical inspection and 
those shown in the accounting records shall be investigated to determine 
the causes of the difference. The recipient shall, in connection with 
the inventory, verify the existence, current utilization, and continued 
need for the equipment.
    (4) A control system shall be in effect to insure adequate 
safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the equipment. Any loss, 
damage, or theft of equipment shall be investigated and fully 
documented; if the equipment was owned by the Federal Government, the 
recipient shall promptly notify the Federal awarding agency.
    (5) Adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented to keep the 
equipment in good condition.
    (6) Where the recipient is authorized or required to sell the 
equipment, proper sales procedures shall be established which provide 
for competition to the

[[Page 585]]

extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.
    (g) When the recipient no longer needs the equipment, the equipment 
may be used for other activities in accordance with the following 
standards. For equipment with a current per unit fair market value of 
$5000 or more, the recipient may retain the equipment for other uses 
provided that compensation is made to the original Federal awarding 
agency or its successor. The amount of compensation shall be computed by 
applying the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the 
original project or program to the current fair market value of the 
equipment. If the recipient has no need for the equipment, the recipient 
shall request disposition instructions from the Federal awarding agency. 
The Federal awarding agency shall determine whether the equipment can be 
used to meet the agency's requirements. If no requirement exists within 
that agency, the availability of the equipment shall be reported to the 
General Services Administration by the Federal awarding agency to 
determine whether a requirement for the equipment exists in other 
Federal agencies. The Federal awarding agency shall issue instructions 
to the recipient no later than 120 calendar days after the recipient's 
request and the following procedures shall govern.
    (1) If so instructed or if disposition instructions are not issued 
within 120 calendar days after the recipient's request, the recipient 
shall sell the equipment and reimburse the Federal awarding agency an 
amount computed by applying to the sales proceeds the percentage of 
Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program. 
However, the recipient shall be permitted to deduct and retain from the 
Federal share $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less, 
for the recipient's selling and handling expenses.
    (2) If the recipient is instructed to ship the equipment elsewhere, 
the recipient shall be reimbursed by the Federal Government by an amount 
which is computed by applying the percentage of the recipient's 
participation in the cost of the original project or program to the 
current fair market value of the equipment, plus any reasonable shipping 
or interim storage costs incurred.
    (3) If the recipient is instructed to otherwise dispose of the 
equipment, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the Federal awarding 
agency for such costs incurred in its disposition.
    (4) The Federal awarding agency may reserve the right to transfer 
the title to the Federal Government or to a third party named by the 
Federal Government when such third party is otherwise eligible under 
existing statutes. Such transfer shall be subject to the following 
standards.
    (i) The equipment shall be appropriately identified in the award or 
otherwise made known to the recipient in writing.
    (ii) The Federal awarding agency shall issue disposition 
instructions within 120 calendar days after receipt of a final 
inventory. The final inventory shall list all equipment acquired with 
grant funds and federally-owned equipment. If the Federal awarding 
agency fails to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar 
day period, the recipient shall apply the standards of this section, as 
appropriate.
    (iii) When the Federal awarding agency exercises its right to take 
title, the equipment shall be subject to the provisions for federally-
owned equipment.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.405  Supplies and other expendable property.

    (a) Title to supplies and other expendable property shall vest in 
the recipient upon acquisition. If there is a residual inventory of 
unused supplies exceeding $5000 in total aggregate value upon 
termination or completion of the project or program and the supplies are 
not needed for any other federally-sponsored project or program, the 
recipient shall retain the supplies for use on non-Federal sponsored 
activities or sell them, but shall, in either case, compensate the 
Federal Government for its share. The amount of compensation shall be 
computed in the same manner as for equipment.
    (b) The recipient shall not use supplies acquired with Federal funds 
to provide services to non-Federal outside organizations for a fee that 
is less than

[[Page 586]]

private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically 
authorized by Federal statute as long as the Federal Government retains 
an interest in the supplies.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.406  Intangible property.

    (a) The recipient may copyright any work that is subject to 
copyright and was developed, or for which ownership was purchased, under 
an award. The Federal awarding agency(ies) reserve a royalty-free, 
nonexclusive and irrevocable right to reproduce, publish, or otherwise 
use the work for Federal purposes, and to authorize others to do so.
    (b) Recipients are subject to applicable regulations governing 
patents and inventions, including governmentwide regulations issued by 
the Department of Commerce at 37 CFR part 401, ``Rights to Inventions 
Made by Nonprofit Organizations and Small Business Firms Under 
Government Grants, Contracts and Cooperative Agreements.''
    (c) Unless waived by the Federal awarding agency, the Federal 
Government has the right to paragraph (c)(1) and (2) of this section.
    (1) Obtain, reproduce, publish or otherwise use the data first 
produced under an award.
    (2) Authorize others to receive, reproduce, publish, or otherwise 
use such data for Federal purposes.
    (d) Title to intangible property and debt instruments acquired under 
an award or subaward vests upon acquisition in the recipient. The 
recipient shall use that property for the originally-authorized purpose, 
and the recipient shall not encumber the property without approval of 
the Federal awarding agency. When no longer needed for the originally 
authorized purpose, disposition of the intangible property shall occur 
in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 105-72.404(g).


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.407  Property trust relationship.

    Real property, equipment, intangible property and debt instruments 
that are acquired or improved with Federal funds shall be held in trust 
by the recipient as trustee for the beneficiaries of the project or 
program under which the property was acquired or improved. Agencies may 
require recipients to record liens or other appropriate notices of 
record to indicate that personal or real property has been acquired or 
improved with Federal funds and that use and disposition conditions 
apply to the property.


<R04>
     Subpart 105	72.50_Post-Award Requirements/Procurement Standards


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.500  Purpose of procurement standards.

    Sections 105-72.501 through 105-72.508 set forth standards for use 
by recipients in establishing procedures for the procurement of supplies 
and other expendable property, equipment, real property and other 
services with Federal funds. These standards are furnished to ensure 
that such materials and services are obtained in an effective manner and 
in compliance with the provisions of applicable Federal statutes and 
executive orders. No additional procurement standards or requirements 
shall be imposed by the Federal awarding agencies upon recipients, 
unless specifically required by Federal statute or executive order or 
approved by OMB.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.501  Recipient responsibilities.

    The standards contained in this section do not relieve the recipient 
of the contractual responsibilities arising under its contract(s). The 
recipient is the responsible authority, without recourse to the Federal 
awarding agency, regarding the settlement and satisfaction of all 
contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements 
entered into in support of an award or other agreement. This includes 
disputes, claims, protests of award, source evaluation or other matters 
of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of statute are to 
be referred to such Federal, State or local authority as may have proper 
jurisdiction.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.502  Codes of conduct.

    The recipient shall maintain written standards of conduct governing 
the performance of its employees engaged in the award and administration 
of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent shall participate in the 
selection,

[[Page 587]]

award, or administration of a contract supported by Federal funds if a 
real or apparent conflict of interest would be involved. Such a conflict 
would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or 
her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization which 
employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a 
financial or other interest in the firm selected for an award. The 
officers, employees, and agents of the recipient shall neither solicit 
nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from 
contractors, or parties to subagreements. However, recipients may set 
standards for situations in which the financial interest is not 
substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The 
standards of conduct shall provide for disciplinary actions to be 
applied for violations of such standards by officers, employees, or 
agents of the recipient.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.503  Competition.

    All procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner to 
provide, to the maximum extent practical, open and free competition. The 
recipient shall be alert to organizational conflicts of interest as well 
as noncompetitive practices among contractors that may restrict or 
eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. In order to ensure 
objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive 
advantage, contractors that develop or draft specifications, 
requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids and/or requests 
for proposals shall be excluded from competing for such procurements. 
Awards shall be made to the bidder or offeror whose bid or offer is 
responsive to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the 
recipient, price, quality and other factors considered. Solicitations 
shall clearly set forth all requirements that the bidder or offeror 
shall fulfill in order for the bid or offer to be evaluated by the 
recipient. Any and all bids or offers may be rejected when it is in the 
recipient's interest to do so.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.504  Procurement procedures.

    (a) All recipients shall establish written procurement procedures. 
These procedures shall provide for, at a minimum, that paragraphs 
(a)(1), (2) and (3) of this section apply.
    (1) Recipients avoid purchasing unnecessary items.
    (2) Where appropriate, an analysis is made of lease and purchase 
alternatives to determine which would be the most economical and 
practical procurement for the Federal Government.
    (3) Solicitations for goods and services provide for all of the 
following.
    (i) A clear and accurate description of the technical requirements 
for the material, product or service to be procured. In competitive 
procurements, such a description shall not contain features which unduly 
restrict competition.
    (ii) Requirements which the bidder/offeror must fulfill and all 
other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.
    (iii) A description, whenever practicable, of technical requirements 
in terms of functions to be performed or performance required, including 
the range of acceptable characteristics or minimum acceptable standards.
    (iv) The specific features of ``brand name or equal'' descriptions 
that bidders are required to meet when such items are included in the 
solicitation.
    (v) The acceptance, to the extent practicable and economically 
feasible, of products and services dimensioned in the metric system of 
measurement.
    (vi) Preference, to the extent practicable and economically 
feasible, for products and services that conserve natural resources and 
protect the environment and are energy efficient.
    (b) Positive efforts shall be made by recipients to utilize small 
businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises, 
whenever possible. Recipients of Federal awards shall take all of the 
following steps to further this goal.
    (1) Ensure that small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's 
business enterprises are used to the fullest extent practicable.
    (2) Make information on forthcoming opportunities available and 
arrange timeframes for purchases and contracts to encourage and 
facilitate participation by small businesses, minority-

[[Page 588]]

owned firms, and women's business enterprises.
    (3) Consider in the contract process whether firms competing for 
larger contracts intend to subcontract with small businesses, minority-
owned firms, and women's business enterprises.
    (4) Encourage contracting with consortiums of small businesses, 
minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises when a contract is 
too large for one of these firms to handle individually.
    (5) Use the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such 
organizations as the Small Business Administration and the Department of 
Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency in the solicitation and 
utilization of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's 
business enterprises.
    (c) The type of procuring instruments used (e.g., fixed price 
contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, purchase orders, and incentive 
contracts) shall be determined by the recipient but shall be appropriate 
for the particular procurement and for promoting the best interest of 
the program or project involved. The ``cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost'' 
or ``percentage of construction cost'' methods of contracting shall not 
be used.
    (d) Contracts shall be made only with responsible contractors who 
possess the potential ability to perform successfully under the terms 
and conditions of the proposed procurement. Consideration shall be given 
to such matters as contractor integrity, record of past performance, 
financial and technical resources or accessibility to other necessary 
resources. In certain circumstances, contracts with certain parties are 
restricted by agencies' implementation of E.O.s 12549 and 12689, 
``Debarment and Suspension.''
    (e) Recipients shall, on request, make available for the Federal 
awarding agency, pre-award review and procurement documents, such as 
request for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost 
estimates, etc., when any of the following conditions apply.
    (1) A recipient's procurement procedures or operation fails to 
comply with the procurement standards in the Federal awarding agency's 
implementation of this regulation.
    (2) The procurement is expected to exceed the small purchase 
threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403 (11) (currently $25,000) and is to be 
awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in 
response to a solicitation.
    (3) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the small purchase 
threshold, specifies a ``brand name'' product.
    (4) The proposed award over the small purchase threshold is to be 
awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under a sealed bid 
procurement.
    (5) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract 
or increases the contract amount by more than the amount of the small 
purchase threshold.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.505  Cost and price analysis.

    Some form of cost or price analysis shall be made and documented in 
the procurement files in connection with every procurement action. Price 
analysis may be accomplished in various ways, including the comparison 
of price quotations submitted, market prices and similar indicia, 
together with discounts. Cost analysis is the review and evaluation of 
each element of cost to determine reasonableness, allocability and 
allowability.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.506  Procurement records.

    Procurement records and files for purchases in excess of the small 
purchase threshold shall include the following at a minimum:
    (a) Basis for contractor selection,
    (b) Justification for lack of competition when competitive bids or 
offers are not obtained, and
    (c) Basis for award cost or price.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.507  Contract administration.

    A system for contract administration shall be maintained to ensure 
contractor conformance with the terms, conditions and specifications of 
the contract and to ensure adequate and timely follow up of all 
purchases. Recipients shall evaluate contractor performance and 
document, as appropriate, whether contractors have met

[[Page 589]]

the terms, conditions and specifications of the contract.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.508  Contract provisions.

    The recipient shall include, in addition to provisions to define a 
sound and complete agreement, the following provisions in all contracts. 
The following provisions shall also be applied to subcontracts.
    (a) Contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall 
contain contractual provisions or conditions that allow for 
administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances in which a 
contractor violates or breaches the contract terms, and provide for such 
remedial actions as may be appropriate.
    (b) All contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall 
contain suitable provisions for termination by the recipient, including 
the manner by which termination shall be effected and the basis for 
settlement. In addition, such contracts shall describe conditions under 
which the contract may be terminated for default as well as conditions 
where the contract may be terminated because of circumstances beyond the 
control of the contractor.
    (c) Except as otherwise required by statute, an award that requires 
the contracting (or subcontracting) for construction or facility 
improvements shall provide for the recipient to follow its own 
requirements relating to bid guarantees, performance bonds, and payment 
bonds unless the construction contract or subcontract exceeds $100,000. 
For those contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000, the Federal 
awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the 
recipient, provided the Federal awarding agency has made a determination 
that the Federal Government's interest is adequately protected. If such 
a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements shall be as 
follows.
    (1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of 
the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist of a firm commitment 
such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument 
accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder shall, upon acceptance 
of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within 
the time specified.
    (2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent 
of the contract price. A ``performance bond'' is one executed in 
connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's 
obligations under such contract.
    (3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of 
the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed in connection 
with a contract to assure payment as required by statute of all persons 
supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for 
in the contract.
    (4) Where bonds are required in the situations described herein, the 
bonds shall be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority 
as acceptable sureties pursuant to 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety Companies 
Doing Business with the United States.''
    (d) All negotiated contracts (except those for less than the small 
purchase threshold) awarded by recipients shall include a provision to 
the effect that the recipient, the Federal awarding agency, the 
Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly 
authorized representatives, shall have access to any books, documents, 
papers and records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to a 
specific program for the purpose of making audits, examinations, 
excerpts and transcriptions.
    (e) All contracts, including small purchases, awarded by recipients 
and their contractors shall contain the procurement provisions of 
appendix A to this part, as applicable.


<R04>
      Subpart 105	72.60_Post-Award Requirements/Reports and Records


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.600  Purpose of reports and records.

    Sections 105-72.601 through 105-72.603 set forth the procedures for 
monitoring and reporting on the recipient's financial and program 
performance and the necessary standard reporting forms. They also set 
forth record retention requirements.

[[Page 590]]


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.601  Monitoring and reporting program performance.

    (a) Recipients are responsible for managing and monitoring each 
project, program, subaward, function or activity supported by the award. 
Recipients shall monitor subawards to ensure subrecipients have met the 
audit requirements as delineated in Sec. 105-72.306.
    (b) The Federal awarding agency shall prescribe the frequency with 
which the performance reports shall be submitted. Except as provided in 
paragraph (f) of this section, performance reports shall not be required 
more frequently than quarterly or, less frequently than annually. Annual 
reports shall be due 90 calendar days after the grant year; quarterly or 
semiannual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. The 
Federal awarding agency may require annual reports before the 
anniversary dates of multiple year awards in lieu of these requirements. 
The final performance reports are due 90 calendar days after the 
expiration or termination of the award.
    (c) If inappropriate, a final technical or performance report shall 
not be required after completion of the project.
    (d) When required, performance reports shall generally contain, for 
each award, brief information on each of the following.
    (1) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals and 
objectives established for the period, the findings of the investigator, 
or both. Whenever appropriate and the output of programs or projects can 
be readily quantified, such quantitative data should be related to cost 
data for computation of unit costs.
    (2) Reasons why established goals were not met, if appropriate.
    (3) Other pertinent information including, when appropriate, 
analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.
    (e) Recipients shall not be required to submit more than the 
original and two copies of performance reports.
    (f) Recipients shall immediately notify the Federal awarding agency 
of developments that have a significant impact on the award-supported 
activities. Also, notification shall be given in the case of problems, 
delays, or adverse conditions which materially impair the ability to 
meet the objectives of the award. This notification shall include a 
statement of the action taken or contemplated, and any assistance needed 
to resolve the situation.
    (g) Federal awarding agencies may make site visits, as needed.
    (h) Federal awarding agencies shall comply with clearance 
requirements of 5 CFR part 1320 when requesting performance data from 
recipients.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.602  Financial reporting.

    (a) The following forms or such other forms as may be approved by 
OMB are authorized for obtaining financial information from recipients.
    (1) SF-269 or SF-269A, Financial Status Report. (i) Each Federal 
awarding agency shall require recipients to use the SF-269 or SF-269A to 
report the status of funds for all nonconstruction projects or programs. 
A Federal awarding agency may, however, have the option of not requiring 
the SF-269 or SF-269A when the SF-270, Request for Advance or 
Reimbursement, or SF-272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions, is 
determined to provide adequate information to meet its needs, except 
that a final SF-269 or SF-269A shall be required at the completion of 
the project when the SF-270 is used only for advances.
    (ii) The Federal awarding agency shall prescribe whether the report 
shall be on a cash or accrual basis. If the Federal awarding agency 
requires accrual information and the recipient's accounting records are 
not normally kept on the accrual basis, the recipient shall not be 
required to convert its accounting system, but shall develop such 
accrual information through best estimates based on an analysis of the 
documentation on hand.
    (iii) The Federal awarding agency shall determine the frequency of 
the Financial Status Report for each project or program, considering the 
size and complexity of the particular project or program. However, the 
report shall not be required more frequently than quarterly or less 
frequently than annually. A final report shall be required at the 
completion of the agreement.
    (iv) The Federal awarding agency shall require recipients to submit 
the

[[Page 591]]

SF-269 or SF-269A (an original and no more than two copies) no later 
than 30 days after the end of each specified reporting period for 
quarterly and semiannual reports, and 90 calendar days for annual and 
final reports. Extensions of reporting due dates may be approved by the 
Federal awarding agency upon request of the recipient.
    (2) SF-272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions. (i) When funds are 
advanced to recipients the Federal awarding agency shall require each 
recipient to submit the SF-272 and, when necessary, its continuation 
sheet, SF-272a. The Federal awarding agency shall use this report to 
monitor cash advanced to recipients and to obtain disbursement 
information for each agreement with the recipients.
    (ii) Federal awarding agencies may require forecasts of Federal cash 
requirements in the ``Remarks'' section of the report.
    (iii) When practical and deemed necessary, Federal awarding agencies 
may require recipients to report in the ``Remarks'' section the amount 
of cash advances received in excess of three days. Recipients shall 
provide short narrative explanations of actions taken to reduce the 
excess balances.
    (iv) Recipients shall be required to submit not more than the 
original and two copies of the SF-272, 15 calendar days following the 
end of each quarter. The Federal awarding agencies may require a monthly 
report from those recipients receiving advances totaling $1 million or 
more per year.
    (v) Federal awarding agencies may waive the requirement for 
submission of the SF-272 for any one of the following reasons:
    (A) When monthly advances do not exceed $25,000 per recipient, 
provided that such advances are monitored through other forms contained 
in this section;
    (B) If, in the Federal awarding agency's opinion, the recipient's 
accounting controls are adequate to minimize excessive Federal advances; 
or,
    (C) When the electronic payment mechanisms provide adequate data.
    (b) When the Federal awarding agency needs additional information or 
more frequent reports, the following shall be observed.
    (1) When additional information is needed to comply with legislative 
requirements, Federal awarding agencies shall issue instructions to 
require recipients to submit such information under the ``Remarks'' 
section of the reports.
    (2) When a Federal awarding agency determines that a recipient's 
accounting system does not meet the standards in Sec. 105-72.301, 
additional pertinent information to further monitor awards may be 
obtained upon written notice to the recipient until such time as the 
system is brought up to standard. The Federal awarding agency, in 
obtaining this information, shall comply with report clearance 
requirements of 5 CFR part 1320.
    (3) Federal awarding agencies are encouraged to shade out any line 
item on any report if not necessary.
    (4) Federal awarding agencies may accept the identical information 
from the recipients in machine readable format or computer printouts or 
electronic outputs in lieu of prescribed formats.
    (5) Federal awarding agencies may provide computer or electronic 
outputs to recipients when such expedites or contributes to the accuracy 
of reporting.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.603  Retention and access requirements for records.

    (a) This section sets forth requirements for record retention and 
access to records for awards to recipients. Federal awarding agencies 
shall not impose any other record retention or access requirements upon 
recipients.
    (b) Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, 
and all other records pertinent to an award shall be retained for a 
period of three years from the date of submission of the final 
expenditure report or, for awards that are renewed quarterly or 
annually, from the date of the submission of the quarterly or annual 
financial report, as authorized by the Federal awarding agency. The only 
exceptions are the following.
    (1) If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the 
expiration of the 3-year period, the records shall be retained until all 
litigation, claims or audit findings involving the records

[[Page 592]]

have been resolved and final action taken.
    (2) Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal 
funds shall be retained for 3 years after final disposition.
    (3) When records are transferred to or maintained by the Federal 
awarding agency, the 3-year retention requirement is not applicable to 
the recipient.
    (4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc., as 
specified in paragraph (g) of this section.
    (c) Copies of original records may be substituted for the original 
records if authorized by the Federal awarding agency.
    (d) The Federal awarding agency shall request transfer of certain 
records to its custody from recipients when it determines that the 
records possess long term retention value. However, in order to avoid 
duplicate recordkeeping, a Federal awarding agency may make arrangements 
for recipients to retain any records that are continuously needed for 
joint use.
    (e) The Federal awarding agency, the Inspector General, Comptroller 
General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized 
representatives, have the right of timely and unrestricted access to any 
books, documents, papers, or other records of recipients that are 
pertinent to the awards, in order to make audits, examinations, 
excerpts, transcripts and copies of such documents. This right also 
includes timely and reasonable access to a recipient's personnel for the 
purpose of interview and discussion related to such documents. The 
rights of access in this paragraph are not limited to the required 
retention period, but shall last as long as records are retained.
    (f) Unless required by statute, no Federal awarding agency shall 
place restrictions on recipients that limit public access to the records 
of recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when the Federal 
awarding agency can demonstrate that such records shall be kept 
confidential and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to 
the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if the records had 
belonged to the Federal awarding agency.
    (g) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. 
Paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) apply to the following types of documents, 
and their supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or 
proposals, cost allocation plans, and any similar accounting 
computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is 
chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe 
benefit rates).
    (1) If submitted for negotiation. If the recipient submits to the 
Federal awarding agency or the subrecipient submits to the recipient the 
proposal, plan, or other computation to form the basis for negotiation 
of the rate, then the 3-year retention period for its supporting records 
starts on the date of such submission.
    (2) If not submitted for negotiation. If the recipient is not 
required to submit to the Federal awarding agency or the subrecipient is 
not required to submit to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other 
computation for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year retention period 
for the proposal, plan, or other computation and its supporting records 
starts at the end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) 
covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.


<R04>
  Subpart 105	72.70_Post-Award Requirements/Termination and Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.700  Purpose of termination and enforcement.

    Section 105-72.701 and Sec. 105-72.702 set forth uniform 
suspension, termination and enforcement procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.701  Termination.

    (a) Awards may be terminated in whole or in part only if paragraph 
(a)(1), (2) or (3) of this section apply.
    (1) By the Federal awarding agency, if a recipient materially fails 
to comply with the terms and conditions of an award.
    (2) By the Federal awarding agency with the consent of the 
recipient, in which case the two parties shall agree upon the 
termination conditions, including the effective date and, in the

[[Page 593]]

case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated.
    (3) By the recipient upon sending to the Federal awarding agency 
written notification setting forth the reasons for such termination, the 
effective date, and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to 
be terminated. However, if the Federal awarding agency determines in the 
case of partial termination that the reduced or modified portion of the 
grant will not accomplish the purposes for which the grant was made, it 
may terminate the grant in its entirety under either paragraphs (a) (1) 
or (2).
    (b) If costs are allowed under an award, the responsibilities of the 
recipient referred to in Sec. 105-72.801(a), including those for 
property management as applicable, shall be considered in the 
termination of the award, and provision shall be made for continuing 
responsibilities of the recipient after termination, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.702  Enforcement.

    (a) Remedies for noncompliance. If a recipient materially fails to 
comply with the terms and conditions of an award, whether stated in a 
Federal statute, regulation, assurance, application, or notice of award, 
the Federal awarding agency may, in addition to imposing any of the 
special conditions outlined in Sec. 105-72.204, take one or more of the 
following actions, as appropriate in the circumstances.
    (1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the 
deficiency by the recipient or more severe enforcement action by the 
Federal awarding agency.
    (2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable 
matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action 
not in compliance.
    (3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award.
    (4) Withhold further awards for the project or program.
    (5) Take other remedies that may be legally available.
    (b) Hearings and appeals. In taking an enforcement action, the 
awarding agency shall provide the recipient an opportunity for hearing, 
appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the recipient is 
entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the action 
involved.
    (c) Effects of suspension and termination. Costs of a recipient 
resulting from obligations incurred by the recipient during a suspension 
or after termination of an award are not allowable unless the awarding 
agency expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or 
termination or subsequently. Other recipient costs during suspension or 
after termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are 
allowable if paragraph (c) (1) and (2) of this section apply.
    (1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred 
by the recipient before the effective date of suspension or termination, 
are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are 
noncancellable.
    (2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or 
expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the 
termination takes effect.
    (d) Relationship to debarment and suspension. The enforcement 
remedies identified in this section, including suspension and 
termination, do not preclude a recipient from being subject to debarment 
and suspension under E.O.s 12549 and 12689 and the Federal awarding 
agency implementing regulations (see Sec. 105-72.203).


<R04>
             Subpart 105	72.80_After-the-Award Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.800  Purpose.

    Sections 105-72.801 through 105-72.803 contain closeout procedures 
and other procedures for subsequent disallowances and adjustments.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.801  Closeout procedures.

    (a) Recipients shall submit, within 90 calendar days after the date 
of completion of the award, all financial, performance, and other 
reports as required by the terms and conditions of the award. The 
Federal awarding agency may approve extensions when requested by the 
recipient.
    (b) Unless the Federal awarding agency authorizes an extension, a 
recipient shall liquidate all obligations incurred under the award not 
later than 90 calendar days after the funding period or

[[Page 594]]

the date of completion as specified in the terms and conditions of the 
award or in agency implementing instructions.
    (c) The Federal awarding agency shall make prompt payments to a 
recipient for allowable reimbursable costs under the award being closed 
out.
    (d) The recipient shall promptly refund any balances of unobligated 
cash that the Federal awarding agency has advanced or paid and that is 
not authorized to be retained by the recipient for use in other 
projects. OMB Circular A-129 governs unreturned amounts that become 
delinquent debts.
    (e) When authorized by the terms and conditions of the award, the 
Federal awarding agency shall make a settlement for any upward or 
downward adjustments to the Federal share of costs after closeout 
reports are received.
    (f) The recipient shall account for any real and personal property 
acquired with Federal funds or received from the Federal Government in 
accordance with Sec. 105-72.401 through Sec. 105-72.407.
    (g) In the event a final audit has not been performed prior to the 
closeout of an award, the Federal awarding agency shall retain the right 
to recover an appropriate amount after fully considering the 
recommendations on disallowed costs resulting from the final audit.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.802  Subsequent adjustments and continuing responsibilities.

    (a) The closeout of an award does not affect any of the following.
    (1) The right of the Federal awarding agency to disallow costs and 
recover funds on the basis of a later audit or other review.
    (2) The obligation of the recipient to return any funds due as a 
result of later refunds, corrections, or other transactions.
    (3) Audit requirements in Sec. 105-72.306.
    (4) Property management requirements in Sec. 105-72.401 through 
Sec. 105-72.407.
    (5) Records retention as required in Sec. 105-72.603.
    (b) After closeout of an award, a relationship created under an 
award may be modified or ended in whole or in part with the consent of 
the Federal awarding agency and the recipient, provided the 
responsibilities of the recipient referred to in Sec. 105-72.803(a), 
including those for property management as applicable, are considered 
and provisions made for continuing responsibilities of the recipient, as 
appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.803  Collection of amounts due.

    (a) Any funds paid to a recipient in excess of the amount to which 
the recipient is finally determined to be entitled under the terms and 
conditions of the award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. If 
not paid within a reasonable period after the demand for payment, the 
Federal awarding agency may reduce the debt by paragraph (a) (1), (2) or 
(3) of this section.
    (1) Making an administrative offset against other requests for 
reimbursements.
    (2) Withholding advance payments otherwise due to the recipient.
    (3) Taking other action permitted by statute.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided by law, the Federal awarding agency 
shall charge interest on an overdue debt in accordance with 4 CFR 
Chapter II, Federal Claims Collection Standards.

             Appendix A to Part 105-72--Contract Provisions

    All contracts, awarded by a recipient including small purchases, 
shall contain the following provisions as applicable:
    1. Equal Employment Opportunity--All contracts shall contain a 
provision requiring compliance with E.O. 11246, ``Equal Employment 
Opportunity,'' as amended by E.O. 11375, ``Amending Executive Order 
11246 Relating to Equal Employment Opportunity,'' and as supplemented by 
regulations at 41 CFR part 60, ``Office of Federal Contract Compliance 
Programs, Equal Employment Opportunity, Department of Labor.''
    2. Copeland ``Anti-Kickback'' Act (18 U.S.C. 874 and 40 U.S.C. 
276c)--All contracts and subgrants in excess of $2000 for construction 
or repair awarded by recipients and subrecipients shall include a 
provision for compliance with the Copeland ``Anti-Kickback'' Act (18 
U.S.C. 874), as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR 
part 3, ``Contractors and Subcontractors on Public Building or Public 
Work Financed in Whole or in Part by Loans or Grants from the United 
States''). The Act provides that each contractor or subrecipient shall 
be prohibited from inducing, by any means, any person

[[Page 595]]

employed in the construction, completion, or repair of public work, to 
give up any part of the compensation to which he is otherwise entitled. 
The recipient shall report all suspected or reported violations to the 
Federal awarding agency.
    3. Davis-Bacon Act, as amended (40 U.S.C. 276a to a-7)--When 
required by Federal program legislation, all construction contracts 
awarded by the recipients and subrecipients of more than $2000 shall 
include a provision for compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 
276a to a-7) and as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 
CFR part 5, ``Labor Standards Provisions Applicable to Contracts 
Governing Federally Financed and Assisted Construction''). Under this 
Act, contractors shall be required to pay wages to laborers and 
mechanics at a rate not less than the minimum wages specified in a wage 
determination made by the Secretary of Labor. In addition, contractors 
shall be required to pay wages not less than once a week. The recipient 
shall place a copy of the current prevailing wage determination issued 
by the Department of Labor in each solicitation and the award of a 
contract shall be conditioned upon the acceptance of the wage 
determination. The recipient shall report all suspected or reported 
violations to the Federal awarding agency.
    4. Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-
333)--Where applicable, all contracts awarded by recipients in excess of 
$2000 for construction contracts and in excess of $2500 for other 
contracts that involve the employment of mechanics or laborers shall 
include a provision for compliance with Sections 102 and 107 of the 
Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-333), as 
supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 5). Under 
Section 102 of the Act, each contractor shall be required to compute the 
wages of every mechanic and laborer on the basis of a standard work week 
of 40 hours. Work in excess of the standard work week is permissible 
provided that the worker is compensated at a rate of not less than 1\1/
2\ times the basic rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 40 
hours in the work week. Section 107 of the Act is applicable to 
construction work and provides that no laborer or mechanic shall be 
required to work in surroundings or under working conditions which are 
unsanitary, hazardous or dangerous. These requirements do not apply to 
the purchases of supplies or materials or articles ordinarily available 
on the open market, or contracts for transportation or transmission of 
intelligence.
    5. Rights to Inventions Made Under a Contract or Agreement--
Contracts or agreements for the performance of experimental, 
developmental, or research work shall provide for the rights of the 
Federal Government and the recipient in any resulting invention in

regulations issued by the awarding agency.
    6. Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) and the Federal Water 
Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), as amended--Contracts 
and subgrants of amounts in excess of $100,000 shall contain a provision 
that requires the recipient to agree to comply with all applicable 
standards, orders or regulations issued pursuant to the Clean Air Act 
(42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as 
amended (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.). Violations shall be reported to the 
Federal awarding agency and the Regional Office of the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA).
    7. Byrd Anti-Lobbying Amendment (31 U.S.C. 1352)--Contractors who 
apply or bid for an award of $100,000 or more shall file the required 
certification. Each tier certifies to the tier above that it will not 
and has not used Federal appropriated funds to pay any person or 
organization for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or 
employee of any agency, a member of Congress, officer or employee of 
Congress, or an employee of a member of Congress in connection with 
obtaining any Federal contract, grant or any other award covered by 31 
U.S.C. 1352. Each tier shall also disclose any lobbying with non-Federal 
funds that takes place in connection with obtaining any Federal award. 
Such disclosures are forwarded from tier to tier up to the recipient.
    8. Debarment and Suspension (E.O.s 12549 and 12689)--No contract 
shall be made to parties listed on the General Services Administration's 
List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement or Nonprocurement 
Programs in accordance with E.O.s 12549 and 12689, ``Debarment and 
Suspension.'' This list contains the names of parties debarred, 
suspended, or otherwise excluded by agencies, and contractors declared

<R04>
                     Subpart A_Purpose and Coverage


<R05>
Sec. 105-74.100  What does this part do?

    This part carries out the portion of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 
1988 (41 U.S.C. 701 et seq., as amended) that applies to grants. It also 
applies the provisions of the Act to cooperative agreements and other 
financial assistance awards, as a matter of Federal Government policy.


<R05>
Sec. 105-74.105  Does this part apply to me?

    (a) Portions of this part apply to you if you are either--
    (1) A recipient of an assistance award from the General Services 
Administration; or
    (2) A(n) GSA awarding official. (See definitions of award and 
recipient in Sec. Sec. 105-74.605 and 105-74.660, respectively.)
    (b) The following table shows the subparts that apply to you:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
            If you are . . .                    see subparts . . .
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) A recipient who is not an            A, B and E.
 individual.
(2) A recipient who is an individual...  A, C and E.
(3) A(n) GSA awarding official.........  A, D and E.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 105-74.110  Are any of my Federal assistance awards exempt from 

this part?

    This part does not apply to any award that the Administrator of 
General Services determines that the application of this part would be 
inconsistent with the international obligations of the United States or 
the laws or regulations of a foreign government.

[[Page 597]]


<R05>
Sec. 105-74.115  Does this part affect the Federal contracts that 

I receive?

    It will affect future contract awards indirectly if you are debarred 
or suspended for a violation of the requirements of this part, as 
described in Sec. 105-74. 510(c). However, this part does not apply 
directly to procurement contracts. The portion of the Drug-Free 
Workplace Act of 1988 that applies to Federal procurement contracts is 
carried out through the Federal Acquisition Regulation in chapter 1 of 
Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations (the drug-free workplace 
coverage currently is in 48 CFR part 23, subpart 23.5).


<R04>
      Subpart B_Requirements for Recipients Other Than Individuals


<R05>
Sec. 105-74.200  What must I do to comply with this part?

    There are two general requirements if you are a recipient other than 
an individual.
    (a) First, you must make a good faith effort, on a continuing basis, 
to maintain a drug-free workplace. You must agree to do so as a 
condition for receiving any award covered by this part. The specific 
measures that you must take in this regard are described in more detail 
in subsequent sections of this subpart. Briefly, those measures are to--
    (1) Publish a drug-free workplace statement and establish a drug-
free awareness program for your employees (see Sec. Sec. 105-74.205 
through 105-74.220); and

any award, he or she:
    (1) Will abide by the terms of the statement; and
    (2) Must notify you in writing if he or she is convicted for a 
violation of a criminal drug statute occurring in the workplace and must 
do so no more than five calendar days after the conviction.


<R05>
Sec. 105-74.210  To whom must I distribute my drug-free workplace 

statement?

    You must require that a copy of the statement described in Sec. 
105-74.205 be given to each employee who will be engaged in the

assistance programs; and
    (d) The penalties that you may impose upon them for drug abuse 
violations occurring in the workplace.


<R05>
Sec. 105-74.220  By when must I publish my drug-free workplace

statement and establish my drug-free awareness program?

    If you are a new recipient that does not already have a policy 
statement as described in Sec. 105-74.205 and an ongoing awareness 
program as described in Sec. 105-74.215, you must publish the statement 
and establish the program by the time given in the following table:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                If . . .                          then you . . .
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) The performance period of the award  must have the policy statement
 is less than 30 days.                    and program in place as soon
                                          as possible, but before the
                                          date on which performance is
                                          expected to be completed.

[[Page 598]]

 
(b) The performance period of the award  must have the policy statement

                                          days after award.
(c) You believe there are extraordinary  may ask the GSA awarding
 circumstances that will require more     official to give you more time
 than 30 days for you to publish the      to do so. The amount of
 policy statement and establish the       additional time, if any, to be
 awareness program.                       given is at the discretion of
                                          the awarding official.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 105-74.225  What actions must I take concerning employees who are

convicted of drug violations in the workplace?

    There are two actions you must take if an employee is convicted of a 
drug violation in the workplace:
    (a) First, you must notify Federal agencies if an employee who is 
engaged in the performance of an award informs you about a conviction, 
as required by Sec. 105-74.205(c)(2), or you otherwise learn of the 
conviction. Your notification to the Federal agencies must--
    (1) Be in writing;
    (2) Include the employee's position title;
    (3) Include the identification number(s) of each affected award;
    (4) Be sent within ten calendar days after you learn of the 
conviction; and
    (5) Be sent to every Federal agency on whose award the convicted 
employee was working. It must be sent to every awarding official or his 
or her official designee, unless the Federal agency has specified a 
central point for the receipt of the notices.
    (b) Second, within 30 calendar days of learning about an employee's 
conviction, you must either--
    (1) Take appropriate personnel action against the employee, up to 
and including termination, consistent with the requirements of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794), as amended; or
    (2) Require the employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug 
abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for these purposes 
by a Federal, State or local health, law enforcement, or other 
appropriate agency.


<R05>
Sec. 105-74.230  How and when must I identify workplaces?

    (a) You must identify all known workplaces under each GSA award. A 
failure to do so is a violation of your drug-free workplace 
requirements. You may identify the workplaces--
    (1) To the GSA official that is making the award, either at the time 
of application or upon award; or
    (2) In documents that you keep on file in your offices during the 
performance of the award, in which case you must make the information 
available for inspection upon request by GSA officials or their 
designated representatives.
    (b) Your workplace identification for an award must include the 
actual address of buildings (or parts of buildings) or other sites where 
work under the award takes place. Categorical descriptions may be used 
(e.g., all vehicles of a mass transit authority or State highway 
department while in operation, State employees in each local 
unemployment office, performers in concert halls or radio studios).
    (c) If you identified workplaces to the GSA awarding official at the 
time of application or award, as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section, and any workplace that you identified changes during the 
performance of the award, you must inform the GSA awarding official.

violation occurring during the conduct of any award activity, you will 
report the conviction:
    (1) In writing.

[[Page 599]]

    (2) Within 10 calendar days of the conviction.
    (3) To the GSA awarding official or other designee for each award 
that you currently have, unless Sec. 105-74.301 or the award document 
designates a central point for the receipt of the notices. When notice 
is made to a central point, it must include the identification number(s)

    The Administrator of General Services may waive with respect to a 
particular award, in writing, a suspension of payments under an award, 
suspension or termination of an award, or suspension or debarment of a 
recipient if the Administrator of General Services determines that such 
a waiver would be in the public interest. This exception authority 
cannot be delegated to any other official.

    No formal property management records are required to be maintained 
for this category of personal property, which includes such items as 
those controlled for calibration or maintenance purposes, contaminated 
property, tool crib items, and equipment pool items. Various control 
records can be employed to help safeguard this property against waste 
and abuse, including purchase vs. use information, tool crib check-outs, 
loss and theft reports, calibration records, disposal records, and other 
similar records. Control techniques would include physical security, 
custodial responsibility, identification/marking, or other locally 
established control techniques.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5109  Control of sensitive items.

    (a) A list of types of personal property considered to be sensitive 
shall be developed and maintained by each DOE activity/site, taking into 
consideration value, costs of administration, need for control, and 
other factors that management determines should apply.
    (b) Items of equipment which are also designated as sensitive items 
will be controlled as sensitive items and as equipment.

1.5110 of this part).
    (8) Requirement for an employee transfer or termination check-out 
procedure and examination and adjustment of records;
    (9) Reminder of prohibition of use for other than official purposes 
and penalties for misuse;
    (10) A clear statement of the extent of responsibility for financial 
accountability depending upon contractor policy; and
    (11) Other procedures which have demonstrated efficient physical and 
administrative control over sensitive items.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5110  Physical inventories of personal property.

    (a) Physical inventories of those categories of personal property as 
specified in paragraph (f) of this section shall be conducted at all DOE 
and designated contractor locations.
    (b) Physical inventories shall be performed by the use of personnel 
other than custodians of the property. Where staffing restraints or 
other considerations apply, the inventory may be performed by the 
custodian with verification by a second party.

[[Page 613]]

    (c) Detailed procedures for the taking of physical inventories shall 
be developed for each DOE office and designated contractor. The OPMO 
shall review and approve the DOE office and contractor procedures.
    (d) The conduct of a physical inventory will be observed, or follow-
on audits made, by independent representatives, e.g., finance, audit, or 
property personnel, to the extent deemed necessary to assure that 
approved procedures are being followed and results are accurate. These 
observations or audits shall be documented and the documentation 
retained in the inventory record file.
    (e) Procedures that are limited to a check-off of a listing of 
recorded property without actual verification of the location and 
existence of such property do not meet the requirements of a physical 
inventory.
    (f) The frequency of physical inventories of personal property shall 
be as follows:
    (1) Equipment--biennial.
    (2) Sensitive items--annual (see paragraph 109-1.5110(l) of this 
section).
    (3) Stores inventories--annual.
    (4) Precious metals--annual.
    (5) Administratively controlled items--There is no formal Department 
requirement for the performance of physical inventories of this 
property. However, OPMOs should determine such requirements based on 
management needs.
    (g) Physical inventories shall be performed at intervals more 
frequently than required when experience at any given location or with 
any given item or items indicates that this action is necessary for 
effective property accounting, utilization, or control.
    (h) Physical inventories of equipment may be conducted by the 
``inventory by exception'' method. The system and procedures for taking 
physical inventories by this method must be fully documented and 
approved in writing by the OPMO.
    (i) The results of physical inventories shall be reconciled with the 
property records, and with applicable financial control accounts.
    (j) The results of physical inventories shall be reported to the 
OPMO within 30 days after the reconciliation required above.
    (k) Physical inventories of equipment and stores inventories may be 
conducted using statistical sampling methods in lieu of the normal wall-
to-wall method. The sampling methods employed must be statistically 
valid and approved in writing by the OPMO. If use of the statistical 
methods of physical inventory does not produce acceptable results, the 
wall-to-wall method shall be used to complete the inventories.
    (l) Physical inventories of sensitive items (excluding arms, 
ammunition, and military property) having an acquisition cost of $2,000 
or less may also be conducted using statistical sampling methods. 
However if statistical sampling methods are used, a wall-to-wall 
inventory is required no less frequently than every three years and at 
contract completion (unless there is a follow-on contract with the same 
contractor).

    (a) Designated contractors shall report any loss, damage, or 
destruction of personal property in its possession or control, including 
property in the possession or control of subcontractors, to the property 
administrator as soon as it becomes known.
    (b) When physical inventories, consumption analyses, or other 
actions disclose consumption of property considered unreasonable by the 
property administrator; or loss, damage, or destruction of personal 
property not previously reported by the contractor, the property 
administrator shall require the contractor to investigate the incidents 
and submit written reports.
    (c) Reports of physical inventory results and identified 
discrepancies shall be submitted to the property administrator within 90 
days of completion of physical inventories. An acceptable percentage of 
shrinkage for stores inventories shall be determined by the property 
administrator on a location-by-location basis, based on type and cost of 
materials, historical data, and other site-specific factors. This 
determination shall be in writing and be supported by appropriate 
documentation.
    (d) The contractor's report referenced above shall contain factual 
data as to the circumstances surrounding the loss, damage, destruction 
or excessive consumption, including:
    (1) The contractor's name and contract number;
    (2) A description of the property;
    (3) Cost of the property, and cost of repairs in instances of damage 
(in event actual cost is not known, use reasonable estimate);
    (4) The date, time (if pertinent), and cause or origin; and
    (5) Actions taken by the contractor to prevent further loss, damage, 
destruction, or unreasonable consumption, and to prevent repetition of 
similar incidents.
    (e) The property administrator shall ensure that the corrective 
actions taken by the contractor under paragraph (d)(5) of this section 
satisfactorily address system weaknesses.
    (f) The contracting officer shall make a determination of contractor 
liability with a copy of the determination furnished to the contractor 
and the property administrator. Costs may be assessed against a 
contractor for physical inventory discrepancies or other instances of 
loss of Government property within the terms of the contract. Credit 
should only be applied if specific items reported as lost can be 
uniquely identified. General physical inventory write-ons are not to be 
used as a credit.
    (g) If part of a designated contractor's personal property 
management system is found to be unsatisfactory, the property 
administrator shall increase surveillance of that part to prevent, to 
the extent possible, any loss, damage, destruction or unreasonable 
consumption of personal property. The property administrator shall give 
special attention to reasonably assuring that any loss, damage, 
destruction or unreasonable consumption occurring during a period when a 
contractor's personal property management system is not approved is 
identified before approval or reinstatement of approval.

  Subpart 109	1.52_Personal Property Management Program for Designated 
                               Contractors


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5200  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes policy and responsibilities for the 
establishment, maintenance, and appraisal of designated contractors' 
programs for the management of personal property.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5201  Policy.

    (a) Designated contractors shall establish, implement, and maintain 
a system that provides for an efficient personal property management 
program. The system shall be consistent with the terms of the contract; 
prescribed policies, procedures, regulations, statutes, and 
instructions; and directions from the contracting officer.
    (b) Designated contractors' personal property management systems 
shall not be considered acceptable until reviewed and approved in 
writing by the cognizant DOE contracting office in accordance with Sec. 
109-1.5205 of this subpart.
    (c) Designated contractors shall maintain their personal property 
management systems in writing. Revisions to the systems shall be 
approved in writing by the cognizant DOE contracting office in 
accordance with Sec. 109-1.5205 of this subpart.
    (d) Designated contractors shall include their personal property 
management system in their management surveillance or internal review 
program in order to identify weaknesses and functions requiring 
corrective action.
    (e) Designated contractors are responsible and accountable for all 
Government personal property in the possession of subcontractors, and 
shall include appropriate provisions in their subcontracts and property 
management systems to assure that subcontractors establish and maintain 
efficient systems for the management of Government personal property in 
their possession in accordance with Sec. 109-1.5204 of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5202  Establishment of a personal property holdings baseline.

    (a) If the contractor is a new designated contractor, the contractor 
may accept the previous contractor's personal property records as a 
baseline or may perform a complete physical inventory of all personal 
property. This physical inventory is to be performed within the time 
period specified by the contracting officer or the contract, but no 
later than one year after the execution date of the contract. If the 
physical inventory is not accomplished within the allotted time frame, 
the previous contractor's records will be considered as the baseline.
    (b) If any required physical inventories have not been accomplished 
within the time periods prescribed in Sec. 109-1.5110(f) of this part, 
the new contractor shall either perform such physical inventories within 
120 days of contract renegotiation, or accept the existing property 
records as the baseline.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5203  Management of subcontractor-held personal property.

    Designated contractors shall require those subcontractors provided 
Government-owned personal property to establish and maintain a system 
for the management of such property. As a minimum, a subcontractor's 
personal property management system shall provide for the following:
    (a) Adequate records.
    (b) Controls over acquisitions.
    (c) Identification as Government-owned personal property.

[[Page 616]]

    (d) Physical inventories.
    (e) Proper care, maintenance, and protection.
    (f) Controls over personal property requiring special handling 
(i.e., nuclear-related, proliferation-sensitive, hazardous, or 
contaminated property).
    (g) Reporting, redistribution, and disposal of excess and surplus 
personal property.
    (h) Accounting for personal property that is lost, damaged, 
destroyed, stolen, abandoned, or worn out.
    (i) Periodic reports, including physical inventory results and total 
acquisition cost of Government property.
    (j) An internal surveillance program, including periodic reviews, to 
ensure that personal property is being managed in accordance with 
established procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5204  Review and approval of a designated contractor's 

personal property management system.

    (a) An initial review of a designated contractor's personal property 
management system shall be performed by the property administrator 
within one year after the execution date of the contract, except for 
contract extensions or renewals or when an existing contractor has been 
awarded a follow-on contract. The purpose of the review is to determine 
whether the contractor's system provides adequate protection, 
maintenance, utilization, and disposition of personal property, and 
reasonable assurance that the Department's personal property is 
safeguarded against waste, loss, unauthorized use, or misappropriation, 
in accordance with applicable statutes, regulations, contract terms and 
conditions, programmatic needs, and good business practices. If 
circumstances preclude completion of the initial review within the 
``within one year'' initial review requirement, the property 
administrator shall request a deviation from the requirement in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 109-1.110-50 of this part.
    (b) If a designated contractor is the successor to a previous 
designated contractor and the contract award was based in part on the 
contractor's proposal to overhaul the existing personal property 
management system(s), the ``within one year'' initial review requirement 
may be extended based on:
    (1) The scope of the overhaul; and
    (2) An analysis of the cost to implement the overhaul within a year 
versus a proposed extended period.
    (c) When an existing contract has been extended or renewed, or the 
designated contractor has been awarded a follow-on contract, an initial 
review of the contractor's personal property management system is not 
required. In such cases, the established appraisal schedule will 
continue to be followed as prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) At a minimum of every three years after the date of approval of 
a designated contractor's property management system, the OPMO shall 
make an appraisal of the personal property management operation of the 
contractor. The purpose of the appraisal is to determine if the 
contractor is managing personal property in accordance with its 
previously approved system and procedures, and to establish whether such 
procedures are efficient. The appraisal may be based on a formal 
comprehensive appraisal or a series of formal appraisals of the 
functional segments of the contractor's operation.
    (e) A designated contractor's property management system shall be 
approved, conditionally approved, or disapproved in writing by the head 
of the field organization with advice of the contracting officer, 
property administrator, OPMO, legal counsel, DPMO, and appropriate 
program officials. Approval authority may be redelegated to the 
contracting officer or contracting officer's designee. Conditional 
approval and disapproval authority cannot be redelegated. When a system 
is conditionally approved or disapproved, the property administrator or 
contracting officer shall advise the contractor, in writing, of 
deficiencies that need to be corrected, and a time schedule established 
for completion of corrective actions.
    (f) Appropriate follow-up will be made by the property administrator 
to ensure that corrective actions have been initiated and completed.
    (g) When a determination has been made by the property administrator 
that all major system deficiencies

[[Page 617]]

identified in the review or appraisal have been corrected, the head of 
the field organization shall withdraw the conditional approval or 
disapproval, and approve the system with the concurrence of the OPMO. 
The approval shall be in writing and addressed to appropriate contractor 
management.
    (h) The property administrator shall maintain a copy of all 
designated contractor personal property management system appraisals and 
approvals in such manner as to be readily available to investigative and 
external review teams.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5205  Personal property management system changes.

    Any proposed significant change to a designated contractor's 
approved personal property management system shall be reviewed by the 
property administrator at the earliest possible time. Such changes 
should then be approved in writing on an interim basis, or disapproved 
in writing, by the property administrator as appropriate.


<R04>
       Subpart 109	1.53_Management of High Risk Personal Property


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5300  Scope of subpart.

    (a) This subpart provides identification, accounting, control, and 
disposal policy guidance for the following categories of high risk 
personal property: especially designed or prepared property, export 
controlled property, nuclear weapon components or weapon-like 
components, and proliferation sensitive property. The guidance is 
intended to ensure that the disposition of these categories of high risk 
personal property does not adversely affect the national security or 
nuclear nonproliferation objectives of the United States.
    (b) The other categories of high risk personal property are 
controlled by other life cycle management programs and procedures 
monitored by other Departmental elements.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5301  Applicability.

    This subpart is applicable to all DOE organizations which purchase, 
manage or dispose of Government personal property, or contract for the 
management of Government facilities, programs, or related services, 
which may directly or indirectly require the purchase, management, or 
disposal of Government-owned personal property. Using the high risk 
personal property control requirements in this subpart as guidance, 
heads of field organizations or OPMOs shall assure that designated 
contractors and financial assistance recipients are responsible for 
developing a cost effective high risk property management system, 
covering all operational responsibilities enumerated in this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5302  Policies.

    (a) It is the responsibility of DOE organizations and designated 
contractors to manage and control Government-owned high risk personal 
property in an efficient manner. High risk personal property will be 
managed throughout its life cycle so as to protect public and DOE 
personnel safety and to advance the national security and the nuclear 
nonproliferation objectives of the U.S. Government.
    (b) The disposition of high risk property is subject to special 
considerations. Items of high risk property may present significant 
risks to the national security and nuclear nonproliferation objectives 
of the Government which must be evaluated. Organizations will identify 
high risk property and control its disposition to eliminate or mitigate 
such risks. In no case shall property be transferred or disposed unless 
it receives a high risk assessment and is handled accordingly.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5303  Procedures.

    (a) Identification, marking and control. To ensure the appropriate 
treatment of property at its disposal and to prevent inadvertent, 
uncontrolled release of high risk property, property should be assessed 
and evaluated as high risk property as early in its life cycle as 
practical.
    (1) Newly acquired high risk personal property shall be identified 
and tracked during the acquisition process and marked upon receipt.
    (2) All personal property shall be reviewed for high risk 
identification, marking, and database entry during regularly scheduled 
physical inventories, unless access to the property is

[[Page 618]]

difficult or impractical because the property is a component of a larger 
assembly, a complex operating system, or an older facility. The review 
of this property will be completed, prior to disposition, when replacing 
components or when operating systems and facilities are decommissioned 
and dismantling.
    (3) High risk personal property which by its nature cannot be 
marked, such as stores items and metal stock, is exempt from this 
requirement. However, personal property management programs should 
contain documentation on the characterization of this property as high 
risk.
    (b) Disposition of high risk property. (1) Prior to disposition, all 
personal property, materials or data will be assessed to determine:
    (i) Whether it should be characterized as high risk and
    (ii) What actions are necessary to ensure compliance with applicable 
national security or nonproliferation controls.
    (2) The DOE or designated contractor property management 
organization may not process high risk personal property into a 
reutilization/disposal program without performing the reviews prescribed 
by the local high risk property management system. The reviews must be 
properly documented, and all appropriate certifications and clearances 
received, in accordance with the approved site or facility personal 
property management program.
    (3) The disposition (including demilitarization of items on the 
Munitions List) and handling of high risk personal property are subject 
to applicable provisions of Subchapter H of the FPMR, subchapter H of 
this chapter, and the DOE Guidelines on Export Control and 
Nonproliferation.
    (4) Documentation. All applicable documentation, including records 
concerning the property's categorization as high risk, shall be included 
as part of the property transfer. The documentation shall be included 
with all transfers within, or external to, DOE.
    (5) Unless an alternative disposition option appears to be in the 
best interest of the Government, surplus Trigger List components, 
equipment, and materials and nuclear weapon components shall either be 
sold for scrap after being rendered useless for their originally 
intended purpose or destroyed, with the destruction verified and 
documented. Requests for approval of an alternative disposition may be 
made through the cognizant Assistant Secretary to the Director of the 
Office of Nonproliferation and National Security.
    (6) Export Restriction Notice. The following Export Restriction 
Notice, or approved equivalent notice, shall be included in all 
transfers, sales, or other offerings:

                        Export Restriction Notice

    The use, disposition, export and reexport of this property are 
subject to all applicable U.S. laws and regulations, including the 
Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended; the Arms Export Control Act (22 
U.S.C. 2751 et seq.); the Export Administration Act of 1979 (560 U.S.C. 
Append 2401 et seq.); Assistance to Foreign Atomic Energy Activities (10 
CFR part 810); Export and Import of Nuclear Equipment and Material (10 
CFR part 110); International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR parts 
120 et seq.); Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR part 730 et 
seq.); Foreign Assets Control Regulations (31 CFR parts 500 et seq.); 
and the Espionage Act (37 U.S.C. 791 et seq.) which among other things, 
prohibit:
    a. The making of false statements and concealment of any material 
information regarding the use or disposition, export or reexport of the 
property; and
    b. Any use or disposition, export or reexport of the property which 
is not authorized in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5304  Deviations.

    (a) Life cycle control determinations. When the HFO approves a 
contractor program containing controls, other than life cycle control 
consistent with this subpart, the decision shall be justified in writing 
and a copy sent to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Procurement and 
Assistance Management. A HFO's decision not to provide life-cycle 
control should take into account:
    (1) The nature and extent of high risk property typically purchased 
or otherwise brought to a DOE or designated contractor facility or site;
    (2) The projected stability of DOE and designated contractor 
operations; and

[[Page 619]]

    (3) The degree of confidence in the property control measures 
available at disposition.
    (b) Certain transfers, sales, or other offerings of high risk 
personal property may require special conditions or specific 
restrictions as determined necessary by the property custodian or 
cognizant program office.
    (c) Requests for deviations from the requirements of this subpart 
may be made through the cognizant HFO to the Deputy Assistant Secretary 
for Procurement and Assistance Management.

walk-throughs conducted shall be at the discretion of the laboratory or 
facility management. However, DOE field organizations may require 
designated contractors to submit a report of walk-throughs to the OPMOs. 
Equipment identified as idle and unneeded shall be redeployed, 
reassigned, placed in equipment pools, or excessed, as appropriate. All 
walk-throughs shall be documented to include, at a minimum, the identity 
of the participants, areas covered, findings, recommendations, 
corrective action plans, and results achieved. The documentation shall 
be made available for review by appropriate contractor management, DOE 
offices, and audit teams.
    (b) Members of management walk-through inspection teams should be 
coordinated with the property administrator and the OPMO.
    (c) OPMOs shall periodically review walk-through procedures and 
practices of DOE offices and designated contractors to determine their 
effectiveness.

Sec. 109-26.501  Purchase of new motor vehicles.


<R05>
Sec. 109-26.501-1  General.

    (a) [Reserved]
    (b) Motor vehicles may be purchased directly rather than through GSA 
when a waiver has been granted by GSA. The waiver request should be 
submitted directly to GSA and a copy forwarded to the DPMO. However, 
where GSA refuses to grant a waiver and it is believed that procurement 
through GSA would adversely affect or otherwise impair a program, the 
DPMO may, upon written request of the head of the DOE field 
organization, grant the authority for direct purchase of general purpose 
motor vehicles. Upon receipt of written authorization from the DPMO, the 
head of the field organization may authorize direct purchase of special 
purpose vehicles. The purchase price for passenger motor vehicles shall 
not exceed any statutory limitation in effect at the time the purchase 
is made.


<R05>
Sec. 109-26.501-4  Submission of orders.

    An original and two copies of requisitions for passenger motor 
vehicles and law enforcement motor vehicles shall be forwarded with 
justification for purchase to the DPMO, for approval and submission to 
GSA. Requisitions for all other types of motor vehicles shall be 
submitted directly to GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 109-26.501-50  Authority and allocations for the acquisition of

passenger motor vehicles.

    (a) Authority for the acquisition of passenger motor vehicles is 
contained in the Department's annual appropriation act.
    (b) DOE offices shall include in their budget submissions the number 
of passenger motor vehicles to be purchased during the fiscal year. The 
procurements will be identified as either additions to the motor vehicle 
fleet or replacement vehicles. A copy of the motor vehicle portion of 
the submission should be submitted to the DPMO.
    (c) To assure that DOE does not exceed the number of passenger motor 
vehicles authorized to be acquired in any fiscal year, the Deputy 
Assistant Secretary for Procurement and Assistance Management or 
designee shall allocate to and inform the field organizations in writing 
of the number of passenger motor vehicles which may be acquired under 
each appropriation. These allocations and the statutory cost limitations 
imposed on these motor vehicles shall not be exceeded.
    (d) The motor vehicle fleet manager shall provide written 
certification to the OPMO that disposition action has been taken on 
replaced passenger motor vehicles. Such certification shall be provided 
no later than 30 days after the disposition of the vehicle. Replaced 
passenger motor vehicles shall not be retained in service after receipt 
of the replacement vehicle.


<R05>
Sec. 109-26.501-51  Used vehicles.

    Normally, DOE does not purchase or authorize contractors to purchase 
used motor vehicles. However, the Director, Office of Administrative 
Services and heads of field organizations may authorize the purchase of 
used motor vehicles where justified by special circumstances, e.g., when 
new motor vehicles are in short supply; motor vehicles are to be used 
for experimental or test purposes; or motor vehicles are acquired from 
exchange/sale. The statutory passenger motor vehicle allocation 
requirements shall apply to any purchase of used passenger motor 
vehicles except in the case of motor vehicles to be used exclusively for 
experimental or test purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 109-26.501-52  Justification for purchase.

    (a) Requisitions for additions to the passenger motor vehicle fleet 
must contain adequate written justification of need. Such justifications 
shall be prepared by the motor vehicle fleet manager and approved by the 
OPMO, and should include:
    (1) A statement as to why the present fleet size is inadequate to 
support requirements;
    (2) Efforts made to achieve maximum use of on-hand motor vehicles 
through pool arrangements, shuttle buses, and taxicabs;
    (3) The programmatic requirement for the motor vehicles and the 
impact

[[Page 624]]

on the program/project if the requisitions are not filled;
    (4) The established DOE or local utilization objectives used to 
evaluate the utilization of passenger motor vehicles and whether the 
objectives have been approved by the OPMO; and
    (5) The date of the last utilization review and the number of 
passenger motor vehicles which did not meet the established utilization 
objectives and the anticipated mileage to be achieved by the new motor 
vehicles.
    (b) Requisitions for replacement passenger motor vehicles should 
include a statement that utilization, pools, shuttle buses and taxicabs 
have been considered by the motor vehicle fleet manager and the OPMO. 
Specific information on the identification, age and mileage of the motor 
vehicles should be included. When a passenger motor vehicle being 
replaced does not meet Federal replacement standards, a description of 
the condition of the vehicle should also be provided.


<R05>
Sec. 109-26.501-53  Acquisitions by transfer.

    (a) The acquisition of passenger motor vehicles by transfer from 
another Government agency or DOE organization shall be within the 
allocations prescribed in Sec. 109-26.501-50 of this subpart.
    (b) Passenger motor vehicles may be acquired by transfer provided 
they are:
    (1) Considered as an addition to the motor vehicle fleet of the 
receiving office;
    (2) Acquired for replacement purposes and an equal number of 
replaced motor vehicles are reported for disposal within 30 days;
    (3) For temporary emergency needs exceeding three months and 
approved in writing by the DPMO; or
    (4) For temporary emergency needs of three months or less in lieu of 
commercial rentals. These transfers will not count toward the 
allocation.


<R05>
Sec. 109-26.501-54  Communications equipment.

    Communications equipment considered to be essential for the 
accomplishment of security and safety responsibilities is exempt from 
the requirements of 41 CFR 101-26.501. The Fleet Manager shall approve 
the installation of communications equipment in motor vehicles.

<R05>
Sec. 109-27.000-50  Definitions.

    As used in this part the following definitions apply:
    Inventories mean stocks of stores, construction, supplies, and parts 
used in support of DOE programs.
    Inventory management means the efficient use of methods, procedures 
and techniques for recording, analyzing, and adjusting inventories in 
accordance with established policy. The following related functions are 
included:
    (1) Providing adequate protection against misuse, theft, and 
misappropriation.
    (2) Providing accurate analyses of quantities to determine 
requirements so that only minimal obsolescence losses will be 
encountered, while ensuring adequate inventory levels to meet program 
schedules.
    (3) Providing adequate and accessible storage facilities and 
services based upon analyses of program requirements so that a minimum 
and economical amount of time is required to service the program.
    Stock record means a device for collecting, storing, and providing 
historical data on recurring transactions for each line item of 
inventory.
    Sub-store means a geographically removed part of the main store's 
operation conducted as a subordinate element of it and subject to the 
same management policies and inventory controls.
    Systems contracting means a materials management purchasing 
technique for the purchase of general, common-use, and repetitive supply 
items in a particular product family. An example is office supplies, 
purchased from a commercial vendor, that are needed for immediate use 
instead of purchasing in bulk for future use, storing in warehouses, and 
issuing to customers by use of a requisitioning system. Systems 
contracting and just-in-time contracting are synonymous.


<R04>
                  Subpart 109	27.1_Stock Replenishment


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.102  Economic order quantity principle.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.102-1  Applicability.

    Replenishment of inventories of stock items having recurring demands 
will be by use of the economic order quantity (EOQ) principle. However, 
when considered more suitable, designated contractors may use other 
generally accepted approaches to EOQ.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.102-50  Systems contracting.

    Systems contracting may be used instead of or along with EOQ once a 
determination is made that such a system is feasible and cost effective, 
and that adequate controls are in place to ensure proper use.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.102-51  Policy.

    Systems contracting for supply operations is a proven cost-effective 
approach to meeting procurement needs and may be implemented in DOE 
offices and designated contractors wherever significant cost savings to 
the Government will result. Impacts on local suppliers and small and 
disadvantaged business concerns should be considered in the overall 
business strategy.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.102-52  Implementation.

    (a) DOE OPMOs shall establish required property management controls 
relative to the implementation of systems contracting.
    (b) DOE offices and designated contractors operating a materials 
management function who have not performed an initial feasibility study 
for the implementation of systems contracting shall perform such a study 
for selected

[[Page 626]]

commodity groups. The study may be accomplished over a period of time, 
until all commodity groups have been considered. The study should 
address functional requirements, activity levels of commodity groups and 
individual items, and potential impacts on local suppliers and small and 
disadvantaged businesses. An industrial relations analysis on existing 
labor relations and union contracts may also be necessary.
    (c) As required in the DEAR, DOE offices and designated contractors 
are required to consider the use of GSA supply sources when economically 
advantageous to the Government. These sources must be considered in the 
conduct of the feasibility study.
    (d) DOE contracting offices shall evaluate the initial cost benefit 
studies performed by contractors to verify the savings and other 
benefits of systems contracting, and shall approve its implementation. 
In those instances where a cost benefit study has previously been 
performed, the DOE contracting office shall ensure that those studies 
have been evaluated and the approval to proceed with systems contracting 
has been provided to the contractor in writing.
    (e) DOE offices shall periodically reevaluate systems contracting 
operations conducted by their office and designated contractors to 
ensure that required property management controls are being followed.


<R04>
           Subpart 109	27.2_Management of Shelf-Life Materials


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.202  Applicability.

    When considered more suitable, designated contractors may use other 
generally accepted approaches to the management of shelf-life materials.


<R04>
             Subpart 109	27.3_Maximizing Use of Inventories


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.302  Applicability.

    When considered more suitable, designated contractors may use other 
generally accepted approaches to maximizing use of inventories.


<R04>
          Subpart 109	27.4_Elimination of Items From Inventory


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.402  Applicability

    When considered more suitable, designated contractors may use other 
generally accepted approaches to determine which items should be 
eliminated from inventory.


<R04>
    Subpart 109	27.50_Inventory Management Policies, Procedures, and 
                               Guidelines


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5001  Objectives.

    Necessary inventories shall be established and maintained at 
reasonable levels, consistent with DOE requirements, applicable laws and 
regulations, and the following objectives:
    (a) The maintenance of adequate stock levels through accurate 
analyses of quantities to determine requirements and stock 
replenishments so that only minimal obsolescence losses will be 
encountered while ensuring adequate inventory levels to meet program 
schedules;
    (b) The protection of materials against misuse, theft, and 
misappropriation;
    (c) The maintenance of an efficient operation; and
    (d) The standardization of inventories to the greatest extent 
practicable.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5002  Stores inventory turnover ratio.

    Comparison of investment in stores inventories to annual issues 
shall be made to assure that minimum inventories are maintained for the 
support of programs. This comparison may be expressed either as a 
turnover ratio (dollar value of issues divided by dollar value of 
inventory) or in the average number of month's supply on hand. Turnover 
or number of month's supply is calculated only on current-use inventory. 
Performance goals, i.e., a six months investment or a turnover ratio of 
2.0, shall be established for each stores using activity. It is 
recognized, however, that extenuating operating circumstances may 
preclude the achievement of such objectives.

[[Page 627]]


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5003  Stock control.

    (a) Stock control shall be maintained on the basis of stock record 
accounts of inventories on hand, on order, received, issued, and 
disposed of, and supported by proper documents in evidence of these 
transactions. Stock record accounts shall be available for review and 
inspection.
    (b) Personal property under stock control for greater than 90 days 
shall be maintained in stock record accounts.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5004  Sub-stores.

    (a) Sub-stores shall be established when necessary to expedite 
delivery of materials and supplies to the users, serve emergencies, 
provide economy in transportation, reduce shop and site stocks, and 
enable stores personnel to provide assistance in obtaining materials and 
supplies as needed.
    (b) Items stored for issue in the sub-stores shall be treated as 
inventory items for control and reporting purposes. Stock records shall 
be integrated with central stock records so that the total amount on 
hand of any item at all locations is known.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5005  Shop, bench, cupboard or site stock.

    Shop, bench, cupboard or site stocks are an accumulation of small 
inventories of fast-moving materials at the point of use. Normally, 
these inventories are expensed at time of issue from controlled stores. 
However, when stocks of such inventories are not consumed or do not turn 
over in a reasonable period of time, which normally should not exceed 90 
days, these items should be subject to the required physical controls 
and recorded in the proper inventory account.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5006  Stores catalogs.

    A stores catalog for customer use that lists items available from 
stock shall be established for each stores operation. Exceptions to this 
requirement are authorized where establishment of a catalog is 
impracticable or uneconomical because of small total value or number of 
items involved, or temporary need for the facility.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5007  Physical inventories.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5007-1  Procedures.

    The following procedures shall be established for taking physical 
inventory of stocks subjected to quantity controls as well as those 
under financial control:
    (a) Completion of a physical inventory not less frequently than 
every twelve months.
    (b) Reconciliation of inventory quantities with the stock records.
    (c) Preparation of a report of the physical inventory results.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5007-2  Inventory adjustments.

    Discrepancies between physical inventories and stock records shall 
be adjusted and the supporting adjustment records shall be reviewed and 
approved by a responsible official at least one supervisory level above 
the supervisor in charge of the warehouse or storage facility. Items on 
an adjustment report which are not within reasonable tolerances for 
particular items shall be thoroughly investigated before report 
approval. Adjustment reports shall be retained on file for inspection 
and review.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5008  Control of drug substances and potable alcohol.

    Effective procedures and practices shall provide for the management 
and physical security of controlled substances and potable alcohol from 
receipt to the point of use. Such procedures shall, as a minimum, 
provide for safeguarding, proper use, adequate records, and compliance 
with applicable laws and regulations. Controls and records of potable 
alcohol shall be maintained on quantities of one quart and above.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5009  Control of hypodermic needles and syringes.

    Effective procedures and practices shall provide for the management 
and physical security of hypodermic needles and syringes to prevent 
illegal use. Controls shall include supervisory approval for issue, 
storage in locked repositories, and the rendering of the items useless 
prior to disposal.

[[Page 628]]


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5010  Containers returnable to vendors.

    Containers furnished by vendors shall be administratively and 
physically controlled before and after issuance. Prompt action shall be 
taken to return such containers to vendors for credit after they have 
served their intended use.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5011  Identification marking of metals and metal products.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5011-1  General.

    Metals and metal products shall be identified and marked in 
accordance with applicable Federal standards. This requirement applies 
to direct charges as well as to items procured for store, shop or floor 
stock, or for use on construction projects. Additional markings not 
covered by Federal standards should be used to show special properties, 
corrosion data, or test data as required. The preferred process is for 
the marking to be done in the manufacturing process, but it may be 
applied by suppliers when circumstances warrant.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5011-2  Exception.

    Exceptions to the marking requirement may be made when:
    (a) It is necessary to procure small quantities from suppliers not 
equipped to do the marking;
    (b) It would delay delivery of emergency orders; or
    (c) Procurement is from DOE or other Federal agency excess.

<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5106-1  Purpose.

    The purpose of the precious metals pool is to recycle, at a minimum 
cost to pool participants, DOE-owned precious metals within the 
Department and to dispose of DOE-owned precious metals that are excess 
to DOE needs. However, if the pool is unable to accept any potential 
precious metal return, the using activity will dispose of the precious 
metals through the disposal process specified in subchapter H of the 
FPMR and this regulation.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5106-2  Withdrawals.

    Pure metals, parts, fabricated products, catalysts, or solutions, 
are generally available and the Business Center for Precious Metals 
Sales and Recovery can provide assistance in supplying such 
requirements. Metals can be shipped to any facility to fulfill 
fabrication requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5106-3  Returns.

    All excess precious metals must be returned to the precious metals 
pool except as noted in Sec. 109-27.5106-1 of this subpart. The pool is 
entirely dependent on metal returns; therefore, metal inventories should 
be maintained on an as-needed basis, and any excess metals must be 
returned to the pool for recycling. With the exception of silver, this 
includes precious metals in any form, including shapes, scrap, or 
radioactively contaminated. Only high grade nonradioactively 
contaminated silver should be included. Procedures have been developed 
by the precious metals pool contractor for metal returns, including 
storing, packaging, shipping, and security.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5106-4  Withdrawals/returns forecasts.

    The Business Center for Precious Metals Sales and Recovery will 
request annually from each DOE field organization its long-range 
forecast of anticipated withdrawals from the pool and returns to the 
pool.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5106-5  Assistance.

    The Business Center for Precious Metals Sales and Recovery operates 
the precious metals pool. DOE organizations and contractors may obtain 
specific information regarding the operation of the precious metals pool 
(operating contractor's name, address, and telephone number; processing

   Subpart 109	28.50_Management of Equipment Held for Future Projects


<R05>
Sec. 109-28.5000  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart provides policies, principles, and guidelines to be 
used in the management of equipment held for future projects (EHFFP).


<R05>
Sec. 109-28.5001  Definition.

    Equipment held for future projects means items being retained, based 
on approved justifications, for a known future use, or for a potential 
use in planned projects.


<R05>
Sec. 109-28.5002  Objective.

    The objective of the EHFFP program is to enable DOE offices and 
contractors to retain equipment not in use in current programs but which 
has a known or potential use in future DOE programs, while providing 
visibility on the types and amounts of equipment so retained through 
review and reporting procedures. It is intended that equipment be 
retained where economically justifiable for retention, considering cost 
of maintenance, replacement, obsolescence, storage, deterioration, or 
future availability; made available for use by others; and promptly 
excessed when no longer needed.


<R05>
Sec. 109-28.5003  Records.

    Records of all EHFFP shall be maintained by the holding 
organization, including a listing of items with original date of 
classification as EHFFP; initial justifications for retaining EHFFP; 
rejustifications for retention; and documentation of reviews made by 
higher levels of management.


<R05>
Sec. 109-28.5004  Justification and review procedures.

    Procedures shall provide for the following:
    (a) The original decision to classify and retain equipment as EHFFP 
shall be justified in writing, providing sufficient detail to support 
the need for retention of the equipment. This justification will cite 
the project for which retained, the potential use to be made of the 
equipment, or other reasons for retention.
    (b) The validity of the initial classification EHFFP shall be 
reviewed by management at a level above that of the individual making 
the initial determination.
    (c) Retention of equipment as EHFFP must be rejustified annually to 
ensure that original justifications remain valid. The rejustifications 
will contain sufficient detail to support retention.
    (d) When equipment is retained as EHFFP for longer than one year, 
the annual rejustification shall be reviewed at a level of management at 
least two levels above that of the individual making the determination 
to retain the EHFFP. Equipment retained as EHFFP for longer than three 
years should be approved by the head of the DOE field organization.


<R05>
Sec. 109-28.5005  EHFFP program review.

    OPMOs or on-site DOE property administrators shall conduct periodic 
reviews to ensure that the EHFFP program is being conducted in 
accordance with established procedures and this subpart. Included in the 
review will be proper determinations of property as EHFFP, the validity 
of justifications for retaining EHFFP, and the inclusion of EHFFP in 
management walk-throughs as prescribed in Sec. 109-25.109-1 of this 
chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 109-28.5006  Utilization.

    It is DOE policy that, where practicable and consistent with program 
needs, EHFFP be considered as a source of supply to avoid or postpone 
acquisition.


<R04>
             Subpart 109	28.51_Management of Spare Equipment


<R05>
Sec. 109-28.5100  Scope of subpart.

in current use in DOE programs.

[[Page 633]]


<R05>
Sec. 109-28.5102  Exclusions.

    The following categories of equipment will not be considered spare 
equipment:
    (a) Equipment installed for emergency backup, e.g., an emergency 
power facility, or an electric motor or a pump, any of which is in place 
and electrically connected.
    (b) Equipment items properly classified as stores inventory.


<R05>
Sec. 109-28.5103  Management policy.

    (a) Procedures shall require the maintenance of records for spare 
equipment, cross-referenced to the location in the facility and the 
engineering drawing number. The purpose for retention shall be in the 
records.
    (b) Reviews shall be made based on technical evaluations of the 
continued need for the equipment. The reviews should be held biennially. 
In addition, individual item levels shall be reviewed when spare 
equipment is installed for use, the basic equipment is removed from 
service, or the process supported is changed.
    (c) Procedures shall be established to provide for the 
identification and reporting of unneeded spare equipment as excess 
property.

<R04>
            Subpart 109	38.51_Utilization of Motor Equipment


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5100  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes policies and procedures concerning the 
utilization of motor equipment.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5101  Policy.

    It is DOE policy to keep the number of motor vehicles and other 
motor equipment at the minimum needed to satisfy programmatic 
requirements. To attain this goal, controls and practices shall be 
established which will achieve the most practical and economical 
utilization of motor equipment. These controls and practices apply to 
all DOE-owned and commercially leased motor equipment and to GSA 
Interagency Fleet Management System motor vehicles.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5102  Utilization controls and practices.

    Controls and practices to be used by DOE organizations and 
designated contractors for achieving maximum economical utilization of 
motor equipment shall include, but not be limited to:
    (a) The maximum use of motor equipment pools, taxicabs, shuttle 
buses, or other common service arrangements;
    (b) The minimum, practicable assignment of motor equipment to 
individuals, groups, or specific organizational components;
    (c) The maintenance of individual motor equipment use records, such 
as trip tickets or vehicle logs, or hours of use, as appropriate, 
showing sufficiently detailed information to evaluate appropriateness of 
assignment and adequacy of use being made. If one-time use of a motor 
vehicle is involved, such as assignments from motor pools, the 
individual's trip records must, as a minimum, identify the motor vehicle 
and show the name of the operator, dates, destination, time of departure 
and return, and mileage;
    (d) The rotation of motor vehicles between high and low mileage 
assignments where practicable to maintain the fleet in the best overall 
replacement age and mileage balance and operating economy;
    (e) The charging, if considered feasible, to the user organization 
for the cost of operating and maintaining motor vehicles assigned to 
groups or organizational components. These charge-back costs should 
include all direct and indirect costs of the motor vehicle fleet 
operation as determined by the field organization and contractor finance 
and accounting functions;
    (f) The use of dual-purpose motor vehicles capable of hauling both 
personnel and light cargo whenever appropriate to avoid the need for two 
motor vehicles when one can serve both purposes. However, truck-type or 
van vehicles shall not be acquired for passenger use merely to avoid 
statutory limitations on the number of passenger motor vehicles which 
may be acquired;
    (g) The use of motor scooters and motorcycles in place of higher 
cost motor vehicles for certain applications within plant areas, such as 
mail and messenger service and small parts and tool delivery. Their 
advantage, however, should be weighed carefully from the standpoint of 
overall economy (comparison with cost for other types of motor vehicles) 
and increased safety hazards, particularly when mingled with other motor 
vehicle traffic; and

[[Page 641]]

    (h) The use of electric vehicles for certain applications. The use 
of these vehicles is encouraged wherever it is feasible to use them to 
further the goal of fuel conservation.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5103  Motor vehicle utilization standards.

    (a) The following average utilization standards are established for 
DOE as objectives for those motor vehicles operated generally for those 
purposes for which acquired:
    (1) Sedans and station wagons, general purpose use--12,000 miles per 
year.
    (2) Light trucks (4x2's) and general purpose vehicles, one ton and 
under (less than 12,500 GVWR)--10,000 miles per year.
    (3) Medium trucks and general purpose vehicles, 1\1/2\ ton through 
2\1/2\ ton (12,500 to 23,999 GVWR)--7,500 miles per year.
    (4) Heavy trucks and general purpose vehicles, three ton and over 
(24,000 GVWR and over)--7,500 miles per year.
    (5) Truck tractors--10,000 miles per year.
    (6) All-wheel-drive vehicles--7,500 miles per year.
    (7) Other motor vehicles--No utilization standards are established 
for other trucks, ambulances, buses, law enforcement motor vehicles, and 
special purpose vehicles. The use of these motor vehicles shall be 
reviewed at least annually by the motor equipment fleet manager and 
action shall be taken and documented to verify that the motor vehicles 
are required to meet programmatic, health, safety, or security 
requirements.
    (b) When operating circumstances prevent the above motor vehicle 
utilization standards from being met, local use objectives must be 
established and met as prescribed in Sec. 109-38.5105 of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5104  Other motor equipment utilization standards.

    No utilization standards are established for motor equipment other 
than motor vehicles. Each DOE office should establish through an 
agreement between the fleet manager and the OPMO utilization criteria 
for other motor equipment including heavy mobile equipment and review, 
adjust, and approve such criteria annually. Utilization of various 
classifications of other motor equipment can be measured through various 
statistics including miles, hours of use, number of trips, and fuel 
consumption. A utilization review of other motor equipment shall be 
performed at least annually by the motor equipment fleet manager to 
justify retainment or disposition of excess equipment not needed to 
fulfill Departmental, programmatic, health, safety, or security 
requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5105  Motor vehicle local use objectives.

    (a) Individual motor vehicle utilization cannot always be measured 
or evaluated strictly on the basis of miles operated or against any 
Department-wide mileage standard. For example, light trucks specifically 
fitted for use by a plumber, welder, etc., in the performance of daily 
work assignments, would have uniquely tailored use objectives, different 
from those set forth for a truck used for general purposes. Accordingly, 
efficient local use objectives, which represent practical units of 
measurement for motor vehicle utilization and for planning and 
evaluating future motor vehicle requirements, must be established and 
documented by the Organizational Motor Equipment Fleet Manager. The 
objectives should take into consideration past performance, future 
requirements, geographical disbursement, and special operating 
requirements.
    (b) These objectives shall be reviewed and adjusted as appropriate, 
but not less often than annually, by the motor equipment fleet manager. 
The reviews shall be documented. The Organizational Motor Equipment 
Fleet Manager is responsible for reviewing and approving in writing all 
proposed local use objectives.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5106  Application of motor vehicle use goals.

    (a) At least annually, the motor equipment fleet manager will review 
motor vehicle utilization statistics and all motor vehicles failing to 
meet the applicable DOE utilization standard or local use objective must 
be identified.
    (b) Prompt action must be initiated to:

[[Page 642]]

    (1) Reassign the underutilized motor vehicles;
    (2) Dispose of the underutilized motor vehicles; or
    (3) Obtain a special justification from users documenting their 
continued requirement for the motor vehicle and any proposed actions to 
improve utilization. Any requirement for underutilized motor vehicles 
which the motor equipment fleet manager proposes to continue in its 
assignment, must be submitted in writing to the Organizational Motor 
Equipment Fleet Manager for approval.
    (c) Both Department-wide standards and local use objectives should 
be applied in such a manner that their application does not stimulate 
motor vehicle use for the purpose of meeting the objective. The ultimate 
standard against which motor vehicle use must be measured is that the 
minimum number of motor vehicles will be retained to satisfy program 
requirements.


<R04>
                      Subpart 109	38.52_Watercraft

the management of watercraft operated by DOE organizations and 
designated contractors. The head of each Departmental organization 
operating watercraft shall issue such supplemental instructions as may 
be needed to ensure the efficient use and management of watercraft.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5201  Definition.

    As used in this subpart the following definition applies:
    Watercraft means any vessel used to transport persons or material on 
water.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5202  Watercraft operations.

    (a) No person may operate a watercraft on a waterway until skill of 
operation and basic watercraft knowledge have been demonstrated.
    (b) Operators of watercraft shall check the vessel to ensure that 
necessary equipment required by laws applicable to the area of operation 
are present, properly stowed, and in proper working order.
    (c) Operators shall comply with all applicable Federal, state, and 
local laws pertaining to the operation of watercraft.
    (d) Operators shall not use watercraft or carry passengers except in 
the performance of official Departmental assignments.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5203  Watercraft identification and numbers.

    Watercraft in the custody of DOE or designated contractors shall 
display identifying numbers, whether issued by the U.S. Coast Guard, 
State, or local field organization, in accordance with applicable 
requirements.

                   Subpart 109	40.1_General Provision


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.000  Scope of part.

    This part describes DOE regulations governing transportation and 
traffic management activities. It also covers arrangements for 
transportation and related services by bill of lading. These regulations 
are designed to ensure that all transportation and traffic management 
activities will be carried out in the manner most advantageous to the 
Government in terms of economy, efficiency, service, environment, safety 
and security.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.000-50  Applicability to contractors.

    DOE-PMR 109-40, Transportation and Traffic Management, should be 
applied to cost-type contractors' transportation and traffic management 
activities. Departure by cost-type contractors from the provisions of 
these regulations may be authorized by the contracting officer provided 
the practices and procedures followed are consistent with the basic 
policy objectives in these regulations and DOE Order 460.2, Departmental 
Materials Transportation and Packaging Management, except to the extent 
such departure is prohibited by statute or executive order.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.102  Representation before regulatory bodies.

    Participation in proceedings related to carrier applications to 
regulatory bodies for temporary or permanent authority to operate in 
specified geographical locations shall be confined to statements or 
testimony in support of a need for service and shall not extend to 
support of individual carriers or groups of carriers.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.103  Selection of carriers.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.103-1  Domestic transportation.

    (a) Preferential treatment, normally, shall not be accorded to any 
mode of transportation (motor, rail, air, water) or to any particular 
carrier when arranging for domestic transportation services. However 
where, for valid reasons, a particular mode of transportation or a 
particular carrier within that mode must be used to meet specific 
program requirements and/or limitations, only that mode or carrier shall 
be considered. Examples of valid reasons for considering only a 
particular mode or carrier are:
    (1) Where only a certain mode of transportation or individual 
carrier is able to provide the needed service or is able to meet the 
required delivery date; and
    (2) Where the consignee's installation and related facilities 
preclude or are not conducive to service by all modes of transportation.
    (b) The following factors are considered in determining whether a 
carrier or mode of transportation can meet DOE's transportation service 
requirements for each individual shipment:
    (1) Availability and suitability of carrier equipment;
    (2) Carrier terminal facilities at origin and destination;
    (3) Pickup and delivery service, if required;
    (4) Availability of required or accessorial and special services, if 
needed;
    (5) Estimated time in transit;
    (6) Record of past performance of the carrier; and
    (7) Availability and suitability of transit privileges.

[[Page 645]]


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.103-2  Disqualification and suspension of carriers.

    Disqualification and suspension are measures which exclude carriers 
from participation, for temporary periods of time, in DOE traffic. To 
ensure that the Government derives the benefits of full and free 
competition of interested carriers, disqualification and suspension 
shall not apply for any period of time longer than necessary to protect 
the interests of the Government.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.103-3  International transportation.

    See 4 CFR 52.2 for a certificate required in nonuse of U.S. flag 
vessels or U.S. flag certificated air carriers.
    (a) U.S.-flag ocean carriers. Arrangements for international ocean 
transportation services shall be made in accordance with the provisions 
of section 901(b) of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, as amended (46 
U.S.C. 1241(b)) concerning the use of privately owned U.S.-flag vessels.
    (b) U.S.-flag certificated air carriers. Arrangements for 
international air transportation services shall be made in accordance 
with the provisions of section 5(a) of the International Air 
Transportation Fair Competition Practices Act of 1974 (49 U.S.C. 1517), 
which requires the use of U.S.-flag certificated air carriers for 
international travel of persons or property to the extent that services 
by these carriers is available.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.105  Use of Government-owned transportation equipment.

    The preferred method of transporting property for the Government is 
through use of the facilities and services of commercial carriers. 
However, Government vehicles may be used when they are available to meet 
emergencies and accomplish program objectives which cannot be attained 
through use of commercial carriers.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.109  Utilization of special contracts and agreements.

    From time to time special transportation agreements are entered into 
on a Government-wide or DOE-wide basis and are applicable, generally, to 
DOE shipments. The HQ DOE Manager, Transportation Operations and 
Traffic, will distribute information on such agreements to field offices 
as it becomes available.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.110  Assistance to economically disadvantaged 

transportation businesses.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.110-1  Small business assistance.

    Consistent with the policies of the Government with respect to small 
businesses, DOE shall place with small business concerns a fair 
proportion of the total purchases and contracts for transportation and 
related services such as packing and crating, loading and unloading, and 
local drayage.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.110-2  Minority business enterprises.

    Minority business enterprises shall have the maximum practical 
opportunity to participate in the performance of Government contracts. 
DOE shall identify transportation-related minority enterprises and 
encourage them to provide services that will support DOE's 
transportation requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.112  Transportation factors in the location of 

Government facilities.

    Transportation rate, charges, and commercial carrier transportation 
services shall be considered and evaluated prior to the selection of new 
site locations and during the planning and construction phases in the 
establishment of leased or relocated Government installations or 
facilities to ensure that consideration is given to the various 
transportation factors that may be involved in this relocation or 
deactivation.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.113  Insurance against transportation hazards.

    The policy of the Government with respect to insurance of its 
property while in the possession of commercial carriers is set forth in 
41 CFR 1-19.107.

<R04>
                   Subpart 109	40.3_Traffic Management


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.301  Traffic management functions administration.

    The DOE traffic management functions are accomplished by established 
field traffic offices under provisions of appropriate Departmental 
directives and Headquarters' staff traffic management supervision.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.302  Standard routing principle.

    (a) Shipments shall be routed using the mode of transportation, or 
individual carriers within the mode, that can provide the required 
service at the lowest overall delivered cost to the Government.
    (b) When more than one mode of transportation, or more than one 
carrier within a mode, can provide equally satisfactory service at the 
same overall cost the traffic shall be distributed as equitably as 
practicable among the modes and among the carriers within the modes.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.303-3  Most fuel efficient carrier/mode.

    When more than one mode, or more than one carrier within a mode, can 
satisfy the service requirements of a specific shipment at the same 
lowest aggregate delivered cost, the carrier/mode determined to be the 
most fuel efficient will be selected. In determining the most fuel 
efficient carrier/mode, consideration will be given to such factors as 
use of the carrier's equipment in ``turn around'' service, proximity of 
carrier equipment to the shipping activity, and ability of the carrier 
to provide the most direct service to the destination points.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.304  Rate tenders to the Government.

    Under the provisions of section 10721 of the Interstate Commerce Act 
(49 U.S.C. 10721), common carriers are permitted to submit to the 
Government tenders which contain rates lower than published tariff rates 
available to the general public. In addition, rates tenders may be 
applied to shipments other than those made by the Government provided 
the total benefits accrue to the Government; that is, provided the 
Government pays the charges or directly and completely reimburses the 
party that initially bears the freight charges (323 ICC 347 and 332 ICC 
161).


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.305-50  Negotiations involving national security.

    Title 49 U.S.C., section 10721(b)(2) provides that rate tenders to 
the Government must be filed by the carriers within the Interstate 
Commerce Commission unless a carrier is advised by the U.S. Government 
that disclosure of a quotation or tender of a rate established * * * for 
transportation provided to the U.S. Government would endanger the 
National security. Carriers will be informed by the negotiating official 
if any quotation or tender to the Department of Energy involves such 
information.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.306-1  Recommended rate tender format.

    Only those rate tenders which have been submitted by the carriers in 
writing shall be considered for use. Carriers should be encouraged to 
use the format ``Uniform Tender of Rates and/or Charges for 
Transportation Services'' when preparing and submitting rate tenders to 
the Government. Rate tenders that are ambiguous in meaning shall be 
resolved in favor of the Government.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.306-2  Required shipping documents and annotations.

    (a) To qualify for transportation under section 10721 rates, 
property must be shipped by or for the Government on:
    (1) Government bills of lading;
    (2) Commercial bills of lading endorsed to show that these bills of 
lading are to be converted to Government bills of lading after delivery 
to the consignee;
    (3) Commercial bills of lading showing that the Government is either 
the consignor or the consignee and endorsed with the following 
statement:

    Transportation hereunder is for the U.S. Department of Energy, and 
the actual total transportation charges paid to the carrier(s) by the 
consignor or consignee are assignable to, and are to be reimbursed by, 
the Government.


[[Page 647]]


    (b) When a rate tender is used for transportation furnished under a 
cost-reimbursable contract, the following endorsement shall be used on 
covering commercial bills of lading:

    Transportation hereunder is for the U.S. Department of Energy, and 
the actual total transportation charges paid to the carrier(s) by the 
consignor or consignee are to be reimbursed by the Government, pursuant 
to cost-reimbursable contract number (insert contract number). This may 
be confirmed by contacting the agency representative at (name and 
telephone number).
    See 332 ICC 161.

    (c) To ensure proper application of a Government rate tender on all 
shipments qualifying for their use, the issuing officer shall show on 
the bills of lading covering such shipments the applicable rate tender 
number and carrier identification, such as: ``Section 10721 tender, ABC 
Transportation Company, ICC No. 374.'' In addition, if commercial bills 
of lading are used, they shall be endorsed as specified above.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.306-3  Distribution.

    Each agency receiving rate tenders shall promptly submit one signed 
copy to the Transportation and Public Utilities Service (WIT), General 
Services Administration, Washington, DC 20407. Also, two copies 
(including at least one signed copy) shall be promptly submitted to the 
General Services Administration (TA), Chester A. Arthur Building, 
Washington, DC 20406.

<R05>
Sec. 109-42.1100.50  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart sets forth policies and procedures for the utilization 
and disposal outside of DOE of excess and surplus personal property 
which has been radioactively or chemically contaminated.


<R05>
Sec. 109-42.1100.51  Policy.

    When the holding organization determines it is appropriate to 
dispose of contaminated personal property, it shall be disposed of by 
DOE in accordance with appropriate Federal regulations governing 
radiation/chemical exposure and environmental contamination. In special 
cases where Federal regulations do not exist or apply, appropriate state 
and local regulations shall be followed.


<R05>
Sec. 109-42.1102-8  United States Munitions List items which require

demilitarization.

    Heads of field organizations shall determine demilitarization 
requirements regarding combat material and military personal property 
using DoD 4160.21-M-1, Defense Demilitarization Manual as a guide.


<R05>
Sec. 109-42.1102-51  Suspect personal property.

    (a) Excess personal property (including scrap) having a history of 
use in an area where radioactive or chemical contamination may occur 
shall be considered suspect and shall be monitored using appropriate 
instruments and techniques by qualified personnel of the DOE office or 
contractor generating the excess.
    (b) With due consideration to the economic factors involved, every 
effort shall be made to reduce the level of contamination of excess or 
surplus personal property to the lowest practicable level. Contaminated 
personal property that exceeds applicable contamination standards shall 
not be utilized or disposed outside DOE.
    (c) If contamination is suspected and the property is of such size, 
construction, or location as to make testing for contamination 
impossible, the property shall not be utilized or disposed outside of 
DOE.


<R05>
Sec. 109-42.1102-52  Low level contaminated personal property.

    If monitoring of suspect personal property indicates that 
contamination does not exceed applicable standards, it may be utilized 
and disposed of in the same manner as uncontaminated personal property, 
provided the guidance in Sec. 109-45.5005-1(a) of this chapter has been 
considered. However, recipients shall be advised where levels of 
radioactive contamination require specific controls for shipment as 
provided in Department of Transportation Regulations (49 CFR parts 171-
179) for shipment of radioactive personal property. In addition, when 
any contaminated personal property is screened within DOE, reported to 
GSA, or otherwise disposed of, the kind and degree of contamination must 
be plainly indicated on all pertinent documents.

Sec. 109-43.304-1  Reporting.


<R05>
Sec. 109-43.304-1.50  DOE reutilization screening.

    (a) Prior to reporting excess personal property to GSA, reportable 
personal property shall be screened for reutilization within DOE through 
the Reportable Excess Automated Property System (REAPS) for a 30-day 
period. REAPS also provides for a 15-day expedited screening period for 
certain categories of personal property for economic development and to 
satisfy urgent conditions.
    (b) An additional 30-day screening period shall be allocated for 
items eligible for screening by educational institutions through ERLE.
    (c) Items in FSCG 66 (Instruments and Laboratory Equipment), 70 
(General Purpose Information Processing Equipment (including firmware)), 
and 99 (Miscellaneous) are reportable when the unit acquisition cost is 
$1,000 or more.
    (d) In exceptional or unusual cases when time is critical, screening 
of excess property may be accomplished by telegram or facsimile with due 
consideration given to the additional costs involved. Examples of 
situations when this method of screening would be used are when there is 
a requirement for quick disposal actions due to unplanned contract 
terminations or facilities closing; to alleviate the paying of storage 
costs; when storage space is critical; to process exchange/sale 
transactions; property dangerous to public health and safety; property 
determined to be classified or otherwise sensitive for reasons of 
national security (when classified communications facilities are used); 
or for hazardous materials which may not be disposed of outside of the 
Department.
    (e) Concurrent DOE and Federal agency screening generally shall not 
be conducted.


<R05>
Sec. 109-43.304-1.51  Transfers within DOE.

    Transfers within DOE generally shall be effected by completion of a 
SF-122, Transfer Order Excess Personal Property. Except for those 
designated contractors authorized by the DOE contracting office to 
execute transfer orders, transfers to DOE contractors must be approved 
by the cognizant DOE property administrator for the contractor receiving 
the property.


<R05>
Sec. 109-43.304-2  Form and distribution of reports.

    Reportable property will be electronically reported by REAPS 
directly to GSA following internal DOE and ERLE screening.


<R05>
Sec. 109-43.304-4  Property at installations due to be discontinued.

    When closing installations, DOE offices shall work with the 
appropriate GSA regional offices to develop site utilization and 
disposal programs:
    (a) In developing a disposal program, property shall be determined

prices by designated contractors.

    (a) Negotiated sales by designated contractors of surplus contractor 
inventory may be made when the DOE contracting officer determines and 
documents prior to the sale that the use of this method of sale is 
justified on the basis of the circumstances enumerated below, provided 
that the Government's interests are adequately protected. These sales 
shall be at prices which are fair and reasonable and not less than the 
proceeds which could reasonably be expected to be obtained if the 
personal property was offered for competitive sale. Specific conditions 
justifying negotiated sales include:
    (1) No acceptable bids have been received as a result of competitive 
bidding under a suitable advertised sale;
    (2) Personal property is of such small value that the proceeds to be 
derived would not warrant the expense of a formal competitive sale;
    (3) The disposal will be to a state, territory, possession, 
political subdivision thereof, or tax-supported agency therein, and the 
estimated fair market value of the personal property and other 
satisfactory terms of disposal are obtained by negotiation;
    (4) The specialized nature and limited use potential of the personal 
property would create negligible bidder interest;
    (5) Removal of the personal property would result in a significant 
reduction in value, or the accrual of disproportionate expense in 
handling; or

[[Page 657]]

    (6) It can be clearly established that such action is in the best 
interests of the Government.
    (b) When determined to be in the best interests of the Government, 
heads of field organizations may authorize fixed-price sales of surplus 
contractor inventory by designated contractors provided:
    (1) The fair market value of the item to be sold does not exceed 
$15,000;
    (2) Adequate procedures for publicizing such sales have been 
established;
    (3) The sales prices are not less than could reasonably be expected 
if competitive bid sales methods were employed and the prices have been 
approved by a reviewing authority designated by the head of the field 
organization; and
    (4) The warranty prescribed in Sec. 109-45.302-50(a) of this 
subpart is obtained when sales are made to employees.

made applicable to the execution, receipt, safeguarding, opening, 
abstraction, and evaluation of bids and awarding contracts, except that

    (g) When appropriate, full and adequate justification for not 
advertising the sale when the fair market value of property sold in this 
manner in any one case exceeds $1,000.
    (h) A justification concerning any award made to other than the high 
bidder.

 Subpart 109	45.51_Disposal of Excess and Surplus Personal Property in 
                              Foreign Areas


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.5100  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart sets forth policies and procedures governing the 
disposal of DOE-owned foreign excess and surplus personal property.


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.5101  Authority.

    The policies and procedures contained in this subpart are issued 
pursuant to the provisions of 40 USC 471, Federal Property and 
Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended. Title IV of the Act 
entitled ``Foreign Excess Property'' provides that, except where 
commitments exist under previous agreements, all excess personal 
property located in foreign areas shall be disposed of by the owning 
agency, and directs that the head of the agency conform to the foreign 
policy of the United States in making such disposals.


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.5102  General.

    Disposal of Government-owned personal property in the custody of DOE 
organizations or its contractors in foreign areas shall be made in an 
efficient and economical manner, and in conformance with the foreign 
policy of the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.5103  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, the following definitions apply:
    Foreign means outside the United States, Puerto Rico, American 
Samoa, Guam, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and the Virgin 
Islands.
    Foreign service post means the local diplomatic or consular post in 
the area where the excess personal property is located.


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.5104  Disposal.


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.5104-1  General.

    Foreign excess personal property which is not required for transfer 
within DOE or to other U.S. Government agencies, except for the personal 
property identified in Sec. 109-45.5005-1(a) of this part, shall be 
considered surplus and may be disposed of by transfer, sale, exchange, 
or lease, for cash, credit, or other property and upon such other terms 
and conditions as may be deemed proper. Such personal property may also 
be donated, abandoned, or destroyed under the conditions specified in 
Sec. 109-45.5105-2(c) of this subpart. Most foreign governments have 
indicated to the U.S. State Department that they wish to be consulted 
before U.S. Government property is disposed of in their countries 
(except in the case of transfers to other U.S. Government agencies). 
Matters concerning customs duties and taxes, or similar charges, may 
require prior agreement with the

[[Page 660]]

foreign government involved. The State Department shall be contacted in 
regard to these issues. Whenever advice or approval of the State 
Department is required by this subpart, it may be obtained either 
through the foreign service post in the foreign area involved or from 
the State Department in Washington, DC. If the issue is to be presented 
to the State Department in Washington, DC, it shall be referred through 
appropriate administrative channels to the Deputy Assistant Secretary 
for Procurement and Assistance Management for review, coordination, and 
handling.


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.5104-2  Methods of disposal.

    (a) Sales of foreign surplus personal property shall be conducted in 
accordance with the following guidelines:
    (1) Generally, all sales of foreign surplus personal property shall 
be conducted under the competitive bid process unless it is advantageous 
and more practicable to the Government not to do so. When competitive 
bids are not solicited, reasonable inquiry of prospective purchasers 
shall be made in order that sales may be made on terms most advantageous 
to the U.S. Government.
    (2) In no event shall any personal property be sold in foreign areas 
without a condition which states that its importation into the United 
States is forbidden unless the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture (in the 
case of any agricultural commodity, food, cotton, or woolen goods), or 
the U.S. Secretary of Commerce (in the case of any other property), has 
determined that the importation of such property would relieve domestic 
shortages or otherwise be beneficial to the economy of the United 
States.
    (3) Sales documents shall provide that the purchaser must pay any 
import duties or taxes levied against personal property sold in the 
country involved and further provide that the amount of this duty or tax 
shall not be included as a part of the price paid the U.S. Government 
for the personal property. In the event the levy is placed upon the 
seller by law, the buyer will be required to pay all such duties or 
taxes and furnish the seller copies of his receipts prior to the release 
of the personal property to him. However, if the foreign government 
involved will not accept payment from the buyer, the seller will collect 
the duties or taxes and turn the amounts collected over to the foreign 
government. Accounting for the amounts collected shall be coordinated 
with the disbursing officer of the nearest United States foreign service 
post. The property shall not be released to the purchaser until the 
disposal officer is satisfied that there is no responsibility for 
payment by the United States (as contrasted to collection by the United 
States) of taxes, duties, excises, etc.
    (4) Certain categories of personal property, including small arms 
and machine guns; artillery and projectiles; ammunition, bombs, 
torpedoes, rockets and guided missiles; fire control equipment and range 
finders; tanks and ordnance vehicles; chemical and biological agents, 
propellants and explosives; vessels of war and special naval equipment; 
aircraft and all components, parts and accessories for aircraft; 
military electronic equipment; aerial cameras, military photo-
interpretation, stereoscopic plotting and photogrammetry equipment; and 
all material not enumerated which is included in the United States 
Munitions List, 22 CFR 121.01, and is subject to disposal restrictions. 
Advance approval must be obtained from the State Department for the sale 
of all such articles. Therefore, prior to the sale of any of the 
articles enumerated in the U.S. Munitions List, the foreign service post 
in the area shall be consulted.
    (5) Prior to the sale of personal property which has a total 
acquisition cost of $250,000 or more, plans for such sale shall be 
reported to the DPMO with ample time to allow consideration of possible 
foreign policy issues and advice thereon from the State Department (see 
section 109-45.5106(a) of this subpart). All proposed sales, regardless 
of the total acquisition cost of the personal property involved, which 
the head of the DOE foreign office believes might have a significant 
economic or political impact in a particular area, shall be discussed 
with the foreign service post.

[[Page 661]]

    (b) While there is authority for exchange or lease of foreign 
surplus personal property, such authority shall be exercised only when 
such action is clearly in the best interests of the U.S. Government. 
Disposals by exchange are subject to the same requirements as disposals 
by sale under Sec. 109-45.5105-2(a) of this subpart.
    (c)(1) Foreign excess or surplus personal property (including 
salvage and scrap) may be donated, abandoned, or destroyed provided:
    (i) The property has no commercial value or the estimated cost of 
its care and handling would exceed the estimated proceeds from its sale; 
and
    (ii) A written finding to that effect is made and approved by the 
Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Energy Policy, Trade and 
Investment.
    (2) No personal property shall be abandoned or destroyed if donation 
is feasible. Donations under these conditions may be made to any agency 
of the U.S. Government, or to educational, public health, or charitable 
nonprofit organizations.
    (3) Foreign excess personal property may also be abandoned or 
destroyed when such action is required by military necessity, safety, or 
considerations of health or security. A written statement explaining the 
basis for disposal by these means and approval by the Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for International Energy Policy, Trade and Investment is 
required.
    (4) Property shall not be abandoned or destroyed in a manner which 
is detrimental or dangerous to public health and safety, or which will 
cause infringement on the rights of other persons.


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.5105  Reports.

    (a) Proposed sales of foreign surplus personal property having an 
acquisition cost of $250,000 or more shall be reported to the DPMO and 
should include all pertinent data, including the following:
    (1) The description of personal property to be sold, including:
    (i) Identification of personal property (description should be in 
terms understandable to persons not expert in technical nomenclature). 
Personal property covered by the U.S. Munitions List and regulations 
pertaining thereto (as published in 22 CFR 121.01) should be clearly 
identified;
    (ii) Quantity;
    (iii) Condition; and
    (iv) Acquisition cost.
    (2) The proposed method of sale (e.g., sealed bid, negotiated sale, 
etc.)
    (3) Any currency to be received and payment provisions (i.e., U.S. 
dollars, foreign currency, or credit, including terms of the proposed 
sale).
    (4) Any restrictions on use of personal property to be sold (such as 
resale of property, disposal as scrap, demilitarization, etc.).
    (5) Any special terms or conditions of sale.
    (6) The categories of prospective purchasers (e.g., host country, 
other foreign countries, special qualifications, etc.).
    (7) How taxes, excises, duties, etc., will be handled.
    (b) Instructions for reporting foreign excess utilization and 
disposal transactions are contained in Chapter III of DOE Order 534.1, 
Accounting.

<R04>
Subpart 109	50.4_Programmatic Disposal to Contractors of DOE Property in 
                            a Mixed Facility


<R05>
Sec. 109-50.400  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart contains policy to be followed when it is proposed to 
sell or otherwise transfer DOE personal property located in a mixed 
facility to the contractor who is the operator of that facility.


<R05>
Sec. 109-50.401  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, the following definitions apply;
    Contractor means the operator of the mixed facility.
    DOE property means DOE-owned personal property located in a mixed 
facility.
    Mixed facility means a partly DOE-owned and partly contractor-owned 
facility. For purposes of this subpart, however, this definition does 
not apply to such a facility operated by an educational or other 
nonprofit institution under a basic research contract with DOE.


<R05>
Sec. 109-50.402  Submission of proposals.

    Proposals involving programmatic disposals of DOE personal property 
located in mixed facilities to contractors operating that facility shall 
be forwarded through the appropriate program organization to the DPMO, 
for review and processing for approval. Each such request shall include 
all information necessary for a proper evaluation of the proposal. The 
proposal shall include, as a minimum:
    (a) The purpose of the mixed facility;
    (b) The description, condition, acquisition cost, and present use of 
the DOE personal property involved.
    (c) The programmatic benefits which could accrue to DOE from the 
disposal to the contractor (including the considerations which become 
important if the disposal is not made);
    (d) The appraised value of the DOE personal property (preferably by 
independent appraisers); and
    (e) The proposed terms and conditions of disposal including:
    (1) Price;

[[Page 667]]

    (2) Priority to be given work for DOE requiring the use of the 
transferred property, and including the basis for any proposed charge to 
DOE for amortizing the cost of plant and equipment items;
    (3) Recapture of the property if DOE foresees a possible future 
urgent need; and
    (4) Delivery of the property, whether ``as is-where is,'' etc.


<R05>
Sec. 109-50.403  Need to establish DOE program benefit.

    When approval for a proposed programmatic disposal of DOE personal 
property in a mixed facility is being sought, it must be established 
that the disposal will benefit a DOE program. For example, approval 
might be contingent on showing that:
    (a) The entry of the contractor as a private concern into the energy 
program is important and significant from a programmatic standpoint; and
    (b) The sale of property to the contractor will remove obstacles 
which otherwise discourage entry into the field.

related EPPMR subparts and will indicate dates for compliance with, and 
cancellation of each issuance.


<R05>
Sec. 115-1.104  Publication of FPMR.


<R05>
Sec. 115-1.104-50  Publication of EPPMR.

    (a) Material published in the EPPMR will generally not be of 
interest to nor directly affect the public. Therefore, most EPPMR 
material will not be published in the Federal Register.
    (b) Arrows printed in the margin of a page indicate material 
changed, deleted, or added by the EPPMR Transmittal Notice cited at the 
bottom of that page. (See GSA, FPMR Amendment Transmittal pages for 
illustrations.)

Regulations (CFR). In FPMR the chapter number is 101 and in EPPMR the 
Chapter number is 115.
    (b) Where EPA Chapter 115 implements Chapter 101 the material will 
be numbered and captioned to correspond to the FPMR part, subpart, 
section or subsection, e.g., 115-1.106 ``Applicability of FPMR'' 
implements 101-1.106 of FPMR.
    (c) Where Chapter 115 supplements the FPMR and deals with subject 
matter not contained in the FPMR, the EPPMR material is numbered to 
follow that which is most closely related to similar material in the 
FPMR, Supplementing material is numbered ``50'' or higher.


<R05>
Sec. 115-1.110  Deviations.

    Where deemed necessary that regulations set forth in the FPMR or 
EPPMR be changed in the interest of program effectiveness, a proposed 
revision will be submitted in accordance with FPR Sec. 1-1.009, to the 
Division of Data and

Sec. 128-1.5002-9  Supply support system.

    The sum of all actions taken in providing buildings, equipment, 
supplies, and services to support program areas.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.5003  Primary authority and responsibility.

    (a) The Attorney General of the United States has the primary 
authority and responsibility for providing direction, leadership, and 
general supervision in the development and administration of an 
effective and efficient supply support system for the Department, to 
include:
    (1) The establishment of Department-wide policies, directions, 
regulations, and procedures satisfying the requirements of law, 
regulations, and sound management practice; and
    (2) The review, evaluation, and improvement of personal property 
management programs, functions, operations, and procedures throughout 
the Department.
    (b) Pursuant to 28 CFR 0.75 and subject to the general supervision 
of the Attorney General and the direction of the Deputy Attorney 
General, the functions described above are assigned to the Assistant 
Attorney General for Administration as delegations of authority.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.5004  Basis for delegations of authority and assignment

of responsibilities.

    Certain personal property management functions can be performed by 
an individual only under a specific grant of authority to that 
individual. Other functions may be performed simply on the basis of 
general instructions or directions or by virtue of an individual 
occupying the position to which the responsibility for the function is 
assigned. In either situation, to eliminate excessive delay and to 
reduce unnecessary involvement of multiple management levels, it is 
considered generally desirable to place authority and responsibility for 
and to exercise property management actions at the lowest organizational 
unit practical. Accordingly, specific redelegations of the authority 
vested in the Assistant Attorney General for Administration are made to 
the heads of bureaus for the personal property management functions 
listed in Sec. 128-1.5005 below. The authority to prescribe and issue 
Department-wide policies, regulations, and procedures for personal 
property management is not redelegated and remains solely within the 
jurisdiction of the Assistant Attorney General for Administration.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.5005  Delegations of authority.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.5005-1  Primary delegations.

    The following authorities are redelegated to the heads of bureaus 
for use within their respective jurisdictions and shall be exercised in 
accordance with the policies and procedures established by the Assistant 
Attorney General for Administration.
    (a) Designating the PMO, for the bureau, within the following 
limitations:
    (1) Only one PMO is to be designated for the bureau, at the bureau 
level. Neither the title designation nor the responsibilities of the PMO 
are to be delegated below that level.
    (2) One or more PC's also may be designated for the bureau, 
depending upon the size and complexity of the organizational structure. 
Each PC is responsible solely for that property within his respective 
jurisdiction. The number and distribution of PC's designated is entirely 
at the option of the head of the bureau.
    (3) There is no restriction on designating a single individual as 
PMO and PC providing that the functions and responsibilities are 
compatible and are within the capabilities of a single person.
    (b) Authorizing exceptions to the FPMR use and replacement standards 
for office machines, furniture, furnishings and typewriters specified in 
Sec. Sec. 101-25.3 and 101-25.4.
    (c) Authorizing exceptions to FPMR replacement standards for 
materials handling equipment specified in Sec. 101-25.304.
    (d) Authorizing the procurement of passenger motor vehicles with 
additional systems or equipment or the procurement of additional systems 
or equipment for passenger motor vehicles already owned or operated by 
the Government, in conformance with Federal Standards No. 122 and Sec. 
101-25.304.

[[Page 682]]

    (e) Authorizing the retention for official use by the bureau of 
abandoned or other unclaimed personal property and of personal property 
which is voluntarily abandoned or forfeited other than by court decree.

    (h) Transferring property forfeited to the Government to other 
authorized recipients or requesting judicial transfer of such property 
from others to the bureau.
    (i) Determining fair market value of abandoned and other unclaimed 
property retained for official use by the bureau, for deposit to a 
special fund for reimbursement of owners.
    (j) Approving claims and reimbursing, less direct costs, former 
owners of abandoned or other unclaimed personal property which has been 
sold or retained for official use.
    (k) Recommending non-Federal grantee excess property screeners to 
GSA as required in FPMR 101-43.320(h).
    (l) When authorized by statutory authority, vesting title to 
Government-furnished personal property in contractors or grantees.
    (m) Acquiring excess personal property from other bureaus and from 
other Federal agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.5005-2  Redelegations of authority.

    (a) The authorities delegated by the Assistant Attorney General for 
Administration to heads of bureaus may, in turn, be redelegated as 
necessary to enable personal property management functions to be

Sec. 128-1.8001  Background.

    The Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 (Act), 42 U.S.C. 7701, 
et seq., as amended, directs the Federal government to establish and 
maintain an effective earthquake hazards reduction program to reduce the 
risks to life and property from future earthquakes. Executive Order 
12699 implements certain provisions of the Act by requiring Federal 
agencies responsible for the design and construction of new buildings to 
develop and implement a seismic safety program. The regulations in this 
subpart implement the Executive Order, and apply to buildings designed 
and constructed under the responsibility of the Department of Justice. 
These regulations do not apply to buildings used by the Department and 
obtained, through purchase or lease, by the General Services 
Administration or other Federal agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.8002  Definitions of terms.

    (a) Construction documents--Detailed plans and specifications for 
the construction of a building.
    (b) Building--Any structure, fully or partially enclosed, used or 
intended for sheltering persons or property.

<R05>
Sec. 128-1.8005  Seismic safety standards.

    (a) To meet the building and construction requirements of this 
subpart, the Department, except as noted, adopts as its seismic safety 
standards the seismic safety levels set forth in the model building 
codes that the Interagency Committee on Seismic Safety in Construction 
(ICSSC) recognizes and recommends as appropriate for implementing the 
Executive Order. The ICSSC, as of the date of this rule, recognizes and 
recommends:
    (1) The 1991 International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO) 
Uniform Building Code (UBC);
    (2) The 1992 Supplement to the Building Officials and Code 
Administrators International (BOCA) National Building Code (NBC); and
    (3) The 1992 Amendments to the Southern Building Code Congress 
(SBCC) Standard Building Code (SBC).
    (b) The seismic design and construction of a covered building shall 
conform to the model code applicable in the locality where the building 
is constructed, unless:
    (1) The building code for the locality provides a higher level of 
seismic safety than provided by the appropriate model code, in which 
case the local code shall be utilized as the standard; or
    (2) The locality does not have seismic safety building requirements, 
in which case the ICSSC model building code appropriate for that 
geographic area shall be utilized as the standard.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.8006  Seismic Safety Program requirements.

    The Department Seismic Safety Coordinator and each Component Seismic 
Safety Coordinator shall ensure that an individual familiar with seismic 
design provisions of the Seismic Safety Standards (appropriate 
standards), or a professional, licensed engineer shall conduct the 
reviews required under this section, as appropriate.
    (a) New building projects. Construction documents initiated after 
August 12, 1993, and which apply to new construction projects, shall 
comply with the appropriate standards and shall be reviewed for 
compliance. Once the reviewer determines that the documents comply, the 
reviewer shall affix his/her signature and seal (if a licensed engineer) 
to the approved documents and provide a statement certifying compliance 
with the appropriate standards.
    (b) Existing building projects. For new buildings with construction 
documents that were initiated prior to August 12, 1993, the documents 
shall be reviewed to determine whether they comply with the appropriate 
standards. If the reviewer determines that the documents comply with the 
standard, the reviewer shall affix his/her signature and seal (if a 
licensed engineer) to the approved documents and provide a statement 
certifying compliance with the appropriate standards. If the reviewer 
determines that seismic deficiencies exist, the appropriate Component 
Head shall ensure completion of one of the following:
    (1) For a new building project for which a contract for construction 
has

[[Page 686]]

not been awarded, the construction documents shall be revised to 
incorporate the appropriate standards. The revised construction 
documents shall then be reviewed for compliance. Once the reviewer 
determines that the documents comply with the standard, the reviewer 
shall affix his/her signature and seal (if a licensed engineer) to the 
approved documents and provide a statement certifying compliance with 
the Department standards.
    (2) For a new building under construction, or for which construction 
has been completed, a corrective action plan shall be devised to bring 
the building into compliance with the appropriate standards. The plan 
shall then be reviewed for compliance. Once the reviewer determines that 
the plan complies with the standard, the reviewer shall affix his/her 
signature and seal (if a licensed engineer) to the approved documents 
and provide a statement certifying compliance with the Department 
standards. The Component Head shall ensure implementation of the 
approved plan.
    (3) For an addition to an existing building, the review shall 
account for, in addition to the requirements provided in paragraphs (b) 
(1) or (2) of this section, as appropriate, any effect the addition will 
have on the seismic resistance of the existing portion of the structure. 
If the reviewer determines that the addition will decrease the level of 
seismic resistance of the existing building, the appropriate Component 
Head shall develop a plan of corrective action to restore the seismic 
integrity of the existing structure. Once the plan of corrective action 
has been accomplished, the reviewer shall verify that the current level 
of seismic resistance of the existing building at least equals the 
seismic resistance level of the building before the addition.
    (c) The Department Seismic Safety Coordinator and each Component 
Seismic Safety Coordinator shall ensure that statements verifying 
compliance made under this subpart have been completed and retained by 
the appropriate contracting officer when the Department contracted for 
design or design review services, or by an individual designated by the 
Component Head where the Department has not contracted for either design 
or design review.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.8007  Reporting.

    The Department shall file reports on the execution of the Executive 
Order as required under the Order, and as required by the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency.

<R05>
Sec. 128-48.102-1  Vesting of title in the United States.

    (a) Abandoned or other unclaimed property, subject to the provisions 
of section 203(m) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services 
Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 484(m)), shall remain in the custody 
of and be the responsibility of the bureau finding such property.
    (b) If the owner of such property is known, the owner shall be 
notified within 20 days of finding such property by certified mail at 
the owner's address of record that the property may be claimed by the 
owner or his designee and that if the property is not claimed within 30 
days from the date the letter of notification is postmarked, the title 
of the property will vest in the United States.
    (c) If the owner of such property is not known and the estimated 
value of the property exceeds $100, the bureau shall post notice within 
20 days of finding such property, which contains the following 
information:
    (1) A description of the property including model or serial numbers, 
if known.
    (2) A statement of the location where the property was found and the 
office that has custody of it.
    (3) A statement that any person desiring to claim the property must 
file with the bureau within 30 days from the date of first publication a 
claim for said property.

[[Page 688]]

    (4) A complete mailing address is to be provided as a point of 
contact within the bureau for any person to obtain additional 
information concerning the property or the procedures involved in filing 
a claim.


Notice must be published once a week for at least three successive 
weeks. Sound judgment and discretion must be used in selecting the 
publication medium. Advertisements should be placed in a publication of 
general circulation within the judicial district where the property was 
found.
    (d) Property, as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section, shall be held for a period of 30 days from the date of the 
first publication of notice. Upon the expiration of this 30-day period, 
title to such property vests in the United States, except that title 
reverts to the owner where a proper claim is filed within three years 
from the date of vesting of title in the United States, but if the 
property has been in official use, transferred for official use, or sold 
at the time the proper claim is approved, title shall not revert back to 
the former owner. The former owner shall instead obtain reimbursement in 
accordance with 41 CFR 101-48.102-4 or 101-48.305-1.
    (e) If the owner of such property is unknown and the estimated value 
of the property is $100 or less, no notice is required, and the property 
shall be held for a period of 30 days from the date of finding the 
property. Upon expiration of this 30-day period, title to such property 
vests in the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 128-48.102-4  Proceeds.

    (a) Records of abandoned or other unclaimed property will be 
maintained in such a manner as to permit identification of the property 
with the original owner, if known, when such property is put into 
official use or transferred for official use by the finding bureau. 
Records will be maintained until the three-year period for filing claims 
has elapsed to enable the bureau to determine the amount of 
reimbursement due to a former owner who has filed a proper claim for

      Subpart 128	50.1_Storage and Care of Seized Personal Property


<R05>
Sec. 128-50.100  Storage and care.

    (a) Each bureau shall be responsible for providing that its seized 
personal property storage facilities meet the safeguarding standards 
applicable to the type of property being stored.
    (b) Each bureau shall be responsible for performing care on its 
seized personal property to prevent the unnecessary deterioration of 
such property. In particular, a bureau preparing a seized vehicle for 
storage should be at a minimum;
    (1) Protect the cooling system from freezing;
    (2) Protect the battery by assuring it is properly watered;
    (3) Protect the tires by inflating to correct pressure;

    (5) Shut all windows and lock all doors and compartments that have 
locks.


<R05>
Sec. 128-50.101  Inventory records.

    Each bureau shall be responsible for establishing and maintaining 
inventory records of its seized personal property to ensure that:
    (a) The date the property was seized is recorded;
    (b) All of the property associated with a case is recorded together 
under the case name and number;
    (c) The location of storage of the property is recorded;
    (d) A well documented chain of custody is kept; and
    (e) All information in the inventory records is accurate and 
current.


<R05>
Sec. 128-50.102  Periodic reviews.

    Each bureau shall be responsible for performing an independent 
accountability review at least once a year to ensure compliance with 
this subpart and with the bureau's procedures for the handling, storage, 
and disposal of its seized personal property. In particular, a bureau 
conducting a review shall verify that the inventory records are 
accurate, current, and are being kept in accordance with established 
inventory procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 128-50.103  Investigation of any discrepancy.

    (a) Upon discovery of any discrepancy between the inventory records 
and the bureau's actual amount of seized personal property, a board of 
survey shall conduct an investigation in accordance with 41 CFR 128-
51.1.
    (b) If the discrepancy cannot be eliminated and involves a shortage, 
the bureau shall notify the U.S. attorney in charge of the litigation 
involving the missing property of the shortage as soon as possible.
    (c) If the discrepancy cannot be eliminated and involves an overage, 
the bureau shall determine if the property has any evidentiary value. If 
the property does have evidentiary value, the property shall be properly 
stored and inventoried. If the property does not have any evidentiary 
value, the bureau shall determine whether the property is forfeitable to 
the United States, voluntarily abandoned, or abandoned. Proper 
proceedings shall be commenced as soon as possible to vest title of the 
forfeitable property in the United States. The voluntarily abandoned and 
abandoned property shall be kept in custody in accordance with 41 CFR 
101-48 and any applicable Justice property management regulations.
