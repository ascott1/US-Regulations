                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 1997), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

Other Provisions Relating to Public Contracts; Subtitle C--Federal 
Property Management Regulations System; Subtitle D is reserved for other 
provisions relating to property management, Subtitle E--Federal 
Information Resources Management Regulations System and Subtitle F--

    Other government-wide procurement regulations relating to public 
contracts appear in chapters 50 through 100, subtitle B.

    The Federal property management regulations in chapter 101 of 
subtitle C are government-wide property management regulations issued by 
the General Services Administration. In the remaining chapters of 
subtitle C are the implementing and supplementing property management 
regulations issued by individual Government agencies. Those regulations 
which implement chapter 101 are numerically keyed to it.

301--304 of subtitle F are issued by the General Services 
Administration.

    Title 41 is composed of four volumes. The chapters in these volumes

<R05>
Sec. 105-1.000-50   Scope of part.

    This part describes the method by which the General Services 
Administration (GSA) implements and supplements the Federal Property 
Management Regulations (FPMR) and implements certain regulations 
prescribed by other agencies. It contains procedures that implement and 
supplement part 101-1 of the FPMR.


<R04>
                   Subpart 105-1.1--Regulations System


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.100   Scope of subpart.

    This subpart establishes the General Services Administration 
Property Management Regulations (GSPMR) and provides certain 
introductory material.


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.101   General Services Administration Property Management Regulations.

    The General Services Administration Property Management Regulations 
(GSPMR) include the GSA property management policies and procedures 
which, together with the Federal Property Management Regulations, 
certain regulations prescribed by other agencies, and various GSA orders 
govern the management of property and records and certain related 
activities of GSA. They may contain policies and procedures of interest 
to other agencies and the general public and are prescribed by the 
Administrator of General Services in this chapter 105.


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.101-50   Exclusions.

    (a) Certain GSA property management and related policies and 
procedures which come within the scope of this chapter 105 nevertheless 
may be excluded therefrom when there is justification. These exclusions 
may include the following categories:
    (1) Subject matter that bears a security classification;
    (2) Policies and procedures that are expected to be effective for a 
period of less than 6 months;
    (3) Policies and procedures that are effective on an experimental 
basis for a reasonable period;
    (4) Policies and procedures pertaining to other functions of GSA as 
well as property management functions and there is need to make the 
issuance available simultaneously to all GSA employees involved; and
    (5) Where speed of issuance is essential, numerous changes are 
required in chapter 105, and all necessary changes cannot be made 
promptly.
    (b) Property management policies and procedures issued in other than 
the FPMR system format under paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) of this section, 
shall be codified into chapter 105 at the earliest practicable date, but 
in any event not later than 6 months from date of issuance.


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.102  Relationship of GSPMR to FPMR.

    (a) GSPMR implement and supplement the FPMR and implement certain 
other regulations. They are part of the General Services Administration 
Regulations System. Material published in the FPMR (which has 
Governmentwide applicability) becomes effective throughout GSA upon the 
effective date of the particular FPMR material. In general, the FPMR 
that are implemented and supplemented shall not be repeated, 
paraphrased, or otherwise restated in chapter 105.
    (b) Implementing is the process of expanding upon the FPMR or other 
Government-wide regulations. Supplementing is the process of prescribing 
material for which there is no

[[Page 10]]

counterpart in the Government-wide regulations.
    (c) GSPMR may deviate from the regulations that are implemented when 
a deviation (see Sec. 105-1.110) is authorized in and explicitly 
referenced to such regulations. Where chapter 105 contains no material 
implementing the FPMR, the FPMR shall govern.


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.104   Publication of GSPMR.

    (a) Most GSPMR are published in the Federal Register. This practice 
helps to ensure that interested business concerns, other agencies, and 
the public are apprised of GSA policies and procedures pertaining to 
property and records management and certain related activities.
    (b) Most GSPMR are published in cumulative form in chapter 105 of 
title 41 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The Federal Register and 
title 41 of the Code of Federal Regulations may be purchased from the 
Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, 
D.C. 20402.


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.106   Applicability.

    Chapter 105 applies to the management of property and records and to 
certain other programs and activities of GSA. Unless otherwise 
specified, chapter 105 applies to activities outside as well as within 
the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.109   Numbering.


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.109-50   General plan.

    Chapter 105 is divided into parts, subparts, and further 
subdivisions as necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.109-51   Arrangement.

    (a) Parts 105-2 through 105-49 are used for GSPMR that implement 
regulations in the corresponding parts of chapter 101. This practice 
results in comparable grouping by subject area without establishment of 
subchapters.
    (b) Parts 105-50 and above are used for GSPMR that supplement 
regulations in the FPMR and implement regulations of other agencies. 
Part numbers are assigned so as to accomplish a similar subject area 
grouping. Regulations on advisory committee management are recodified as 
part 105-54 to place them in the appropriate subject area category. 
Regulations on standards of conduct remain in part 105-735 because the 
number 735 identifies regulations of the U.S. Civil Service Commission 
and various civil agencies on this subject.


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.109-52   Cross-references.

    (a) Within chapter 105, cross-references to the FPMR shall be made 
in the same manner as used within the FPMR. Illustrations of cross-
references to the FPMR are:

    (1) Part 101-3;
    (2) Subpart 101-3.1;
    (3) Sec. 101-3.413-5.

    (b) Within chapter 105, cross-references to parts, subparts, 
sections, and subsections of chapter 105 shall be made in a manner 
generally similar to that used in making cross-references to the FPMR. 
For example, this paragraph would be referenced as Sec. 105-1.109-52(b).


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.110   Deviation.

    (a) In the interest of establishing and maintaining uniformity to 
the greatest extent feasible, deviations; i.e., the use of any policy or 
procedure in any manner that is inconsistent with a policy or procedure 
prescribed in the Federal Property Management Regulations, are 
prohibited unless such deviations have been requested from and approved 
by the Administrator of General Services or his authorized designee. 
Deviations may be authorized by the Administrator of General Services or 
his authorized designee when so doing will be in the best interest of 
the Government. Request for deviations shall clearly state the nature of 
the deviation and the reasons for such special action.
    (b) Requests for deviations from the FPMR shall be sent to the

to discrimination on the basis of handicap, nor may the agency establish 
requirements for the programs or activities of licenses or certified 
entities that subject qualified individuals with handicaps to 
discrimination on the basis of handicap. However, the programs or 
activities of entities that are licensed or certified by the agency are 
not, themselves, covered by part.
    (b) The exclusion of persons without handicaps from the benefits of 
a program limited by Federal statute or Executive order to individuals

<R05>
Sec. 105-8.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Secs. 105-8.150 and 105-8.154, no 
qualified individual with handicaps shall, because

[[Page 15]]

the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals 
with handicaps, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from 
participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any 
program or activity conducted by the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 105-8.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.


<R05>
Sec. 105-8.150-1  General.

    The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the 
program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible 
to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This section does not--
    (a) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps; or
    (b) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the 
agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment 
of significant historic features of an historic property.


<R05>
Sec. 105-8.150-2   Methods.

    (a) General. The agency may comply with the requirements of 
Sec. 105-8.150 through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment 
of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to 
beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible 
sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new 
facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that 
result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and 
usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is not required to make 
structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are 
effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in 
making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility 
requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations 
implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the 
requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those 
methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with 
handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (b) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 105-8.105-1 in historic preservation programs, the agency shall 
give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals 
with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to a historic 
property is not required because of Secs. 105-8.105-1(b) or 105-8.154 
alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include--
    (1) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those 
portions of a historic property that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible;
    (2) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or 
through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible; or
    (3) Adopting other innovative methods.


<R05>
Sec. 105-8.150-3  Time period for compliance.

    The agency shall comply with the obligations established under 
Sec. 105-8.150 by May 7, 1991; except where structural changes in 
facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by March 8, 1994, 
but in any event as expeditiously as possible.


<R05>
Sec. 105-8.150-4  Transition plan.

    In the event that structural changes to facilities will be 
undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, 
by March 9, 1992; the transition plan setting forth the steps necessary 
to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to 
interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or 
organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in 
the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral 
and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for 
public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (a) Identify physical obstacles in the facilities occupied by GSA 
that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to 
individuals with handicaps;

[[Page 16]]

    (b) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (c) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with Sec. 105-8.150 and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (d) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 105-8.151  Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, of for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards 
of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established 
in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this 
section.


<R05>
Sec. 105.8.152  Program accessibility: Assignment of space.

    (a) When GSA assigns or reassigns space to an agency, it shall 
consult with the agency to ensure that the assignment or reassignment 
will not result in one or more of the agency's programs or activities 
being inaccessible to individuals with handicaps.
    (b) Prior to the assignment or reassignment of space to an agency, 
GSA shall inform the agency of the accessibility, and/or the absence of 
accessibility features, of the space in which GSA intends to locate the 
agency. If the agency informs GSA that the use of the space will result 
in one or more of the agency's programs being inaccessible, GSA shall 
take one or more of the following actions to make the programs 
accessible:
    (1) Arrange for alterations, improvements, and repairs to buildings 
and facilities;
    (2) Locate and provide alternative space that will not result in one 
or more of the agency's programs being inaccessible; or
    (3) Take any other actions that result in making this agency's 
programs accessible.

The responsibility for payment to make the physical changes in the space 
shall be assigned on a case-by-case basis as agreed to by GSA and the 
user agency, dependent on individual circumstances.
    (c) GSA may not require the agency to accept space that results in 
one or more of the agency's programs being inaccessible.


<R05>
Sec. 105-8.153  Program accessibility: Interagency cooperation.


<R05>
Sec. 105-8.153-1  General.

    GSA, upon request from an occupant agency engaged in the development 
of a transition plan under section 504, shall participate with the 
occupant agency in the development and implementation of the transition 
plan and shall provide information and guidance to the occupant agency. 
Upon request, GSA shall conduct space inspections to assist the agency 
in determining whether a current assignment of space results in one or 
more of the occupant agency's programs or activities being inaccessible. 
GSA shall provide the occupant agency with a written summary of 
significant findings and recommendations, together with data concerning 
programmed repairs and alterations planned by GSA and alterations that 
can be effected by the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 105-8.153-2  Requests from occupant agencies.

    (a) Upon receipt of an occupant agency's request for new space, 
additional space, relocation to accessible space, alterations, or other 
actions under GSA's control that are needed to ensure program 
accessibility in the requesting agency's program(s) as required by the 
agency's section 504 transition plan, GSA shall assist or advise the 
requesting agency in providing or arranging for the requested action 
within the timeframes specified in the requesting agency's transition 
plan.
    (b) If the requested action cannot be completed within the time 
frame specified in an agency's transition plan, GSA shall so advise the 
requesting agency within 30 days of the request by submitting, after 
consultation with the agency, a revised schedule specifying the date by 
which the action shall be

[[Page 17]]

completed. If the delay in completing the action results in or continues 
the inaccessibility of the requesting agency's program, GSA and the 
agency shall, after consultation, take interim measures to make the 
agency's program accessible.
    (c) If GSA determines that it is unable to take the requested 
action, GSA shall--
    (1) Within 30 days, set forth in writing to the requesting agency 
the reasons for denying the agency's request, and
    (2) Within 90 days, propose to the requesting agency other methods 
for making the agency's program accessible.
    (d) Receipt of a copy of an occupant agency's transition plan under 
section 504 shall constitute notice to GSA of the requested actions in 
the transition plan and of the times frames which the actions are 
required to be completed.


<R05>
Sec. 105-8.154  Program accessibility: Exceptions.

    Sections 105-8.150, 105-8.152, and 105-8.153 do not require GSA to 
take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental 
alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial 
and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where GSA personnel 
believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program 
or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative 
burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance would 
result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would 
result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Administrator 
or his or her designee after considering all resources available for use 
in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and 
must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching 
that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in 
such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that 
individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the 
program or activity.
Secs. 105-8.155--105-8.159  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 105-8.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
individual with handicaps.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate 
with persons with impaired hearing.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 150.8.160 would 
result in such alteration or burdens.

[[Page 18]]

The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens 
must be made by the Administrator or his or her designee after 
considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and

alteration or such burdnes, the agency shall take any other action that 
would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would 
nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals 
with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or 
activity.

    (b) The complainant and respondent shall be parties to the hearing. 
Any interested person or organization may petition to become a party or 
amicus curiae. The ALJ may, in his or her discretion, grant such a

interest in the proceedings and the participation will not unduly delay 
the outcome and may contribute materially to the proper disposition of 
the proceedings.

shall be conducted in conformity with 5 U.S.C. 554-557 (sections 5-8 of

to maintain order. He or she shall have all powers necessary to these 
ends, including (but not limited to) the power to--

prehearing conferences and issue notices thereof;

a hearing, or to consider other matters that may aid in the expeditious 
disposition of the hearing;

to the various issues in the hearing and to exchange such statements 
with all other parties;
    (4) Examine witnesses and direct witnesses to testify;
    (5) Receive, rule on, exclude, or limit evidence;
    (6) Rule on procedural items pending before him or her; and
    (7) Take any action permitted to the ALJ as authorized by this part, 
or by the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551-
559).
    (d) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings 
conducted pursuant to Sec. 105-8.170-11, but rules or principles 
designed to assure production of credible evidence available and to 
subject testimony to cross-examination shall be applied by the ALJ 
whenever reasonably necessary. The ALJ may exclude irrelevant, 
immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other 
evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by 
the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments 
advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the 
oral evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated 
for the record. All decisions shall be based upon the hearing record.

hearing shall, at the request of the ALJ and with the approval of the 
employing agency, be on official duty status during any period of 
absence from normal duties caused by their testimony, and shall not 
receive witness fees.
    (3) The fees and expenses of other persons called to testify at a 
hearing shall be paid by the party requesting their appearance.
    (4) The ALJ may require the agency to pay travel expenses necessary 
for the complainant to attend the hearing.

the ALJ and court reporter.
    (6) All other expenses shall be paid by the party, the intervening 
party, or amicus curiae incurring them.
    (f) The ALJ shall submit in writing recommended findings of fact, 
conclusions of law, and remedies to all parties and the Special Counsel 
for Ethics and Civil Rights within 30 days after receipt of the hearing 
transcripts, or within 30 days after the conclusion of the hearing if no 
transcript is made. This time limit may be extended with the permission 
of the Special Counsel.
    (g) Within 15 days after receipt of the recommended decision of the 
ALJ any party may file exceptions to the decision with the Speical 
Counsel. Thereafter, each party will have ten days to file reply 
exceptions with the Special Counsel.


<R05>
Sec. 105-8.170-12  Decision.

    (a) The Special Counsel shall make the decision of the agency based 
on information in the investigative record and, if a hearing is held, on 
the hearing record. The decision shall be made within 60 days of receipt 
of the transmittal of the notice of appeal and investitive record 
pursuant to Sec. 105-8.170-9(c) or after the period for filing 
exceptions ends, which ever is applicable. If the Special Counsel for 
Ethics and Civil Rights determines that he or she needs additional 
information from any party, he or she shall request the information and 
provide the other party or parties an opportunity to respond to that 
information. The Special Counsel shall have 60 days from receipt of the 
additional information to render the decision on the appeal. The Special 
Counsel shall transmit his or her decision by letter to the parties. The 
time limits established in this paragraph may be extended with the 
permission of the Assistant Attorney General. The decision shall set 
forth the findings, remedial action required, and reasons for the 
decision. If the decision is based on a hearing record, the Special 
Counsel shall consider the recommended decision of the ALJ and render a 
final decision based on the entire record. The Special Counsel may also 
remand the hearing record to the ALJ for a fuller development of the 
record.
    (b) Any respondent required to take action under the terms of the 
decision of the agency shall do so promptly. The Official may require 
periodic compliance reports specifying--
    (1) The manner in which compliance with the provisions of the 
decision has been achieved;
    (2) The reasons any action required by the final decision has not 
yet been taken; and
    (3) The steps being taken to ensure full compliance. The Official 
may retain responsibility for resolving disagreements that arise between 
the parties over interpretation fo the final agency decision or for 
specific adjudicatory decisions arising out of implementation.


<R05>

agreement between GSA and the requesting governmental unit.

Sec. 105-50.304a   Deposits.

    Reimbursements to GSA for furnishing special or technical services 
to State and local units of government will be deposited to the credit 
of the appropriation from which the cost of providing such services has 
been paid or is to be charged if such reimbursements are authorized.

which instance the actual cost thereof shall be charged.

Personnel Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. 4742), admit employees of State and

<R05>
Sec. 105-54.000  Scope of part.

    This part sets forth policies and procedures in GSA regarding the 
establishment, operation, termination, and control of advisory 
committees for which GSA has responsibility. It implements the Federal 
Advisory Committee Act (Pub. L. 92-463), which authorizes a system 
governing the establishment and operation of advisory committees in the 
executive branch of the Federal Government, and Executive Order 11686 of 
October 7, 1972, which directs the heads of all executive departments 
and agencies to take appropriate action to ensure their ability to 
comply with the provisions of the Act.


<R04>
                  Subpart 105-54.1--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.101  Applicability.

    This part 105-54 applies to all advisory committees for which GSA 
has responsibility. This part also applies to any committee that advises 
GSA officials even if the committee were not established for that 
purpose. This applicability, however, is limited to the period of the 
committee's use as an advisory body. This part does not apply to:
    (a) An advisory committee exempted by an Act of Congress;
    (b) A local civic group whose primary function is to render a public 
service in connection with a Federal program;
    (c) A State or local committee, council, board, commission, or 
similar group established to advise or make recommendations to State or 
local officials or agencies;
    (d) A meeting initiated by the President or one or more Federal 
official(s) for the purpose of obtaining advice or recommendations from 
one individual;
    (e) A meeting with a group initiated by the President or one or more 
Federal official(s) for the sole purpose of exchanging facts or 
information;
    (f) A meeting initiated by a group with the President or one or more 
Federal official(s) for the purpose of expressing the group's views, 
provided that the President or Federal official(s) does not use the 
group recurrently as a preferred source of advice or recommendations;
    (g) A committee that is established to perform primarily operational 
as opposed to advisory functions. Operational functions are those 
specifically provided by law, such as making or implementing Government 
decisions or policy. An operational committee would be covered by the 
Act if it becomes primarily advisory in nature;
    (h) A meeting initiated by a Federal official(s) with more than one 
individual for the purpose of obtaining the advice of individual 
attendees and not for the purpose of utilizing the group to obtain 
consensus advice or recommendations. However, such a group would be 
covered by the Act when an agency accepts the group's deliberations as a 
source of consensus advice or recommendations;
    (i) A meeting of two or more advisory committee or subcommittee 
members convened solely to gather information or conduct research for a 
chartered advisory committee, to analyze relevant issues and facts, or 
to draft proposed position papers for deliberation by the advisory 
committee or a subcommittee of the advisory committee; and
    (j) A committee composed wholly of full-time officers or employees 
of the Federal Government.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.102  Definitions.

    (a) The term ``advisory committee'' means any committee, board, 
commission, council, conference, panel, task force, or other similar 
group or any subcommittee thereof that is:
    (1) Established by statute,
    (2) Established or utilized by the President, or
    (3) Established or utilized by any agency official to obtain advice 
or recommendations that are within the scope of his/her responsibilies.

The term ``advisory committee'' excludes the Advisory Committee on 
Intergovernmental Relations and any

[[Page 36]]

committees composed wholly of full-time officers or employees of the 
Federal Government.
    (b) ``Presidential advisory committee'' means any committee that 
advises the President. It may be established by the President or by the 
Congress, or may be used by the President to obtain advice or 
recommendations.
    (c) ``Independent Presidential advisory committee'' means any 
Presidential advisory committee not assigned by the President, or the 
President's delegate, or by the Congress in law, to an agency for 
administrative and other support and for which the Administrator of 
General Services may provide administrative and other support on a 
reimbursable basis.
    (d) ``Committee member'' means an individual who serves by 
appointment on a committee and has the full right and obligation to 
participate in the activities of the committee, including voting on 
committee recommendations.
    (e) ``Staff member'' means any individual who serves in a support 
capacity to an advisory committee.
    (f) ``Secretariat'' means the General Services Administration's 
Committee Management Secretariat. Established pursuant to the Federal 
Advisory Committee Act, it is responsible for all matters relating to 
advisory committees, and carries out the Administrator's 
responsibilities under the Act and Executive Order 12024.
    (g) ``Utilized'' (or used), as stated in the definition of 
``advisory committee'' above, refers to a situation in which a GSA 
official adopts a committee or other group composed in whole or in part 
of other than full-time Federal officers or employees with an 
established existence outside GSA as a preferred source from which to 
obtain advice or recommendations on a specific issue or policy within 
the scope of his/her responsibilities in the same manner as that 
official would obtain advice or recommendations from an established 
advisory committee.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.103  Policy.

    The basic GSA policy on committee management is as follows:
    (a) Advisory committees will be formed or used by GSA only when 
specifically authorized by law, or by the President, or specifically 
determined as a matter of formal record by the Administrator of General 
Services to be in the public interest in connection with the performance 
of duties imposed on GSA by law;
    (b) Advisory committees will not be used to administer a function 
that is the assigned responsibility of a service or staff office;
    (c) The assigned responsibility of a GSA official may not be 
delegated to any committee;
    (d) No advisory committee may be used for functions that are not 
solely advisory unless specifically authorized by statute or 
Presidential directive. Making policy decisions and determining action 
to be taken with respect to any matter considered by an advisory 
committee is solely the responsibility of GSA; and
    (e) In carrying out its responsibilities, GSA will consult with and 
obtain the advice of interested groups substantially affected by its 
programs. The use of advisory committees for this purpose is considered 
to be in the public interest and necessary for the proper performance by 
GSA of its assigned functions.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.104  Responsibilities.

    (a) Responsibility for coordination and control of committee 
management in GSA is vested in the Associate Administrator for 
Administration, who serves as the GSA Committee Management Officer 
(CMO). This Officer carries out the functions prescribed in section 8(b) 
of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. In doing so, the Officer controls 
and supervises the establishment, procedures, and accomplishments of 
GSA-sponsored advisory committees. The Organization and Productivity 
Improvement Division, Office of Management Services, Office of 
Administration, provides staff resources and furnishes the Staff Contact 
Person (SCP) to the CMO.
    (b) The Head of each Service and Staff Office and each Regional 
Administrator selects a Committee Management Officer (CMO) to coordinate 
and control committee management within the service, staff office, or 
regional office and to act as liaison to the GSA

[[Page 37]]

Committee Management Officer. The duties of the CMOs are as follows:
    (1) Assemble and maintain the reports, records, and other papers of 
any GSA-sponsored committee during its existence (Arrangements may be 
made, however, for the Government chairperson or other GSA 
representative to retain custody of reports, records, and other papers 
to facilitate committee operations. After the committee is terminated, 
all committee records are disposed of following existing regulations.); 
and
    (2) Under agency regulations in 41 CFR 105-60, carry out the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552 with respect to the reports, records, and 
other papers of GSA-sponsored advisory committees.


<R04>
         Subpart 105-54.2--Establishment of Advisory Committees


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.200  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes the policy and procedures for establishing 
advisory committees within GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.201  Proposals for establishing advisory committees.

    (a) The Administrator approves the establishment of all GSA Federal 
Advisory Committees.
    (b) When it is decided that it is necessary to establish a 
committee, the appropriate Head of the Service or Staff Office (HSSO) 
must consider the functions of similar committees in GSA to ensure that 
no duplication of effort will occur.
    (c) The HSSO proposes the establishment of a Central Office or 
regional advisory committee within the scope of assigned program 
responsibilities. In doing so, the HSSO assures that advisory committees 
are established only if they are essential to the conduct of agency 
business. Advisory committees are established only if there is a 
compelling need for the committees, the committees have a truly balanced 
membership, and the committees conduct their business as openly as 
possible under the law and their mandate. Each proposal is submitted to 
the GSA Committee Management Officer for review and coordination and 
includes:
    (1) A letter addressed to the Committee Management Secretariat 
signed by the HSSO with information copies for the Administrator, Deputy 
Administrator, the Associate Administrator for Congressional and 
Industry Relations, and the Special Counsel for Ethics and Civil Rights, 
describing the nature and purpose of the proposed advisory committee; 
why it is essential to agency business and in the public interest; why 
its functions cannot be performed by an existing committee of GSA, by 
GSA, or other means such as a public hearing; and the plans to ensure 
balanced membership;
    (2) A notice for publication in the Federal Register containing the 
Administrator's certification that creation of the advisory committee is 
in the public interest and describing the nature and purpose of the 
committee; and
    (3) A draft charter for review by the Committee Management 
Secretariat.
    (d) Subcommittees that do not function independently of the full or 
parent advisory committee need not follow the requirements of paragraph 
(c) of this section. However, they are subject to all other requirements 
of the Federal Advisory Committee Act.
    (e) The requirements of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section 
apply to any subcommittee of a chartered committee, whether its members 
are drawn in whole or in part from the full or parent advisory 
committee, that functions independently of the parent advisory 
committee, such as by making recommendations directly to a GSA official 
rather than for consideration by the chartered advisory committee.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.202  Review and approval of proposals.

    (a) The GSA Committee Management Officer reviews each proposal to 
make sure it conforms with GSA policies and procedures. The Officer 
sends the letter of justification, including the draft charter, to the 
Committee Management Secretariat. The Secretariat reviews the proposal 
and provides its views within 15 calendar days of receipt, if possible. 
The Administrator retains final authority for establishing a particular 
advisory committee.

[[Page 38]]

    (b) When the Secretariat notifies the Officer that establishing the 
committee conforms with the Federal Advisory Committee Act, the Officer 
obtains the Administrator's approval of the charter and the Federal 
Register notice. The Officer publishes the notice in the Federal 
Register at least 15 calendar days before the filing of the charter 
under Sec. 105-54.203 with the standing committees of the Senate and the 
House of Representatives having legislative jurisdiction over GSA. The 
date of filing constitutes the date of establishment.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.203  Advisory committee charters.

    No advisory committee may operate, meet, or take any action until 
the Administrator approves its charter and the Committee Management 
Officer sends a copy of it to the standing committees of the Senate and 
the House of Representatives having legislative jurisdiction over GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.203-1  Preparation of charters.

    Each committee charter contains the following information:
    (a) The committee's official designation;
    (b) The committee's objectives and the scope of its activities;
    (c) The period of time necessary for the committee to carry out its 
purpose (if the committee is intended to function as a standing advisory 
committee, this should be made clear);
    (d) The official to whom the committee reports, including the 
official's name, title, and organization;
    (e) The agency and office responsible for providing the necessary 
support for the committee;
    (f) A description of the duties for which the committee is 
responsible (if the duties are not solely advisory, the statutory or 
Presidential authority for additional duties shall be specified);
    (g) The estimated annual operating costs in dollars and person-years 
for the committee;
    (h) The estimated number and frequency of committee meetings;
    (i) The committee's termination date, if it is less than 2 years 
from the date of its establishment; and

Sec. 105-54.204  Advisory committee membership.

    (a) Advisory committees that GSA establishes represent the points of 
view of the profession, industry, or other group to which it relates, 
taking into account the size, function, geographical location, 
affiliation, and other considerations affecting the character of a 
committee. To ensure balance, the agency considers for membership a 
cross-section of interested persons and groups with professional or 
personal qualifications or experience to contribute to the functions and 
tasks to be performed. This should be construed neither to limit the 
participation nor to compel the selection of any particular individual 
or group to obtain different points of view relevant to committee 
business. The Administrator designates members, alternates, and 
observers, as appropriate, of advisory committees. He/she designates a 
Federal officer or employee to chair or attend each meeting of each 
advisory committee. The Administrator also designates GSA employees to 
serve on advisory committees sponsored by other Government agencies. The 
HSSO or Regional Administrator submits nominations and letters of 
designation for the Administrator's signature to

[[Page 39]]

the GSA Committee Management Officer and to the Special Counsel for 
Ethics and Civil Rights for review and forwarding to the Administrator.
    (b) Discrimination is prohibited on the basis of race, color, age, 
national origin, religion, sex, or mental and physical handicap in 
selecting advisory committee members.
    (c) Nominees for membership must submit a Statement of Employment 
and Financial Interests (provided to the nominee by the HSSO or Regional 
Administrator) and may not be appointed until cleared by the Designated 
Agency Ethics Official.

             Subpart 105-54.3--Advisory Committee Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.300  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart sets forth the procedures that will be followed in the 
operation of advisory committees within GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.301  Meetings.

    (a) Each GSA advisory committee meeting is open to the public unless 
the Administrator decides otherwise;
    (b) Each meeting is held at a reasonable time and in a place 
reasonably accessible to the public;
    (c) The meeting room size is sufficient to accommodate committee 
members, committee or GSA staff, and interested members of the public;
    (d) Any private citizen is permitted to file a written statement 
with the advisory committee;
    (e) Any private citizen is permitted to speak at the advisory 
committee meeting, at the chairperson's discretion;
    (f) All persons attending committee meetings at which classified 
information will be considered are required to have an adequate security 
clearance;
    (g) The Designated Federal Officer (who may be either full time or 
permanent part-time) for each advisory committee and its subcommittees 
does the following:
    (1) Approves or calls the meetings of the advisory committee;
    (2) Approves the meeting agenda, which lists the matters to be 
considered at the meeting and indicates whether any part of the meeting 
will be closed to the public under the Government in the Sunshine Act (5 
U.S.C. 552b(c)). Ordinarily, copies of the agenda are distributed to 
committee members before the date of the meeting;
    (3) Attends all meetings (no part of a meeting may proceed in the 
Designated Federal Officer's absence);
    (4) Adjourns the meeting when he or she determines that adjournment 
is in the public interest; and
    (5) Chairs the meeting when asked to do so.
    (h) The Committee Chairperson makes sure that detailed minutes of 
each meeting are kept and certifies to their accuracy. The minutes 
include:
    (1) Time, date, and place;
    (2) A list of the following persons who were present;
    (i) Advisory committee members and staff;
    (ii) Agency employees; and
    (iii) Private citizens who presented oral or written statements;
    (3) The estimated number of private citizens present;
    (4) An accurate description of each matter discussed and the 
resolution of the matter, if any; and
    (5) Copies of each report or other document the committee received, 
issued, or approved.
    (i) The responsible HSSO or the Regional Administrator publishes at 
least 15 calendar days before the meeting a notice in the Federal 
Register that includes:
    (1) The name of the advisory committee as chartered;
    (2) The time, date, place, and purpose of the meeting;
    (3) A summary of the agenda; and
    (4) A statement whether all or part of the meeting is open to the 
public of closed; and if closed, the reasons why, and citing the 
specific exemptions of the Government is the Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C. 
552b) as the basis for closure;
    (j) In exceptional circumstances and when approved by the General 
Counsel or designee, less than 15 calendar days notice may be given, 
provided the reasons for doing so are included in the committee meeting 
notice published in the Federal Register;
    (k) Notices to be published in the Federal Register are submitted to 
the Federal Register Liaison Officer

[[Page 40]]

(CAID). At least five workdays are needed for printing of the notice;
    (l) Meetings may also be announced by press release, direct mail, 
publication in trade and professional journals, or by notice to special 
interest and community groups affected by the Committee's deliberations. 
This procedure cannot be a substitute for Federal Register publication;
    (m) The fact that a meeting may be closed to the public under the 
exemptions of the Government in the Sunshine Act does not relieve GSA of 
the requirement to publish a notice of it in the Federal Register. The 
Administrator may authorize an exception to this requirement for reasons 
of national security if the HSSO requests it at least 30 calendar days 
before the meeting, with the concurrence of the General Counsel of 
designee.
    (n) An advisory committee meeting is not open to the public, nor is 
the attendance, appearance, or filing of statements by interested 
persons permitted, if the Administrator decides that the meeting is 
exempted under the Government in the Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C. 552b (c)) 
and there is sufficient reason to invoke the exemption. If only part of 
the meeting concerns exempted matters, only that part is closed. The 
HSSO or Regional Administrator submits any decisions concerning the 
closing of meetings in writing to the Administrator for approval at 
least 30 calendar days in advance of the meeting. These decisions 
clearly set forth the reasons for doing so, citing the specific 
exemptions used from the Government in the Sunshine Act in the meeting 
notice published in the Federal Register. They are made available to the 
public on request. The Administrator may waive the 30-day requirement 
when a lesser period of time is requested and adequately justified.
    (o) If any meeting or portion of a meeting is closed to public 
attendance, the advisory committee issues a report at lease annually 
setting forth a summary of its activities and such related matters as 
would be informative to the public, consistent with the policy of 5 
U.S.C. 552(b). Notice of the availability of the report and instructions 
on how to gain access to it are published in the Federal Register no 
later than 60 days after its completion. In addition, copies of the 
report are filed with the Library of Congress.
    (p) The General Counsel reviews all requests to close meetings.
    (q) The HSSO or Regional Administrator publishes the meeting notices 
in the Federal Register, including the reasons why all or part of the 
meeting is closed, citing the specified exemptions used from the 
Government in the Sunshine Act.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.302  Committee records and reports.

    (a) Subject to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), the 
records, reports, transcripts, minutes, appendixes, working papers, 
drafts, studies, agenda, or other documents that were available to or 
prepared for or by a GSA advisory committee are available (until the 
committee ceases to exist) for public inspection and copying in the 
office of the Government Chairperson or Designated Federal Officer. 
Requests to inspect or copy these records are processed under 41 CFR 
105-60.4. Except where prohibited by a contract entered into before 
January 5, 1973, copies of transcripts, if any, of committee meetings 
are made available by the Government chairperson or Designated Federal 
Officer to any person at the cost of duplication. After the committee's 
work ends, disposition of the committee documents and the release of 
information from them are made in accordance with Federal records, 
statutes, and regulations.
    (b) Subject to 5 U.S.C. 552(b) and instructions of the Committee 
Management Secretariat, the Government chairperson or Designated Federal 
Officer files at least eight copies of each report an advisory committee 
makes, including any report on closed meetings with the Library of 
Congress at the time of its issuance. Where appropriate, the chairperson 
also files copies of background papers that consultants to the advisory 
committee prepare with the Library of Congress. The transmittal letter 
identifies the materials being furnished, with a copy of the transmittal 
provided to the GSA Committee Management Officer.

[[Page 41]]


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.303  Fiscal and administrative provisions.

    (a) Each HSSO and each Regional Administrator ensures that under 
established GSA procedures, records are kept that fully disclose the 
disposition of funds at the disposal of an advisory committee and the 
nature and extent of the committee's activities.
    (b) When GSA is assigned to provide administrative support for a 
Presidential advisory committee, the Agency Liaison Coordinator in the 
Office of the Deputy Regional Administrator, National Capital Region, as 
a part of its support, arranges with the Office of Finance, Office of 
the Comptroller, for maintaining all financial records.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided in a Presidential order, statute, or 
other authority, the GSA service or staff office sponsoring an advisory 
committee provides support services for the committee.
    (d) The guidelines in paragraph (e) through (l) of this section are 
established under section 7(d) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 86 
Stat. 773. They apply to the pay of members, staff, and consultants of 
an advisory committee, except that nothing in this paragraph will affect 
a rate of pay or a limitation on a rate of pay that is established by 
statute or a rate of pay established under the General Schedule 
classification and pay system in Chapter 51 and Subchapter III of 
Chapter 53 of Title 5, U.S.C.
    (e) The members of GSA advisory committee established pursuant to 
the Administrator's authority under section 205(g) of the Federal 
Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 
486(g)), are not compensated, since, by law, members so appointed shall 
service without compensation. A person who (without regard to his or her 
service with an advisory committee) is a full-time Federal employee will 
normally receive compensation at the rate at which he or she would 
otherwise be compensated.
    (f) When required by law, the pay of the members of GSA advisory 
committees will be fixed to the daily equivalent of a rate of the 
General Schedule in 5 U.S.C. 5332 unless the members are appointed as 
consultants and compensated as provided in paragraph (h) of this 
section. In determining an appropriate rate of pay for the members, GSA 
must give consideration to the significance, scope, and technical 
complexity of the matters with which the advisory committee is concerned 
and the qualifications required of the members of the advisory 
committee. GSA may not fix the pay of the members of an advisory 
committee at a rate higher than the daily equivalent of the maximum rate 
for a GS-15 under the General Schedule, unless a higher rate is mandated 
by statute, or the Administrator has personally determined that a higher 
rate of pay under the General Schedule is justified and necessary. Such 
a determination must be reviewed by the Administrator annually. 
Accordingly, the Administrator may not fix the pay of the members of an 
advisory committee at a rate of pay higher than the daily equivalent of 
a rate for a GSA 18, as provided in 5 U.S.C. 5332.
    (g) The pay of each staff member of an advisory committee is fixed 
at a rate of the General Schedule, General Management Schedule, or 
Senior Executive Service pay rate in which the staff member's position 
would be placed (5 U.S.C. Chapter 51). GSA cannot fix the pay of a staff 
member higher than the daily equivalent of the maximum rate for GS-15 
unless the Administrator decides that under the General Schedule, 
General Management Schedule, or Senior Executive Service classification 
system, the staff member's position should be higher than GS-15. The 
Administrator must review this decision annually.
    (1) In establishing compensation rates, GSA must comply with 
applicable statutes, regulations, Executive Orders, and administrative 
guidelines.
    (2) A staff member who is a Federal employee serves with the 
knowledge of the Designated Federal Officer and the approval of the 
employee's direct supervisor. A staff member who is a non-Federal 
employee is appointed under agency procedures, after consultation with 
the advisory committee.
    (h) The pay of a consultant to an advisory committee will be fixed 
after giving consideration to the qualifications required of the 
consultant and the significance, scope, and technical complexity of the 
work. The rate of

[[Page 42]]

pay will not exceed the maximum rate of pay which the agency may pay 
experts and consultants under 5 U.S.C. 3109 and must be in accordance 
with any applicable statutes, regulations, Executive Orders, and 
administrative guidelines.
    (i) Advisory committee and staff members, while performing their 
duties away from their homes or regular places of business, may be 
allowed travel expenses, including per diem instead of subsistence, as 
authorized by 5 U.S.C. 5703 for persons employed intermittently in the 
Government service.
    (j) Members of an advisory committee and its staff who are blind or 
deaf or who otherwise qualify as handicapped persons (under section 501 
of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794)), and who do not 
otherwise qualify for assistance under 5 U.S.C. 3102, as an employee of 
an agency (under section 3102(a)(1) of Title 5), may be provided the 
services of a personal assistant.
    (k) Under this paragraph, GSA may accept the gratuitous services of 
a member, consultant, or staff member of an advisory committee who 
agrees in advance to serve without compensation.
    (l) A person who immediately before his or her service with an 
advisory committee was a full-time Federal employee may receive 
compensation at the rate at which he or she was compensated as a Federal 
employee.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.304  Cost guidelines.

    (a) The reporting and estimating of the costs of advisory committees 
include direct obligations for the following items:
    (1) Pay compensation of committee members; consultants to the 
committee; all permanent, temporary, or part-time (GM, GS, WB, or other) 
positions which are a part of or support the committee; and all overtime 
related to committee functions (Compensation should reflect actual or 
estimated Federal person-years or parts thereof devoted to a committee's 
activities. It includes the compensation of Federal employees assigned 
to committees, on a reimbursable or nonreimbursable basis, from agencies 
or departments other than to which the committee reports.);
    (2) Personnel benefits associated with the above compensation (13 
percent of basic payroll);
    (3) Travel costs (including per diem) of committee members; 
consultants; and all permanent, temporary, or part-time positions which 
are a part of or support the committee;
    (4) Transportation of things, communications, and printing and 
reproduction;
    (5) Rent for additional space acquired for committee use;
    (6) Other services required by the committee, including data 
processing services, management studies and evaluations, contractual 
services, and reimbursable services; and
    (7) Supplies, materials, and equipment acquired for committee use.
    (b) The reporting and estimating of the cost of advisory committees 
does not include indirect or overhead costs; e.g., the costs of the 
committee management system (committee management officers, etc.).


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.305  Renewal of advisory committees.

    (a) Each advisory committee being continued is renewed for 
successive 2-year periods beginning with the date when it was 
established according to the following, except for statutory advisory 
committees: (For renewal of statutory advisory committees, see paragraph 
(b) of this section.)
    (1) Advisory committees are not renewed unless there is a compelling 
need for them, they have balanced membership, and they conduct their 
business as openly as possible under the law.
    (2) The renewal of a committee requires that the responsible HSSO 
submit to the GSA Committee Management Officer the following:
    (i) An updated charter with an explanation of the need for the 
renewal of the committee. The charter and explanation are furnished 60 
calendar days before the 2-year anniversary date of the committee.);
    (ii) A letter signed by the HSSO to the Director, Committee 
Management Secretariat, with information copies to the Administrator and 
the Deputy Administrator, setting forth:

[[Page 43]]

    (A) An explanation of why the committee is essential to the conduct 
of agency business and is in the public interest;
    (B) GSA's plan to attain balanced membership of the committee; and
    (C) An explanation of why the committee's functions cannot be 
performed by GSA, another existing GSA advisory committee, or other 
means such as a public hearing;
    (iii) A notice for publication in the Federal Register describing 
the nature and purpose of the committee and containing a certification 
by the Administrator that renewing the advisory committee is in the 
public interest.
    (3) On receiving the above documents, the GSA Committee Management 
Officer submits the renewal letter to the Committee Management 
Secretariat not more than 60 calendar days nor less than 30 days before 
the committee expires. Following receipt of the Committee Management 
Secretariat's views on the committee renewal, the Officer obtains the 
Administrator's approval of the charter and the Federal Register notice. 
The Officer publishes notice of the renewal in the Federal Register and 
files copies of the updated charter. The 15-day notice requirement does 
not apply to committee renewals, notices of which may be published 
concurrently with the filing of the charter.
    (b) Each statutory advisory committee is renewed by the filing of a 
renewal charter upon the expiration of each successive 2-year period 
following the date of enactment of the statute establishing the 
committee according to the following:
    (1) The procedures in paragraph (a)(2) of this section apply to the 
renewal of a statutory committee except that neither prior consultation 
with the Committee Management Secretariat nor a Federal Register notice 
is required. Accordingly, the letter that paragraph a(2)(ii) requires is 
sent to the Administrator rather than the Committee Mangement 
Secretariat. Due to the nature of a committee the law established, the 
explanation of the need to continue the committee's existence is less 
extensive than the explanation for the continuation of a non-statutory 
committee; and
    (2) The GSA Committee Management Officer provides the Committee 
Management Secretariat with a copy of the filed charter.
    (c) An advisory commitee required to file a new charter may not take 
any action other than preparing the charter between the date it is to be 
filed and the date it is actually filed.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.306  Amendment of advisory committee charters.

    (a) A charter is amended when GSA decides that the existing charter 
no longer accurately reflects the objectives or functions of the 
committee. Changes may be minor, such as revising the name of the 
committee or modifying the estimated number or frequency of meetings, or 
they may be major dealing with the basic objectives or composition of 
the committee. The Administrator retains final authority for amending 
the charter of an advisory committee. Amending an existing advisory 
committee charter does not constitute renewal of the committee.
    (b) To make a minor amendment, the Administrator approves the 
amended charter and has it filed according to Sec. 105-54.203-1.
    (c) To make a major amendment, the Committee Management Officer 
submits an amended charter and a letter to the Committee Management 
Secretariat, signed by the HSSO with the concurrence of the General 
Counsel or designee, requesting the Secretariat's views on the amended 
language, along with an explanation of the purpose of the changes and 
why they are necessary. The Secretariat reviews the proposed changes and 
notifies the Committee Management Officer of its views within 15 
calendar days of receiving it, if possible. The Administrator has the 
charter filed according to Sec. 105-54.203-1.
    (d) Amending an existing charter does not constitute renewal of the 
committee.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.307  Termination of advisory committees.

    (a) The sponsoring HSSO terminates an advisory commitee that has 
fulfilled the purpose stated in its charter. The official takes action 
to rescind any existing orders relating to the committee and to notify 
committee members, the

[[Page 44]]

GSA Committee Management Officer, and the Committee Management 
Secretariat of the termination.
    (b) Failing to continue an advisory committee by the 2-year 
anniversary date terminates the committee, unless its duration is 
provided for by law.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.308  Responsibilities of the Administrator.

    The Administrator must ensure:
    (a) Compliance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act and this 
chapter;
    (b) Issuance of administrative guidelines and management controls 
that apply to all advisory committees established or used by the agency;
    (c) Designation of a Committee Management Officer to carry out the

Act;
    (d) Provision of a written determination stating the reasons for 
closing any advisory committee meeting to the public;
    (e) A review, at least annually, of the need to continue each 
existing advisory committee, consistent with the public interest and the 
purpose and functions of each committee;
    (f) The appointment of a Designated Federal Officer for each 
advisory committee and its subcommittee;
    (g) The opportunity for reasonable public participation in advisory 
committee activities; and
    (h) That the number of committee members is limited to the fewest 
necessary to accomplish committee objectives.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.309  Added responsibilities of service and staff office heads and regional administrators.

    (a) No later than the first meeting of an advisory committee, submit 
to committee members, committee staff, consultants, and appropriate 
agency management personnel a written statement of the purpose, 
objectives, and expected accomplishments of the committee;
    (b) Solicit in writing or in a formal meeting at least annually the 
views of committee members on the effectiveness, activities, and 
management of the committee, including recommendations for improvement. 
Review comments to determine whether improvements or corrective action 
is warranted. Retain recommendations until the committee is terminated 
or renewed.
    (c) Involve key management personnel of the agency whose interests 
are affected by the committee in committee meetings, including reviewing 
reports and establishing agendas.
    (d) Periodically, but not less than annually, review the level of 
committee staff suport to make sure that expenditures are justified by 
committee activity and benefit to the Government.
    (e) Monitor the attendance and participation of committee members 
and consider replacing any member who misses a substantial number of 
scheduled meetings.
    (f) Establish meeting dates and distribute agendas and other 
materials well in advance.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.310  Advisory committee duties of the GSA Committee Management Officer.

    In addition to implementing the provisions of section 8(b) of the 
Federal Advisory Committee Act, the GSA Committee Management Officer 
carries out all responsibilities delegated by the Administrator. The 
Officer ensures that sections 10(b), 12(a), and 13 of the Act are 
implemented by GSA to provide for appropriate record keeping. Records 
include, but are not limited to:
    (a) A set of approved charters and membership lists for each 
advisory committee;
    (b) Copies of GSA's portion of the Annual Report of Federal Advisory 
Committees.
    (c) Guidelines on committee management operations and procedures as 
maintained and updated; and
    (d) Determinations to close advisory committee meetings.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.311  Complaint procedures.

    (a) Any person whose request for access to an advisory committee 
document is denied may seek administrative review under 41 CFR 105-60, 
which implements the Freedom of Information Act. (See GSA Order, GSA 
regulations under the ``Freedom of Information Act'' (ADM 7900.3A).)
    (b) Aggrieved individuals or organizations may file written 
complaints on

[[Page 45]]

matters not involving access to documents with the Deputy Administrator, 
General Services Administration, Washington, DC 20405. Complaints must 
be filed within 90 calendar days from the date the grievance arose. The 
Deputy Administrator promptly acts on each complaint and notifies the 
complainant in writing of the decision.

<R05>
Sec. 105-55.001  Background.

    The Department of Justice and the General Accounting Office have 
jointly issued amended Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR parts 
101-105) which reflect changes to the Federal Claims Collection Act of 
1966 (31 U.S.C. 3701-3719) made by the passage of the Debt Collection 
Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1754). The preamble to the amended 
Federal Claims Collection Standards instructs individual agencies to 
adopt their own regulations as to detailed procedures in furtherance of 
the Federal Claims Collection Standards. Additionally, the Debt 
Collection Act of 1982 directs, as reflected in the Federal Claims 
Collection Standards, that each agency must prescribe regulations on 
collecting by administrative offset and that each agency may prescribe 
regulations identifying circumstances appropriate to waive collection of 
interest and charges in conformity with the Federal Claims Collection 
Standards.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.002  Purpose.

    In keeping with the suggestion in the preamble to the amended 
Federal Claims Collection Standards and the directives in the Debt 
Collection Act of 1982 and the Federal Claims Collection Standards as to 
administrative offset and the collection of interest and charges, this 
part provides procedures for the General Services Administration to 
collect, compromise, or terminate collection action on claims owed to 
the United States arising from activities under GSA jurisdiction. It 
implements the Federal Claims Collection Act as amended by the Debt 
Collection Act. It supplements the regulations published jointly by the 
General Accounting Office and the Department of Justice. It sets forth 
procedures by which GSA:
    (a) Will collect claims owed to the United States;
    (b) Will determine and collect interest and other charges on those 
claims;
    (c) Will compromise claims; and
    (d) Will refer unpaid claims for litigation.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.003  Applicability.

    (a) This part applies to all claims due the United States under the 
Federal

[[Page 46]]

Claims Collection Act, as amended by the Debt Collection Act, arising 
from activities under the jurisdiction of the General Services 
Administration, except for the collection by administrative offset of 
those claims arising out of contracts subject to the Contracts Disputes 
Act of 1982, 41 U.S.C. 601 et. seq. The word ``claims'' includes but is 
not limited to amounts due the United States from fees, overpayments, 
fines, civil penalties, damages, interest and other sources.
    (b) Claims arising from the audit of transportation accounts 
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3726 shall be determined, collected, compromised, 
terminated or settled in accordance with regulation published under the

<R05>
Sec. 105-55.004  Demand for payment.

    (a) A total of three progressively stronger written demands at 
approximately 30-day intervals will normally be made, unless a response 
or other information indicates that additional written demands would 
either be unnecessary or futile. When necessary to protect the 
Government's interest, written demand may be preceded by other 
appropriate actions under the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 
including immediate referral for litigation and/or offset.
    (b) The initial written demand for payment shall inform the debtor 
of:
    (1) The basis for the claim;
    (2) The amount of the claim;
    (3) The date when payment is due; (30 days from date of mailing or 
hand delivery of the initial demand for payment);
    (4) The provision for interest, penalties, and administrative 
charges in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717, if payment is not received by 
the due date (See Sec. 105-55.005 for details regarding interest, 
administrative charges, and penalty charges.)
    (5) The intent of the agency to collect by administrative offset, 
including asking the assistance of other Federal agencies to help in the 
offset whenever possible, if the debtor has not made payment by the 
payment due date, has not requested a review of the claim within the 
agency as set out in paragraph (b)(8) of this section or has not made an 
arrangement for payment by the payment due date;
    (6) The right of the debtor to inspect and copy the records of the 
agency related to the claim. Any costs associated therewith shall be 
borne by the debtor. The debtor shall give reasonable notice in advance 
to the agency of the date upon which it intends to inspect and copy the 
records involved;
    (7) The right of the debtor to a review of the claim within the 
agency. If the claim is disputed in full or part, the debtor shall 
respond to the demand in writing by making a request for a review of the 
claim within the agency by the payment due date stated in the demand. 
The debtor's written response shall state the basis for the dispute. If 
only part of the claim is disputed, the undisputed portion should be 
paid by the date stated in the initial demand. The agency shall 
acknowledge receipt of the request for a review, and upon completion of 
consideration shall notify the debtor whether its determination has been 
sustained, amended, or canceled within 15 days of the receipt of the 
request for a review. If the agency either sustains or amends its 
determination, it shall notify the debtor of its intent to collect by 
administrative offset unless payment is received within 15 days of the 
mailing of the notification of its decision following a review of the 
claim.
    (8) The right of the debtor to offer to make a written agreement to 
repay the amount of the claim. The acceptance of such an agreement is 
discretionary with the agency. If the debtor requests a repayment 
arrangement because a payment of the amount due would create a financial 
hardship, the appropriate GSA Regional Finance Division will analyze the 
debtor's financial condition. Dependent upon the Regional Finance 
Division's evaluation of the financial strength of the debtor, the 
Comptroller or the appropriate designee and the debtor may agree to a 
written installment repayment schedule. The debtor shall execute a 
confess-judgment note which specifies all of

[[Page 47]]

the terms of the arrangement. The size and frequency of installment 
payments should bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and 
the debtor's ability to pay. Interest, administrative charges, and 
penalty charges shall be provided for in the note. The debtor shall be 
provided with a written explanation of the consequences of signing a 
confess-judgment note. The debtor shall sign a statement acknowledging 
receipt of the written explanation which shall recite that the statement 
was read and understood before execution of the notice and that the note 
is being signed knowingly and voluntarily. Some form of objective 
evidence of these facts should be maintained in the agency's file on the 
debtor.
    (c) If no response to the demand is received by the date stated in 
the demand, GSA will take further action under this subpart or under the 
Federal Claims Collection Standards. These actions may include reports 
to credit bureaus, referrals to collection agencies, termination of 
contract, debarment, offset of Federal salary, and other administrative 
offset, as authorized in 31 U.S.C. 3701-3719.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.005  Interest, administrative charges, and penalty charges.

    (a) GSA shall assess interest on unpaid claims at the rate of the 
current value of funds to the Treasury as prescribed by the Secretary of 
the Treasury on the date interest begins to run. GSA shall assess 
administrative charges to cover the costs of processing and handling 
overdue claims. GSA shall assess penalty charges of six percent a year 
on any part of a debt more than 90 days past due. The imposition of 
interest, administrative charges, and penalty charges are made in 
accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717.
    (b) Interest will be computed from the date of mailing or hand 
delivery of the initial demand if the amount of the claim is not paid 
within 30 days. The 30-day period may be extended in individual cases if 
there is good cause to do so and it is in the public interest. Interest 
will only be computed on the principal of the claim and the interest 
rate will remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness, except 
where a debtor has defaulted on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter 
into a new agreement. A new rate which reflects the current value of 
funds to the Treasury at the time the new agreement is executed may be 
set if applicable and interest on interest and related charges may be 
charged where the debtor has defaulted on a previous repayment 
agreement. Charges which accrued but were not collected under the 
defaulted agreement shall be added to the principal to be paid under the 
new repayment schedule.
    (c) GSA may waive interest, administrative charges, or penalty 
charges if it finds that:
    (1) The debtor is unable to pay any significant sum toward the claim 
within a reasonable period of time;
    (2) Collection of interest, administrative charges, or penalty 
charges will jeopardize collection of the principal of the claim; or
    (3) It is otherwise in the best interests of the United States, 
including the situation where an offset or installment payment agreement 
is in effect.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.006  Responsibility for collection.

    (a) Heads of Central Office Services and Staff Offices and Regional 
Administrators must initiate actions on claims arising from their 
program operations and immediately notify the appropriate Regional 
Finance Division. A claim will be recorded and controlled by the 
Regional Finance Division upon receipt of documentation from a competent 
authority establishing the amount due.
    (b) The collection of claims under the control of Regional Finance 
Divisions will be aggressively pursued in accordance with the provisions 
of part 102 of the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR part 102). 
Whenever feasible, debts owed to the United States, together with 
interest, administrative charges and penalty charges, should be 
collected in full in one lump sum. If the debtor requests installment 
payments, the Regional Finance Divisions shall be responsible for 
determining the financial hardship of debtors and when appropriate shall 
arrange installment payment schedules. Claims which cannot be collected 
either directly or by administrative offset shall either be

[[Page 48]]

written off as administratively uncollectible in accordance with 
authority delegated to the Director, Office of Finance and the 
Directors, Regional Finance Divisions, or referred to the appropriate 
Assistant General Counsel or Regional Counsel for further consideration.
    (c) The General Counsel, delegated officials in the Office of 
General Counsel, and each Regional Counsel may compromise or suspend or 
terminate the collection of, referred claims under $20,000, exclusive of 
interest, penalties and administrative charges under the Act and the 
Federal Claims Collection Standards 4 CFR parts 103 and 104.
    (d) The Office of General Counsel officials listed in paragraph (c) 
of this section have the responsibility for referring to the Department 
of Justice all claims over $20,000 exclusive of interest, penalties and 
administrative charges which cannot be compromised, suspended or 
terminated in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Act and the 
Federal Claims Collections Standards. Referrals to the Department of 
Justice shall be made in accordance with 4 CFR part 105 of the Federal 
Claims Collections Standards.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.007  Collection by offset.

    (a) Whenever feasible, after a debtor fails to pay the claim, 
request a review of the claim, or make an arrangement for payment. The 
Comptroller or his appropriate regional designee will collect claims 
under this part by means of administrative offset against obligations of 
the United States to the debtor, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716, except 
offset of Federal salaries and claims arising out of contracts subject 
to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, 41 U.S.C. 601 et. seq.
    (b) Salary offsets and offsets against military retired pay are 
governed by 5 U.S.C. 5514.
    (c) Collection by administrative offset of amounts payable from 
Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund will be made pursuant to 5 
U.S.C. 5514 and 5 U.S.C. 5705 and regulations thereunder.
    (d) The offset of claims arising out of contracts subject to the 
Contract Disputes Act of 1978, 41 U.S.C. 601 et. seq. will be made 
pursuant to the Government common law right of offset.
    (e) GSA will promptly make requests for offset to other agencies 
holding funds payable to a debtor and provide instructions for the 
transfer of these funds. Requests for offset received from other 
agencies shall be processed promptly and the funds transferred to the 
requesting agency.
    (f) If administrative offset cannot be effected through GSA or other 
known agency accounts receivable, then GSA will place a complete stop 
order against amounts otherwise payable to the debtor by placing the 
name of that debtor on the Department of the Army ``List of Contractors 
Indebted to the United States.'' If any amounts are discovered under 
this procedure, they will be offset against the debt owed to GSA.
    (g) GSA should not attempt to effect collection by administrative 
offset when:
    (1) The debtor has ceased to do business and there are no known or 
potential obligations payable by any agency of the United States 
Government to the debtor.
    (2) The debt in question is over ten years old.
    (3) The debtor has either gone into receivership and has liquidated 
all of its assets or has filed a petition in bankruptcy as a no asset 
debtor, and there is no likelihood of the debtor resuming operations; 
and there are no known or potential obligations payable by any agency of 
the United States Government to the debtor. In the case of a bankruptcy 
petition, the automatic stay against setoff must be honored pending 
release from the stay.
    (4) The debtor is deceased, and there are no attachable assets in 
the estate.
    (5) Any other circumstances which would indicate that the likelihood 
of collection by administrative offset is less than probable.

<R05>
Sec. 105-55.008  Settlement of claims.

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of 4 CFR part 103, GSA 
officials listed in Sec. 105-55.006(c) may settle claims not exceeding 
$20,000 exclusive of interest, penalties and administrative charges

[[Page 49]]

by compromise at less than the principal of the claim if:
    (1) The debtor shows an inability to pay the full amount within a 
reasonable time;
    (2) The Government would be unable to enforce complete collection by 
any means within a reasonable time;
    (3) The amount of the claim does not justify the actual foreseable 
collection cost of the claim; or
    (4) A combination of the above reasons.
    (b) GSA may suspend or terminate collection action in accordance 
with the terms and procedures contained in 4 CFR part 104.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.009  Referral for litigation.

    Claims which cannot be settled under Sec. 105-55.008 or for which 
collection action cannot be suspended or terminated under 4 CFR parts 
103 and 104, will be referred to the General Accounting Office or the 
Department of Justice, whichever is appropriate, in accordance with the 
procedures in 4 CFR part 105.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.010  Disclosure to credit reporting agencies and referrals to collection agencies.

    The Comptroller and his designees may disclose debtor information to 
credit reporting agencies and may refer delinquent debts to debt 
collection agencies under the Federal Claims Collection Act, as amended, 
and other applicable authorities, provided, however, that no claim 
arising from the dishonor of any check or other negotiable instrument 
shall be disclosed to a credit reporting agency or referred to a 
collection agency without the concurrence of the appropriate Regional 
Inspector General for Investigations. Information will be disclosed to 
reporting agencies and referred to debt collection agencies in 
accordance with the terms and conditions of agreements entered into 
between GSA and the reporting and collection agencies. The terms and 
conditions of such agreements shall specify that all of the rights and 
protections afforded to the debtor under 31 U.S.C. 3711(f) have been 
fulfilled.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.011  Credit report.

    In order to aid the agency in making appropriate determinations as 
to the collection and compromise of claims; the collection of interest, 
administrative charges, and penalty charges; the use of administrative 
offset; the use of other collection methods; and the likelihood of 
collecting the claim, the Comptroller or his designees may institute a 
credit investigation of the debtor immediately following receipt of 
knowledge of the claim.

to the official who signed the demand letter to enter into a written 
repayment agreement of the debt in lieu of offset. The request must be 
made within 7 days of receipt of notice under Sec. 105-56.004. The 
agreement must be in writing, signed by both the employee and the

paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Waiver. Where a waiver of repayment is authorized by law, the 
employee may request a waiver from the General Accounting Office.
    (c) Reconsideration. (1) An employee may seek a reconsideration of 
the Agency's determination regarding the existence or amount of the 
debt. The request must be submitted to the official who signed the 
demand letter within 7 days of receipt of notice under Sec. 105-56.004. 
Within 20 days of receipt of this notice, the employee shall submit a 
detailed statement of reasons for reconsideration which must be 
accompanied by supporting documentation.
    (2) An employee may request a reconsideration of the proposed offset 
schedule. The request must be submitted to the program official who 
signed the demand letter within 7 days of receipt of notice under 
Sec. 105-56.004. Within 20 days of receipt of this notice, the employee 
shall submit an alternative repayment schedule accompanied by a detailed 
statement supported by documentation evidencing financial hardship 
resulting from the agency's proposed schedule. Acceptance of the request

writing of its decision concerning the request to reduce the rate of an 
involuntary deduction.


<R05>
Sec. 105-56.006  Petition for pre-offset hearing.

    (a) The employee may petition for a pre-offset hearing by filing a 
written petition with the program official who

[[Page 52]]

signed the demand letter within 15 days of receipt of the written 
notice. The petition must state why the employee believes the agency's 
determination concerning the existence or amount of the debt is in 
error, and set forth objections to the involuntary repayment schedule. 
The timely filing of a petition will suspend the commencement of 
collection proceedings.
    (b) The employee's petition or statement must be signed by the 
employee.
    (c) Petitions for hearing made after the expiration of the 15 day 
period may be accepted if the employee can show that the delay was 
because of circumstances beyond his or her control or because of failure 
to receive notice of the time limit.
    (d) If the employee timely requests a pre-offset hearing or the 
timeliness is waived, the program official must:
    (1) Notify the employee whether the employee may elect an oral 
hearing or whether he or she may have only a ``paper hearing,'' i.e., a 
review on the written record (see 4 CFR 102.3(c)). In either case, the 
program official will arrange for a hearing official; and
    (2) The program official will provide the hearing official with a 
copy of all records on which the determination of the debt and any 
involuntary repayment schedule are based.
    (e) An employee who elects an oral hearing must notify the hearing 
official and the program official in writing within 5 days of receipt of 
the notice under paragraph (d)(1) of this section and within 20 days of 
receipt of the notice under (d)(1) the employee shall fully identify and 
explain with reasonable specificity all the facts, evidence and 
witnesses which the employee believes support his or her position.
    (f) The hearing official shall notify the program official and the 
employee of the date, time and location of the hearing.
    (g) If the employee later elects to have the hearing based only on 
the written submissions, notification must be given to the hearing 
official and the program official at least 3 calendar days before the 
date of the oral hearing. The hearing official may waive the 3-day 
requirement for good cause.
    (h) Failure of the employee to appear at the oral hearing can result 
in dismissal of the petition and affirmation of the agency's decision.


<R05>
Sec. 105-56.007  Pre-offset oral hearing.

    (a) Oral hearings are informal in nature. The agency, represented by 
a program official or a representative of the Office of General Counsel, 
and the employee, or his or her representative, shall explain their case 
in the form of an oral presentation with reference to the documentation 
submitted. The employee may testify on his or her own behalf, subject to 
cross examination. Other witnesses may be called to testify where the 
hearing official determines the testimony to be relevant and not 
redundant.
    (b) The hearing official shall--
    (1) Conduct a fair and impartial hearing; and
    (2) Preside over the course of the hearing, maintain decorum, and 
avoid delay in the disposition of the hearing.
    (c) The employee may represent himself or herself or may be 
represented by another person at the hearing. The employee may not be 
represented by a person who creates an actual or apparent conflict of 
interest.
    (d) Oral hearings are open to the public. However, the hearing 
official may close all or any portion of the hearing when doing so is in 
the best interests of the employee or the public.
    (e) Oral hearings may be conducted by conference call at the request 
of the employee or at the discretion of the hearing official.


<R05>
Sec. 105-56.008  Pre-offset ``paper hearing.''

    If a hearing is to be held only upon written submissions, the 
hearing official shall issue a decision based upon the record and 
responses submitted by both the agency and the employee.


<R05>
Sec. 105-56.009  Written decision.

    Within 60 days of filing of the employee's petition for a pre-offset 
hearing, the hearing official will issue a written decision setting 
forth: The facts supporting the nature and origin of the debt; the 
hearing official's analysis, findings and conclusions as to the 
employee's or agency's grounds, the amount and validity of the debt and 
the repayment schedule.

[[Page 53]]


<R05>
Sec. 105-56.010  Deductions.

    (a) When deductions may begin. If the employee filed a petition for 
hearing with the program official before the expiration of the period 
provided for in Sec. 105-56.006, then deductions will begin after the 
hearing official has provided the employee with a hearing, and the final 
written decision is in favor of the agency. It is the responsibility of 
the employee's program official to issue the pre-offset notice to the 
employee and to instruct the National Payroll Center to begin offset in 
accordance with the final written decision.
    (b) Retired or separated employees. If the employee retires, 
resigns, or is terminated before collection of the amount of the 
indebtedness is completed, the remaining indebtedness will be offset 
from any subsequent payments of any nature. If the debt cannot be 
satisfied from subsequent payments, then the debt must be collected 
according to the procedures for administrative offset pursuant to 31 
U.S.C. 3716.
    (c) Types of collection. A debt may be collected in one lump sum or 
in installments. Collection will be by lump-sum unless the employee is 
able to demonstrate to the program official who signed the demand letter 
that he or she is financially unable to pay in one lump-sum. In these 
cases, collection will be by installment deductions.
    (d) Methods of collection. If the debt cannot be collected in one 
lump sum, the debt will be collected by deductions at officially 
established pay intervals from an employee's current pay account, unless 
the employee and the program official agree to an alternative repayment 
schedule. The alternative arrangement must be in writing and signed by 
both the employee and the program official.
    (1) Installment deductions. Installment deductions will be made over 
the shortest period possible. The size and frequency of installment 
deductions will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and 
the employee's ability to pay. However, the amount deducted for any 
period will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the 
deduction is made, unless the employee has agreed in writing to the 
deduction of a greater amount. The installment payment will be 
sufficient in size and frequency to pay the debt over the shortest 
period possible and never to exceed three years. Installment payments of 
less than $100 per pay period will be accepted only in the most unusual 
circumstances.
    (2) Sources of deductions. GSA will make deductions only from basic 
pay, special pay, incentive pay, retired pay, retainer pay, or in the 
case of an employee not entitled to basic pay, other authorized pay.
    (e) Interest, penalties and administrative costs on debts under this 
part will be assessed according to the provisions of 4 CFR 102.13.


<R05>
Sec. 105-56.011  Non-waiver of rights.

    An employee's involuntary payment of all or any portion of a debt 
being collected under 5 U.S.C. 5514 shall not be construed as a waiver 
of any rights which the employee may have under 5 U.S.C. 5514 or any 
other provision of contract or law unless there are statutory or 
contractual provisions to the contrary.


<R05>
Sec. 105-56.012  Refunds.

    GSA will refund promptly to the appropriate individual amounts 
offset under these regulations when:
    (a) A debt is waived or otherwise found not owing the United States 
(unless expressly prohibited by statute or regulation); or
    (b) GSA is directed by an administrative or judicial order to refund 
amounts deducted from the employee's current pay.


<R05>
Sec. 105-56.013  Coordinating offset with another Federal agency.

    (a) When GSA is owed the debt. When GSA is owed a debt by an 
employee of another agency, the other agency shall not initiate the 
requested offset until GSA provides the agency with a written 
certification that the debtor owes GSA a debt and that GSA has complied 
with these regulations. This certification shall include the amount and 
basis of the debt and the due date of the payment.
    (b) When another agency is owed the debt. GSA may use salary offset 
against one of its employees who is indebted to another agency if 
requested to do so by that agency. Any such request must be

[[Page 54]]

accompanied by a certification from the requesting agency that the 
person owes the debt, the amount of the debt and that the employee has 
been given the procedural rights required by 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR 
part 550, subpart K.

<R05>
Sec. 105-57.001  Purpose.

    This part establishes procedures for the General Services 
Administration (GSA) to refer past due debts to the Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS) for offset against income tax refunds of taxpayers owing 
debts to GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 105-57.002  Applicability and scope.

    (a) This part implements 31 U.S.C. 3720A which authorizes the IRS to 
reduce a tax refund by the amount of a past due legally enforceable debt 
owed to the United States.
    (b) For purposes of this section, a past due legally enforceable 
debt referable to the IRS is a debt which is owed to the United States 
and:
    (1) Has been delinquent for at least three months but, except in the 
case of a judgment debt, has not been delinquent more than ten years at 
the time the offset is made;
    (2) With respect to which, GSA has given the taxpayer at least 60 
days, from the date of notification, to present evidence that all or 
part of the debt is not past due or legally enforceable, has considered 
such evidence, and has determined that the debt is past due and legally 
enforceable;
    (3) Cannot be currently collected pursuant to the salary offset 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1);
    (4) Cannot be currently collected pursuant to the administrative 
offset provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3716;
    (5) Has been disclosed by GSA to a credit reporting agency, 
including a consumer reporting agency as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 
3711(f);
    (6) With respect to which, GSA has notified, or has made a 
reasonable attempt to notify, the taxpayer that the debt is past due 
and, unless repaid within 60 days thereafter, will be referred to the 
IRS for offset against any income tax refunds due the taxpayer;
    (7) Is at least $25.00;
    (8) All other requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3720A and the Department of 
the Treasury regulations relating to eligibility of a debt for tax 
refund offset, at 26 CFR 301.6402-6T, have been satisfied.


<R05>
Sec. 105-57.003  Administrative charges.

    All administrative charges incurred in connection with the referral 
of debts to the IRS will be added to the debt, thus increasing the 
amount of the offset.


<R05>
Sec. 105-57.004  Reasonable attempt to notify.

    In order to constitute a reasonable attempt to notify the debtor, 
GSA must have used a mailing address for the debtor obtained from the 
IRS pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 6103 (m)(2) or 
(m)(4), within one year preceding the attempt to notify the debtor.


<R05>
Sec. 105-57.005  Notice requirement before offset.

    The notification provided by GSA to the debtor will inform the 
debtor how to go about presenting evidence to GSA that all or part of 
the debt is either not past due or is not legally enforceable.


<R05>
Sec. 105-57.006  Consideration of evidence.

    Evidence submitted by the debtor will be considered by officials or 
employees of GSA. Any determination that an amount of such debt is past 
due and legally enforceable will be made by such officials or employees. 
Evidence that the debt is affected by a bankruptcy proceeding involving 
the debtor shall bar referral of the debt.

[[Page 55]]


<R05>
Sec. 105-57.007  Change in conditions after submission to IRS.

    If the amount of a debt is reduced after submission by GSA and 
offset by IRS, GSA will refund to the debtor any excess amount and will 
promptly notify IRS of the refund. GSA will also promptly notify the IRS 
if, after submission of a debt to the IRS for offset, GSA:
    (a) Determines that an error has been made with respect to the 
information submitted;
    (b) Receives a payment or credits a payment to an account submitted; 
or
    (c) Receives notification that the debtor has filed for bankruptcy 
under title 11 of the United States Code or has been adjudicated 
bankrupt and the debt has been discharged.

<R04>
                  Subpart 105-60.1--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.101  Purpose.

    Part 105-60 implements the provisions of the Freedom of Information 
Act, 5 U.S.C. 552 (``FOIA'') (Pub. L. 90-23, which codified Pub. L. 89-
487 and amended section 3 of the Administrative Procedure Act, formerly 
5 U.S.C. 1002 (1964 ed.); Pub. L. 93-502, popularly known as the Freedom 
of Information Act Amendments of 1974, as amended by Pub. L. 99-570, the 
Freedom of Information Reform Act of 1986. This part prescribes 
procedures by which the public may inspect and obtain copies of GSA 
records under the FOIA.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.102  Application.

    This part applies to all records and informational materials 
generated, maintained, and controlled by GSA which come within the scope 
of 5 U.S.C. 552.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.103  Policy.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.103-1  Availability of records.

    GSA records are available to the greatest extent possible in keeping 
with the spirit and intent of the FOIA. GSA will furnish them promptly 
to any member of the public upon request addressed to the office 
designated in Sec. 105-60.402-1 at fees specified in Sec. 105-60.305-10. 
The person making the request need not have a particular interest in the 
subject matter, nor must that person provide justification for the 
request. The requirement of the FOIA that records be available to the 
public refers only to records in being at the date of the request and 
imposes no obligation on GSA to compile a record including development 
of a new computer program to respond to a request.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.103-2  Applying exemptions.

    GSA may deny a request for a GSA record if it falls within an 
exemption under the FOIA as outlined in subpart 105-60.5. Except when a 
record is classified or when disclosure would violate any Federal 
statute, the authority to withhold a record from disclosure is 
permissive rather than mandatory. GSA will not withhold a record unless 
there is a compelling reason to do so. In the absence of a compelling 
reason, GSA will disclose a record although it otherwise is subject to 
exemption.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.104  Records of other agencies.

    If GSA receives a request to make available current records that are 
the primary responsibility of another agency, GSA will refer the request 
to the agency concerned for appropriate action. GSA will inform the 
requester that GSA has forwarded the request to the responsible agency.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.105  Inconsistent directives of GSA superseded.

    Any policies and procedures in any GSA directive that are 
inconsistent with the policies and procedures set forth in this part are 
superseded to the extent of that inconsistency.


<R04>
Subpart 105-60.2--Publication of General Agency Information and Rules in 
                          the Federal Register

<R05>
Sec. 105-60.304  Index.

    GSA will maintain and make available for public inspection and

information for the public regarding any matter issued, adopted, or 
promulgated after July 4, 1967, and described in Sec. 105-60.302.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305  Fees.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-1  Definitions.

    For the purpose of these regulations:
    (a) A statute specifically providing for setting the level of fees 
for particular types of records (5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(vi)) means any 
statute that specifically requires (as opposed to generally discussing) 
a Government agency to set the level of fees for particular types of 
records, in order to:
    (1) Serve both the general public and private sector organizations 
by conveniently making available Government information;
    (2) Ensure that groups and individuals pay the cost of publications 
and other services which are for their special use so that these costs 
are not borne by the general taxpaying public;

[[Page 59]]

    (3) Operate an information dissemination activity on a self-
sustaining bases to the maximum extent possible; or
    (4) Return revenue to the Treasury for defraying, wholly or in part, 
appropriated funds used to pay the cost of disseminating Government 
information.
    (b) The term direct costs means those expenditures which GSA 
actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and in the case of 
commercial requesters, reviewing) documents to respond to a FOIA 
request. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the employee 
performing the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 
percent of that rate to cover benefits), and the cost of operating 
duplicating machinery. Not included in direct cost are overhead expenses 
such as costs of space, and heating or lighting the facility where the 
records are stored.
    (c) The term search includes all time spent looking for material 
that is responsive to a request, including line-by-line identification 
of material within documents. Searches will be performed in the most 
efficient and least expensive manner so as to minimize costs for both 
the agency and the requester. Line-by-line searches will not be 
undertaken when it would be more efficient to duplicate the entire 
document. Such activity will be distinguished from ``review'' of 
material in determining whether the material is exempt from disclosure 
(see paragraph (e) of this section). Searches may be done manually or by 
computer using existing programming.
    (d) The term duplication refers to the process of making a copy of a 
document in response to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of 
paper, microform, audiovisual materials, or machine-readable 
documentation. GSA will provide a copy of the material in a form that is 
usable by the requester unless it is administratively burdensome to do 
so.
    (e) The term review refers to the process of examining documents 
located in response to request that is for commercial use (see paragraph 
(f) of this section) to determine if any portion of that document is 
permitted to be withheld and processing any documents for disclosure. 
See Sec. 105-60.305-7.
    (f) The term commercial-use request refers to a request from or on 
behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers 
the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or person on 
whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a requester 
properly belongs in this category, GSA will look first at how the 
requester will use the documents.
    (g) The term educational institution refers to a preschool, a public 
or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate 
higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an 
institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational 
education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.
    (h) The term noncommercial scientific institution refers to an 
institution that is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis as that term 
is referenced in paragraph (f) of this section and which is operated 
solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of 
which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.
    (i) The term representative of the news media refers to any person 
actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to 
publish or broadcast news to the public. The term news means information 
that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the 
public. Examples of news media include television or radio stations 
broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but 
only in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of 
``news'') who make their products available for purchase or subscription 
by the general public. In the case of ``freelance'' journalists, they 
may be regarded as working for a news organization if they can 
demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that 
organization, even though not actually employed by it.

<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-2  Scope of section.

    This section sets forth policies and procedures to be followed in 
the assessment and collection of fees from a requester for the search, 
review, and reproduction of GSA records.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-3  Record material available without charge.

    GSA records available to the public are displayed in the business 
service center for that region. Certain material related to bids 
(excluding construction plans and specifications) and any material 
displayed are available without charge upon request.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-4  Copy of GSA records available at a fee.

    GSA will make a record not subject to exemption available at a time 
and place mutually agreed upon by GSA and the requester. GSA will agree 
either to
    (a) Show the originals to the requester,
    (b) Make one copy available at a fee, or
    (c) A combination of these alternatives.

In the case of voluminous materials, GSA will make copies as quickly as 
possible. GSA may make a reasonable number of additional copies for a 
fee when commercial reproduction services are not available to the 
requester.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-5  Waiver of fee.

    (a) Any request for waiver or reduction of a fee should be included 
in the initial letter requesting access to GSA records under Sec. 105-
60.402-1. The waiver request should explain how disclosure of the 
information would contribute significantly to public understanding of 
the operations or activities of the Government and would not be 
primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. In responding to 
a request GSA will consider the following factors:
    (1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns ``the 
operations or activities of the Government.'' The subject matter of the 
requested records must specifically concern identifiable operations or 
activities of the Federal Government--with a connection between them 
that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.
    (2) Whether the disclosure is ``likely to contribute'' to an 
understanding of Government operations or activities. In this 
connection, GSA should consider whether the requested information is 
already in the public domain, either in a duplicative or a substantially 
identical form. If it is, then disclosure of the information would not 
be likely to contribute to an understanding of Government operations or 
activities, as nothing new would be added to the public record.
    (3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute 
to ``public understanding.'' The focus here must be on the contribution 
to public understanding, rather than personal benefit to be derived by 
the requester. For purposes of this analysis, the identity and 
qualifications of the requester should be considered, to determine 
whether the requester is in a position to contribute to public 
understanding through the requested disclosure.
    (4) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be 
furthered by the requested disclosure; and if so
    (5) Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of 
the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public 
interest in disclosure, that disclosure is ``primarily in the commercial 
interest of the requester.''
    (b) If the initial request provides insufficient information for the 
agency to evaluate the request, GSA may ask the requester to furnish 
additional information. GSA will not start processing a request until 
the fee waiver issue has been resolved, unless the requester has 
provided written assurance of payment in full if the fee waiver is 
denied by the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-6  Searches.

    (a) GSA may charge for the time spent in the following activities in 
determining ``search time'' subject to applicable fees as provided in 
Sec. 105-60.305-10:
    (1) Time spent in trying to locate GSA records which come within the 
scope of the request;

[[Page 61]]

    (2) Time spent in either transporting a necessary agency searcher to 
a place of record storage, or in transporting records to the locations 
of a necessary agency searcher; and
    (3) Direct costs involving the use of computer time to locate and 
extract requested records.
    (b) GSA will not charge for the time spent in monitoring a 
requester's inspection of disclosed agency records.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-7  Reviews.

    (a) GSA may charge for the time spent in the following activities in 
determining ``review time'' subject to applicable fees as provided in 
Sec. 105-60.305-10:
    (1) Time spent in examining a requested record to determine whether 
the record is permitted to be withheld in whole or in part; and
    (2) Time spent in deleting exempt matter being withheld from records 
otherwise made available.
    (b) GSA will not charge for the time spent in resolving issues of 
law or policy regarding the application of exemptions.
    (c) GSA may not charge for review at the administrative appeal level 
of an exemption already applied. However, records or portions of records 
withheld in full under an exemption which is subsequently determined not 
to apply may be reviewed again to determine the applicability of other 
exemptions not previously considered. The costs for such a subsequent 
review would be properly assessable.
    (d) GSA will charge only commercial-use requesters for review time.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-8  Prepayment of fees over $250.

    GSA will require prepayment of fees for search, review, and 
reproduction which are likely to exceed $250. When the anticipated total 
fee exceeds $250, the requester will receive notice to prepay and at the 
same time will be given an opportunity to modify his or her request to 
reduce the fee. GSA will also inform the requester that fees for search 
time will be charged even if the search proves unsuccessful. GSA will 
not start processing a request until payment is received.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-9  Form of payment.

    Requesters should pay fees by check or money order made out to the 
General Services Administration and addressed to the official named by 
GSA in its correspondence.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-10  Fee schedule.

    (a) When GSA is aware that documents responsive to a request are 
maintained for distribution by an agency operating a statutory fee based 
program, GSA will inform the requester of the procedures for obtaining 
records from those sources.
    (b) In computing applicable fees, GSA will consider only the 
following costs in providing the requester records:
    (1) Review and search fees.

Manual searches by clerical staff....  $9 per hour or fraction of an    
                                        hour.                           
Manual searches and reviews by         $18 per hour or fraction of an   
 professional staff in cases in which   hour.                           
 clerical staff would be unable to                                      
 locate the requested records.                                          
Computer searches....................  Direct cost to GSA.              
Transportation or special handling of  Direct cost to GSA.              
 records.                                                               
                                                                        

    (2) Reproduction fees.

Pages no larger than 8\1/2\ by 14      $0.10 per page.                  
 inches, when reproduced by routine                                     
 electrostatic copying.                                                 
Pages over 8\1/2\ by 14 inches.......  Direct cost of reproduction to   
                                        GSA.                            
Pages requiring reduction,             Direct cost of reproduction to   
 enlargement, or other special          GSA.                            
 services.                                                              
Reproduction by other than routine     Direct cost of reproduction to   
 electrostatic copying.                 GSA.                            
                                                                        

    (c) Any fees not provided for under paragraph (b) of this section, 
shall be calculated in accordance with Sec. 105-60.305-1(b).
    (d) Categories of requesters. There are four categories of 
requesters: Commercial-use; educational and noncommercial scientific 
institutions; news media; and all other. The fees listed above apply 
with the following exceptions:

[[Page 62]]

    (1) GSA will not charge the requester if the fee is $10 or less as 
the cost of collection would be greater than the fee.
    (2) Educational and noncommercial scientific institutions and the 
news media will be charged for the cost of reproduction alone. These 
requesters are entitled to the first 100 pages (paper copies) of 
duplication at no cost. The following are examples of how these fees are 
calculated.
    (i) A request that results in 150 pages of material. No fee would be 
assessed for duplication of 150 pages. The reason is that these 
requesters are entitled to the first 100 pages at no charge. The charge 
for the remaining 50 pages would be $5. This amount would not be billed 
under the preceding section.
    (ii) A request that results in 250 pages of material. The requester 
in this case would be charged $15.
    (3) Noncommercial requesters who are not included under paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section will be entitled to the first 100 pages (paper 
copies) of duplication at no cost and 2 hours of search without charge. 
The term ``search time'' in this context has as its basis, manual 
search. To apply this term to searches made by computer, GSA will 
determine the hourly cost of operating the central processing unit and 
the operator's hourly salary plus 16 percent. When the cost of search 
(including the operator time and the cost of operating the computer to 
process a request) equals the equivalent dollar amount of two hours of 
the salary of the person performing the search, i.e., the operator, GSA 
will begin assessing charges for computer search.
    (4) GSA will charge commercial-use requesters fees which recover the 
full direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release, and 
duplicating the records sought. Commercial-use requesters are not 
entitled to 2 hours of free search time.
    (e) Determining category of requester. GSA may ask the requester to 
provide additional information at any time to determine what fee 
category he or she falls under. This applies to all requesters.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-11  Fees for authenticated and attested copies.

    The fees set forth in Sec. 105-60.305-10 apply to requests for 
authenticated and attested copies of GSA records.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-12  Administrative actions to improve assessment and collection of fees.

    (a) Charging interest. GSA may charge requesters who fail to pay 
fees interest on the amount billed starting on the 31st day following 
the day on which the billing was sent. Interest will be at the rate 
prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717.
    (b)  Effect of the Debt Collection Act of 1982. GSA will take any 
action authorized by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365), 
including disclosure to consumer reporting agencies, use of collection 
agencies, and assessment of penalties and administrative costs, where 
appropriate, to encourage payment.
    (c) Charges for unsuccessful search. The agency may assess charges 
for time spent searching for the records even if the agency fails to 
locate the records or if the records located are exempt from disclosure.
    (d) Notifying requester of charges over $25. If charges are likely 
to exceed $25, GSA will notify the requester and obtain, in writing, 
assurance of the requester's willingness to pay the estimated fee. The 
requester shall also be offered an opportunity to modify his or her 
request to reduce the fee. GSA will not start processing the request 
until assurance of payment is received.
    (e) Aggregating requests. When the agency reasonably believes that a 
requester, or group of requesters acting in concert, is attempting to 
break a request down into a series of requests related to the same 
subject for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, GSA will 
combine any such requests and charge accordingly, including fees for 
previous requests where charges were not assessed. GSA will presume that 
multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period are made to 
avoid fees.
    (f) Advance payments. (1) See Sec. 105-60.305-8 regarding prepayment 
of fees for FOIA requests.
    (2) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged in 
a timely

[[Page 63]]

fashion (i.e., within 30 days of the date of the billing), GSA will 
require the requester to pay the full amount owed plus any applicable 
interest penalties and administrative costs as provided above, or 
demonstrate that he or she has, in fact, paid the fee, and to make an 
advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the 
agency begins to process a new request or a pending request from that 
requester.
    (3) If GSA acts under paragraphs (f) (1) and (2) of this section, 
the administrative time limits in subsection (a)(6) of the FOIA (i.e., 
10 working days from receipt of initial requests and 20 working days 
from receipt of appeals form initial denial plus permissible time 
extensions) will begin only after it has received the fee payments 
described above.


<R04>
                   Subpart 105-60.4--Described Records


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.401  General.

    (a) Except for records made available in accordance with subparts 
105-60.2 and 105-60.3, GSA will make records available to a requester 
promptly when the request reasonably describes the records unless GSA 
invokes an exemption in accordance with subpart 105-60.5. Although the 
burden of reasonable description of the records rests with the 
requester, GSA will assist in identification.
    (b) Upon receipt of a request that does not reasonably describe the 
records requested, GSA may contact the requester to seek a more specific 
description. The 10-workday time limit set forth in Sec. 105-60.402-2 
will not start until the official identified in Sec. 105-60.402-1 
receives a request reasonably describing the records.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.402  Procedures for making records available.

    This section sets forth initial procedures for making records 
available when they are requested.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.402-1  Submission of requests.

    For records located in the GSA Central Office, the requester should 
submit a request in writing to the GSA FOIA Officer, General Services 
Administration (CAIR), Washington, DC 20405. For records located in the 
GSA regional offices, the requester should submit a request to the FOIA 
Officer for the relevant region, at the address listed in Sec. 105-
60.303(a), with the exception of Region 9. Requests for Region 9 should 
be sent to the following address: General Services Administration (9AA), 
525 Market St., 28th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105. Requests should 
include the words ``Freedom of Information Act Request'' prominently 
marked on both the face of the request letter and the envelope. The 10-
workday time limit for agency decisions set forth in Sec. 105-60.402-2 
begins with receipt of a request in the office of the appropriate 
official identified in this section, unless the provisions under 
Sec. 105-60.305-12(d) and (f) apply. Failure to include the words 
``Freedom of Information Act Request'' or to sumbit a request to the 
official identified in this section will result in processing delays. A 
requester who has questions concerning an FOIA request may consult the 
GSA FOIA Officer, General Services Administration (CAIR), 18th and F 
Streets, NW., Washington, DC 20405, (202) 535-7983.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.402-2  Response to initial requests.

    GSA will respond to an initial FOIA request within 10 workdays (that 
is, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after 
receipt of a request by the office of the appropriate official specified 
in Sec. 105-60.402-1. This letter should state the agency's decision 
with respect to disclosure or nondisclosure of the requested records. If 
the records to be disclosed are not provided with the initial letter, 
the records will be sent as soon as possible thereafter. In unusual 
circumstances, GSA will inform the requester of the agency's need to 
take an extension of time.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.403  Appeal within GSA.

    (a) A requester who receives a denial of a request, in whole or in 
part, may appeal that decision within GSA. The requester must direct the 
appeal to the GSA FOIA Officer, General Services Administration (CAIR), 
Washington,

[[Page 64]]

DC 20405, regardless of whether the denial being appealed was made in 
the Central Office or in a regional office.
    (b) The GSA FOIA Officer must receive an appeal no later than 30 
calendar days after receipt by the requester of the initial denial of 
access.
    (c) The requester must appeal in writing and include a brief 
statement of the reasons he or she thinks GSA should release the records 
and enclose copies of the initial request and denial. The appeal letter 
should include the words ``Freedom of Information Act Appeal'' on both 
the face of the appeal letter and on the envelope. Failure to follow 
these procedures will delay processing of the appeal. GSA has 20 
workdays after receipt of an appeal to make a determination with respect 
to the appeal. The 20-workday time limit shall not begin until the GSA 
FOIA Officer receives the appeal.
    (d) A requester who has received a denial of an appeal may seek 
judicial review of GSA's decision in the United States District Court in 
the district in which the requester resides or has a principal place of 
business, or where the records are situated, or in the United States 
District Court for the District of Columbia.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.404  Extension of time limits.

    (a) In unusual circumstances, the GSA FOIA Officer or the regional 
FOIA Officer may extend the time limits prescribed in Secs. 105-60.402 
and 105-60.403. For purposes of this section, the term ``unusual 
circumstances'' means:
    (1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from 
field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the 
office processing the request;
    (2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a 
voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in 
a single request;
    (3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all 
practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in 
the determination of the request or among two or more components of the 
agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein; or
    (4) The need to consult with the submitter of the requested 
information.
    (b) If necessary, more than one extension of time may be taken. 
However, the total extension of time shall not exceed 10 workdays with 
respect to a particular request. The extension may be divided between 
the initial and appeal stages or within a single stage. GSA will provide 
a written notice to the requester of any extension of time limits.


<R04>
                      Subpart 105-60.5--Exemptions


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.501   Categories of records exempt from disclosure under the FOIA.

    (a) 5 U.S.C. 552(b) provides that the requirements of the FOIA do 
not apply to matters that are:
    (1) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an 
Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or 
foreign policy and that are, in fact, properly classified under the 
Executive order;
    (2) Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of 
an agency;
    (3) Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute, other than the 
Government in the Sunshine Act, provided that the statute (i) requires 
that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to 
leave no discretion on the issue of (ii) establishes particular criteria 
for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld;
    (4) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained 
from a person that are privileged or confidential;
    (5) Interagency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would 
not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation 
with the agency;
    (6) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of 
which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy;
    (7) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, 
but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement 
records or information:

[[Page 65]]

    (i) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement 
proceedings;
    (ii) Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an 
impartial adjudication;
    (iii) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted 
invasion of personal privacy;
    (iv) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a 
confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or 
authority or any private institution which furnished information on a 
confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled 
by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal 
investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security 
intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential 
source;
    (v) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement 
investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law 
enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could 
reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or
    (vi) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical 
safety of any individual.
    (8) Contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition 
reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency 
responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; 
and
    (9) Geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, 
concerning wells.
    (b) GSA will provide any reasonably segregable portion of a record 
to a requester after deletion of the portions that are exempt under this 
section.
    (c) GSA will invoke no exemption under this section to deny access 
to records that would be available pursuant to a request made under the 
Privacy Act of 1974 and implementing regulations, part 105-64, or if 
disclosure would cause no demonstrable harm to any public or private 
interest.
    (d) Whenever a request is made which involves access to records 
described in Sec. 105-60.501(a)(7)(i) and
    (1) The investigation or proceeding involves a possible violation of 
criminal law, and
    (2) There is reason to believe that (i) the subject of the 
investigation or proceeding is not aware of its pendency, and (ii) 
disclosure of the existence of the records could reasonably be expected 
to interfere with enforcement proceedings, the agency may, during only 
such time as that circumstance continues, treat the records as not 
subject to the requirements of this section.
    (e) Whenever informant records maintained by a criminal law 
enforcement agency under an informant's name or personal identifier are 
requested by a third party according to the informant's name or personal 
identifier, the agency may treat the records as not subject to the 
requirements of this section unless the informant's status as an 
informant has been officially confirmed.
    (f) Whenever a request is made which involves access to records 
maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation pertaining to foreign 
intelligence or counterintelligence, or international terrorism, and the 
existence of the records is classified information as provided in 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Bureau may, as long as the 
existence of the records remains classified information, treat the 
records as not subject to the requirements of this section.

Sec. 105-62.000  Scope of part.

    This part prescribes procedures for safeguarding national security 
information and material within GSA. They explain how to identify, 
classify, downgrade, declassify, disseminate, and protect such 
information in the interests of national security. They also supplement 
and conform with Executive Order 12065 dated June 28, 1978, subject: 
National Security Information, and the Implementing Directive dated 
September 29, 1978, issued through the Information Security Oversight 
Office.

                 Subpart 105-62.1--Classified Materials


<R05>
Sec. 105-62.101  Security classification categories.

    As set forth in Executive Order 12065, official information or 
material which requires protection against unauthorized disclosure in 
the interests of the national defense or foreign relations of the United 
States (hereinafter collectively termed ``national security'') shall be 
classified in one of three categories: Namely, Top Secret, Secret, or 
Confidential, depending on its degree of significance to the national 
security. No other categories shall be used to identify official 
information or material as requiring protection in the interests of 
national security except as otherwise expressly provided by statute. The 
three classification categories are defined as follows:
    (a) Top Secret. Top Secret refers to that national security 
information which requires the highest degree of protection, and shall 
be applied only to such information as the unauthorized disclosure of 
which could reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage 
to the national security. Examples of exceptionally grave damage include 
armed hostilities against the United States or its allies, disruption of 
foreign relations vitally affecting the national security, intelligence 
sources and methods, and the compromise of vital national defense plans 
or complex cryptologic and communications systems. This classification 
shall be used with the utmost restraint.
    (b) Secret. Secret refers to that national security information or 
material which requires a substantial degree of protection, and shall be 
applied only to such information as the unauthorized disclosure of which 
could reasonably be expected to cause serious damage to the national 
security. Examples of serious damage include disruption of foreign 
relations significantly affecting the national security, significant 
impairment of a program or policy directly related to the national 
security, and revelation of significant military plans or intelligence 
operations. This classification shall be used sparingly.
    (c) Confidential. Confidential refers to other national security 
information which requires protection, and shall be applied only to such 
information as the unauthorized disclosure of which could reasonably be 
expected to cause identifiable damage to the national security.


<R05>
Sec. 105-62.102  Authority to originally classify.

    (a) Top secret, secret, and confidential. The authority to 
originally classify information as Top Secret, Secret, or Confidential 
may be exercised only by

[[Page 67]]

the Administrator and is delegable only to the Director, Information 
Security Oversight Office.
    (b) Limitations on delegation of classification authority. 
Delegations of original classification authority are limited to the 
minimum number absolutely required for efficient administration. 
Delegated original classification authority may not be redelegated.

[47 FR 5416, Feb. 5, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 105-62.103  Access to GSA-originated materials.

    Classified information shall not be disseminated outside the 
executive branch of the Government without the express permission of the 
GSA Security Officer except as otherwise provided in this Sec. 105-
62.103.
    (a) Access by historical researchers. Persons outside the executive 
branch who are engaged in historical research projects, may be 
authorized access to classified information or material, provided that:
    (1) A written determination is made by the Administrator of General 
Services that such access is clearly consistent with the interests of 
national security.
    (2) Access is limited to that information over which GSA has 
classification jurisdiction.
    (3) The material requested is reasonably accessible and can be 
located with a reasonable amount of effort.
    (4) The person agrees to safeguard the information and to authorize 
a review of his or her notes and manuscript for determination that no 
classified information is contained therein by signing a statement 
entitled ``Conditions Governing Access to Official Records for 
Historical Research Purposes.''
    (5) An authorization for access shall be valid for a period of 2 
years from the date of issuance and may be renewed under the provisions 
of this Sec. 105-62.103(a).
    (b) Access by former Presidential appointees. Persons who previously 
occupied policymaking positions to which they were appointed by the 
President may not remove classified information or material upon 
departure from office as all such material must remain under the 
security control of the U.S. Government. Such persons may be authorized 
access to classified information or material which they originated, 
received, reviewed, signed, or which was addressed to them while in 
public office, provided that the GSA element having classification 
jurisdiction for such information or material makes a written 
determination that access is consistent with the interests of national 
security, approval is granted by the GSA Security Officer, and the 
individual seeking access agrees:
    (1) To safeguard the information,
    (2) To authorize a review of his or her notes for determination that 
no classified information is contained therein, and
    (3) To ensure that no classified information will be further 
disseminated or published.
    (c) Access during judicial proceedings. Classified information will 
not normally be released in the course of any civilian judicial 
proceeding. In special circumstances however, and upon the receipt of an 
order or subpoena issued by a Federal court, the Administrator may 
authorize the limited release of classified information if he or she 
determines that the interests of justice cannot otherwise be served. 
Appropriate safeguards will be established to protect such classified 
material released for use in judicial proceedings.
    (d) Access to material in NARS custody. The Archivist of the United 
States prepares procedures governing access to materials transferred to 
NARS custody. These procedures are issued by the Administrator of 
General Services in 41 CFR part 105-61.
    (e) Access by the General Accounting Office and congressional 
committees. Classified information may be released to the General 
Accounting Office (GAO) and congressional committees when specifically 
authorized by the GSA Security Officer except as otherwise provided by 
law.


<R04>
           Subpart 105-62.2--Declassification and Downgrading


<R05>
Sec. 105-62.201  Declassification and downgrading.

    (a) Authority to downgrade and declassify. The authority to 
downgrade and

[[Page 68]]

declassify national security information or material shall be exercised 
as follows:
    (1) Information or material may be downgraded or declassified by the 
GSA official authorizing the original classification, by a successor in 
capacity, by a supervisory official of either, or by the Information 
Security Oversight Committee on appeal.
    (2) Downgrading and declassification authority may also be exercised 
by an official specifically authorized by the Administrator.
    (3) In the case of classified information or material officially 
transferred to GSA by or under statute or Executive order in conjunction 
with a transfer of functions and not merely for storage purposes, GSA 
shall be deemed the originating agency for all purposes under these 
procedures including downgrading and declassification.
    (4) In the case of classified information or material held in GSA 
not officially transferred under paragraph (a)(3) of this section but 
originated in an agency which has since ceased to exist, GSA is deemed 
the originating agency. Such information or material may be downgraded 
and declassified 30 calendar days after consulting with any other 
agencies having an interest in the subject matter.
    (5) Classified information or material under the final 
declassification jurisdiction of GSA which has been transferred to NARS 
for accession into the Archives of the United States may be downgraded 
and declassified by the Archivist of the United States in accordance 
with Executive Order 12065, directives of the Information Security 
Oversight Office, and the systematic review guidelines issued by the 
Administrator of General Services.
    (6) It is presumed that information which continues to meet 
classification requirements requires continued protection. In some 
cases, however, the need to protect such information may be outweighed 
by the public interest in disclosure of the information, and in these 
cases the information should be declassified. When such questions arise 
they shall be referred to the Administrator, the Director of the 
Information Security Oversight Office, or in accordance with the 
procedures for mandatory review described in Sec. 105-62.202(b).
    (b) Declassification. Declassification of information shall be given 
emphasis comparable to that acccorded classification. Information 
classified under Executive Order 12065 and prior orders shall be 
declassified as early as national security considerations permit. 
Decisions concerning declassification shall be based on the loss of 
sensitivity of the information with the passage of time or on the 
occurrence of an event which permits declassification. When information 
is reviewed for declassification it shall be declassified unless the 
declassification authority established in Sec. 105-62.202 determines 
that the information continues to meet the classification requirements 
prescribed despite the passage of time.
    (c) Downgrading. Classified information that is marked for automatic 
downgrading is downgraded accordingly without notification to holders. 
Classified information that is not marked for automatic downgrading may 
be assigned a lower classification designation by the originator or by 
an official authorized to declassify the same information. Notice of 
downgrading shall be provided to known holders of the information.


<R05>
Sec. 105-62.202  Review of classified materials for declassification purposes.

    (a) Systematic review for declassification. Except for foreign 
government information, classified information constituting permanently 
valuable records of GSA as defined by 44 U.S.C. 2103, and information in 
the possession and under control of NARA, under 44 U.S.C. 2107 or 2107 
note, shall be reviewed for declassification as it becomes 20 years old. 
Transition to systematic review at 20 years shall be implemented as 
rapidly as practicable and shall be completed by December 1, 1988. 
Foreign government information shall be reviewed for declassification as 
it becomes 30 years old.
    (b) Mandatory review for declassification. All classified 
information upon request by a member of the public or a Government 
employee or agency to declassify and release such information under the 
provisions of Executive

[[Page 69]]

Order 12065 shall be reviewed by the responsible GSA element for 
possible declassification in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section.
    (c) Submission of requests for review. Requests for mandatory review 
of classified information shall be submitted in accordance with the 
following:
    (1) Requests originating within GSA shall in all cases be submitted 
directly to the service or staff office that originated the information.
    (2) For expeditious action, requests from other governmental 
agencies or from members of the public should be submitted directly to 
the service or staff office that originated the material, or, if the 
originating element is not known, or no longer exists, the requester 
shall submit the request to the GSA Security Officer who shall cause 
such request to be reviewed.
    (d) Requirements for processing. Requests for declassification 
review and release of information shall be processed in accordance with 
the provisions set forth in paragraphs (e) through (h) of this section 
subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The request is in writing and reasonably describes the 
information sought with sufficient particularity to enable the element 
to identify it.
    (2) The requester shall be asked to correct a request that does not 
comply with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to provide additional 
information.
    (3) If within 30 days the requester does not correct the request, 
describe the information sought with sufficient particularity or narrow 
the scope of the request, the element that received the request shall 
notify the requester and state the reason why no action will be taken on 
the request.
    (e) Processing of requests. Requests that meet the foregoing 
requirements for processing will be acted upon as follows:
    (1) GSA action upon the initial request shall be completed within 60 
days.
    (2) Receipt of the request shall be acknowledged within 7 days.
    (3) The designated service or staff office shall determine if the 
requested information may be declassified and shall make such 
information available to the requester, unless withholding it is 
otherwise warranted under applicable law. If the information may not be 
released in whole or in part, the requester shall be given a brief 
statement as to the reasons for denial, a notice of the right to appeal 
the determination to the Deputy Administrator (the notice shall include 
the Deputy Administrator's name, title, and address), and a notice that 
such an appeal must be filed with the Deputy Administrator within 60 
days in order to be considered.
    (f) Foreign government information. Except as provided hereinafter, 
requests for mandatory review for the declassification of classified 
documents that contain foreign government information shall be processed 
and acted upon in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (c) 
through (e) of this section. If the request involves information that 
was initially received or classified by GSA, then the corresponding 
service or staff office shall be designated by the GSA Security Officer 
to determine whether the foreign government information in the document 
may be declassified and released in accordance with GSA policy or 
guidelines, after consulting with other agencies that have subject 
matter interest as necessary. If GSA is not the agency that received or 
classified the foreign government information, it shall refer the 
request to the appropriate agency. In those cases where agency policy or 
guidelines do not apply, consultation with the foreign originator, 
through the GSA Security Officer, may be made prior to final action on 
the request.
    (g) Information classified outside the service or staff office. When 
a service or staff office receives a request for declassification of 
information in a document which is in the custody of the service or 
staff office but was classified by another service or staff office or by 
another Government agency, the service or staff office shall refer the 
request to the classifying service or staff office or Government agency, 
together with a copy of the document containing the information 
requested when

[[Page 70]]

practicable, and shall notify the requester of the referral, unless the 
agency that classified the information objects on the grounds that its 
association with the information requires protection. When a GSA service 
or staff office receives such a referral, it shall process the request 
in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph and, if so 
requested, shall notify the referring service, staff office, or agency 
of the determination made on the request.
    (h) Action on appeal. The following procedures shall be followed 
when denials of requests for declassification are appealed:
    (1) The Deputy Administrator shall, within 15 days of the date of 
the appeal, convene a meeting of the GSA Information Security Oversight 
Committee (ISOC) that shall include the GSA Security Officer, or his or 
her representative, and the GSA official who denied the original request 
(and, at the option of that official, any subordinates or personnel from 
other agencies that participated in the decision for denial).
    (2) The ISOC shall learn from the official the reasons for denying 
the request, concentrating in particular upon which requirement 
continued classification is based and the identifiable damage that would 
result if the information were declassified. The ISOC shall also learn 
from the official the part or parts of the information that is 
classified and if by deleting minor segments of the information it might 
not then be declassified.
    (3) The ISOC's decision to uphold or deny the appeal, in whole or in 
part, shall be based upon the unanimous opinion of its membership. In 
the event that unanimity cannot be attained, the matter shall be 
referred to the Administrator, whose decision shall be final.
    (4) Based upon the outcome of the appeal, a reply shall be made to 
the person making the appeal that either encloses the requested 
information or part of the information, or explains why the continued 
classification of the information is required. A copy of the reply shall 
be sent to the GSA official who originally denied the request for 
declassification, to the GSA Security Officer, and to any other agency 
expressing an interest in the decision.
    (5) Final action on appeals shall be completed within 30 days of the 
date of the appeal.
    (i) Prohibition. No service of staff office in possession of a 
classified document may refuse to confirm the existence of the document 
in response to a request for the document under the provisions for 
mandatory review, unless the fact of its existence would itself be 
classifiable.
    (j) Presidential papers.  Information less than 10 years old which 
was originated by the President, by the White House staff, or by 
committees or commissions appointed by the President, or by others 
acting on behalf of the President, is exempted from mandatory review for 
declassification. Such information 10 years old or older is subject to 
mandatory review for declassification in accordance with procedures 
developed by the Archivist of the United States which provide for 
consultation with GSA on matters of primary subject interest to this 
agency.

Sec. 105-64.101  Maintenance of records.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.101-1  Collection and use.

    (a) General. The system manager (also called the manager) should 
collect information used for determining an individual's rights, 
benefits, or privileges under GSA programs directly from the subject 
individual if practical. The system manager should ensure that 
information collected is used only as intended by the Act and these 
regulations.
    (b) Soliciting information. Manager must ensure that when 
information is solicited, the person is informed of the authority for 
collecting it; whether providing it is mandatory or voluntary; the 
purpose for which it will be used; routine uses of the information; and 
the effect on the individual, if any, of not providing the information. 
Heads of Services and Staff Offices and Regional Administrators must 
ensure that forms used to solicit information comply with the Act and 
these regulations.
    (c) Soliciting a social security number. Before requesting a person 
to disclose his or her social security number, ensure either:
    (1) The disclosure is required by Federal statute, or;

If soliciting a social security number is authorized under paragraph (c) 
(1) or (2) of this section, inform the person beforehand whether the 
disclosure is mandatory or voluntary, by what legal or other authority 
the number is requested, and the use that is to be made of it.
    (d) Soliciting information from third parties. Officers or employees 
must inform third parties requested to provide information about another 
person of the reason for collecting the information.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.101-2  Standards of accuracy.

determinations about an individual are maintained with the accuracy, 
relevance, timeliness, and completeness needed to ensure fairness to the 
individual.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.101-3  Rules of conduct.

    Those who design, develop, operate, or maintain a system of records, 
or any record, must review 5 U.S.C. 552a and the regulations in this 
part and follow 41 CFR part 105-735, Standards of Conduct, for 
protecting personal information.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.101-4  Safeguarding systems of records.

    Managers must ensure that administrative, technical, and physical 
safeguards are established to ensure the security and confidentiality of 
records and to protect against possible threats or hazards which could 
be harmful, embarrassing, inconvenient, or unfair to any individual. 
They must protect personnel information contained in manual and 
automated systems of records by using the following safeguards:
    (a) Storing official personnel folders and work folders in a 
lockable filing cabinet when not in use. The system

[[Page 73]]

manager may use an alternative storage system if it provides the same 
security as a locked cabinet.
    (b) Designating other sensitive records that need safeguards similar 
to those described in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Permitting access to and use of automated or manual personnel 
records only to persons whose official duties require it, or to a 
subject individual or to his or her representative.

    This part 105-64 applies or takes precedence when any GSA directive 
disagrees with it.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.102  Records of other agencies.

    If a GSA employee receives a request to review records that are the 
primary responsibility of another agency, but are maintained by or in 
the temporary possession of GSA, the employee should consult with the 
other agency before releasing the records. Records in the custody of GSA 
that are the responsibility of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) 
are governed by rules issued by OPM under the Privacy Act.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.103  Subpoenas and other legal demands.

him or her that is contained in a system or records maintained in the 
GSA Central Office should send a written request to the GSA Privacy Act 
Officer, General Services Administration (ATRAI), Washington, DC 20405.

individual; a brief description of the nature, time, place, and 
circumstances of the person's association with GSA; and any other 
information that would indicate whether the information is in the system 
of records. The 10-workday time limit for the agency to reply under

<R05>
Sec. 105-64.301-2  Special requirements for medical records.

records belonging to the Office of Personnel Management and described in 
Chapter 339, Federal Personnel Manual (records about entrance 
qualification, fitness for duty, or records filed in the official 
personnel folder), should refer the matter to a Federal medical officer 
for a decision under this section. If no medical officer is available, 
the manager should send the request and the medical reports to the 
Office of Personnel Management for a decision.
    (b) If the Federal medical officer believes the medical records 
requested by the subject individual discuss a condition that a physician 
would hesitate to reveal to the person, the manager may release the 
information only to a physician designated in writing by the subject 
individual, his or her guardian, or conservator. If the records contain 
information the physician would likely disclose to the person, the 
information may be released to anyone the person authorizes in writing 
to receive it.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.301-3  Granting access.

    (a) Upon receiving a request for access to nonexempt records, the 
manager must make them available to the subject individual or

when the records will be available.
    (b) If the manager expects a delay of more than the 10 days allowed, 
he or she should state the reason why in the acknowledgement.
    (c) If a request for access does not contain enough information to 
find the records, the manager should request additional information from 
the individual and is allowed 10 more workdays after receiving it to 
make the records available or acknowledge receiving the request.
    (d) Records are available during normal business hours at the

[[Page 75]]

should be prepared to identify themselves by signature and to show other 
identification verifying their signature.
    (e) Managers may permit an individual to examine the original of a 
nonexempt record and, if asked, provide the person with a copy of the 
record. Fees are charged only for copies given to the person, not for 
copies made for the agency's convenience.
    (f) A requester may pick up a record in person or receive it by 
mail, directed to an address provided in the request. The manager should 
not give a record to a third party to deliver to the subject individual, 
except medical records as outlined in Sec. 105-64.301-2 or as described 
in paragraph (g) of this section.
    (g) If a person wants to have someone else accompany him or her 
while reviewing a record or when obtaining a copy of it, he or she must 
first sign a statement authorizing the disclosure of the record. The 
system manager shall maintain this statement with the record.
    (h) The procedure to review the account of disclosures is the same 
as the procedures for reviewing a record.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.301-4  Denials of access.

not be disclosed. These systems are described in Subpart 105-64.6.
    (b) If a manager receives a request for access to a record in an 
exempt system of record, he or she should forward it to the Head of the 
Service or Staff Office or Regional Administrator, attaching an 
explanation and recommending the request be denied or granted.
    (c) If the manager is the Head of a Service or Staff Office or a 
Regional Administrator, he or she retains the responsibility for 
granting or denying the request.
    (d) The head of the Service or Staff Office or Regional 
Administrator, in consultation with legal counsel and other officials 
concerned, should decide whether the requested record is exempt from 
disclosure and,
    (1) If the record is not exempt, notify the system manager to grant 
the request under Sec. 105-64.301-3; or
    (2) If the record is part of an exempt system he or she should:
    (i) Notify the requester that the request is denied, explain why it 
is denied, and inform the requester of his or her right to have GSA

Services Administration (ATRAI), Washington, DC 20405, regardless 
whether the denial was made by a Central Office or a regional official.
    (b) Each appeal to the Privacy Act Officer must be in writing. The 
appeal should be marked Privacy Act-Access Appeal, on the face of the 
letter and on the envelope.
    (c) On receiving an appeal, the Privacy Act Officer consults with

officials concerned. If the Privacy Act Officer, after consultation, 
decides to grant the request, he or she notifies the manager in writing 
to grant access to the record under Sec. 105-64.301-3, or grants access 
himself or herself and notifies the requester of that action.
    (d) If the Privacy Act Officer decides the appeal should be 
rejected, he or she sends the request file and any appeal, with a 
recommendation, to the Deputy Administrator for a final administrative 
decision.
    (e) If the Deputy Administrator decides to grant a request, he or 
she promptly instructs the system manager in writing to grant access to 
the record under Sec. 105-64.301-3. The Deputy

[[Page 76]]

Administrator sends a copy of the instructions to the Privacy Act 
Officer, who notifies the requester.
    (f) If the Deputy Administrator rejects an appeal, he or she should 
promptly notify the requester in writing. This action constitutes the 
final administrative decision on the request and should state:

    On receiving a final decision not to amend a record, the requester 
may file a Statement of Disagreement with the manager. The statement 
should explain why the requester believes the record to be inaccurate, 
irrelevant, untimely, or incomplete. The manager must file the statement 
with the records and include a copy of it in any disclosure of the 
record. The manager must also provide a copy of the Statement of 
Disagreement to any person or agency to whom the record has been

                        Subpart 105-68.1--General


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.100  Purpose.

    (a) Executive Order (E.O.) 12549 provides that, to the extent 
permitted by law, Executive departments and agencies shall participate 
in a governmentwide system for nonprocurement debarment and suspension. 
A person who is debarred or suspended shall be excluded from Federal 
financial and nonfinancial assistance and benefits under Federal 
programs and activities. Debarment or suspension of a participant in a 
program by one agency shall have governmentwide effect.
    (b) These regulations implement section 3 of E.O. 12549 and the 
guidelines promulgated by the Office of Management and Budget under 
section 6 of the E.O. by:
    (1) Prescribing the programs and activities that are covered by the 
governmentwide system;
    (2) Prescribing the governmentwide criteria and governmentwide 
minimum due process procedures that each agency shall use;
    (3) Providing for the listing of debarred and suspended 
participants,

[[Page 82]]

participants declared ineligible (see definition of ``ineligible'' in 
Sec. 105-68.105), and participants who have voluntarily excluded 
themselves from participation in covered transactions;
    (4) Setting forth the consequences of a debarment, suspension, 
determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion; and
    (5) Offering such other guidance as necessary for the effective 
implementation and administration of the governmentwide system.
    (c) These regulations also implement Executive Order 12689 (3 CFR, 
1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Public Law 103-355, sec. 
2455, 108 Stat. 3327) by--
    (1) Providing for the inclusion in the List of Parties Excluded from 
Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs all persons proposed for 
debarment, debarred or suspended under the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation, 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4; persons against which 
governmentwide exclusions have been entered under this part; and persons 
determined to be ineligible; and
    (2) Setting forth the consequences of a debarment, suspension, 
determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion.
    (d) Although these regulations cover the listing of ineligible 
participants and the effect of such listing, they do not prescribe 
policies and procedures governing declarations of ineligibility.

<R05>
Sec. 105-68.110  Coverage.

    (a) These regulations apply to all persons who have participated, 
are currently participating or may reasonably be expected to participate 
in transactions under Federal nonprocurement programs. For purposes of 
these regulations such transactions will be referred to as ``covered 
transactions.''
    (1) Covered transaction. For purposes of these regulations, a 
covered transaction is a primary covered transaction or a lower tier 
covered transaction. Covered transactions at any tier need not involve 
the transfer of Federal funds.
    (i) Primary covered transaction. Except as noted in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section, a primary covered transaction is any nonprocurement 
transaction between an agency and a person, regardless of type, 
including: grants, cooperative agreements, scholarships, fellowships, 
contracts of assistance, loans, loan guarantees, subsidies, insurance, 
payments for specified use, donation agreements and any other 
nonprocurement transactions between a Federal agency and a person. 
Primary covered transactions also include those transactions specially 
designated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in 
such agency's regulations governing debarment and suspension.
    (ii) Lower tier covered transaction. A lower tier covered 
transaction is:
    (A) Any transaction between a participant and a person other than a 
procurement contract for goods or services, regardless of type, under a 
primary covered transaction.
    (B) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a 
participant and a person, regardless of type, expected to equal or 
exceed the Federal procurement small purchase threshold fixed at 10 
U.S.C. 2304(g) and 41 U.S.C. 253(g) (currently $25,000) under a primary 
covered transaction.
    (C) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a 
participant and a person under a covered transaction, regardless of 
amount, under which that person will have a critical influence on or 
substantive control over that covered transaction. Such persons are:
    (1) Principal investigators.
    (2) Providers of federally-required audit services.
    (2) Exceptions. The following transactions are not covered:
    (i) Statutory entitlements or mandatory awards (but not subtier 
awards thereunder which are not themselves mandatory), including 
deposited funds insured by the Federal Government;
    (ii) Direct awards to foreign governments or public international 
organizations, or transactions with foreign governments or foreign 
governmental entities, public international organizations, foreign 
government owned (in whole or in part) or controlled entities, entities 
consisting wholly or partially of foreign governments or foreign 
governmental entities;
    (iii) Benefits to an individual as a personal entitlement without 
regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received 
in an individual's business capacity are not excepted);
    (iv) Federal employment;
    (v) Transactions pursuant to national or agency-recognized 
emergencies or disasters;
    (vi) Incidental benefits derived from ordinary governmental 
operations; and
    (vii) Other transactions where the application of these regulations 
would be prohibited by law.
    (b) Relationship to other sections. This section describes the types 
of transactions to which a debarment or suspension under the regulations 
will apply. Subpart 105-68.2, ``Effect of Action,'' Sec. 105-68.200, 
``Debarment or suspension,'' sets forth the consequences of a debarment 
or suspension. Those consequences would obtain only with respect to 
participants and principals in the covered transactions and activities 
described in Sec. 105-68.110(a). Sections 105-68.325, ``Scope of 
debarment,'' and 105-68.420, ``Scope of suspension,'' govern the extent 
to which a specific participant or organizational elements of a 
participant would be automatically included within a debarment or 
suspension action, and the conditions under

[[Page 85]]

which affiliates or persons associated with a participant may also be 
brought within the scope of the action.
    (c) Relationship to Federal procurement activities. In accordance 
with E.O. 12689 and section 2455 of Public Law 103-355, any debarment, 
suspension, proposed debarment or other governmentwide exclusion 
initiated under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) on or after 
August 25, 1995, shall be recognized by and effective for Executive 
Branch agencies and participants as an exclusion under this regulation. 
Similarly, any debarment, suspension or other governmentwide exclusion 
initiated under this regulation on or after August 25, 1995, shall be 
recognized by and effective for those agencies as a debarment or 
suspension under the FAR.

[53 FR 19198, 19204, May 26, 1988, as amended at 54 FR 4962, Jan. 31, 
1989; 60 FR 33041, 33059, June 26, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.115  Policy.

    (a) In order to protect the public interest, it is the policy of the 
Federal Government to conduct business only with responsible persons. 
Debarment and suspension are discretionary actions that, taken in 
accordance with Executive Order 12549 and these regulations, are 
appropriate means to implement this policy.
    (b) Debarment and suspension are serious actions which shall be used 
only in the public interest and for the Federal Government's protection 
and not for purposes of punishment. Agencies may impose debarment or 
suspension for the causes and in accordance with the procedures set 
forth in these regulations.
    (c) When more than one agency has an interest in the proposed 
debarment or suspension of a person, consideration shall be given to 
designating one agency as the lead agency for making the decision. 
Agencies are encouraged to establish methods and procedures for 
coordinating their debarment or suspension actions.

<R05>
Sec. 105-68.200  Debarment or suspension.

    (a) Primary covered transactions. Except to the extent prohibited by 
law, persons who are debarred or suspended shall be excluded from 
primary covered transactions as either participants or principals 
throughout the Executive Branch of the Federal Government for the period 
of their debarment, suspension, or the period they are proposed for 
debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4. Accordingly, no agency shall 
enter into primary covered transactions with such excluded persons 
during such period, except as permitted pursuant to Sec. 105-68.215.
    (b) Lower tier covered transactions. Except to the extent prohibited 
by law, persons who have been proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 
9, subpart 9.4, debarred or suspended shall be excluded from 
participating as either participants or principals in all lower tier 
covered transactions (see Sec. 105-68.110(a)(1)(ii)) for the period of 
their exclusion.
    (c) Exceptions. Debarment or suspension does not affect a person's 
eligibility for--
    (1) Statutory entitlements or mandatory awards (but not subtier 
awards thereunder which are not themselves mandatory), including 
deposited funds insured by the Federal Government;
    (2) Direct awards to foreign governments or public international 
organizations, or transactions with foreign governments or foreign 
governmental entities, public international organizations, foreign 
government owned (in whole or in part) or controlled entities, and 
entities consisting wholly or partially of foreign governments or 
foreign governmental entities;
    (3) Benefits to an individual as a personal entitlement without 
regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received 
in an individual's business capacity are not excepted);
    (4) Federal employment;
    (5) Transactions pursuant to national or agency-recognized 
emergencies or disasters;
    (6) Incidental benefits derived from ordinary governmental 
operations; and
    (7) Other transactions where the application of these regulations 
would be prohibited by law.

Sec. 105-68.205  Ineligible persons.

    Persons who are ineligible, as defined in Sec. 105-68.105(i), are 
excluded in accordance with the applicable statutory, executive order, 
or regulatory authority.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.210  Voluntary exclusion.

    Persons who accept voluntary exclusions under Sec. 105-68.315 are 
excluded in accordance with the terms of their settlements. GSA shall, 
and participants may, contact the original action agency to ascertain 
the extent of the exclusion.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.215  Exception provision.

    GSA may grant an exception permitting a debarred, suspended, or 
voluntarily excluded person, or a person proposed for debarment under 48 
CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, to participate in a particular covered 
transaction upon a written determination by the agency head or an 
authorized designee stating the reason(s) for deviating from the 
Presidential policy established by Executive Order 12549 and Sec. 105-
68.200. However, in accordance with the President's stated intention in 
the Executive Order, exceptions shall be granted only infrequently. 
Exceptions shall be reported in accordance with Sec. 105-68.505(a).

<R05>
Sec. 105-68.220  Continuation of covered transactions.

    (a) Notwithstanding the debarment, suspension, proposed debarment 
under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, determination of ineligibility, or 
voluntary exclusion of any person by an agency, agencies and 
participants may continue covered transactions in existence at the time 
the person was debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 CFR 
part 9, subpart 9.4, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded. A 
decision as to the type of termination action, if any, to be taken 
should be made only after thorough review to ensure the propriety of the 
proposed action.
    (b) Agencies and participants shall not renew or extend covered 
transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) with any person who is 
debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 
9.4, ineligible or voluntary excluded, except as provided in Sec. 105-
68.215.

[60 FR 33041 and 33059, June 26, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.225  Failure to adhere to restrictions.

    (a) Except as permitted under Sec. 105-68.215 or Sec. 105-68.220, a 
participant shall not knowingly do business under a covered transaction 
with a person who is--
    (1) Debarred or suspended;
    (2) Proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4; or
    (3) Ineligible for or voluntarily excluded from the covered 
transaction.
    (b) Violation of the restriction under paragraph (a) of this section 
may result in disallowance of costs, annulment or termination of award, 
issuance of a stop work order, debarment or suspension, or other 
remedies as appropriate.
    (c) A participant may rely upon the certification of a prospective 
participant in a lower tier covered transaction that it and its 
principals are not debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 
CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from the 
covered transaction (See appendix B of these regulations), unless it 
knows that the certification is erroneous. An agency has the burden of 
proof that a participant did knowingly do business with a person that 
filed an erroneous certification.

Sec. 105-68.305, using procedures established in Secs. 105-68.310 
through 105-68.314. The existence of a cause for debarment, however, 
does not necessarily require that the person be debarred; the 
seriousness of the person's acts or omissions and any mitigating factors 
shall be considered in making any debarment decision.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.305  Causes for debarment.

<R05>
Sec. 105-68.310  Procedures.

    GSA shall process debarment actions as informally as practicable, 
consistent with the principles of fundamental fairness, using the 
procedures in Secs. 105-68.311 through 105-68.314 and 48 CFR subpart 
509.4.

[53 FR 19198, 19204, May 26, 1988, as amended at 56 FR 29438, June 27, 
1991]


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.311  Investigation and referral.

    Information concerning the existence of a cause for debarment from 
any source shall be promptly reported, investigated, and referred, when 
appropriate, to the debarring official for consideration. After 
consideration, the debarring official may issue a notice of proposed 
debarment.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.312  Notice of proposed debarment.

    A debarment proceeding shall be initiated by notice to the 
respondent advising:
    (a) That debarment is being considered;
    (b) Of the reasons for the proposed debarment in terms sufficient to 
put the respondent on notice of the conduct or transaction(s) upon which 
it is based;
    (c) Of the cause(s) relied upon under Sec. 105-68.305 for proposing 
debarment;
    (d) Of the provisions of Sec. 105-68.311 through Sec. 105-68.314, 
and any other GSA procedures, if applicable, governing debarment 
decisionmaking; and
    (e) Of the potential effect of a debarment.

[[Page 88]]


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.313  Opportunity to contest proposed debarment.

    (a) Submission in opposition. Within 30 days after receipt of the 
notice of proposed debarment, the respondent may submit, in person, in 
writing, or through a representative, information and argument in 
opposition to the proposed debarment.
    (b) Additional proceedings as to disputed material facts. (1) In 
actions not based upon a conviction or civil judgment, if the debarring 
official finds that the respondent's submission in opposition raises a 
genuine dispute over facts material to the proposed debarment, 
respondent(s) shall be afforded an opportunity to appear with a 
representative, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and 
confront any witness the agency presents.
    (2) A transcribed record of any additional proceedings shall be made 
available at cost to the respondent, upon request, unless the respondent 
and the agency, by mutual agreement, waive the requirement for a 
transcript.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.314  Debarring official's decision.

    (a) No additional proceedings necessary. In actions based upon a 
conviction or civil judgment, or in which there is no genuine dispute 
over material facts, the debarring official shall make a decision on the 
basis of all the information in the administrative record, including any 
submission made by the respondent. The decision shall be made within 45 
days after receipt of any information and argument submitted by the 
respondent, unless the debarring official extends this period for good 
cause.
    (b) Additional proceedings necessary. (1) In actions in which 
additional proceedings are necessary to determine disputed material 
facts, written findings of fact shall be prepared. The debarring 
official shall base the decision on the facts as found, together with 
any information and argument submitted by the respondent and any other 
information in the administrative record.
    (2) The debarring official may refer disputed material facts to 
another official for findings of fact. The debarring official may reject 
any such findings, in whole or in part, only after specifically 
determining them to be arbitrary and capricious or clearly erroneous.
    (3) The debarring official's decision shall be made after the 
conclusion of the proceedings with respect to disputed facts.
    (c)(1) Standard of proof. In any debarment action, the cause for 
debarment must be established by a preponderance of the evidence. Where 
the proposed debarment is based upon a conviction or civil judgment, the 
standard shall be deemed to have been met.
    (2) Burden of proof. The burden of proof is on the agency proposing 
debarment.
    (d) Notice of debarring official's decision. (1) If the debarring 
official decides to impose debarment, the respondent shall be given 
prompt notice:
    (i) Referring to the notice of proposed debarment;
    (ii) Specifying the reasons for debarment;
    (iii) Stating the period of debarment, including effective dates; 
and
    (iv) Advising that the debarment is effective for covered 
transactions throughout the executive branch of the Federal Government 
unless an agency head or an authorized designee makes the determination 
referred to in Sec. 105-68.215.
    (2) If the debarring official decides not to impose debarment, the 
respondent shall be given prompt notice of that decision. A decision not 
to impose debarment shall be without prejudice to a subsequent 
imposition of debarment by any other agency.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.315  Settlement and voluntary exclusion.

    (a) When in the best interest of the Government, GSA may, at any 
time, settle a debarment or suspension action.
    (b) If a participant and the agency agree to a voluntary exclusion 
of the participant, such voluntary exclusion shall be entered on the 
Nonprocurement List (see subpart 105-68.5).

[53 FR 19198, 19204, May 26, 1988, as amended at 54 FR 4962, Jan. 31, 
1989]


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.320  Period of debarment.

    (a) Debarment shall be for a period commensurate with the 
seriousness of the cause(s). If a suspension precedes a

[[Page 89]]

debarment, the suspension period shall be considered in determining the 
debarment period.
    (1) Debarment for causes other than those related to a violation of 
the requirements of subpart 105-68.6 of this part generally should not 
exceed three years. Where circumstances warrant, a longer period of 
debarment may be imposed.
    (2) In the case of a debarment for a violation of the requirements 
of subpart 105-68.6 of this part (see 105-68.305(c)(5)), the period of 
debarment shall not exceed five years.
    (b) The debarring official may extend an existing debarment for an 
additional period, if that official determines that an extension is 
necessary to protect the public interest. However, a debarment may not 
be extended solely on the basis of the facts and circumstances upon 
which the initial debarment action was based. If debarment for an 
additional period is determined to be necessary, the procedures of 
Secs. 105-68.311 through 105-68.314 shall be followed to extend the 
debarment.
    (c) The respondent may request the debarring official to reverse the 
debarment decision or to reduce the period or scope of debarment. Such a 
request shall be in writing and supported by documentation. The 
debarring official may grant such a request for reasons including, but 
not limited to:
    (1) Newly discovered material evidence;
    (2) Reversal of the conviction or civil judgment upon which the 
debarment was based;
    (3) Bona fide change in ownership or management;
    (4) Elimination of other causes for which the debarment was imposed; 
or
    (5) Other reasons the debarring official deems appropriate.

Jan. 31, 1989; 56 FR 29438, June 27, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.325  Scope of debarment.

    (a) Scope in general. (1) Debarment of a person under these 
regulations constitutes debarment of all its divisions and other 
organizational elements from all covered transactions, unless the 
debarment decision is limited by its terms to one or more specifically 
identified individuals, divisions or other organizational elements or to 
specific types of transactions.
    (2) The debarment action may include any affiliate of the 
participant that is specifically named and given notice of the proposed 
debarment and an opportunity to respond (see Secs. 105-68.311 through 
105-68.314).
    (b) Imputing conduct. For purposes of determining the scope of 
debarment, conduct may be imputed as follows:
    (1) Conduct imputed to participant. The fraudulent, criminal or 
other seriously improper conduct of any officer, director, shareholder, 
partner, employee, or other individual associated with a participant may 
be imputed to the participant when the conduct occurred in connection 
with the individual's performance of duties for or on behalf of the 
participant, or with the participant's knowledge, approval, or 
acquiescence. The participant's acceptance of the benefits derived from 
the conduct shall be evidence of such knowledge, approval, or 
acquiescence.
    (2) Conduct imputed to individuals associated with participant. The 
fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper conduct of a 
participant may be imputed to any officer, director, shareholder, 
partner, employee, or other individual associated with the participant 
who participated in, knew of, or had reason to know of the participant's 
conduct.
    (3) Conduct of one participant imputed to other participants in a 
joint venture. The fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper 
conduct of one participant in a joint venture, grant pursuant to a joint 
application, or similar arrangement may be imputed to other participants 
if the conduct occurred for or on behalf of the joint venture, grant 
pursuant to a joint application, or similar arrangement or with the 
knowledge, approval, or acquiescence of these participants. Acceptance 
of the benefits derived from the conduct shall be evidence of such 
knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.

<R05>
Sec. 105-68.400  General.

    (b) Suspension is a serious action to be imposed only when:
    (1) There exists adequate evidence of one or more of the causes set 
out in Sec. 105-68.405, and
    (2) Immediate action is necessary to protect the public interest.
    (c) In assessing the adequacy of the evidence, the agency should 
consider how much information is available, how credible it is given the 
circumstances, whether or not important allegations are corroborated, 
and what inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result. This assessment 
should include an examination of basic documents such as grants, 
cooperative agreements, loan authorizations, and contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.405  Causes for suspension.

    (a) Suspension may be imposed in accordance with the provisions of 
Secs. 105-68.400 through 105-68.413 upon adequate evidence:

[53 FR 19198, 19204, May 26, 1988, as amended at 56 FR 29438, June 27, 
1991]


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.411  Notice of suspension.

    When a respondent is suspended, notice shall immediately be given:
    (a) That suspension has been imposed;
    (b) That the suspension is based on an indictment, conviction, or 
other adequate evidence that the respondent has committed irregularities 
seriously reflecting on the propriety of further Federal Government 
dealings with the respondent;
    (c) Describing any such irregularities in terms sufficient to put 
the respondent on notice without disclosing the Federal Government's 
evidence;
    (d) Of the cause(s) relied upon under Sec. 105-68.405 for imposing 
suspension;
    (e) That the suspension is for a temporary period pending the 
completion of an investigation or ensuing legal, debarment, or Program

or through a representative, information and argument in opposition to 
the suspension.
    (b) Additional proceedings as to disputed material facts. (1) If the 
suspending official finds that the respondent's submission in opposition 
raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the suspension, 
respondent(s) shall be afforded an opportunity to appear with a 
representative, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and 
confront any witness the agency presents, unless:
    (i) The action is based on an indictment, conviction or civil 
judgment, or
    (ii) A determination is made, on the basis of Department of Justice 
advice, that the substantial interests of the

[[Page 91]]

Federal Government in pending or contemplated legal proceedings based on 
the same facts as the suspension would be prejudiced.
    (2) A transcribed record of any additional proceedings shall be 
prepared and made available at cost to the respondent, upon request, 
unless the respondent and the agency, by mutual agreement, waive the 
requirement for a transcript.


<R05>

    The suspending official may modify or terminate the suspension (for 
example, see Sec. 105-68.320(c) for reasons for reducing the period or 
scope of debarment) or may leave it in force. However, a decision to 
modify or terminate the suspension shall be without prejudice to the 
subsequent imposition of suspension by any other agency or debarment by 
any agency. The decision shall be rendered in accordance with the 
following provisions:
    (a) No additional proceedings necessary. In actions: based on an 
indictment, conviction, or civil judgment; in which there is no genuine 
dispute over material facts; or in which additional proceedings to 
determine disputed material facts have been denied on the basis of 
Department of Justice advice, the suspending official shall make a 
decision on the basis of all the information in the administrative 
record, including any submission made by the respondent. The decision 
shall be made within 45 days after receipt of any information and 
argument submitted by the respondent, unless the suspending official 
extends this period for good cause.
    (b) Additional proceedings necessary. (1) In actions in which 
additional proceedings are necessary to determine disputed material 
facts, written findings of fact shall be prepared. The suspending 
official shall base the decision on the facts as found, together with 
any information and argument submitted by the respondent and any other 
information in the administrative record.
    (2) The suspending official may refer matters involving disputed 
material facts to another official for findings of fact. The suspending 
official may reject any such findings, in whole or in part, only after 
specifically determining them to be arbitrary or capricious or clearly 
erroneous.
    (c) Notice of suspending official's decision. Prompt written notice 
of the suspending official's decision shall be sent to the respondent.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.415  Period of suspension.

    (a) Suspension shall be for a temporary period pending the 
completion of an investigation or ensuing legal, debarment, or Program 
Fraud Civil Remedies Act proceedings, unless terminated sooner by the 
suspending official or as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) If legal or administrative proceedings are not initiated within 
12 months after the date of the suspension notice, the suspension shall 
be terminated unless an Assistant Attorney General or United States 
Attorney requests its extension in writing, in which case it may be 
extended for an additional six months. In no event may a suspension 
extend beyond 18 months, unless such proceedings have been initiated 
within that period.
    (c) The suspending official shall notify the Department of Justice 
of an impending termination of a suspension, at least 30 days before the 
12-month period expires, to give that Department an opportunity to 
request an extension.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.420  Scope of suspension.

    The scope of a suspension is the same as the scope of a debarment 
(see Sec. 105-68.325), except that the procedures of Secs. 105-68.410 
through 105-68.413 shall be used in imposing a suspension.

1988]


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.505  GSA responsibilities.

    (a) The agency shall provide GSA with current information concerning 
debarments, suspension, determinations of ineligibility, and voluntary 
exclusions it has taken. Until February 18, 1989, the agency shall also 
provide GSA and OMB with information concerning all transactions in 
which GSA has granted exceptions under Sec. 105-68.215 permitting 
participation by debarred, suspended, or voluntarily excluded persons.
    (b) Unless an alternative schedule is agreed to by GSA, the agency 
shall advise GSA of the information set forth in Sec. 105-68.500(b) and 
of the exceptions granted under Sec. 105-68.215 within five working days 
after taking such actions.
    (c) The agency shall direct inquiries concerning listed persons to 
the agency that took the action.
    (d) Agency officials shall check the Nonprocurement List before 
entering covered transactions to determine whether a participant in a 
primary transaction is debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily 
excluded (202) 501-0688.
    (e) Agency officials shall check the Nonprocurement List before 
approving principals or lower tier participants where agency approval of 
the principal or lower tier participant is required under the terms of 
the transaction, to determine whether such principals or participants 
are debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded.

1991]


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.510  Participants' responsibilities.

    (a) Certification by participants in primary covered transactions. 
Each participant shall submit the certification in appendix A to this 
part for it and its principals at the time the participant submits its 
proposal in connection with a primary covered transaction, except that 
States need only complete such certification as to their principals. 
Participants may decide the method and frequency by which they determine 
the eligibility of their principals. In addition, each participant may, 
but is not required to, check the Nonprocurement List for its principals 
(202) 501-0688. Adverse information on the certification will not 
necessarily result in denial of participation. However, the 
certification, and any additional information pertaining to the 
certification submitted by the participant, shall be considered in the 
administration of covered transactions.
    (b) Certification by participants in lower tier covered 
transactions. (1) Each participant shall require participants in lower 
tier covered transactions to include the certification in appendix B to 
this part for it and its principals in any proposal submitted in 
connection with such lower tier covered transactions.
    (2) A participant may rely upon the certification of a prospective 
participant in a lower tier covered transaction that it and its 
principals are not debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily 
excluded from the covered transaction by any Federal agency, unless it 
knows that the certification is erroneous. Participants may decide the 
method and frequency by which they determine the eligiblity of their 
principals. In addition, a participant may, but is not required to, 
check the Nonprocurement List for its principals and for participants 
(202) 501-0688.
    (c) Changed circumstances regarding certification. A participant 
shall provide immediate written notice to GSA if at any time the 
participant learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted 
or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. Participants 
in lower tier covered transactions shall provide the same updated

[[Page 93]]

notice to the participant to which it submitted its proposals.

in writing, that--
    (a) The grantee has made a false certification under Sec. 105-
68.630;
    (b) With respect to a grantee other than an individual--

out the requirements of paragraphs (A)(a) through (g) and/or (B) of the 
certification (Alternate I to Appendix C) or
    (2) Such a number of employees of the grantee have been convicted of 
violations of criminal drug statutes for violations occurring in the 
workplace as to indicate that the grantee has failed to make a good 
faith effort to provide a drug-free workplace.
    (c) With respect to a grantee who is an individual--
    (1) The grantee has violated the certification by failing to carry 
out its requirements (Alternate II to Appendix C); or

[[Page 95]]


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.630  Certification requirements and procedures.

    (a)(1) As a prior condition of being awarded a grant, each grantee 
shall make the appropriate certification to the Federal agency providing 
the grant, as provided in appendix C to this part.
    (2) Grantees are not required to make a certification in order to 
continue receiving funds under a grant awarded before March 18, 1989, or 
under a no-cost time extension of such a grant. However, the grantee 
shall make a one-time drug-free workplace certification for a non-
automatic continuation of such a grant made on or after March 18, 1989.
    (b) Except as provided in this section, all grantees shall make the 
required certification for each grant. For mandatory formula grants and 
entitlements that have no application process, grantees shall submit a 
one-time certification in order to continue receiving awards.
    (c) A grantee that is a State may elect to make one certification in 
each Federal fiscal year. States that previously submitted an annual 
certification are not required to make a certification for Fiscal Year 
1990 until June 30, 1990. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, this certification shall cover all grants to all State agencies 
from any Federal agency. The State shall retain the original of this 
statewide certification in its Governor's office and, prior to grant 
award, shall ensure that a copy is submitted individually with respect 
to each grant, unless the Federal agency has designated a central 
location for submission.
    (d)(1) The Governor of a State may exclude certain State agencies 
from the statewide certification and authorize these agencies to submit 
their own certifications to Federal agencies. The statewide 
certification shall name any State agencies so excluded.
    (2) A State agency to which the statewide certification does not 
apply, or a State agency in a State that does not have a statewide 
certification, may elect to make one certification in each Federal 
fiscal year. State agencies that previously submitted a State agency 
certification are not required to make a certification for Fiscal Year 
1990 until June 30, 1990. The State agency shall retain the original of 
this State agency-wide certification in its central office and, prior to 
grant award, shall ensure that a copy is submitted individually with 
respect to each grant, unless the Federal agency designates a central 
location for submission.
    (3) When the work of a grant is done by more than one State agency, 
the certification of the State agency directly receiving the grant shall 
be deemed to certify compliance for all workplaces, including those 
located in other State agencies.
    (e)(1) For a grant of less than 30 days performance duration, 
grantees shall have this policy statement and program in place as soon 
as possible, but in any case by a date prior to the date on which 
performance is expected to be completed.
    (2) For a grant of 30 days or more performance duration, grantees 
shall have this policy statement and program in place within 30 days 
after award.
    (3) Where extraordinary circumstances warrant for a specific grant, 
the grant officer may determine a different date on which the policy 
statement and program shall be in place.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.635  Reporting of and employee sanctions for convictions of criminal drug offenses.

    (a) When a grantee other than an individual is notified that an 
employee has been convicted for a violation of a criminal drug statute 
occurring in the workplace, it shall take the following actions:
    (1) Within 10 calendar days of receiving notice of the conviction, 
the grantee shall provide written notice, including the convicted 
employee's position title, to every grant officer, or other designee on 
whose grant activity the convicted employee was working, unless a 
Federal agency has designated a central point for the receipt of such 
notifications. Notification shall include the identification number(s) 
for each of the Federal agency's affected grants.
    (2) Within 30 calendar days of receiving notice of the conviction, 
the grantee shall do the following with respect to the employee who was 
convicted.

[[Page 96]]

    (i) Take appropriate personnel action against the employee, up to 
and including termination, consistent with requirements of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended; or
    (ii) Require the employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug 
abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for such purposes by 
a Federal, State, or local health, law enforcement, or other appropriate 
agency.
    (b) A grantee who is an individual who is convicted for a violation 
of a criminal drug statute occurring during the conduct of any grant 
activity shall report the conviction, in writing, within 10 calendar 
days, to his or her Federal agency grant officer, or other designee, 
unless the Federal agency has designated a central point for the receipt 
of such notices. Notification shall include the identification number(s) 
for each of the Federal agency's affected grants.

     Suspension, and Other Responsibility Matters--Primary Covered 
                              Transactions

                     Instructions for Certification

    1. By signing and submitting this proposal, the prospective primary 
participant is providing the certification set out below.
    2. The inability of a person to provide the certification required 
below will not necessarily result in denial of participation in this 
covered transaction. The prospective participant shall submit an 
explanation of why it cannot provide the certification set out below. 
The certification or explanation will be considered in connection with 
the department or agency's determination whether to enter into this 
transaction. However, failure of the prospective primary participant to 
furnish a certification or an explanation shall disqualify such person 
from participation in this transaction.
    3. The certification in this clause is a material representation of 
fact upon which reliance was placed when the department or agency 
determined to enter into this transaction. If it is later determined 
that the prospective primary participant knowingly rendered an erroneous 
certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal 
Government, the department or agency may terminate this transaction for 
cause or default.
    4. The prospective primary participant shall provide immediate 
written notice to the department or agency to which this proposal is 
submitted if at any time the prospective primary participant learns that 
its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous 
by reason of changed circumstances.
    5. The terms covered transaction, debarred, suspended, ineligible, 
lower tier covered transaction, participant, person, primary covered 
transaction, principal, proposal, and voluntarily excluded, as used in 
this clause, have the meanings set out in the Definitions and Coverage 
sections of the rules implementing Executive Order 12549. You may 
contact the department or agency to which this proposal is being 
submitted for assistance in obtaining a copy of those regulations.
    6. The prospective primary participant agrees by submitting this 
proposal that, should the proposed covered transaction be entered into, 
it shall not knowingly enter into any lower tier covered transaction 
with a person who is proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 
9.4, debarred, suspended, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded 
from participation in this covered transaction, unless authorized by the 
department or agency entering into this transaction.
    7. The prospective primary participant further agrees by submitting 
this proposal that it will include the clause titled ``Certification 
Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and Voluntary Exclusion-
Lower Tier Covered Transaction,'' provided by the department or agency 
entering into this covered transaction, without modification, in all 
lower tier covered transactions and in all solicitations for lower tier 
covered transactions.
    8. A participant in a covered transaction may rely upon a 
certification of a prospective participant in a lower tier covered 
transaction that it is not proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, 
subpart 9.4, debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded 
from the covered transaction, unless it knows that the certification is 
erroneous. A participant may decide the method and frequency by which it 
determines the eligibility of its principals. Each participant may, but 
is not required to, check the List of Parties Excluded from Federal 
Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs.
    9. Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require 
establishment of a system of records in order to render in good faith 
the certification required by this clause. The knowledge and information 
of a participant is not required to exceed that which is normally 
possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business 
dealings.

[[Page 97]]

    10. Except for transactions authorized under paragraph 6 of these 
instructions, if a participant in a covered transaction knowingly enters 
into a lower tier covered transaction with a person who is proposed for 
debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, suspended, debarred, 
ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in this 
transaction, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal 
Government, the department or agency may terminate this transaction for 
cause or default.

 Appendix C to Part 105-68--Certification Regarding Drug-Free Workplace 
                              Requirements

                     Instructions for Certification

    1. By signing and/or submitting this application or grant agreement, 
the grantee is providing the certification set out below.
    2. The certification set out below is a material representation of 
fact upon which reliance is placed when the agency awards the grant. If 
it is later determined that the grantee knowingly rendered a false 
certification, or otherwise violates the requirements of the Drug-Free 
Workplace Act, the agency, in addition to any other remedies available 
to the Federal Government, may take action authorized under the Drug-
Free Workplace Act.
    3. For grantees other than individuals, Alternate I applies.
    4. For grantees who are individuals, Alternate II applies.
    5. Workplaces under grants, for grantees other than individuals, 
need not be identified on the certification. If known, they may be 
identified in the grant application. If the grantee does not identify 
the workplaces at the time of application, or upon award, if there is no 
application, the grantee must keep the identity of the workplace(s) on 
file in its office and make the information available for Federal 
inspection. Failure to identify all known workplaces constitutes a 
violation of the grantee's drug-free workplace requirements.
    6. Workplace identifications must include the actual address of 
buildings (or parts of buildings) or other sites where work under the 
grant takes place. Categorical descriptions may be used (e.g., all 
vehicles of a mass transit authority or State highway department while 
in operation, State employees in each local unemployment office, 
performers in concert halls or radio studios).
    7. If the workplace identified to the agency changes during the 
performance of the grant, the grantee shall inform the agency of the 
change(s), if it previously identified the workplaces in question (see 
paragraph five).
    8. Definitions of terms in the Nonprocurement Suspension and 
Debarment common rule and Drug-Free Workplace common rule apply to this 
certification. Grantees' attention is called, in particular, to the 
following definitions from these rules:
    Controlled substance means a controlled substance in Schedules I 
through V of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 812) and as 
further defined by regulation (21 CFR 1308.11 through 1308.15);
    Conviction means a finding of guilt (including a plea of nolo 
contendere) or imposition of sentence, or both, by any judicial body 
charged with the responsibility to determine violations of the Federal 
or State criminal drug statutes;
    Criminal drug statute means a Federal or non-Federal criminal 
statute involving the manufacture, distribution, dispensing, use, or 
possession of any controlled substance;
    Employee means the employee of a grantee directly engaged in the 
performance of work under a grant, including: (i) All direct charge 
employees; (ii) All indirect charge employees unless their impact or 
involvement is insignificant to the performance of the grant; and, (iii) 
Temporary personnel and consultants who are directly engaged in the 
performance of work under the grant and who are on the grantee's 
payroll. This definition does not include workers not on the payroll of 
the grantee (e.g., volunteers, even if used to meet a matching 
requirement; consultants or independent contractors not on the grantee's 
payroll; or employees of subrecipients or subcontractors in covered 
workplaces).

performance of the grant be given a copy of the statement required by 
paragraph (a);
    (d) Notifying the employee in the statement required by paragraph 
(a) that, as a condition of employment under the grant, the employee 
will--
    (1) Abide by the terms of the statement; and
    (2) Notify the employer in writing of his or her conviction for a 
violation of a criminal drug statute occurring in the workplace no later 
than five calendar days after such conviction;
    (e) Notifying the agency in writing, within ten calendar days after 
receiving notice under paragraph (d)(2) from an employee or otherwise 
receiving actual notice of such conviction. Employers of convicted 
employees must provide notice, including position title, to every grant

was working, unless the Federal agency has designated a central point 
for the receipt of such notices. Notice shall include the identification 
number(s) of each affected grant;

Check {time}  if there are workplaces on file that are not identified 
here.

              Alternate II. (Grantees Who Are Individuals)

    (a) The grantee certifies that, as a condition of the grant, he or 
she will not engage in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, 
dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance in conducting 
any activity with the grant;
    (b) If convicted of a criminal drug offense resulting from a 
violation occurring during the conduct of any grant activity, he or she 
will report the conviction, in writing, within 10 calendar days of the 
conviction, to every grant officer or other designee, unless the Federal 
agency designates a central point for the receipt of such notices. When

<R04>
                 Subpart B--Activities by Own Employees


<R05>
Sec. 105-69.200  Agency and legislative liaison.

    (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in Sec. 105-
69.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable 
compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or 
receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if 
the payment is for agency and legislative liaison activities not 
directly related to a covered Federal action.
    (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, providing any 
information specifically requested by an agency or Congress is allowable 
at any time.
    (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following 
agency and legislative liaison activities are allowable at any time only 
where they are not related to a specific solicitation for any covered 
Federal action:
    (1) Discussing with an agency (including individual demonstrations) 
the qualities and characteristics of the person's products or services, 
conditions or terms of sale, and service capabilities; and,
    (2) Technical discussions and other activities regarding the 
application or adaptation of the person's products or services for an 
agency's use.
    (d) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following 
agencies and legislative liaison activities are allowable only where 
they are prior to formal solicitation of any covered Federal action:
    (1) Providing any information not specifically requested but 
necessary for an agency to make an informed decision about initiation of 
a covered Federal action;
    (2) Technical discussions regarding the preparation of an 
unsolicited proposal prior to its official submission; and,
    (3) Capability presentations by persons seeking awards from an 
agency pursuant to the provisions of the Small Business Act, as amended 
by Public Law 95-507 and other subsequent amendments.
    (e) Only those activities expressly authorized by this section are

<R05>
Sec. 105-69.205  Professional and technical services.

    (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in Sec. 105-
69.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable 
compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or 
receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or 
an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a 
Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is 
for professional or technical services rendered directly in the 
preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or 
application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative 
agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a 
condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or 
cooperative agreement.
    (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, ``professional 
and technical services'' shall be limited to advice and analysis 
directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, 
drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer 
is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the 
performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered 
directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, 
communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such 
as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed 
accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide 
advice and analysis directly applying their professional or

[[Page 104]]

technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered 
directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a 
covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the 
intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or 
analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her 
client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are 
not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing 
professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent 
to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior 
to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable 
under this section since the engineer is providing technical services 
but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a 
covered Federal action.
    (c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for 
receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or 
regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, 
and any other requirements in the actual award documents.
    (d) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are 
allowable under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 105-69.210  Reporting.

    No reporting is required with respect to payments of reasonable 
compensation made to regularly employed officers or employees of a 
person.


<R04>
            Subpart C--Activities by Other Than Own Employees


<R05>
Sec. 105-69.300  Professional and technical services.

    (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in Sec. 105-
69.100 (a), does not apply in the case of any reasonable payment to a 
person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or 
receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional 
or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, 
or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal 
contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting 
requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving 
that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.
    (b) The reporting requirements in Sec. 105-69.110 (a) and (b) 
regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall 
not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered 
directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any 
commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a 
loan.
    (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, ``professional 
and technical services'' shall be limited to advice and analysis 
directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, 
drafting or a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer 
is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the 
performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered 
directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, 
communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such 
as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed 
accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide 
advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical 
expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and 
solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered 
Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to 
influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis 
directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's 
proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not 
allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing 
professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent 
to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior 
to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable 
under this section since the engineer is providing technical services 
but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a 
covered Federal action.

[[Page 105]]

    (d) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for 
receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or 
regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, 
and any other requirements in the actual award documents.
    (e) Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting 
or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade 
associations.
    (f) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are 
allowable under this section.


<R04>
                  Subpart D--Penalties and Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 105-69.400  Penalties.

    (a) Any person who makes an expenditure prohibited herein shall be 
subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than 
$100,000 for each such expenditure.
    (b) Any person who fails to file or amend the disclosure form (see 
appendix B) to be filed or amended if required herein, shall be subject 
to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 
for each such failure.
    (c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an 
administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced 
does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure 
occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with 
respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in 
writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.
    (d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount 
of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency 
shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the 
violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in 
business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability 
of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such 
other matters as may be appropriate.
    (e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section 
shall be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating 
circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be 
subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as 
determined by the agency head or his or her designee.
    (f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not 
prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply 
to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil 
penalty.


<R05>
Sec. 105-69.405  Penalty procedures.

    Agencies shall impose and collect civil penalties pursuant to the 
provisions of the Program Fraud and Civil Remedies Act, 31 U.S.C. 
sections 3803 (except subsection (c)), 3804, 3805, 3806, 3807, 3808, and 
3812, insofar as these provisions are not inconsistent with the 
requirements herein.


<R05>
Sec. 105-69.410  Enforcement.

    The head of each agency shall take such actions as are necessary to 
ensure that the provisions herein are vigorously implemented and 
enforced in that agency.

<R05>
Sec. 105-69.500  Secretary of Defense.

    (a) The Secretary of Defense may exempt, on a case-by-case basis, a

determines, in writing, that such an exemption is in the national 
interest. The Secretary shall transmit a copy of each such written 
exemption to Congress immediately after making such a determination.
    (b) The Department of Defense may issue supplemental regulations to 
implement paragraph (a) of this section.

official shall submit a report containing the findings and conclusions 
of such investigation to the reviewing official.

    (d) Nothing in this section modifies any responsibility of an

submission.
    (c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the 
reviewing official's authority to join in a single complaint against a 
person claims that are unrelated or were not submitted simultaneously, 
regardless of the amount of money or the value of property or services 
demanded or requested.


<R05>
Sec. 105-70.007   Complaint.

    (c) If the defendant is unable to file an answer meeting the

the defendant may, before the expiration of 30 days from service of the 
complaint, file with the reviewing official a general answer denying 
liability and requesting a hearing, and a request for an extension of 
time within which to file an answer meeting the requirements of 
paragraph (b) of this section. The reviewing official shall file

that an initial decision will be issued under this section.

true, and, if such facts establish liability under Sec. 105-70.003, the 
ALJ shall issue an initial decision imposing the maximum amount of 
penalties and assessments allowed under the statute.
    (d) Except as otherwise provided in this section, by failing to file 
a timely answer, the defendant waives any right to further review of the 
penalties and assessments imposed under paragraph (c) of this section, 
and the initial decision shall become final and binding upon the parties 
30 days after it is issued.

[[Page 116]]

    (e) If, before such an initial decision becomes final, the defendant 
files a motion with the ALJ seeking to reopen on the grounds that 
extraordinary circumstances prevented the defendant from filing an 
answer, the initial decision shall be stayed pending the ALJ's decision 
on the motion.
    (f) If, on such motion, the defendant can demonstrate extraordinary 
circumstances excusing the failure to file a timely answer, the ALJ 
shall withdraw the initial decision in paragraph (c) of this section, if 
such a decision has been issued, and shall grant the defendant an 
opportunity to answer the complaint.
    (g) A decision of the ALJ denying a defendant's motion under 
paragraph (e) of this section is not subject to reconsideration under 
Sec. 105-70.038.
    (h) The defendant may appeal to the Authority Head the decision 
denying a motion to reopen by filing a notice of appeal with the 
Authority Head within 15 days after the ALJ denies the motion. The 
timely filing of a notice of appeal shall stay the initial decision 
until the Authority Head decides the issue.
    (i) If the defendant files a timely notice of appeal with the 
Authority Head, the ALJ shall forward the record of the proceeding to 
the Authority Head.
    (j) The Authority Head shall decide expeditiously whether 
extraordinary circumstances excuse the defendant's failure to file a 
timely answer based solely on the record before the ALJ.
    (k) If the Authority Head decides that extraordinary circumstances 
excused the defendant's failure to file a timely answer, the Authority 
Head shall remand the case to the ALJ with instructions to grant the 
defendant an opportunity to answer.
    (l) If the Authority Head decides that the defendant's failure to 
file a timely answer is not excused, the Authority Head shall reinstate 
the initial decision of the ALJ, which shall become final and binding 
upon the parties 30 days after the Authority Head issues such decision.


<R05>

<R05>
Sec. 105-71.102  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    Accrued expenditures mean the charges incurred by the grantee during 
a given period requiring the provision of funds for: (1) Goods and other 
tangible property received; (2) services performed by employees, 
contractors, subgrantees, subcontractors, and other payees; and (3) 
other amounts becoming owed under programs for which no current services 
or performance is required, such as annuities, insurance claims, and 
other benefit payments.
    Accrued income means the sum of: (1) Earnings during a given period 
from services performed by the grantee and goods and other tangible 
property delivered to purchasers, and (2) amounts becoming owed to the 
grantee for which no current services or performance is required by the 
grantee.

[[Page 127]]

    Acquisition cost of an item of purchased equipment means the net 
invoice unit price of the property including the cost of modifications, 
attachments, accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessary to make the 
property usable for the purpose for which it was acquired. Other charges 
such as the cost of installation, transportation, taxes, duty or 
protective in-transit insurance, shall be included or excluded from the 
unit acquisition cost in accordance with the grantee's regular 
accounting practices.
    Administrative requirements mean those matters common to grants in 
general, such as financial management, kinds and frequency of reports, 
and retention of records. These are distinguished from programmatic 
requirements, which concern matters that can be treated only on a 
program-by-program or grant-by-grant basis, such as kinds of activities 
that can be supported by grants under a particular program.
    Awarding agency means (1) with respect to a grant, the Federal 
agency, and (2) with respect to a subgrant, the party that awarded the 
subgrant.
    Cash contributions means the grantee's cash outlay, including the 
outlay of money contributed to the grantee or subgrantee by other public 
agencies and institutions, and private organizations and individuals. 
When authorized by Federal legislation, Federal funds received from 
other assistance agreements may be considered as grantee or subgrantee 
cash constributions.
    Contract means (except as used in the definitions for grant and 
subgrant in this section and except where qualified by Federal) a 
procurement contract under a grant or subgrant, and means a procurement 
subcontract under a contract.
    Cost sharing or matching means the value of the third party in-kind 
contributions and the portion of the costs of a federally assisted 
project or program not borne by the Federal Government.
    Cost-type contract means a contract or subcontract under a grant in 
which the contractor or subcontractor is paid on the basis of the costs 
it incurs, with or without a fee.
    Equipment means tangible, nonexpendable, personal property having a 
useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or 
more per unit. A grantee may use its own definition of equipment 
provided that such definition would at least include all equipment 
defined above.
    Expenditure report means: (1) For non-construction grants, the SF-
269 ``Financial Status Report'' (or other equivalent report); (2) for 
construction grants, the SF-271 ``Outlay Report and Request for 
Reimbursement'' (or other equivalent report).
    Federally recognized Indian tribal government means the governing 
body or a governmental agency of any Indian tribe, band, nation, or 
other organized group or community (including any Native village as 
defined in section 3 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, 85 
Stat. 688) certified by the Secretary of the Interior as eligible for 
the special programs and services provided by him through the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs.
    Government means a State or local government or a federally 
recognized Indian tribal government.
    Grant means an award of financial assistance, including cooperative 
agreements, in the form of money, or property in lieu of money, by the 
Federal Government to an eligible grantee. The term does not include 
technical assistance which provides services instead of money, or other 
assistance in the form of revenue sharing, loans, loan guarantees, 
interest subsidies, insurance, or direct appropriations. Also, the term 
does not include assistance, such as a fellowship or other lump sum 
award, which the grantee is not required to account for.
    Grantee means the government to which a grant is awarded and which 
is accountable for the use of the funds provided. The grantee is the 
entire legal entity even if only a particular component of the entity is 
designated in the grant award document.
    Local government means a county, municipality, city, town, township, 
local public authority (including any public and Indian housing agency 
under the United States Housing Act of 1937) school district, special 
district,

[[Page 128]]

intrastate district, council of governments (whether or not incorporated 
as a nonprofit corporation under State law), any other regional or 
interstate government entity, or any agency or instrumentality of a 
local government.
    Obligations means the amounts of orders placed, contracts and 
subgrants awarded, goods and services received, and similar transactions 
during a given period that will require payment by the grantee during 
the same or a future period.
    OMB means the United States Office of Management and Budget.
    Outlays (expenditures) mean charges made to the project or program. 
They may be reported on a cash or accrual basis. For reports prepared on 
a cash basis, outlays are the sum of actual cash disbursement for direct 
charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect expense incurred, 
the value of in-kind contributions applied, and the amount of cash 
advances and payments made to contractors and subgrantees. For reports 
prepared on an accrued expenditure basis, outlays are the sum of actual 
cash disbursements, the amount of indirect expense incurred, the value 
of in-kind contributions applied, and the new increase (or decrease) in 
the amounts owed by the grantee for goods and other property received, 
for services performed by employees, contractors, subgrantees, 
subcontractors, and other payees, and other amounts becoming owed under 
programs for which no current services or performance are required, such 
as annuities, insurance claims, and other benefit payments.
    Percentage of completion method refers to a system under which 
payments are made for construction work according to the percentage of 
completion of work, rather than to the grantee's cost incurred.
    Prior approval means documentation evidencing consent prior to 
incurring specific cost.
    Real property means land, including land improvements, structures 
and appurtenances thereto, excluding movable machinery and equipment.
    Share, when referring to the awarding agency's portion of real 
property, equipment or supplies, means the same percentage as the 
awarding agency's portion of the acquiring party's total costs under the 
grant to which the acquisition costs under the grant to which the 
acquisition cost of the property was charged. Only costs are to be 
counted--not the value of the third-party in-kind contributions.
    State means any of the several States of the United States, the 
District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or 
possession of the United States, or any agency or instrumentality of a 
State exclusive of local governments. The term does not include any 
public and Indian housing under United States Housing Act of 1937.
    Subgrant means an award of financial assistance in the form of 
money, or property in lieu of money, made under a grant by a grantee to 
an eligible subgrantee. The term includes financial assistance when 
provided by contractual legal agreement, but does not include 
procurement purchases, nor does it include any form of assistance which 
is excluded from the definition of grant in this part.
    Subgrantee means the government or other legal entity to which a 
subgrant is awarded and which is accountable to the grantee for the use 
of the funds provided.
    Supplies means all tangible personal property other than equipment 
as defined in this part.
    Suspension means depending on the context, either (1) temporary 
withdrawal of the authority to obligate grant funds pending corrective 
action by the grantee or subgrantee or a decision to terminate the 
grant, or (2) an action taken by a suspending official in accordance 
with agency regulations implementing E.O. 12549 to immediately exclude a 
person from participating in grant transactions for a period, pending 
completion of an investigation and such legal or debarment proceedings 
as may ensue.
    Termination means permanent withdrawal of the authority to obligate 
previously-awarded grant funds before that authority would otherwise 
expire. It also means the voluntary relinquishment of that authority by 
the grantee or subgrantee.
    Termination does not include: (1) Withdrawal of funds awarded on the 
basis of the grantee's underestimate of

[[Page 129]]

the unobligated balance in a prior period; (2) Withdrawal of the 
unobligated balance as of the expiration of a grant; (3) Refusal to 
extend a grant or award additional funds, to make a competing or 
noncompeting continuation, renewal, extension, or supplemental award; or 
(4) voiding of a grant upon determination that the award was obtained 
fraudulently, or was otherwise illegal or invalid from inception.
    Terms of a grant or subgrant mean all requirements of the grant or 
subgrant whether in statute, regulations, or the award document.
    Third party in-kind contributions mean property or services which 
benefit a federally assisted project or program and which are 
contributed by non-Federal third parties without charge to the grantee, 
or a cost-type contractor under the grant agreement.
    Unliquidated obligations for reports prepared on a cash basis mean 
the amount of obligations incurred by the grantee that has not been 
paid. For reports prepared on an accrued expenditure basis, they 
represent the amount of obligations incurred by the grantee for which an 
outlay has not been recorded.
    Unobligated balance means the portion of the funds authorized by the 
Federal agency that has not been obligated by the grantee and is 
determined by deducting the cumulative obligations from the cumulative 
funds authorized.

higher education operated by a government) in applying for grants. This 
section is not applicable, however, to formula grant programs which do 
not require applicants to apply for funds on a project basis.
    (2) This section applies only to applications to Federal agencies 
for grants, and is not required to be applied by grantees in dealing 
with applicants for subgrants. However, grantees are encouraged to avoid 
more detailed or burdensome application requirements for subgrants.
    (b) Authorized forms and instructions for governmental 
organizations. (1) In applying for grants, applicants shall only use 
standard application forms or those prescribed by the granting agency

and evaluate the work under a grant. Other supplementary instructions 
may be issued only with the approval of OMB to the extent required under

applicant to disregard any line item that is not needed.
    (4) When a grantee applies for additional funding (such as a 
continuation or supplemental award) or amends a previously submitted 
application, only the affected pages need be submitted.

[[Page 131]]

Previously submitted pages with information that is still current need 
not be resubmitted.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.111  State plans.

    (a) Scope. The statutes for some programs require States to submit 
plans before receiving grants. Under regulations implementing Executive

contains additional provisions for plans that are subject to regulations 
implementing the Executive order.
    (b) Requirements. A State need meet only Federal administrative or 
programmatic requirements for a plan that are in statutes or codified 
regulations.
    (c) Assurances. In each plan the State will include an assurance 
that the State shall comply with all applicable Federal statutes and 
regulations in effect with respect to the periods for which it receives 
grant funding. For this assurance and other assurances required in the 
plan, the State may:
    (1) Cite by number the statutory or regulatory provisions requiring 
the assurances and affirm that it gives the assurances required by those 
provisions,
    (2) Repeat the assurance language in the statutes or regulations, or
    (3) Develop its own language to the extent permitted by law.
    (d) Amendments. A State will amend a plan whenever necessary to 
reflect:
    (1) New or revised Federal statutes or regulations or
    (2) A material change in any State law, organization, policy, or 
State agency operation.

The State will obtain approval for the amendment and its effective date 
but need submit for approval only the amended portions of the plan.

awarding agency determines that a grantee or subgrantee:
    (1) Has a history of unsatisfactory performance, or
    (2) Is not financially stable, or
    (3) Has a management system which does not meet the management 
standards set forth in this part, or
    (4) Has not conformed to terms and conditions of previous awards, or
    (5) Is otherwise not responsible, and if the awarding agency 
determines that an award will be made, special conditions and/or 
restrictions shall correspond to the high risk condition and shall be 
included in the award.
    (b) Special conditions or restrictions may include:
    (1) Payment on a reimbursement basis;
    (2) Withholding authority to proceed to the next phase until receipt

    (c) If an awarding agency decides to impose such conditions, the 
awarding official will notify the grantee or subgrantee as early as 
possible, in writing, of:
    (1) The nature of the special conditions/restrictions;
    (2) The reason(s) for imposing them;
    (3) The corrective actions which must be taken before they will be

    (a) A State must expand and account for grant funds in accordance 
with State laws and procedures for expending and accounting for its own 
funds. Fiscal control and accounting procedures of the State, as well as 
its subgrantees and cost-type contractors, must be sufficient to--

[[Page 132]]

    (1) Permit preparation of reports required by this part and the 
statutes authorizing the grant, and
    (2) Permit the tracing of funds to a level of expenditures adequate 
to establish that such funds have not been used in violation of the 
restrictions and prohibitions of applicable statutes.
    (b) The financial management systems of other grantees and 
subgrantees must meet the following standards:
    (1) Financial reporting. Accurate, current, and complete disclosure 
of the financial result of financially assisted activities must be made 
in accordance with the financial reporting requirements of the grant or 
subgrant.
    (2) Accounting records. Grantees and subgrantees must maintain 
records which adequately identify the source and application of funds 
provided for financially-assisted activities. These records must contain 
information pertaining to grant or subgrant awards and authorizations, 
obligations, unobligated balances, assets, liabilities, outlays or 
expenditures, and income.
    (3) Internal control. Effective control and accountability must be 
maintained for all grant and subgrant cash, real and personal property, 
and other assets. Grantees and subgrantees must adequately safeguard all 
such property and must assure that it is used solely for authorized 
purposes.
    (4) Budget control. Actual expenditures or outlays must be compared 
with budgeted amounts for each grant or subgrant. Financial information 
must be related to performance or productivity data, including the 
development of unit cost information whenever appropriate or 
specifically required in the grant or subgrant agreement. If unit cost 
data are required, estimates based on available documentation will be 
accepted whenever possible.
    (5) Allowable cost. Applicable OMB cost principles, agency program 
regulations, and the terms of grant and subgrant agreements will be 
followed in determining the reasonableness, allowability and 
allocability of costs.
    (6) Source documentation. Accounting records must be supported by 
such source documentation as cancelled checks, paid bills, payrolls, 
time and attendance records, contract and subgrant award documents, etc.
    (7) Cash management. Procedures for minimizing the time elapsing 
between the transfer of funds from the U.S. Treasury and disbursement by 
grantees and subgrantees must be followed whenever advance payment 
procedures are used. Grantees must establish reasonable procedures to 
ensure the receipt of reports on subgrantees' cash balances and cash 
disbursements in sufficient time to enable them to prepare complete and 
accurate cash transactions reports to the awarding agency. When advances 
are made by letter-of-credit or electronic transfer of funds methods, 
the grantee must make drawdowns as close as possible to the time of 
making disbursements. Grantees must monitor cash drawdowns by their 
subgrantees to assure that they conform substantially to the same 
standards of timing and amount as apply to advances to the grantees.
    (c) An awarding agency may review the adequacy of the financial 
management system of any applicant for financial assistance as part of a 
preaward review or at any time subsequent to award.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.121   Payment.

    (a) Scope. This section prescribes the basic standard and the 
methods under which a Federal agency will make payments to grantees, and 
grantees will make payments to subgrantees and contractors.
    (b) Basic standard. Methods and procedures for payment shall 
minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and 
disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee, in accordance with Treasury 
regulations at 31 CFR part 205.
    (c) Advances. Grantees and subgrantees shall be paid in advance, 
provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness and ability to 
maintain procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer 
of the funds and their disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee.
    (d) Reimbursement. Reimbursement shall be the preferred method when 
the requirements in paragraph (c) of this

[[Page 133]]

section are not met. Grantees and subgrantees may also be paid by 
reimbursement for any construction grant. Except as otherwise specified 
in regulation, Federal agencies shall not use the percentage of 
completion method to pay construction grants. The grantee or subgrantee 
may use that method to pay its construction contractor, and if it does, 
awarding agency's payments to the grantee or subgrantee will be based on 
the grantee's or subgrantee's actual rate of disbursement.
    (e) Working capital advances. If a grantee cannot meet the criteria 
for advance payments described in paragraph (c) of this section, and the 
Federal agency has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because 
the grantee lacks sufficient working capital the awarding agency may 
provide cash or a working capital, advance basis. Under this procedure 
the awarding agency shall advance cash to the grantee to cover its 
estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to 
the grantee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the awarding agency shall 
reimburse the grantee for its actual cash disbursements. The working 
capital advance method of payment shall not be used by grantees or 
subgrantees if the reason for using such method is the unwillingness or 
inability of the grantee to provide timely advances to the subgrantee to 
meet the subgrantee's actual cash disbursements.
    (f) Effect of program income, refunds and audit recoveries on 
payment. (1) Grantees and subgrantees shall disburse repayments to and 
interest earned on a revolving fund before requesting additional cash 
payments for the same activity.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, grantees 
and subgrantees shall disburse program income, rebates, refunds, 
contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned on such funds 
before requesting additional cash payments.
    (g) Withholding payments. (1) Unless otherwise required by Federal 
statute, awarding agencies shall not withhold payments for proper 
charges incurred by grantees or subgrantees unless--
    (i) The grantee or subgrantee has failed to comply with grant award 
conditions or
    (ii) The grantee or subgrantee is indebted to the United States.
    (2) Cash withheld for failure to comply with grant award conditions, 
but without suspension of the grant, shall be released to the grantee 
upon subsequent compliance. When a grant is suspended, payment 
adjustments will be made in accordance with Sec. 105-71.143(c).
    (3) A Federal agency shall not make payment to grantees for amounts 
that are withheld by grantees or subgrantees from payment to contractors 
to assure satisfactory completion of work. Payments shall be made by the 
Federal agency when the grantees or subgrantees actually disburse the 
withheld funds to the contractors or to escrow accounts established to 
assure satisfactory completion of work.
    (h) Cash depositories. (1) Consistent with the national goal of 
expanding the opportunities for minority business enterprises, grantees 
and subgrantees are encouraged to use minority banks (a bank which is 
owned at least 50 percent by minority group members). A list of minority 
owned banks can be obtained from the Minority Business Development 
Agency, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230.
    (2) A grantee or subgrantee shall maintain a separate bank account 
only when required by Federal-State agreement.
    (i) Interest earned on advances. Except for interest earned on 
advances of funds exempt under the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (31 
U.S.C. 6501 et seq.) and the Indian Self-Determination Act (23 U.S.C. 
450), grantees and subgrantees shall promptly, but at least quarterly, 
remit interest earned on advances to the Federal agency. The grantee or 
subgrantee may keep interest amounts up to $100 per year for 
administrative expenses.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.122  Allowable costs.

    (a) Limitation on use of funds. Grant funds may be used only for:
    (1) The allowable costs of the grantees, subgrantees and cost-type 
contractors, including allowable costs in the form of payments to fixed-
price contractors; and

[[Page 134]]

    (2) Reasonable fees or profit to cost-type contractors but not any 
fee or profit (or other increment above allowable costs) to the grantee 
or subgrantee.
    (b) Applicable cost principles. For each kind of organization, there 
is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. 
Allowable costs will be determined in accordance with the cost 
principles applicable to the organization incurring the costs. The 
following chart lists the kinds of organizations and the applicable cost 
principles:

<R05>
Sec. 105-71.123  Period of availability of funds.

    (a) General. Where a funding period is specified, a grantee may 
charge to the award only costs resulting from obligations of the funding 
period unless carryover or unobligated balances are permitted, in which 
case the carryover balances may be charged for costs resulting from 
obligations of the subsequent funding period.
    (b) Liquidation of obligations. A grantee must liquidate all 
obligations incurred under the award not later than 90 days after the 
end of the funding period (or as specified in a program regulation) to 
coincide with the submission of the annual Financial Status Report (SF-
269). The Federal agency may extend this deadline at the request of the 
grantee.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.124  Matching or cost sharing.

    (a) Basic rule: Costs and contributions acceptable. With the 
qualifications and exceptions listed in paragraph (b) of this section, a 
matching or cost sharing requirement may be satisfied by either or both 
of the following:
    (1) Allowable costs incurred by the grantee, subgrantee or cost-type 
contractor under the assistance agreement. This includes allowable costs 
borne by non-Federal grants or by other cash donations from non-Federal 
third parties.
    (2) The value of third party in-kind contributions applicable to the 
period to which the cost sharing or matching requirements apply.
    (b) Qualifications and exceptions--(1) Costs borne by other Federal 
grant agreements. Except as provided by Federal statute, a cost sharing 
or matching requirement may not be met by costs borne by another Federal 
grant. This prohibition does not apply to income earned by a grantee or 
subgrantee from a contract awarded under another Federal grant.
    (2) General revenue sharing. For the purpose of this section, 
general revenue sharing funds distributed under 31 U.S.C. 6702 are not 
considered Federal grant funds.
    (3) Cost or contributions counted towards other Federal costs-
sharing requirements. Neither costs nor the values of third party in-
kind contributions may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or 
matching requirement of a grant agreement if they have been or will be 
counted towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement of 
another Federal grant agreement, a Federal procurement contract or any 
other award of Federal funds.
    (4) Costs financed by program income. Costs financed by program 
income, as defined in Sec. 105-71.125, shall not count towards 
satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement unless they are 
expressly permitted in the terms of the assistance agreement. (This use 
of general program income is described in Sec. 105-71.125(g).)
    (5) Services or property financed by income earned by contractors. 
Contractors under a grant may earn income from the activities carried 
out under the contract in addition to the amounts earned from the party 
awarding the contract. No costs of services or property supported by 
this income may count toward satisfying a cost sharing

[[Page 135]]

or matching requirement unless other provisions of the grant agreement 
expressly permit this kind of income to be used to meet the requirement.
    (6) Records. Costs and third party in-kind contributions counting 
towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement must be 
verifiable from the records of grantees and subgrantee or cost-type 
contractors. These records must show how the value placed on third party 
in-kind contributions was derived. To the extent feasible, volunteer 
services will be supported by the same methods that the organization 
uses to support the allocability of regular personnel costs.
    (7) Special standards for third party in-kind contributions. (i) 
Third party in-kind contributions count towards satisfying a cost 
sharing or matching requirement only where, if the party receiving the 
contributions were to pay for them, the payments would be allowable 
costs.
    (ii) Some third party in-kind contributions are goods and services 
that, if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor receiving the 
contribution had to pay for them, the payments would have been an 
indirect cost. Costs sharing or matching credit for such contributions 
shall be given only if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor has 
established, along with its regular indirect cost rate, a special rate 
for allocating to individual projects or programs the value of 
contributions.
    (iii) A third party in-kind contribution to a fixed price contract 
may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement only 
if it results in:
    (A) An increase in the services or property provided under the 
contract (without additional cost to the grantee or subgrantee) or
    (B) A cost savings to the grantee or subgrantee.
    (iv) The values placed on third party in-kind contributions for cost 
sharing or matching purposes will conform to the rules in the succeeding 
sections of this part. If a third party in-kind contribution is a type 
not treated in those sections, the value placed upon it shall be fair 
and reasonable.
    (c) Valuation of donated services--(1) Volunteer services. Unpaid 
services provided to a grantee or subgrantee by individuals will be 
valued at rates consistent with those ordinarily paid for similar work 
in the grantee's or subgrantee's organization. If the grantee or 
subgrantee does not have employees performing similar work, the rates 
will be consistent with those ordinarily paid by other employers for 
similar work in the same labor market. In either case, a reasonable 
amount for fringe benefits may be included in the valuation.
    (2) Employees of other organizations. When an employer other than a 
grantee, subgrantee, or cost-type contractor furnishes free of charge 
the services of an employee in the employee's normal line of work, the 
services will be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay exclusive 
of the employee's fringe benefits and overhead costs. If the services 
are in a different line of work, paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
applies.
    (d) Valuation of third party donated supplies and loaned equipment 
or space. (1) If a third party donates supplies, the contribution will 
be valued at the market value of the supplies at the time of donation.
    (2) If a third party donates the use of equipment or space in a 
building but retains title, the contribution will be valued at the fair 
rental rate of the equipment or space.
    (e) Valuation of third party donated equipment, buildings, and land. 
If a third party donates equipment, buildings, or land, and the title 
passes to a grantee or subgrantee, the treatment of the donated property 
will depend upon the purpose of the grant or subgrant as follows:
    (1) Awards for capital expenditures. If the purpose of the grant or 
subgrant is to assist the grantee or subgrantee in the acquisition of 
property, the market value of that property at the time of donation may 
be counted as cost sharing or matching.
    (2) Other awards. If assisting in the acquisition of property is not 
the purpose of the grant or subgrant, paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (ii) of 
this section apply.
    (i) If approval is obtained from the awarding agency, the market 
value at the time of donation of the donated equipment or buildings and 
the fair

[[Page 136]]

rental rate of the donated land may be counted as cost sharing or 
matching. In the case of a subgrant, the terms of the grant agreement 
may require that the approval be obtained from the Federal agency as 
well as the grantee. In all cases, the approval may be given only if a 
purchase of the equipment or rental of the land would be approved as an 
allowable direct cost. If any part of the donated property was acquired 
with Federal funds, only the non-Federal share of the property may be 
counted as cost sharing or matching.
    (ii) If approval is not obtained under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this 
section, no amount may be counted for donated land, and only 
depreciation or use allowances may be counted for donated equipment and 
buildings. The depreciation or use allowances for this property are not 
treated as third party in-kind contributions. Instead, they are treated 
as costs incurred by the grantee or subgrantee. They are computed and 
allocated (usually as indirect costs) in accordance with the cost 
principles specified in Sec. 105-71.122, in the same way as depreciation 
or use allowances for purchased equipment and buildings. The amount of 
depreciation or use allowances for donated equipment and buildings is 
based on the property's market value at the time it was donated.
    (f) Valuation of grantee or subgrantee donated real property for 
construction/acquisition. If a grantee or subgrantee donates real 
property for a construction or facilities acquisition project, the 
current market value of that property may be counted as cost sharing or 
matching. If any part of the donated property was acquired with Federal 
funds, only the non-Federal share of the property may be counted as cost 
sharing or matching.
    (g) Appraisal of real property. In some cases under paragraphs (d), 
(e) and (f) of this section, it will be necessary to establish the 
market value of land or a building or the fair rental rate of land or of 
space in the building. In these cases, the Federal agency may require 
the market value or fair rental value be set by an independent 
appraiser, and that the value or rate be certified by the grantee. This 
requirement will also be imposed by the grantee on subgrantees.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.125  Program income.

    (a) General. Grantees are encouraged to earn income to defray 
program costs. Program income includes income from fees for services 
performed, from the use or rental of real or personal property acquired 
with grant funds, from the sale of commodities or items fabricated under 
a grant agreement, and from payments of principal and interest on loans 
made with grant funds. Except as otherwise provided in regulations of 
the Federal agency, program income does not include interest on grant 
funds, rebates, credits, discounts, refunds, etc. and interest earned on 
any of them.
    (b) Definition of program income. Program income means gross income 
received by the grantee or subgrantee directly generated by a grant 
supported activity, or earned only as a result of the grant agreement 
during the grant period. ``During the grant period'' is the time between 
the effective date of the award and the ending date of the award 
reflected in the final financial report.
    (c) Cost of generating program income. If authorized by Federal 
regulations or the grant agreement, costs incident to the generation of 
program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program 
income.
    (d) Government revenues. Taxes, special assessments, levies, fines, 
and other such revenues raised by a grantee or subgrantee are not 
program income unless the revenues are specifically identified in the 
grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as program income.
    (e) Royalties. Income from royalties and license fees for 
copyrighted material, patents, and inventions developed by a grantee or 
subgrantee is program income only if the revenues are specifically 
identified in the grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as 
program income. (See Sec. 105-71.134.)
    (f) Property. Proceeds from the sale of real property or equipment 
will be handled in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 105-71.131 
and Sec. 105-71.132.
    (g) Use of program income. Program income shall be deducted from 
outlays

[[Page 137]]

which may be both Federal and non-Federal as described below, unless the 
Federal agency regulations or the grant agreement specify another 
alternative (or a combination of the alternatives). In specifying 
alternatives, the Federal agency may distinguish between income earned 
by the grantee and income earned by subgrantees and between the sources, 
kinds, or amounts of income. When Federal agencies authorize the 
alternatives in paragraphs (g) (2) and (3) of this section, program 
income in excess of any limits stipulated shall also be deducted from 
outlays.
    (1) Deduction. Ordinarily program income shall be deducted from 
total allowable costs to determine the net allowable costs. Program 
income shall be used for current costs unless the Federal agency 
authorizes otherwise. Program income which the grantee did not 
anticipate at the time of the award shall be used to reduce the Federal 
agency and grantee contributions rather than to increase the funds 
committed to the project.
    (2) Addition. When authorized, program income may be added to the 
funds committed to the grant agreement by the Federal agency and the 
grantee. The program income shall be used for the purposes and under the 
conditions of the grant agreement.
    (3) Cost sharing or matching. When authorized, program income may be 
used to meet the cost sharing or matching requirement of the grant 
agreement. The amount of the Federal grant award remains the same.
    (h) Income after the award period. There are no Federal requirements 
governing the disposition of program income earned after the end of the 
award period (i.e., until the ending date of the final financial report, 
see paragraph (a) of this section), unless the terms of the agreement or 
the Federal agency regulations provide otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.126  Non-Federal audit.

    (a) Basic rule. Grantees and subgrantees are responsible for 
obtaining audits in accordance with the Single Audit Act of 1984 (31 
U.S.C. 7501-7) and Federal agency implementing regulations. The audits 
shall be made by an independent auditor in accordance with generally 
accepted government auditing standards covering financial and compliance 
audits.
    (b) Subgrantees. State or local governments, as those terms are 
defined for purposes of the Single Audit Act, that receive Federal 
financial assistance and provide $25,000 or more of it in a fiscal year 
to a subgrantee shall:
    (1) Determine whether State or local subgrantees have met the audit 
requirements of the Act and whether subgrantees covered by OMB Circular 
A-110, ``Uniform Requirements for Grants and Other Agreements with 
Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals and Other Nonprofit 
Organizations'' have met the audit requirement. Commercial contractors 
(private for profit and private and governmental organizations) 
providing goods and services to State and local governments are not 
required to have a single audit performed. State and local governments 
should use their own procedures to ensure that the contractor has 
complied with laws and regulations affecting the expenditure of Federal 
funds;
    (2) Determine whether the subgrantee spent Federal assistance funds 
provided in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. This may be 
accomplished by reviewing an audit of the subgrantee made in accordance 
with the Act, Circular A-110, or through other means (e.g., program 
reviews) if the subgrantee has not had such an audit;
    (3) Ensure the appropriate corrective action is taken within six 
months after receipt of the audit report in instance of noncompliance 
with Federal laws and regulations;
    (4) Consider whether subgrantee audits necessitate adjustment of the 
grantee's own records; and
    (5) Require each subgrantee to permit independent auditors to have 
access to the records and financial statements.
    (c) Auditor selection. In arranging for audit services, Sec. 105-
71.136 shall be followed.

   Subpart 105-71.13--Post-Award Requirements/Changes, Property, and 
                                Subawards


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.130  Changes.

    (a) General. Grantees and subgrantees are permitted to rebudget 
within the approved direct cost budget to meet unanticipated 
requirements and may make limited program changes to the approved 
project. However, unless waived by the awarding agency, certain types of 
post-award changes in budgets and projects shall require the prior 
written approval of the awarding agency.
    (b) Relation to cost principles. The applicable cost principles (see 
Sec. 105-71.122) contain requirements for prior approval of certain 
types of costs. Except where waived, those requirements apply to all 
grants and subgrants even if paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section 
do not.
    (c) Budget changes-- (1) Non-construction projects. Except as stated 
in other regulations or an award document, grantees or subgrantees shall 
obtain the prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the 
following changes is anticipated under a non-construction award:
    (i) Any revision which would result in the need for additional 
funding.
    (ii) Unless waived by the awarding agency, cumulative transfers 
among direct cost categories, or, if applicable, among separately 
budgeted programs, projects, functions, or activities which exceed or 
are expected to exceed ten percent of the current total approved budget, 
whenever the awarding agency's share exceeds $100,000.
    (iii) Transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (i.e., from 
direct payments to trainees to other expense categories).
    (2) Construction projects. Grantees and subgrantees shall obtain 
prior written approval for any budget revision which would result in the 
need for additional funds.
    (3) Combined construction and non-construction projects. When a 
grant or subgrant provides funding for both construction and non-
construction activities, the grantee or subgrantee must obtain prior 
written approval from the awarding agency before making any fund or 
budget transfer from non-construction to construction or vice versa.
    (d) Programmatic changes. Grantees or subgrantees must obtain the 
prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the following 
actions is anticipated:
    (1) Any revision of the scope or objectives of the project 
(regardless of whether there is an associated budget revision requiring 
prior approval).
    (2) Need to extend the period of availability of funds.
    (3) Changes in key persons in cases where specified in an 
application or a grant award. In research projects, a change in the 
project director or principal investigator shall always require approval 
unless waived by the awarding agency.
    (4) Under non-construction projects, contracting out, subgranting 
(if authorized by law) or otherwise obtaining the services of a third 
party to perform activities which are central to the purposes of the 
award. This approval requirement is in addition to the approval 
requirements of Sec. 105-71.136 but does not apply to the procurement of 
equipment, supplies, and general support services.
    (e) Additional prior approval requirements. The awarding agency may 
not require prior approval for any budget revision which is not 
described in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (f) Requesting prior approval. (1) A request for prior approval of 
any budget revision will be in the same budget format the grantee used 
in its application and shall be accomplished by a narrative 
justification for the proposed revision.
    (2) A request for a prior approval under the applicable Federal cost 
principles (see Sec. 105-71.122) may be made by letter.
    (3) A request by a subgrantee for prior approval will be addressed 
in writing to the grantee. The grantee will promptly review such request 
and shall approve or disapprove the request in writing. A grantee will 
not approve any budget or project revision which is inconsistent with 
the purpose or terms and conditions of the Federal grant to the grantee. 
If the revision, requested by the subgrantee would result in a change to 
the grantee's approved

[[Page 139]]

project which requires Federal prior approval, the grantee will obtain 
the Federal agency's approval before approving the subgrantee's request.

    (a) Title. Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in 
this section, title to real property acquired under a grant or subgrant 
will vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) Use. Except as otherwise provided by Federal statutes, real 
property will be used for the originally authorized purposes as long as 
needed for that purpose, and the grantee or subgrantee shall not dispose 
of or encumber its title or other interests.
    (c) Disposition. When real property is no longer needed for the 
originally authorized purpose, the grantee or subgrantee will request 
disposition instructions from the awarding agency. The instructions will 
provide for one of the following alternatives.
    (1) Retention of title. Retain title after compensating the awarding 
agency. The amount paid to the awarding agency will be computed by 
applying the awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost 
of the original purchase to the fair market value of the property. 
However, in those situations where a grantee or subgrantee is disposing 
of real property acquired with grant funds and acquiring replacement 
real property under the same program, the net proceeds from the 
disposition may be used as an offset to the cost of the replacement 
property.
    (2) Sale of property. Sell the property and compensate the awarding 
agency. The amount due to the awarding agency will be calculated by 
applying the awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost 
of the original purchase to the proceeds of the sale after deduction of 
any actual and reasonable selling and fixing-up expenses. If the grant 
is still active, the net proceeds from the sale may be offset against 
the original cost of the property. When a grantee or subgrantee is 
directed to sell property, sales procedures shall be followed that 
provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the 
highest possible return.
    (3) Transfer of title. Transfer title to the awarding agency or to a 
third-party designated/approved by the awarding agency. The grantee or 
subgrantee shall be paid an amount calculated by applying the grantee or 
subgrantee's percentage of participation in the purchase of the real 
property to the current fair market value of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.132  Equipment.

    (a) Title. Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in 
this section, title to equipment acquired under a grant or subgrant will 
vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) States. A State will use, manage, and dispose of equipment 
acquired under a grant by the State in accordance with State laws and 
procedures. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow paragraphs (c) 
through (e) of this section.
    (c) Use. (1) Equipment shall be used by the grantee or subgrantee in 
the program or project for which it was acquired as long as needed, 
whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by 
Federal funds. When no longer needed for the original program or 
project, the equipment may be used in other activities currently or 
previously supported by a Federal agency.
    (2) The grantee or subgrantee shall also make equipment available 
for use on other projects or programs currently or previously supported 
by the Federal Government, providing such use will not interfere with 
the work on the projects or program for which it was originally 
acquired. First preference for other use shall be given to other 
programs or projects supported by the awarding agency. User fees should 
be considered if appropriate.
    (3) Notwithstanding the encouragement in Sec. 105-71.125(a) to earn 
program income, the grantee or subgrantee must not use equipment 
acquired with grant funds to provide services for a fee to compete 
unfairly with private companies that provide equivalent services, unless 
specifically permitted or contemplated by Federal statute.
    (4) When acquiring replacement equipment, the grantee or subgrantee

[[Page 140]]

may use the equipment to be replaced as a trade-in or sell the property 
and use the proceeds to offset the cost of the replacement property, 
subject to the approval of the awarding agency.
    (d) Management requirements. Procedures for managing equipment 
(including replacement equipment), whether acquired in whole or in part 
with grant funds, until disposition takes place will, as a minimum, meet 
the following requirements:
    (1) Property records must be maintained that include a description 
of the property, a serial number or other identification number, the 
source of property, who holds the title, the acquisition date, and cost 
of the property, percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the 
property, the location, use and condition of the property, and any 
ultimate disposition data including the data of disposal and sale price 
of the property.
    (2) A physical inventory of the property must be taken and the 
results reconciled with the property records at least once every two 
years.
    (3) A control system must be developed to ensure adequate safeguards 
to prevent loss, damage or theft of the property. Any loss, damage or 
theft shall be investigated.
    (4) Adequate maintenance procedures must be developed to keep the 
property in good condition.
    (5) If the grantee or subgrantee is authorized or required to sell 
the property, proper sales procedures must be established to ensure the 
highest possible return.
    (e) Disposition. When original or replacement equipment acquired 
under a grant or subgrant is no longer needed for the original project 
or program or for other activities currently or previously supported by 
a Federal agency, disposition of the equipment will be made as follows:
    (1) Items of equipment with a current per-unit fair market value of 
less than $5,000 may be retained, sold or otherwise disposed of with no 
further obligation to the awarding agency.
    (2) Items of equipment with a current per unit fair market value in 
excess of $5,000 may be retained or sold and the awarding agency shall 
have a right to an amount calculated by multiplying the current market 
value or proceeds from sale by the awarding agency's share of the 
equipment.
    (3) In cases where a grantee or subgrantee fails to take appropriate 
disposition actions, the awarding agency may direct the grantee or 
subgrantee to take excess and disposition actions.
    (f) Federal equipment. In the event grantee or subgrantee is 
provided federally-owned equipment:
    (1) Title will remain vested in the Federal Government.
    (2) Grantees or subgrantees will manage the equipment in accordance 
with Federal agency rules and procedures, and submit an annual inventory 
listing.
    (3) When the equipment is no longer needed, the grantee or 
subgrantee will request disposition instructions from the Federal 
agency.
    (g) Right to transfer title. The Federal awarding agency may reserve 
the right to transfer title to the Federal Government or a third party 
named by the awarding agency when such a third party is otherwise 
eligible under existing statutes. Such transfers shall be subject to the 
following standards:
    (1) The property shall be identified in the grant or otherwise made 
known to the grantee in writing.
    (2) The Federal awarding agency shall issue disposition instruction 
within 120 calendar days after the end of the Federal support of the 
project for which it was acquired. If the Federal awarding agency fails 
to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar-day period the 
grantee shall follow Sec. 105-71.132(e).
    (3) When title to equipment is transferred, the grantee shall be 
paid an amount calculated by applying the percentage of participation in 
the purchase to the current fair market value of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.133  Supplies.

    (a) Title. Title to supplies acquired under a grant or subgrant will 
vest, upon acquisition, in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) Disposition. If there is a residual inventory of unused supplies 
exceeding $5,000 in total aggregate fair market value upon termination 
or completion of the award, and if the supplies are

[[Page 141]]

not needed for any other federally sponsored programs or projects, the 
grantee or subgrantee shall compensate the awarding agency for its 
share.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.134  Copyrights.

    The Federal awarding agency reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive, 
and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish or otherwise use, and to 
authorize others to use, for Federal Government purposes:
    (a) The copyright in any work developed under a grant, subgrant, or 
contract under a grant or subgrant; and
    (b) Any rights of copyright to which a grantee, subgrantee or a 
contractor purchases ownership with grant support.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.135  Subawards to debarred and suspended parties.

    Grantees and subgrantees must not make any award or permit any award 
(subgrant or contract) at any tier to any party which is debarred or 
suspended or is otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation 
in Federal assistance programs under Executive Order 12549, ``Debarment 
and Suspension''.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.136  Procurement.

    (a) States. When procuring property and services under a grant, a 
State will allow the same policies and procedures it uses for 
procurements from its non-Federal funds. The State will ensure that 
every purchase order or other contract includes any clauses required by 
Federal statutes and executive orders and their implementing 
regulations. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow paragraphs (b) 
through (i) in this section.
    (b) Procurement standards. (1) Grantees and subgrantees will use 
their own procurement procedures which reflect applicable State and 
local laws and regulations, provided that the procurements conform to 
applicable Federal law and the standards identified in this section.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a contract administration 
system which ensures that contractors perform in accordance with the 
terms, conditions and specifications of their contracts or purchase 
orders.
    (3) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a written code of 
standards of conduct governing the performance of their employees 
engaged in the award and administration of contracts. No employee, 
officer or agent of the grantee or subgrantee shall participate in 
selection, or in the award or administration of a contract supported by 
Federal funds if a conflict of interest, real or apparent, would be 
involved. Such a conflict would arise when:
    (i) The employee, officer or agent,
    (ii) Any member of his immediate family,
    (iii) His or her partner, or
    (iv) An organization which employs, or is about to employ, any of 
the above, has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for 
award. The grantee's or subgrantee's officers, employees or agent will 
neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors or anything of monetary 
value from contractors, potential contractors, or parties to 
subagreements. Grantees and subgrantees may set minimum rules where the 
financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item 
of nominal intrinsic value. To the extent permitted by State or local 
law or regulations, such standards of conduct will provide for 
penalties, sanctions, or other disciplinary actions for violations of 
such standards by the grantee's officers, employees, or agents, or by 
contractors or their agents. The awarding agency may in regulation 
provide additional prohibitions relative to real, apparent, or potential 
conflicts of interest.
    (4) Grantee and subgrantee procedures will provide for a review of 
proposed procurements to avoid purchase of unnecessary or duplicative 
items. Consideration should be given to consolidating or breaking out 
procurements to obtain a more economical purchase. Where appropriate, an 
analysis will be made of lease versus purchase alternatives, and any 
other appropriate analysis to determine the most economical approach.
    (5) To foster greater economy and efficiency, grantees and 
subgrantees are encouraged to enter into State and local 
intergovernmental agreements

[[Page 142]]

for procurement or use of common goods and services.
    (6) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use Federal excess 
and surplus property in lieu of purchasing new equipment and property 
whenever such use is feasible and reduces project costs.
    (7) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use value engineering 
clauses in contracts for construction projects of sufficient size to 
offer reasonable opportunities for cost reductions. Value engineering is 
a systematic and creative analysis of each contract item or task to 
ensure that its essential function is provided at the overall lower 
cost.
    (8) Grantees and subgrantees will make awards only to responsible 
contractors possessing the ability to perform successfully under the 
terms and conditions of a proposed procurement. Consideration will be 
given to such matters as contractor integrity, compliance with public 
policy, record of past performance, and financial and technical 
resources.
    (9) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain records sufficient to 
detail the significant history of a procurement. These records will 
include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: Rationale for 
the method of procurement, selection of contract type, contractor 
selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price.
    (10) Grantees and subgrantees will use time and material type 
contracts only--
    (i) After a determination that no other contract is suitable, and
    (ii) If the contract includes a ceiling price that the contractor 
exceeds at its own risk.
    (11) Grantees and subgrantees alone will be responsible, in 
accordance with good administrative practice and sound business 
judgment, for the settlement of all contractual and administrative 
issues arising out of procurements. These issues include, but are not 
limited to source evaluation, protests, disputes and claims. These 
standards do not relieve the grantee or subgrantee of any contractual 
responsibilities under its contracts. Federal agencies will not 
substitute their judgment for that of the grantee or subgrantee unless 
the matter is primarily a Federal concern. Violations of law will be 
referred to the local, State or Federal authority having proper 
jurisdiction.
    (12) Grantees and subgrantees will have protest procedures to handle 
and resolve disputes relating to their procurements and shall in all 
instances disclose information regarding the protests to the awarding 
agency. A protestor must exhaust all administrative remedies with the 
grantee and subgrantee before pursuing a protest with the Federal 
agency. Reviews of protests by the Federal agency will be limited to:
    (i) Violations of Federal law or regulations and the standards of 
this section (violations of State or local law will be under the 
jurisdiction of State or local authorities) and
    (ii) Violations of grantee's or subgrantee's protest procedures for 
failure to review a complaint or protest. Protests received by the 
Federal agency other than those specified above will be referred to the 
grantee or subgrantee.
    (c) Competition. (1) All procurement transactions will be conducted 
in a manner providing full and open competition consistent with the 
standards of Sec. 105-71.136. Some of the situations considered to be 
restrictive of competition include but are not limited to:
    (i) Placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to 
qualify to do business,
    (ii) Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive bonding,
    (iii) Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between 
affiliated companies,
    (iv) Noncompetitive awards to consultants that are on retainer 
contracts,
    (v) Organizational conflicts of interest,
    (vi) Specifying only a ``brand name'' product instead of allowing 
``an equal'' product to be offered and describing the performance of 
other relevant requirements of the procurement, and
    (vii) Any arbitrary action in the procurement process.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will conduct procurements in a manner 
that prohibits the use of statutorily or administratively imposed in-
State or local geographical preferences in the evaluation of bids or 
proposals, except

[[Page 143]]

in those cases where applicable Federal statutes expressly mandate or 
encourage geographic preference. Nothing in this section preempts State 
licensing laws. When contracting for architectural and engineering (A/E) 
services, geographic location may be a selection criteria provided its 
application leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the 
nature and size of the project, to compete for the contract.
    (3) Grantees will have written selection procedures for procurement 
transactions. These procedures will ensure that all solicitations:
    (i) Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical 
requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured. Such 
description shall not, in competitive procurements, contain features 
which unduly restrict competition. The description may include a 
statement of the qualitative nature of the material, product or service 
to be procured, and when necessary, shall set forth those minimum 
essential characteristics and standards to which it must conform if it 
is to satisfy its intended use. Detailed product specifications should 
be avoided if at all possible. When it is impractical or uneconomical to 
make a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements, a 
``brand name or equal'' description may be used as a means to define the 
performance or other salient requirements of a procurement. The specific 
features of the named brand which must be met by offerors shall be 
clearly stated; and
    (ii) Identify all requirements which the offerors must fulfill and 
all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.
    (4) Grantees and subgrantees will ensure that all prequalified lists 
of persons, firms, or products which are used in acquiring goods and 
services are current and include enough qualified sources to ensure 
maximum open and free competition. Also, grantees and subgrantees will 
not preclude potential bidders from qualifying during the solicitation 
period.
    (d) Methods of procurement to be followed--(1) Procurement by small 
purchase procedures. Small purchase procedures are those relatively 
simple and informal procurement methods for securing services, supplies, 
or other property that do not cost more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) (currently set at $100,000). If 
small purchase procedures are used, price or rate quotations shall be 
obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources.
    (2) Procurement by sealed bids (formal advertising). Bids are 
publicly solicited and a firm-fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit 
price) is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with 
all the material terms and conditions of the invitation for bids, is the 
lowest in price. The sealed bid method is the preferred method for 
procuring construction, if the conditions in Sec. 105-71.136(d)(2)(i) 
apply.
    (i) In order for sealed bidding to be feasible, the following 
conditions should be present:
    (A) A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase 
description is available;
    (B) Two or more responsible bidders are willing and able to compete 
effectively and for the business; and
    (C) The procurement lends itself to a firm fixed price contract and 
the selection of the successful bidder can be made principally on the 
basis of price.
    (ii) If sealed bids are used, the following requirements apply:
    (A) The invitation for bids will be publicly advertised and bids 
shall be solicited from an adequate number of known suppliers, providing 
them sufficient time prior to the date set for opening the bids;
    (B) The invitation for bids, which will include any specifications 
and pertinent attachments, shall define the items or services in order 
for the bidder to properly respond;
    (C) All bids will be publicly opened at the time and place 
prescribed in the invitation for bids;
    (D) A firm fixed-price contract award will be made in writing to the 
lowest responsive and responsible bidder. Where specified in bidding 
documents, factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and life 
cycle costs shall be considered in determining which bid is lowest. 
Payment discounts will only be used to determine the low bid when prior 
experience indicates that such

[[Page 144]]

discounts are usually taken advantage of; and
    (E) Any or all bids may be rejected if there is a sound documented 
reason.
    (3) Procurement by competitive proposals. The technique of 
competitive proposals is normally conducted with more than one source 
submitting an offer, and either a fixed-price or cost-reimbursement type 
contract is awarded. It is generally used when conditions are not 
appropriate for the use of sealed bids. If this method is used, the 
following requirements apply:
    (i) Requests for proposals will be publicized and identify all 
evaluation factors and their relative importance. Any response to 
publicized requests for proposals shall be honored to the maximum extent 
practical;
    (ii) Proposals will be solicited from an adequate number of 
qualified sources;
    (iii) Grantees and subgrantees will have a method for conducting 
technical evaluations of the proposals received and for selecting 
awardees;
    (iv) Awards will be made to the responsible firm whose proposal is 
most advantageous to the program, with price and other factors 
considered; and
    (v) Grantees and subgrantees may use competitive proposal procedures 
for qualifications-based procurement of architectural/engineering (A/E) 
professional services whereby competitors' qualifications are evaluated 
and the most qualified competitor is selected, subject to negotiation of 
fair and reasonable compensation. The method, where price is not used as 
a selection factor, can only be used in procurement of A/E professional 
services. It cannot be used to purchase other types of services though 
A/E firms are a potential source to perform the proposed effort.
    (4) Procurement by noncompetitive proposals is procurement through 
solicitation of a proposal from only one source, or after solicitation 
of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate.
    (i) Procurement by noncompetitive proposals may be used only when 
the award of a contract is infeasible under small purchase procedures, 
sealed bids or competitive proposals and one of the following 
circumstances applies:
    (A) The item is available only from a single source;
    (B) The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not 
permit a delay resulting from competitive solicitation;
    (C) The awarding agency authorizes noncompetitive proposals; or
    (D) After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is 
determined inadequate.
    (ii) Cost analysis, i.e., verifying the proposed cost data, the 
projections of the data, and the evaluation of the specific elements of 
costs and profits, is required.
    (iii) Grantees and subgrantees may be required to submit the 
proposed procurement to the awarding agency for pre-award review in 
accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
    (e) Contracting with small and minority firms, women's business 
enterprise and labor surplus area firms. (1) The grantee and subgrantee 
will take all necessary affirmative steps to assure that minority firms, 
women's business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms are used when 
possible.
    (2) Affirmative steps shall include:
    (i) Placing qualified small and minority businesses and women's 
business enterprises on solicitation lists;
    (ii) Assuring that small and minority businesses, and women's 
business enterprises are solicited whenever they are potential sources;
    (iii) Dividing total requirements, when economically feasible, into 
smaller tasks or quantities to permit maximum participation by small and 
minority business, and women's business enterprises;
    (iv) Establishing delivery schedules, where the requirement permits, 
which encourage participation by small and minority business, and 
women's business enterprises;
    (v) Using the services and assistance of the Small Business 
Administration, and the Minority Business Development Agency of the 
Department of Commerce; and
    (vi) Requiring the prime contractor, if subcontracts are to be let, 
to take the affirmative steps listed in paragraphs (e)(2) (i) through 
(v) of this section.

[[Page 145]]

    (f) Contract cost and price. (1) Grantees and subgrantees must 
perform a cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement 
action including contract modifications. The method and degree of 
analysis is dependent on the facts surrounding the particular 
procurement situation, but as a starting point, grantees must make 
independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals. A cost 
analysis must be performed when the offeror is required to submit the 
elements of his estimated cost, e.g., under professional, consulting, 
and architectural engineering services contracts. A cost analysis will 
be necessary when adequate price competition is lacking, and for sole 
source procurements, including contract modifications or change orders, 
unless price reasonableness can be established on the basis of a catalog 
or market price of a commercial product sold in substantial quantities 
to the general public or based on prices set by law or regulation. A 
price analysis will be used in all other instances to determine the 
reasonableness of the proposed contract price.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will negotiate profit as a separate 
element of the price for each contract in which there is no price 
competition and in all cases where cost analysis is performed. To 
establish a fair and reasonable profit, consideration will be given to 
the complexity of the work to be performed, the risk borne by the 
contractor, the contractor's investment, the amount of subcontracting, 
the quality of its record of past performance, and industry profit rates 
in the surrounding geographical area for similar work.
    (3) Costs or prices based on estimated costs for contracts under 
grants will be allowable only to the extent that costs incurred or cost 
estimates included in negotiated prices are consistent with Federal cost 
principles (see Sec. 105-71.122). Grantees may reference their own cost 
principles that comply with the applicable Federal cost principles.
    (4) The cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of 
construction cost methods of contracting shall not be used.
    (g) Awarding agency review. (1) Grantees and subgrantees must make 
available, upon request of the awarding agency, technical specifications 
on proposed procurements where the awarding agency believes such review 
is needed to ensure that the item and/or service specified is the one 
being proposed for purchase. This review generally will take place prior 
to the time the specification is incorporated into a solicitation 
document. However, if the grantee or subgrantee desires to have the 
review accomplished after a solicitation has been developed, the 
awarding agency may still review the specifications, with such review 
usually limited to the technical aspects of the proposed purchase.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees must on request make available for 
awarding agency pre-award review procurement documents, such as requests 
for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc. 
when:
    (i) A grantee's or subgrantee's procurement procedures or operation 
fails to comply with the procurement standards in this section; or
    (ii) The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified 
acquisition threshold and is to be awarded without competition or only 
one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation; or
    (iii) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the simplified 
acquisition threshold, specifies a ``brand name'' product; or
    (iv) The proposed award is more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold and is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder 
under a sealed bid procurement; or
    (v) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract 
or increases the contract amount by more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold.
    (3) A grantee or subgrantee will be exempt from the pre-award review 
in paragraph (g)(2) of this section if the awarding agency determines 
that its procurement systems comply with the standards of this section.
    (i) A grantee or subgrantee may request that its procurement system 
be reviewed by the awarding agency to determine whether its system meets 
these standards in order for its system

[[Page 146]]

to be certified. Generally, these reviews shall occur where there is a 
continuous high-dollar funding, and third-party contracts are awarded on 
a regular basis.
    (ii) A grantee or subgrantee may self-certify its procurement 
system. Such self-certification shall not limit the awarding agency's 
right to survey the system. Under a self-certification procedure, 
awarding agencies may wish to rely on written assurances from the 
grantee or subgrantee that it is complying with these standards. A 
grantee or subgrantee will cite specific procedures, regulations, 
standards, etc., as being in compliance with these requirements and have 
its system available for review.
    (h) Bonding requirements. For construction or facility improvement 
contracts or subcontracts exceeding the simplified acquisition 
threshold, the awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and 
requirements of the grantee or subgrantee provided the awarding agency 
has made a determination that the awarding agency's interest is 
adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the 
minimum requirements shall be as follows:
    (1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of 
the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist of a firm commitment 
such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument 
accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder will, upon acceptance of 
his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within 
the time specified.
    (2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent 
of the contract price. A ``performance bond'' is one executed in 
connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's 
obligations under such contract.
    (3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of 
the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed in connection 
with a contract to assure payment as required by law of all persons 
supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for 
in the contract.
    (i) Contract provisions. A grantee's and subgrantee's contracts must 
contain provisions in paragraph (i) of this section. Federal agencies 
are permitted to require changes, remedies, changed conditions, access 
and records retention, suspension of work, and other clauses approved by 
the Office of Federal Procurement Policy.
    (1) Administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances 
where contractors violate or breach contract terms, and provide for such 
sanctions and penalties as may be appropriate. (Contracts more than the 
simplified acquisition threshold)
    (2) Termination for cause and for convenience by the grantee or 
subgrantee including the manner by which it will be effected and the 
basis for settlement. (All contracts in excess of $10,000)
    (3) Compliance with Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, 
entitled ``Equal Employment Opportunity,'' as amended by Executive Order 
11375 of October 13, 1967, and as supplemented in Department of Labor 
regulations (41 CFR chapter 60). (All construction contracts awarded in 
excess of $10,000 by grantees and their contractors or subgrantees)
    (4) Compliance with the Copeland ``Anti-Kickback'' Act (18 U.S.C. 
874) as supplemented in Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 3). 
(All contracts and subgrants for construction or repair)

Sec. 105-71.137  Subgrants.

    (a) States. States shall follow State law and procedures when 
awarding and administering subgrants (whether on a cost reimbursement or 
fixed amount basis) of financial assistance to local and Indian tribal 
governments. States shall:
    (1) Ensure that every subgrant includes any clauses required by 
Federal statute and executive orders and their implementing regulations;
    (2) Ensure that subgrantees are aware of requirements imposed upon 
them by Federal statute and regulation;
    (3) Ensure that a provision for compliance with Sec. 105-71.142 is 
placed in every cost reimbursement subgrant; and
    (4) Conform any advances of grant funds to subgrantees substantially 
to the same standards of timing and amount that apply to cash advances 
by Federal agencies.
    (b) All other grantees. All other grantees shall follow the 
provisions of this part which are applicable to awarding agencies when 
awarding and administering subgrants (whether on a cost reimbursement or 
fixed amount basis) of financial assistance to local and Indian tribal 
governments. Grantees shall:
    (1) Ensure that every subgrant includes a provision for compliance 
with this part;
    (2) Ensure that every subgrant includes any clauses required by 
Federal statute and executive orders and their implementing regulations; 
and
    (3) Ensure that subgrantees are aware of requirements imposed upon 
them by Federal statutes and regulations.
    (c) Exceptions. By their own terms, certain provisions of this part

    (1) Section 105-71.110;
    (2) Section 105-71.111;
    (3) The letter-of-credit procedures specified in Treasury

                             and Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.140  Monitoring and reporting program performance.

    (a) Monitoring by grantees. Grantees are responsible for managing 
the day-to-day operations of grant and subgrant supported activities. 
Grantees must monitor grant and subgrant supported activities to assure 
compliance with applicable Federal requirements and that performance 
goals are being achieved. Grantee monitoring must cover each program, 
function or activity.
    (b) Non-construction performance reports. The Federal agency may, if 
it decides that performance information

[[Page 148]]

available from subsequent applications contains sufficient information 
to meet its programmatic needs, require the grantee to submit a 
performance report only upon expiration or termination of grant support. 
Unless waived by the Federal agency this report will be due on the same 
date as the final Financial Status Report.
    (1) Grantees shall submit annual performance reports unless the 
awarding agency requires quarterly or semiannual reports. However, 
performance reports will not be required more frequently than quarterly. 
Annual reports shall be due 90 days after the grant year, quarterly or 
semiannual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. The 
final performance report will be due 90 days after the expiration or 
termination of grant support. If a justified request is submitted by a 
grantee, the Federal agency may extend the due date for any performance 
report. Additionally, requirements for unnecessary performance reports 
may be waived by the Federal agency.
    (2) Performance reports will contain, for each grant, brief 
information on the following:
    (i) A comparison of actual accomplishments to the objectives 
established for the period. Where the output of the project can be 
quantified, a computation of the cost per unit of output may be required 
if that information will be useful.
    (ii) The reasons for slippage if established objectives were not 
met.
    (iii) Additional pertinent information including, when appropriate, 
analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.
    (3) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original 
and two copies of performance reports.
    (4) Grantees will adhere to the standards in this section in 
prescribing performance reporting requirements for subgrantees.
    (c) Construction performance reports. For the most part, on-site 
technical inspections and certified percentage-of-completion data are 
relied on heavily by Federal agencies to monitor progress under 
construction grants and subgrants. The Federal agency will require 
additional formal performance reports only when considered necessary, 
and never more frequently than quarterly.
    (d) Significant developments. Events may occur between the scheduled 
performance reporting dates which have significant impact upon the grant 
or subgrant supported activity. In such cases, the grantee must inform 
the Federal agency as soon as the following types of conditions become 
known:
    (1) Problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will materially 
impair the ability to meet the objective of the award. This disclosure 
must include a statement of the action taken, or contemplated, and any 
assistance needed to resolve the situation.
    (2) Favorable developments which enable meeting time schedules and 
objectives sooner or at less cost than anticipated or producing more 
beneficial results than originally planned.
    (e) Federal agencies may make site visits as warranted by program 
needs.
    (f) Waivers, extensions. (1) Federal agencies may waive any 
performance report required by this part if not needed.
    (2) The grantee may waive any performance report from a subgrantee 
when not needed. The grantee may exend the due date for any performance 
report from a subgrantee if the grantee will still be able to meet its 
performance reporting obligations to the Federal agency.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.141  Financial reporting.

    (a) General. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a) (2) and (5) of 
this section, grantees will use only the forms specified in paragraphs 
(a) through (e) of this section, and such supplementary or other forms 
as may from time to time be authorized by OMB, for:
    (i) Submitting financial reports to Federal agencies, or
    (ii) Requesting advances or reimbursements when letters of credit 
are not used.
    (2) Grantees need not apply the forms prescribed in this section in 
dealing with their subgrantees. However, grantees shall not impose more 
burdensome requirements on subgrantees.
    (3) Grantees shall follow all applicable standard and supplemental 
Federal agency instructions approved by OMB

[[Page 149]]

to the extent required under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 for use 
in connection with forms specified in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this 
section. Federal agencies may issue substantive supplementary 
instructions only with the approval of OMB. Federal agencies may shade 
out or instruct the grantee to disregard any line item that the Federal 
agency finds unnecessary for its decision making purposes.
    (4) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original 
and two copies of forms required under this part.
    (5) Federal agencies may provide computer outputs to grantees to 
expedite or contribute to the accuracy of reporting. Federal agencies 
may accept the required information from grantees in machine usable 
format or computer printouts instead of prescribed forms.
    (6) Federal agencies may waive any report required by this section 
if not needed.
    (7) Federal agencies may extend the due date on any financial report 
upon receiving a justified request from a grantee.
    (b) Financial Status Report--(1) Form. Grantees will use Standard 
Form 269 or 269A, Financial Status Report, to report the status of funds 
for all non-construction grants and for construction grants when 
required in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (2) Accounting basis. Each grantee will report program outlays and 
program income on a cash or accrual basis as prescribed by the awarding 
agency. If the Federal agency requires accrual information and the 
grantee's accounting records are not normally kept on the accrual basis, 
the grantee shall not be required to convert its accounting system but 
shall develop such accrual information through an analysis of the 
documentation on hand.
    (3) Frequency. The Federal agency may prescribe the frequency of the 
report for each project or program. However, the report will not be 
required more frequently than quarterly. If the Federal agency does not 
specify the frequency of the report, it will be submitted annually. A 
final report will be required upon expiration or termination of grant 
support.
    (4) Due date. When reports are required on a quarterly or semiannual 
basis, they will be due 30 days after the reporting period. When 
required on an annual basis, they will be due 90 days after the grant 
year. Final reports will be due 90 days after the expiration or 
termination of grant support.
    (c) Federal Cash Transactions Report--(1) Form. (i) For grants paid 
by letter of credit, Treasury check advances or electronic transfer of 
funds, the grantee will submit the Standard Form 272, Federal Cash 
Transactions Report, and when necessary, its continuation sheet, 
Standard Form 272A, unless the terms of the award exempt the grantee 
from this requirement.
    (ii) These reports will be used by the Federal agency to monitor 
cash advanced to grantees and to obtain disbursement or outlay 
information for each grant from grantees. The format of the report may 
be adapted as appropriated when reporting is to be accomplished with the 
assistance of automatic data processing equipment provided that the 
information to be submitted is not changed in substance.
    (2) Forecasts of Federal cash requirements. Forecasts of Federal 
cash requirements may be required in the ``Remarks'' section of the 
report.
    (3) Cash in hands of subgrantees. When considered necessary and 
feasible by the Federal agency, grantees may be required to report the 
amount of cash advances in excess of three days' needs in the hands of 
their subgrantees or contractors and to provide short narrative 
explanations of actions taken by the grantee to reduce the excess 
balances.
    (4) Frequency and due date. Grantees must submit the report no later 
than 15 working days following the end of each quarter. However, where 
an advance either by letter of credit or electronic transfer of funds is 
authorized at an annualized rate of one million dollars or more, the 
Federal agency may require the report to be submitted within 15 working 
days following the end of each month.
    (d) Request for advance or reimbursement--(1) Advance payments. 
Requests for Treasury check advance payments will be submitted on 
Standard Form

[[Page 150]]

270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. (This form will not be used 
for drawdowns under a letter of credit, electronic funds transfer or 
when Treasury check advance payments are made to the grantee 
automatically on a predetermined basis.)
    (2) Reimbursements. Requests for reimbursement under non-
construction grants will also be submitted on Standard Form 270. (For 
reimbursement requests under construction grants, see paragraph (e)(1) 
of this section.)
    (3) The frequency for submitting payment requests is treated in 
Sec. 105-71.141(b)(3).
    (e) Outlay report and request for reimbursement for construction 
programs. (1) Grants that support construction activities paid by 
reimbursement method.
    (i) Requests for reimbursement under construction grants will be 
submitted on Standard Form 271, Outlay Report and Request for 
Reimbursement for Construction Programs. Federal agencies may, however, 
prescribe the Request for Advance or Reimbursement form, specified in 
Sec. 105-71.141(d), instead of this form.
    (ii) The frequency for submitting reimbursement requests is treated 
in Sec. 105-71.141(b)(3).
    (2) Grants that support construction activities paid by letter of 
credit, electronic funds transfer or Treasury check advance.
    (i) When a construction grant is paid by letter of credit, 
electronic funds transfer or Treasury check advances, the grantee will 
report its outlays to the Federal agency using Standard Form 271, Outlay 
Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. The 
Federal agency will provide any necessary special instruction. However, 
frequency and due date shall be governed by Sec. 105-71.141(b) (3) and 
(4).
    (ii) When a construction grant is paid by Treasury check advances 
based on periodic requests from the grantee, the advances will be 
requested on the form specified in Sec. 105-71.141(d).
    (iii) The Federal agency may substitute the Financial Status Report 
specified in Sec. 105-71.141(b) for the Outlay Report and Request for 
Reimbursement for Construction Programs.
    (3) Accounting basis. The accounting basis for the Outlay Report and 
Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs shall be governed by 
Sec. 105-71.141(b)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.142  Retention and access requirements for records.

    (a) Applicability. (1) This section applies to all financial and 
programmatic records, supporting documents, statistical records, and 
other records of grantees of subgrantees or subgrantees which are:
    (i) Required to be maintained by the terms of this part, program 
regulations or the grant agreement, or
    (ii) Otherwise reasonably considered as pertinent to program 
regulations or the grant agreement.
    (2) This section does not apply to records maintained by contractors 
or subcontractors. For a requirement to place a provision concerning 
records in certain kinds of contracts, see Sec. 105-71.136(i)(10).
    (b) Length of retention period. (1) Except as otherwise provided, 
records must be retained for three years from the starting date 
specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or other action 
involving the records has been started before the expiration of the 3-
year period, the records must be retained until completion of the action 
and resolution of all issues which arise from it, or until the end of 
the regular 3-year period, whichever is later.
    (3) To avoid duplicate recordkeeping, awarding agencies may make 
special arrangements with grantees and subgrantees to retain any records 
which are continuously needed for joint use. The awarding agency will 
request transfer of records to its custody when it determines that the 
records possess long-term retention value. When the records are 
transferred to or maintained by the Federal agency, the 3-year retention 
requirement is not applicable to the grantee or subgrantee.
    (c) Starting date of retention period--(1) General. When grant 
support is continued or renewed at annual or other intervals, the 
retention period for the records of each funding period starts on

[[Page 151]]

the day the grantee or subgrantee submits to the awarding agency its 
single or last expenditure report for that period. However, if grant 
support is continued or renewed quarterly, the retention period for each 
year's records starts on the day the grantee submits its expenditure 
report for the last quarter of the Federal fiscal year. In all other 
cases, the retention period starts on the day the grantee submits its 
final expenditure report. If an expenditure report has been waived, the 
retention period starts on the day the report would have been due.
    (2) Real property and equipment records. The retention period for 
real property and equipment records starts from the date of the 
disposition or replacement or transfer at the direction of the awarding 
agency.
    (3) Records for income transactions after grant or subgrant support. 
In some cases grantees must report income after the period of grant 
support. Where there is such a requirement, the retention period for the 
records pertaining to the earning of the income starts from the end of 
the grantee's fiscal year in which the income is earned.
    (4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. This 
paragraph applies to the following types of documents, and their 
supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost 
allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rates 
at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer 
usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).
    (i) If submitted for negotiation. If the proposal, plan, or other 
computation is required to be submitted to the Federal Government (or to 
the grantee) to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-
year retention period for its supporting records starts from the date of 
such submission.
    (ii) If not submitted for negotiation. If the proposal, plan, or 
other computations are not required to be submitted to the Federal 
Government (or to the grantee) for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year 
retention period for the proposal plan, or computation and its 
supporting records starts from end of the fiscal year (or other 
accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.
    (d) Substitution of microfilm. Copies made by microfilming, 
photocopying, or similar methods may be substituted for the original 
records.
    (e) Access to records--(1) Records of grantees and subgrantees. The 
awarding agency and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any 
of their authorized representatives, shall have the right of access to 
any pertinent books, documents, papers, or other records of grantees and 
subgrantees which are pertinent to the grant, in order to make audits, 
examinations, excerpts, and transcripts.
    (2) Expiration of right of access. The rights of access in this 
section must not be limited to the required retention period but shall 
last as long as the records are retained.
    (f) Restrictions on public access. The Federal Freedom of 
Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) does not apply to records. Unless 
required by Federal, State, or local law, grantees and subgrantees are 
not required to permit public access to their records.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.143  Enforcement.

    (a) Remedies for noncompliance. If a grantee or subgrantee 
materially fails to comply with any term of an award, whether stated in 
a Federal statute or regulation, an assurance, in a State plan or 
application, a notice of award, or elsewhere, the awarding agency may 
take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the 
circumstances:
    (1) Temporary withhold cash payments pending correction of the 
deficiency by the grantee or subgrantee or more severe enforcement 
action by the awarding agency,
    (2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and matching credit 
for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in 
compliance,
    (3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award for the 
grantee's or subgrantee's program,
    (4) Without further awards for the program, or
    (5) Take other remedies that may be legally available,
    (b) Hearings, appeals. In taking an enforcement action, the awarding 
agency

[[Page 152]]

will provide the grantee or subgrantee an opportunity for such hearing, 
appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the grantee or 
subgrantee is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the 
action involved.
    (c) Effects of suspension and termination. Costs of grantee or 
subgrantee resulting from obligations incurred by the grantee or 
subgrantee during a suspension or after termination of an award are not 
allowable unless the awarding agency expressly authorizes them in the 
notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. Other grantee or 
subgrantee costs during suspension or after termination which are 
necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if:
    (1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred 
by the grantee or subgrantee before the effective date of suspension or 
termination, are not in anticipation of it, and, in case of a 
termination, are noncancellable, and,
    (2) The cost would be allowable if the award were not suspended or 
expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the 
termination takes effect.
    (d) Relationship to debarment and suspension. The enforcement 
remedies identified in this section, including suspension and 
termination, do not preclude grantee or subgrantee from being subject to 
``Debarment and Suspension'' under E.O. 12549 (see Sec. 105-71.135).


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.144  Termination for convenience.

    Except as provided in Sec. 105-71.143 awards may be terminated in 
whole or in part only as follows:
    (a) By the awarding agency with the consent of the grantee or 
subgrantee in which case the two parties shall agree upon the 
termination conditions, including the effective date and in the case of 
partial termination, the portion to be terminated, or
    (b) By the grantee or subgrantee upon written notification to the 
awarding agency, setting forth the reasons for such termination, the 
effective date, and in the case of partial termination, the portion to 
be terminated. However, if, in the case of a partial termination, the 
awarding agency determines that the remaining portion of the award will 
not accomplish the purposes for which the award was made, the awarding 
agency may terminate the award in its entirety under either Sec. 105-
71.143 or paragraph (a) of this section.


<R04>
             Subpart 105-71.15--After-the-Grant Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.150  Closeout.

    (a) General. The Federal agency will close out the award when it 
determines that all applicable administrative actions and all required 
work of the grant has been completed.
    (b) Reports. Within 90 days after the expiration or termination of 
the grant, the grantee must submit all financial, performance, and other 
reports required as a condition of the grant. Upon request by the 
grantee, Federal agencies may extend this timeframe. These may include 
but are not limited to:
    (1) Final performance or progress report.
    (2) Financial Status Report (SF 269) or Outlay Report and Request 
for Reimbursement for Construction Programs (SF-271) (as applicable).
    (3) Final request for payment (SF-270) (if applicable).
    (4) Invention disclosure (if applicable).
    (5) Federally-owned property report: In accordance with Sec. 105-
71.132(f), a grantee must submit an inventory of all federally owned 
property (as distinct from property acquired with grant funds) for which 
it is accountable and request disposition instructions from the Federal 
agency of property no longer needed.
    (c) Cost adjustment. The Federal agency will, within 90 days after 
receipt of reports in paragraph (b) of this section, make upward or 
downward adjustments to the allowable costs.
    (d) Cash adjustments. (1) The Federal agency will make prompt 
payment to the grantee for allowable reimbursable costs.
    (2) The grantee must immediately refund to the Federal agency any 
balance of unobligated (unencumbered) cash

[[Page 153]]

advanced that is not authorized to be retained for use on other grants.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.151  Later disallowances and adjustments.

    The closeout of a grant does not affect:
    (a) The Federal agency's right to disallow costs and recover funds 
on the basis of a later audit or other review;
    (b) The grantee's obligation to return any funds due as a result of 
later refunds, corrections, or other transactions;
    (c) Records retention as required in Sec. 105-71.142;
    (d) Property management requirements in Sec. 105-71.131 and 
Sec. 105-71.132; and
    (e) Audit requirements in Sec. 105-71.126.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.152  Collection of amounts due.

    (a) Any funds paid to a grantee in excess of the amount to which the 
grantee is finally determined to be entitled under the terms of the 
award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. If not paid within a 
reasonable period after demand, the Federal agency may reduce the debt 
by:
    (1) Making an administrative offset against other requests for 
reimbursement,
    (2) Withholding advance payments otherwise due to the grantee, or
    (3) Other action permitted by law.
    (b) Except where otherwise provided by statutes or regulations, the 
Federal agency will charge interest on an overdue debt in accordance 
with the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR Ch.II). The date 
from which interest is computed is not extended by litigation or the 
filing of any form of appeal.

Sec. 105-72.100  Purpose.

    This part establishes uniform administrative requirements for 
Federal grants and agreements awarded to institutions of higher 
education, hospitals, and other non-profit organizations. Federal 
awarding agencies shall not impose additional or inconsistent 
requirements, except as provided in Sec. 105-72.103, and Sec. 105-72.204 
or unless specifically required by Federal statute or executive order. 
Non-profit organizations that implement Federal programs for the States 
are also subject to State requirements.

during a given period requiring the provision of funds for:
    (1) Goods and other tangible property received;

    (c) Acquisition cost of equipment means the net invoice price of the 
equipment, including the cost of modifications, attachments, 
accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessary to make the property

transit insurance, shall be included or excluded from the unit 
acquisition cost in accordance with the recipient's regular accounting 
practices.
    (d) Advance means a payment made by Treasury check or other 
appropriate payment mechanism to a recipient upon its request either 
before outlays are made by the recipient or through the use of 
predetermined payment schedules.
    (e) Award means financial assistance that provides support or 
stimulation to accomplish a public purpose. Awards include grants and 
other agreements in the form of money or property in lieu of money, by 
the Federal Government to an eligible recipient. The term does not

the outlay of money contributed to the recipient by third parties.
    (g) Closeout means the process by which a Federal awarding agency 
determines that all applicable administrative actions and all required 
work of

[[Page 155]]

the award have been completed by the recipient and Federal awarding 
agency.
    (h) Contract means a procurement contract under an award or 
subaward, and a procurement subcontract under a recipient's or 
subrecipient's contract.
    (i) Cost sharing or matching means that portion of project or 
program costs not borne by the Federal Government.
    (j) Date of completion means the date on which all work under an 
award is completed or the date on the award document, or any supplement 
or amendment thereto, on which Federal sponsorship ends.
    (k) Disallowed costs means those charges to an award that the 
Federal awarding agency determines to be unallowable, in accordance with 
the applicable Federal cost principles or other terms and conditions 
contained in the award.
    (l) Equipment means tangible nonexpendable personal property 
including exempt property charged directly to the award having a useful 
life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $5000 or more per 
unit. However, consistent with recipient policy, lower limits may be 
established.

awarding agency that, as determined by the head thereof, is no longer 
required for its needs or the discharge of its responsibilities.
    (n) Exempt property means tangible personal property acquired in 
whole or in part with Federal funds, where the Federal awarding agency 
has statutory authority to vest title in the recipient without further 
obligation to the Federal Government. An example of exempt property 
authority is contained in the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement 
Act (31 U.S.C. 6306), for property acquired under an award to conduct

grants awarded, services received and similar transactions during a 
given period that require payment by the recipient during the same or a 
future period.
    (u) Outlays or expenditures means charges made to the project or 
program. They may be reported on a cash or accrual basis. For reports 
prepared on a cash basis, outlays are the sum of cash disbursements for 
direct charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect expense 
charged, the value of third party in-kind contributions applied and the

performed, the use or rental of real or personal property acquired under 
federally-funded projects, the sale of commodities or items fabricated 
under an award, license fees and royalties on patents and copyrights, 
and interest on loans made with award funds. Interest earned on advances 
of Federal funds is not program income. Except as otherwise provided in 
Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the 
award, program income does not include the receipt of principal on 
loans, rebates, credits, discounts, etc., or interest earned on any of 
them.
    (y) Project costs means all allowable costs, as set forth in the 
applicable Federal cost principles, incurred by a recipient and the 
value of the contributions made by third parties in accomplishing the 
objectives of the award during the project period.
    (z) Project period means the period established in the award 
document during which Federal sponsorship begins and ends.
    (aa) Property means, unless otherwise stated, real property, 
equipment, intangible property and debt instruments.

structures and appurtenances thereto, but excludes movable machinery and 
equipment.

directly from Federal awarding agencies to carry out a project or 
program. The term includes public and private institutions of higher 
education, public and private hospitals, and other quasi-public and 
private non-profit organizations such as, but not limited to, community 
action agencies, research institutes, educational associations, and 
health centers. The term may include commercial organizations, foreign 
or international organizations (such as agencies of the United Nations) 
which are recipients, subrecipients, or contractors or subcontractors of 
recipients or subrecipients at the discretion of the Federal awarding 
agency. The term does not include government-owned contractor-operated

oriented, large-scale programs that are government-owned or controlled, 
or are designated as federally-funded research and development centers.
    (dd) Research and development means all research activities, both 
basic and applied, and all development activities that are supported at 
universities, colleges, and other non-profit institutions. ``Research'' 
is defined as a systematic study directed toward fuller scientific 
knowledge or understanding of the subject studied. ``Development'' is 
the systematic use of knowledge and understanding gained from research 
directed toward the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or 
methods, including design and development of prototypes and processes. 
The term research also includes activities involving the training of 
individuals in research techniques where such activities utilize the 
same facilities as other research and development activities and where 
such activities are not included in the instruction function.
    (ee) Small awards means a grant or cooperative agreement not 
exceeding the small purchase threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) 
(currently $25,000).
    (ff) Subaward means an award of financial assistance in the form of 
money, or property in lieu of money, made under an award by a recipient 
to an eligible subrecipient or by a subrecipient to a lower tier 
subrecipient. The term includes financial assistance when provided by 
any legal agreement, even if the agreement is called a contract, but 
does not include procurement of goods and services nor does it include 
any form of assistance which is excluded from the definition of 
``award'' in paragraph 105-72.101(e).
    (gg) Subrecipient means the legal entity to which a subaward is made 
and which is accountable to the recipient for the use of the funds 
provided. The

[[Page 157]]

term may include foreign or international organizations (such as 
agencies of the United Nations) at the discretion of the Federal 
awarding agency.
    (hh) Supplies means all personal property excluding equipment, 
intangible property, and debt instruments as defined in this section, 
and inventions of a contractor conceived or first actually reduced to 
practice in the performance of work under a funding agreement (``subject 
inventions''), as defined in 37 CFR part 401, ``Rights to Inventions 
Made by Nonprofit Organizations and Small Business Firms Under 
Government Grants, Contracts, and Cooperative Agreements.''
    (ii) Suspension means an action by a Federal awarding agency that 
temporarily withdraws Federal sponsorship under an award, pending 
corrective action by the recipient or pending a decision to terminate 
the award by the Federal awarding agency. Suspension of an award is a 
separate action from suspension under Federal agency regulations 
implementing E.O.s 12549 and 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension.''
    (jj) Termination means the cancellation of Federal sponsorship, in 
whole or in part, under an agreement at any time prior to the date of 
completion.
    (kk) Third party in-kind contributions means the value of noncash 
contributions provided by non-Federal third parties. Third party in-kind 
contributions may be in the form of real property, equipment, supplies 
and other expendable property, and the value of goods and services 
directly benefiting and specifically identifiable to the project or 
program.
    (ll) Unliquidated obligations, for financial reports prepared on a 
cash basis, means the amount of obligations incurred by the recipient 
that have not been paid. For reports prepared on an accrued expenditure 
basis, they represent the amount of obligations incurred by the 
recipient for which an outlay has not been recorded.
    (mm) Unobligated balance means the portion of the funds authorized 
by the Federal awarding agency that has not been obligated by the 
recipient and is determined by deducting the cumulative obligations from 
the cumulative funds authorized.
    (nn) Unrecovered indirect cost means the difference between the 
amount awarded and the amount which could have been awarded under the 
recipient's approved negotiated indirect cost rate.
    (oo) Working capital advance means a procedure where by funds are 
advanced to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for 
a given initial period.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.102  Effect on other issuances.

    For awards subject to this regulation, all administrative 
requirements of codified program regulations, program manuals, handbooks 
and other nonregulatory materials which are inconsistent with the 
requirements of this regulation shall be superseded, except to the 
extent they are required by statute, or authorized in accordance with 
the deviations provision in Sec. 105-72.103.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.103  Deviations.

    The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) may grant exceptions for 
classes of grants or recipients subject to the requirements of this 
regulation when exceptions are not prohibited by statute. However, in 
the interest of maximum uniformity, exceptions from the requirements of 
this regulation shall be permitted only in unusual circumstances. 
Federal awarding agencies may apply more restrictive requirements to a 
class of recipients when approved by OMB. Federal awarding agencies may 
apply less restrictive requirements when awarding small awards, except 
for those requirements which are statutory. Exceptions on a case-by-case 
basis may also be made by Federal awarding agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.104  Subawards.

    Unless sections of this regulation specifically exclude 
subrecipients from coverage, the provisions of this regulation shall be 
applied to subrecipients performing work under awards if such 
subrecipients are institutions of higher education, hospitals or other 
non-profit organizations. State and local government subrecipients are 
subject to the provisions of regulations implementing the grants 
management common rule,

[[Page 158]]

``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative 
Agreements to State and Local Governments,'' 41 CFR 105-71.


<R04>
                Subpart 105-72.2--Pre-Award Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.200  Purpose.

    Sections 105-72.201 through 105-72.207 prescribes forms and 
instructions and other pre-award matters to be used in applying for 
Federal awards.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.201  Pre-award policies.

    (a) Use of grants and cooperative agreements, and contracts. In each 
instance, the Federal awarding agency shall decide on the appropriate 
award instrument (i.e., grant, cooperative agreement, or contract). The 
Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. 6301-08) governs 
the use of grants, cooperative agreements and contracts. A grant or 
cooperative agreement shall be used only when the principal purpose of a 
transaction is to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation 
authorized by Federal statute. The statutory criterion for choosing 
between grants and cooperative agreements is that for the latter, 
``substantial involvement is expected between the executive agency and 
the State, local government, or other recipient when carrying out the 
activity contemplated in the agreement.'' Contracts shall be used when 
the principal purpose is acquisition of property or services for the 
direct benefit or use of the Federal Government.
    (b) Public notice and priority setting. Federal awarding agencies 
shall notify the public of its intended funding priorities for 
discretionary grant programs, unless funding priorities are established 
by Federal statute.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.202  Forms for applying for Federal assistance.

    (a) Federal awarding agencies shall comply with the applicable 
report clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320, ``Controlling 
Paperwork Burdens on the Public,'' with regard to all forms used by the 
Federal awarding agency in place of or as a supplement to the Standard 
Form 424 (SF-424) series.
    (b) Applicants shall use the SF-424 series or those forms and 
instructions prescribed by the Federal awarding agency.
    (c) For Federal programs covered by E.O. 12372, ``Intergovernmental 
Review of Federal Programs,'' the applicant shall complete the 
appropriate sections of the SF-424 (Application for Federal Assistance) 
indicating whether the application was subject to review by the State 
Single Point of Contact (SPOC). The name and address of the SPOC for a 
particular State can be obtained from the Federal awarding agency or the 
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance. The SPOC shall advise the 
applicant whether the program for which application is made has been 
selected by that State for review.
    (d) Federal awarding agencies that do not use the SF-424 form should 
indicate whether the application is subject to review by the State under 
E.O. 12372.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.203  Debarment and suspension.

    Federal awarding agencies and recipients shall comply with the 
nonprocurement debarment and suspension common rule implementing E.O.s 
12549 and 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension.'' This common rule 
restricts subawards and contracts with certain parties that are 
debarred, suspended or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for 
participation in Federal assistance programs or activities.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.204  Special award conditions.

    If an applicant or recipient:
    (a) Has a history of poor performance,
    (b) Is not financially stable,
    (c) Has a management system that does not meet the standards 
prescribed in this regulation,
    (d) Has not conformed to the terms and conditions of a previous 
award, or
    (e) Is not otherwise responsible;

Federal awarding agencies may impose additional requirements as needed, 
provided that such applicant or recipient is notified in writing as to: 
the nature of the additional requirements, the reason why the additional 
requirements are being imposed, the nature of the

[[Page 159]]

corrective action needed, the time allowed for completing the corrective 
actions, and the method for requesting reconsideration of the additional 
requirements imposed. Any special conditions shall be promptly removed 
once the conditions that prompted them have been corrected.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.205  Metric system of measurement.

    The Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and 
Competitiveness Act (15 U.S.C. 205) declares that the metric system is 
the preferred measurement system for U.S. trade and commerce. The Act 
requires each Federal agency to establish a date or dates in 
consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, when the metric system of 
measurement will be used in the agency's procurements, grants, and other 
business-related activities. Metric implementation may take longer where 
the use of the system is initially impractical or likely to cause 
significant inefficiencies in the accomplishment of federally-funded 
activities. Federal awarding agencies shall follow the provisions of 
E.O. 12770, ``Metric Usage in Federal Government Programs.''


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.206  Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

    Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (Pub. L. 94-
580 codified at 42 U.S.C. 6962), any State agency or agency of a 
political subdivision of a State which is using appropriated Federal 
funds must comply with section 6002. Section 6002 requires that 
preference be given in procurement programs to the purchase of specific 
products containing recycled materials identified in guidelines 
developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (40 CFR parts 247 
through 254). Accordingly, State and local institutions of higher 
education, hospitals, and non-profit organizations that receive direct 
Federal awards or other Federal funds shall give preference in their 
procurement programs funded with Federal funds to the purchase of 
recycled products pursuant to the EPA guidelines.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.207  Certifications and representations.

    Unless prohibited by statute or codified regulation, each Federal 
awarding agency is authorized and encouraged to allow recipients to 
submit certifications and representations required by statute, executive 
order, or regulation on an annual basis, if the recipients have ongoing 
and continuing relationships with the agency. Annual certifications and 
representations shall be signed by responsible officials with the 
authority to ensure recipients' compliance with the pertinent 
requirements.


<R04>
    Subpart 105-72.30--Post-Award Requirements/Financial and Program 
                               Management


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.300  Purpose of financial and program management.

    Sections 105-72.301 through 105-72.308 prescribe standards for 
financial management systems, methods for making payments and rules for: 
satisfying cost sharing and matching requirements, accounting for 
program income, budget revision approvals, making audits, determining 
allowability of cost, and establishing fund availability.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.301  Standards for financial management systems.

    (a) Federal awarding agencies shall require recipients to relate 
financial data to performance data and develop unit cost information 
whenever practical.
    (b) Recipients' financial management systems shall provide for the 
following.
    (1) Accurate, current and complete disclosure of the financial 
results of each federally-sponsored project or program in accordance 
with the reporting requirements set forth in Sec. 105-72.602. If a 
Federal awarding agency requires reporting on an accrual basis from a 
recipient that maintains its records on other than an accrual basis, the 
recipient shall not be required to establish an accrual accounting 
system. These recipients may develop such accrual data for its reports 
on the basis of an analysis of the documentation on hand.
    (2) Records that identify adequately the source and application of 
funds for

[[Page 160]]

federally-sponsored activities. These records shall contain information 
pertaining to Federal awards, authorizations, obligations, unobligated 
balances, assets, outlays, income and interest.
    (3) Effective control over and accountability for all funds, 
property and other assets. Recipients shall adequately safeguard all 
such assets and assure they are used solely for authorized purposes.
    (4) Comparison of outlays with budget amounts for each award. 
Whenever appropriate, financial information should be related to 
performance and unit cost data.
    (5) Written procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the 
transfer of funds to the recipient from the U.S. Treasury and the 
issuance or redemption of checks, warrants or payments by other means 
for program purposes by the recipient. To the extent that the provisions 
of the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) (Pub. L. 101-453) govern, 
payment methods of State agencies, instrumentalities, and fiscal agents 
shall be consistent with CMIA Treasury-State Agreements or the CMIA 
default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205, ``Withdrawal of Cash 
from the Treasury for Advances under Federal Grant and Other Programs.''
    (6) Written procedures for determining the reasonableness, 
allocability and allowability of costs in accordance with the provisions 
of the applicable Federal cost principles and the terms and conditions 
of the award.
    (7) Accounting records including cost accounting records that are 
supported by source documentation.
    (c) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment 
of money borrowed by the recipient, the Federal awarding agency, at its 
discretion, may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding 
and insurance requirements of the recipient are not deemed adequate to 
protect the interest of the Federal Government.
    (d) The Federal awarding agency may require adequate fidelity bond 
coverage where the recipient lacks sufficient coverage to protect the 
Federal Government's interest.
    (e) Where bonds are required in the situations described above, the 
bonds shall be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority 
as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety 
Companies Doing Business with the United States.''


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.302  Payment.

    (a) Payment methods shall minimize the time elapsing between the 
transfer of funds from the United States Treasury and the issuance or 
redemption of checks, warrants, or payment by other means by the 
recipients. Payment methods of State agencies or instrumentalities shall 
be consistent with Treasury-State CMIA agreements or default procedures 
codified at 31 CFR part 205.
    (b)(1) Recipients are to be paid in advance, provided they maintain 
or demonstrate the willingness to maintain:
    (i) Written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the 
transfer of funds and disbursement by the recipient, and
    (ii) Financial management systems that meet the standards for fund 
control and accountability as established in Sec. 105-72.301.
    (2) Cash advances to a recipient organization shall be limited to 
the minimum amounts needed and be timed to be in accordance with the 
actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient organization in 
carrying out the purpose of the approved program or project. The timing 
and amount of cash advances shall be as close as is administratively 
feasible to the actual disbursements by the recipient organization for 
direct program or project costs and the proportionate share of any 
allowable indirect costs.
    (c) Whenever possible, advances shall be consolidated to cover 
anticipated cash needs for all awards made by the Federal awarding 
agency to the recipient.
    (1) Advance payment mechanisms include, but are not limited to, 
Treasury check and electronic funds transfer.
    (2) Advance payment mechanisms are subject to 31 CFR part 205.
    (3) Recipients shall be authorized to submit requests for advances 
and reimbursements at least monthly when electronic fund transfers are 
not used.
    (d) Requests for Treasury check advance payment shall be submitted 
on

[[Page 161]]

SF-270, ``Request for Advance or Reimbursement,'' or other forms as may 
be authorized by OMB. This form is not to be used when Treasury check 
advance payments are made to the recipient automatically through the use 
of a predetermined payment schedule or if precluded by special Federal 
awarding agency instructions for electronic funds transfer.
    (e) Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in 
paragraph (b) cannot be met. Federal awarding agencies may also use this 
method on any construction agreement, or if the major portion of the 
construction project is accomplished through private market financing or 
Federal loans, and the Federal assistance constitutes a minor portion of 
the project.
    (1) When the reimbursement method is used, the Federal awarding 
agency shall make payment within 30 days after receipt of the billing, 
unless the billing is improper.
    (2) Recipients shall be authorized to submit request for 
reimbursement at least monthly when electronic funds transfers are not 
used.
    (f) If a recipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and 
the Federal awarding agency has determined that reimbursement is not 
feasible because the recipient lacks sufficient working capital, the 
Federal awarding agency may provide cash on a working capital advance 
basis. Under this procedure, the Federal awarding agency shall advance 
cash to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an 
initial period generally geared to the awardee's disbursing cycle. 
Thereafter, the Federal awarding agency shall reimburse the recipient 
for its actual cash disbursements. The working capital advance method of 
payment shall not be used for recipients unwilling or unable to provide 
timely advances to their subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual 
cash disbursements.
    (g) To the extent available, recipients shall disburse funds 
available from repayments to and interest earned on a revolving fund, 
program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries 
and interest earned on such funds before requesting additional cash 
payments.
    (h) Unless otherwise required by statute, Federal awarding agencies 
shall not withhold payments for proper charges made by recipients at any 
time during the project period unless paragraphs (h)(1) or (2) of this 
section apply.
    (1) A recipient has failed to comply with the project objectives, 
the terms and conditions of the award, or Federal reporting 
requirements.
    (2) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the 
United States as defined in OMB Circular A-129, ``Managing Federal 
Credit Programs.'' Under such conditions, the Federal awarding agency 
may, upon reasonable notice, inform the recipient that payments shall 
not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date until the 
conditions are corrected or the indebtedness to the Federal Government 
is liquidated.
    (i) Standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as 
depositories of funds advanced under awards are as follows:
    (1) Except for situations described in paragraph (i)(2), Federal 
awarding agencies shall not require separate depository accounts for 
funds provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility requirements 
for depositories for funds provided to a recipient. However, recipients 
must be able to account for the receipt, obligation and expenditure of 
funds.
    (2) Advances of Federal funds shall be deposited and maintained in 
insured accounts whenever possible.
    (j) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities 
for women-owned and minority-owned business enterprises, recipients 
shall be encouraged to use womenowned and minority-owned banks (a bank 
which is owned at least 50 percent by women or minority group members).
    (k) Recipients shall maintain advances of Federal funds in interest 
bearing accounts, unless paragraph (k)(1), (2) or (3) of this section 
apply.
    (1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per 
year.

[[Page 162]]

    (2) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not 
be expected to earn interest in excess of $250 per year on Federal cash 
balances.
    (3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so 
high that it would not be feasible within the expected Federal and non-
Federal cash resources.
    (l) For those entities where CMIA and its implementing regulations 
do not apply, interest earned on Federal advances deposited in interest 
bearing accounts shall be remitted annually to Department of Health and 
Human Services, Payment Management System, P.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD 
20852. Interest amounts up to $250 per year may be retained by the 
recipient for administrative expense. State universities and hospitals 
shall comply with CMIA, as it pertains to interest. If an entity subject 
to CMIA uses its own funds to pay pre-award costs for discretionary 
awards without prior written approval from the Federal awarding agency, 
it waives its right to recover the interest under CMIA.
    (m) Except as noted elsewhere in this regulation, only the following 
forms shall be authorized for the recipients in requesting advances and 
reimbursements. Federal agencies shall not require more than an original 
and two copies of these forms.
    (1) SF-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. Each Federal 
awarding agency shall adopt the SF-270 as a standard form for all 
nonconstruction programs when electronic funds transfer or predetermined 
advance methods are not used. Federal awarding agencies, however, have 
the option of using this form for construction programs in lieu of the 
SF-271, ``Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction 
Programs.''
    (2) SF-271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for 
Construction Programs. Each Federal awarding agency shall adopt the SF-
271 as the standard form to be used for requesting reimbursement for 
construction programs. However, a Federal awarding agency may substitute 
the SF-270 when the Federal awarding agency determines that it provides 
adequate information to meet Federal needs.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.303  Cost sharing or matching.

    (a) All contributions, including cash and third party in-kind, shall 
be accepted as part of the recipient's cost sharing or matching when 
such contributions meet all of the following criteria.
    (1) Are verifiable from the recipient's records.
    (2) Are not included as contributions for any other federally-
assisted project or program.
    (3) Are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient 
accomplishment of project or program objectives.
    (4) Are allowable under the applicable cost principles.
    (5) Are not paid by the Federal Government under another award, 
except where authorized by Federal statute to be used for cost sharing 
or matching.
    (6) Are provided for in the approved budget when required by the 
Federal awarding agency.
    (7) Conform to other provisions of this regulation, as applicable.
    (b) Unrecovered indirect costs may be included as part of cost 
sharing or matching only with the prior approval of the Federal awarding 
agency.
    (c) Values for recipient contributions of services and property 
shall be established in accordance with the applicable cost principles. 
If a Federal awarding agency authorizes recipients to donate buildings 
or land for construction/facilities acquisition projects or long-term 
use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing or matching 
shall be the lesser of paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
    (1) The certified value of the remaining life of the property 
recorded in the recipient's accounting records at the time of donation.
    (2) The current fair market value. However, when there is sufficient 
justification, the Federal awarding agency may approve the use of the 
current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds 
the certified value at the time of donation to the project.
    (d) Volunteer services furnished by professional and technical 
personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor may be 
counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an

[[Page 163]]

integral and necessary part of an approved project or program. Rates for 
volunteer services shall be consistent with those paid for similar work 
in the recipient's organization. In those instances in which the 
required skills are not found in the recipient organization, rates shall 
be consistent with those paid for similar work in the labor market in 
which the recipient competes for the kind of services involved. In 
either case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and 
allocable may be included in the valuation.
    (e) When an employer other than the recipient furnishes the services 
of an employee, these services shall be valued at the employee's regular 
rate of pay (plus an amount of fringe benefits that are reasonable, 
allowable, and allocable, but exclusive of overhead costs), provided 
these services are in the same skill for which the employee is normally 
paid.
    (f) Donated supplies may include such items as expendable equipment, 
office supplies, laboratory supplies or workshop and classroom supplies. 
Value assessed to donated supplies included in the cost sharing or 
matching share shall be reasonable and shall not exceed the fair market 
value of the property at the time of the donation.
    (g) The method used for determining cost sharing or matching for 
donated equipment, buildings and land for which title passes to the 
recipient may differ according to the purpose of the award, if paragraph 
(g)(1) or (2) of this section apply.
    (1) If the purpose of the award is to assist the recipient in the 
acquisition of equipment, buildings or land, the total value of the 
donated property may be claimed as cost sharing or matching.
    (2) If the purpose of the award is to support activities that 
require the use of equipment, buildings or land, normally only 
depreciation or use charges for equipment and buildings may be made. 
However, the full value of equipment or other capital assets and fair 
rental charges for land may be allowed, provided that the Federal 
awarding agency has approved the charges.
    (h) The value of donated property shall be determined in accordance 
with the usual accounting policies of the recipient, with the following 
qualifications.
    (1) The value of donated land and buildings shall not exceed its 
fair market value at the time of donation to the recipient as 
established by an independent appraiser (e.g., certified real property 
appraiser or General Services Administration representative) and 
certified by a responsible official of the recipient.
    (2) The value of donated equipment shall not exceed the fair market 
value of equipment of the same age and condition at the time of 
donation.
    (3) The value of donated space shall not exceed the fair rental 
value of comparable space as established by an independent appraisal of 
comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the 
same locality.
    (4) The value of loaned equipment shall not exceed its fair rental 
value.
    (5) The following requirements pertain to the recipient's supporting 
records for in-kind contributions from third parties.
    (i) Volunteer services shall be documented and, to the extent 
feasible, supported by the same methods used by the recipient for its 
own employees.
    (ii) The basis for determining the valuation for personal service, 
material, equipment, buildings and land shall be documented.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.304  Program income.

    (a) Federal awarding agencies shall apply the standards set forth in 
this section in requiring recipient organizations to account for program 
income related to projects financed in whole or in part with Federal 
funds.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, program 
income earned during the project period shall be retained by the 
recipient and, in accordance with Federal awarding agency regulations or 
the terms and conditions of the award, shall be used in one or more of 
the ways listed in the following.
    (1) Added to funds committed to the project by the Federal awarding 
agency and recipient and used to further eligible project or program 
objectives.
    (2) Used to finance the non-Federal share of the project or program.

[[Page 164]]

    (3) Deducted from the total project or program allowable cost in 
determining the net allowable costs on which the Federal share of costs 
is based.
    (c) When an agency authorizes the disposition of program income as 
described in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2), program income in excess of 
any limits stipulated shall be used in accordance with paragraph (b)(3).
    (d) In the event that the Federal awarding agency does not specify 
in its regulations or the terms and conditions of the award how program 
income is to be used, paragraph (b)(3) shall apply automatically to all 
projects or programs except research. For awards that support research, 
paragraph (b)(1) shall apply automatically unless the awarding agency 
indicates in the terms and conditions another alternative on the award 
or the recipient is subject to special award conditions, as indicated in 
Sec. 105-72.204.
    (e) Unless Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and 
conditions of the award provide otherwise, recipients shall have no 
obligation to the Federal Government regarding program income earned 
after the end of the project period.
    (f) If authorized by Federal awarding agency regulations or the 
terms and conditions of the award, costs incident to the generation of 
program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program 
income, provided these costs have not been charged to the award.
    (g) Proceeds from the sale of property shall be handled in 
accordance with the requirements of the Property Standards (See 
Sec. 105-72.400 through Sec. 105-72.407).
    (h) Unless Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and 
condition of the award provide otherwise, recipients shall have no 
obligation to the Federal Government with respect to program income 
earned from license fees and royalties for copyrighted material, 
patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions produced under 
an award. However, Patent and Trademark Amendments (35 U.S.C. 18) apply 
to inventions made under an experimental, developmental, or research 
award.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.305  Revision of budget and program plans.

    (a) The budget plan is the financial expression of the project or 
program as approved during the award process. It may include either the 
Federal and non-Federal share, or only the Federal share, depending upon 
Federal awarding agency requirements. It shall be related to performance 
for program evaluation purposes whenever appropriate.
    (b) Recipients are required to report deviations from budget and 
program plans, and request prior approvals for budget and program plan 
revisions, in accordance with this section.
    (c) For nonconstruction awards, recipients shall request prior 
approvals from Federal awarding agencies for one or more of the 
following program or budget related reasons.
    (1) Change in the scope or the objective of the project or program 
(even if there is no associated budget revision requiring prior written 
approval).
    (2) Change in a key person specified in the application or award 
document.
    (3) The absence for more than three months, or a 25 percent 
reduction in time devoted to the project, by the approved project 
director or principal investigator.
    (4) The need for additional Federal funding.
    (5) The transfer of amounts budgeted for indirect costs to absorb 
increases in direct costs, or vice versa, if approval is required by the 
Federal awarding agency.
    (6) The inclusion, unless waived by the Federal awarding agency, of 
costs that require prior approval in accordance with OMB Circular A-21, 
``Cost Principles for Institutions of Higher Education,'' OMB Circular 
A-122, ``Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations,'' or 45 CFR part 
74 appendix E, ``Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research 
and Development under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals,'' or 48 CFR 
part 31, ``Contract Cost Principles and Procedures,'' as applicable.
    (7) The transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (direct 
payment to trainees) to other categories of expense.
    (8) Unless described in the application and funded in the approved

[[Page 165]]

awards, the subaward, transfer or contracting out of any work under an 
award. This provision does not apply to the purchase of supplies, 
material, equipment or general support services.
    (d) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be 
imposed unless a deviation has been approved by OMB.
    (e) Except for requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(4) 
of this section, Federal awarding agencies are authorized, at their 
option, to waive cost-related and administrative prior written approvals 
required by this regulation and OMB Circulars A-21 and A-122. Such 
waivers may include authorizing recipients to do any one or more of the 
following.
    (1) Incur pre-award costs 90 calendar days prior to award or more 
than 90 calendar days with the prior approval of the Federal awarding 
agency. All pre-award costs are incurred at the recipient's risk (i.e., 
the Federal awarding agency is under no obligation to reimburse such 
costs if for any reason the recipient does not receive an award or if 
the award is less than anticipated and inadequate to cover such costs).
    (2) Initiate a one-time extension of the expiration date of the 
award of up to 12 months unless one or more of the following conditions 
apply. For one-time extensions, the recipient must notify the Federal 
awarding agency in writing with the supporting reasons and revised 
expiration date at least 10 days before the expiration date specified in 
the award. This one-time extension may not be exercised merely for the 
purpose of using unobligated balances.
    (i) The terms and conditions of award prohibit the extension.
    (ii) The extension requires additional Federal funds.
    (iii) The extension involves any change in the approved objectives 
or scope of the project.
    (3) Carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent funding 
periods.
    (4) For awards that support research, unless the Federal awarding 
agency provides otherwise in the award or in the agency's regulations, 
the prior approval requirements described in paragraph (e) are 
automatically waived (i.e., recipients need not obtain such prior 
approvals) unless one of the conditions included in paragraph (e)(2) 
applies.
    (f) The Federal awarding agency may, at its option, restrict the 
transfer of funds among direct cost categories or programs, functions 
and activities for awards in which the Federal share of the project 
exceeds $100,000 and the cumulative amount of such transfers exceeds or 
is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget as last approved by 
the Federal awarding agency. No Federal awarding agency shall permit a 
transfer that would cause any Federal appropriation or part thereof to 
be used for purposes other than those consistent with the original 
intent of the appropriation.
    (g) All other changes to nonconstruction budgets, except for the 
changes described in paragraph (j), do not require prior approval.
    (h) For construction awards, recipients shall request prior written 
approval promptly from Federal awarding agencies for budget revisions 
whenever paragraphs (h)(1), (2) or (3) of this section apply.
    (1) The revision results from changes in the scope or the objective 
of the project or program.
    (2) The need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the 
project.
    (3) A revision is desired which involves specific costs for which 
prior written approval requirements may be imposed consistent with 
applicable OMB cost principles listed in Sec. 105-72.307.
    (i) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be 
imposed unless a deviation has been approved by OMB.
    (j) When a Federal awarding agency makes an award that provides 
support for both construction and nonconstruction work, the Federal 
awarding agency may require the recipient to request prior approval from 
the Federal awarding agency before making any fund or budget transfers 
between the two types of work supported.
    (k) For both construction and nonconstruction awards, Federal 
awarding agencies shall require recipients to notify the Federal 
awarding agency in writing promptly whenever the amount of Federal 
authorized funds is expected

[[Page 166]]

to exceed the needs of the recipient for the project period by more than 
$5000 or five percent of the Federal award, whichever is greater. This 
notification shall not be required if an application for additional 
funding is submitted for a continuation award.
    (l) When requesting approval for budget revisions, recipients shall 
use the budget forms that were used in the application unless the 
Federal awarding agency indicates a letter of request suffices.
    (m) Within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request 
for budget revisions, Federal awarding agencies shall review the request 
and notify the recipient whether the budget revisions have been 
approved. If the revision is still under consideration at the end of 30 
calendar days, the Federal awarding agency shall inform the recipient in 
writing of the date when the recipient may expect the decision.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.306  Non-Federal audits.

    (a) Recipients and subrecipients that are institutions of higher 
education or other non-profit organizations shall be subject to the 
audit requirements contained in OMB Circular A-133, ``Audits of 
Institutions of Higher Education and Other Non-Profit Institutions.''
    (b) State and local governments shall be subject to the audit 
requirements contained in the Single Audit Act (31 U.S.C. 7501-7) and 
Federal awarding agency regulations implementing OMB Circular A-128, 
``Audits of State and Local Governments.''
    (c) Hospitals not covered by the audit provisions of OMB Circular A-
133 shall be subject to the audit requirements of the Federal awarding 
agencies.
    (d) Commercial organizations shall be subject to the audit 
requirements of the Federal awarding agency or the prime recipient as 
incorporated into the award document.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.307  Allowable costs.

    For each kind of recipient, there is a set of Federal principles for 
determining allowable costs. Allowability of costs shall be determined 
in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity 
incurring the costs. Thus, allowability of costs incurred by State, 
local or federally-recognized Indian tribal governments is determined in 
accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-87, ``Cost Principles 
for State and Local Governments.'' The allowability of costs incurred by 
non-profit organizations is determined in accordance with the provisions 
of OMB Circular A-122, ``Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations.'' 
The allowability of costs incurred by institutions of higher education 
is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21, 
``Cost Principles for Educational Institutions.'' The allowability of 
costs incurred by hospitals is determined in accordance with the 
provisions of appendix E of 45 CFR part 74, ``Principles for Determining 
Costs Applicable to Research and Development Under Grants and Contracts 
with Hospitals.'' The allowability of costs incurred by commercial 
organizations and those non-profit organizations listed in Attachment C 
to Circular A-122 is determined in accordance with the provisions of the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR part 31.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.308  Period of availability of funds.

    Where a funding period is specified, a recipient may charge to the 
grant only allowable costs resulting from obligations incurred during 
the funding period and any pre-award costs authorized by the Federal 
awarding agency.


<R04>
      Subpart 105-72.40--Post-Award Requirements/Property Standards


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.400  Purpose of property standards.

    Sections 105-72.401 through 105-72.407 set forth uniform standards 
governing management and disposition of property furnished by the 
Federal Government whose cost was charged to a project supported by a 
Federal award. Federal awarding agencies shall require recipients to 
observe these standards under awards and shall not impose additional 
requirements, unless specifically required by Federal statute. The 
recipient may use its own property management standards and procedures 
provided it observes the provisions of Sec. 105-72.401 through Sec. 105-
72.407.

[[Page 167]]


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.401  Insurance coverage.

    Recipients shall, at a minimum, provide the equivalent insurance 
coverage for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds as 
provided to property owned by the recipient. Federally-owned property 
need not be insured unless required by the terms and conditions of the 
award.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.402  Real property.

    Each Federal awarding agency shall prescribe requirements for 
recipients concerning the use and disposition of real property acquired 
in whole or in part under awards. Unless otherwise provided by statute, 
such requirements, at a minimum, shall contain the following.
    (a) Title to real property shall vest in the recipient subject to 
the condition that the recipient shall use the real property for the 
authorized purpose of the project as long as it is needed and shall not 
encumber the property without approval of the Federal awarding agency.
    (b) The recipient shall obtain written approval by the Federal 
awarding agency for the use of real property in other federally-
sponsored projects when the recipient determines that the property is no 
longer needed for the purpose of the original project. Use in other 
projects shall be limited to those under federally-sponsored projects 
(i.e., awards) or programs that have purposes consistent with those 
authorized for support by the Federal awarding agency.
    (c) When the real property is no longer needed as provided in 
paragraphs (a) and (b), the recipient shall request disposition 
instructions from the Federal awarding agency or its successor Federal 
awarding agency. The Federal awarding agency shall observe one or more 
of the following disposition instructions.
    (1) The recipient may be permitted to retain title without further 
obligation to the Federal Government after it compensates the Federal 
Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the 
property attributable to the Federal participation in the project.
    (2) The recipient may be directed to sell the property under 
guidelines provided by the Federal awarding agency and pay the Federal 
Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the 
property attributable to the Federal participation in the project (after 
deducting actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any, 
from the sales proceeds). When the recipient is authorized or required 
to sell the property, proper sales procedures shall be established that 
provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the 
highest possible return.
    (3) The recipient may be directed to transfer title to the property 
to the Federal Government or to an eligible third party provided that, 
in such cases, the recipient shall be entitled to compensation for its 
attributable percentage of the current fair market value of the 
property.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.403  Federally-owned and exempt property.

    (a) Federally-owned property. (1) Title to federally-owned property 
remains vested in the Federal Government. Recipients shall submit 
annually an inventory listing of federally-owned property in their 
custody to the Federal awarding agency. Upon completion of the award or 
when the property is no longer needed, the recipient shall report the 
property to the Federal awarding agency for further Federal agency 
utilization.
    (2) If the Federal awarding agency has no further need for the 
property, it shall be declared excess and reported to the General 
Services Administration, unless the Federal awarding agency has 
statutory authority to dispose of the property by alternative methods 
(e.g., the authority provided by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 
U.S.C. 3710 (I)) to donate research equipment to educational and non-
profit organizations in accordance with E.O. 12821, ``Improving 
Mathematics and Science Education in Support of the National Education 
Goals.'') Appropriate instructions shall be issued to the recipient by 
the Federal awarding agency.
    (b) Exempt property. When statutory authority exists, the Federal 
awarding agency has the option to vest title to property acquired with 
Federal funds

[[Page 168]]

in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government 
and under conditions the Federal awarding agency considers appropriate. 
Such property is ``exempt property.'' Should a Federal awarding agency 
not establish conditions, title to exempt property upon acquisition 
shall vest in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal 
Government.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.404  Equipment.

    (a) Title to equipment acquired by a recipient with Federal funds 
shall vest in the recipient, subject to conditions of this section.
    (b) The recipient shall not use equipment acquired with Federal 
funds to provide services to non-Federal outside organizations for a fee 
that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, 
unless specifically authorized by Federal statute, for as long as the 
Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment.
    (c) The recipient shall use the equipment in the project or program 
for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project 
or program continues to be supported by Federal funds and shall not 
encumber the property without approval of the Federal awarding agency. 
When no longer needed for the original project or program, the recipient 
shall use the equipment in connection with its other federally-sponsored 
activities, in the following order of priority:
    (1) Activities sponsored by the Federal awarding agency which funded 
the original project, then
    (2) Activities sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies.
    (d) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program 
for which it was acquired, the recipient shall make it available for use 
on other projects or programs if such other use will not interfere with 
the work on the project or program for which the equipment was 
originally acquired. First preference for such other use shall be given 
to other projects or programs sponsored by the Federal awarding agency 
that financed the equipment; second preference shall be given to 
projects or programs sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. If 
the equipment is owned by the Federal Government, use on other 
activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible 
if authorized by the Federal awarding agency. User charges shall be 
treated as program income.
    (e) When acquiring replacement equipment, the recipient may use the 
equipment to be replaced as trade-in or sell the equipment and use the 
proceeds to offset the costs of the replacement equipment subject to the 
approval of the Federal awarding agency.
    (f) The recipient's property management standards for equipment 
acquired with Federal funds and federally-owned equipment shall include 
all of the following.
    (1) Equipment records shall be maintained accurately and shall 
include the following information.
    (i) A description of the equipment.
    (ii) Manufacturer's serial number, model number, Federal stock 
number, national stock number, or other identification number.
    (iii) Source of the equipment, including the award number.
    (iv) Whether title vests in the recipient or the Federal Government.
    (v) Acquisition date (or date received, if the equipment was 
furnished by the Federal Government) and cost.
    (vi) Information from which one can calculate the percentage of 
Federal participation in the cost of the equipment (not applicable to 
equipment furnished by the Federal Government).
    (vii) Location and condition of the equipment and the date the 
information was reported.
    (viii) Unit acquisition cost.
    (ix) Ultimate disposition data, including date of disposal and sales 
price or the method used to determine current fair market value where a 
recipient compensates the Federal awarding agency for its share.
    (2) Equipment owned by the Federal Government shall be identified to 
indicate Federal ownership.
    (3) A physical inventory of equipment shall be taken and the results 
reconciled with the equipment records at least once every two years. Any 
differences between quantities determined by the physical inspection and 
those shown in the accounting records shall be investigated to determine 
the

[[Page 169]]

causes of the difference. The recipient shall, in connection with the 
inventory, verify the existence, current utilization, and continued need 
for the equipment.
    (4) A control system shall be in effect to insure adequate 
safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the equipment. Any loss, 
damage, or theft of equipment shall be investigated and fully 
documented; if the equipment was owned by the Federal Government, the 
recipient shall promptly notify the Federal awarding agency.
    (5) Adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented to keep the 
equipment in good condition.
    (6) Where the recipient is authorized or required to sell the 
equipment, proper sales procedures shall be established which provide 
for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest 
possible return.
    (g) When the recipient no longer needs the equipment, the equipment 
may be used for other activities in accordance with the following 
standards. For equipment with a current per unit fair market value of 
$5000 or more, the recipient may retain the equipment for other uses 
provided that compensation is made to the original Federal awarding 
agency or its successor. The amount of compensation shall be computed by 
applying the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the 
original project or program to the current fair market value of the 
equipment. If the recipient has no need for the equipment, the recipient 
shall request disposition instructions from the Federal awarding agency. 
The Federal awarding agency shall determine whether the equipment can be 
used to meet the agency's requirements. If no requirement exists within 
that agency, the availability of the equipment shall be reported to the 
General Services Administration by the Federal awarding agency to 
determine whether a requirement for the equipment exists in other 
Federal agencies. The Federal awarding agency shall issue instructions 
to the recipient no later than 120 calendar days after the recipient's 
request and the following procedures shall govern.
    (1) If so instructed or if disposition instructions are not issued 
within 120 calendar days after the recipient's request, the recipient 
shall sell the equipment and reimburse the Federal awarding agency an 
amount computed by applying to the sales proceeds the percentage of 
Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program. 
However, the recipient shall be permitted to deduct and retain from the 
Federal share $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less, 
for the recipient's selling and handling expenses.
    (2) If the recipient is instructed to ship the equipment elsewhere, 
the recipient shall be reimbursed by the Federal Government by an amount 
which is computed by applying the percentage of the recipient's 
participation in the cost of the original project or program to the 
current fair market value of the equipment, plus any reasonable shipping 
or interim storage costs incurred.
    (3) If the recipient is instructed to otherwise dispose of the 
equipment, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the Federal awarding 
agency for such costs incurred in its disposition.
    (4) The Federal awarding agency may reserve the right to transfer 
the title to the Federal Government or to a third party named by the 
Federal Government when such third party is otherwise eligible under 
existing statutes. Such transfer shall be subject to the following 
standards.
    (i) The equipment shall be appropriately identified in the award or 
otherwise made known to the recipient in writing.
    (ii) The Federal awarding agency shall issue disposition 
instructions within 120 calendar days after receipt of a final 
inventory. The final inventory shall list all equipment acquired with 
grant funds and federally-owned equipment. If the Federal awarding 
agency fails to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar 
day period, the recipient shall apply the standards of this section, as 
appropriate.
    (iii) When the Federal awarding agency exercises its right to take 
title, the equipment shall be subject to the provisions for federally-
owned equipment.

[[Page 170]]


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.405  Supplies and other expendable property.

    (a) Title to supplies and other expendable property shall vest in 
the recipient upon acquisition. If there is a residual inventory of 
unused supplies exceeding $5000 in total aggregate value upon 
termination or completion of the project or program and the supplies are 
not needed for any other federally-sponsored project or program, the 
recipient shall retain the supplies for use on non-Federal sponsored 
activities or sell them, but shall, in either case, compensate the 
Federal Government for its share. The amount of compensation shall be 
computed in the same manner as for equipment.
    (b) The recipient shall not use supplies acquired with Federal funds 
to provide services to non-Federal outside organizations for a fee that 
is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless 
specifically authorized by Federal statute as long as the Federal 
Government retains an interest in the supplies.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.406  Intangible property.

    (a) The recipient may copyright any work that is subject to 
copyright and was developed, or for which ownership was purchased, under 
an award. The Federal awarding agency(ies) reserve a royalty-free, 
nonexclusive and irrevocable right to reproduce, publish, or otherwise 
use the work for Federal purposes, and to authorize others to do so.
    (b) Recipients are subject to applicable regulations governing 
patents and inventions, including governmentwide regulations issued by 
the Department of Commerce at 37 CFR part 401, ``Rights to Inventions 
Made by Nonprofit Organizations and Small Business Firms Under 
Government Grants, Contracts and Cooperative Agreements.''
    (c) Unless waived by the Federal awarding agency, the Federal 
Government has the right to paragraph (c)(1) and (2) of this section.
    (1) Obtain, reproduce, publish or otherwise use the data first 
produced under an award.
    (2) Authorize others to receive, reproduce, publish, or otherwise 
use such data for Federal purposes.
    (d) Title to intangible property and debt instruments acquired under 
an award or subaward vests upon acquisition in the recipient. The 
recipient shall use that property for the originally-authorized purpose, 
and the recipient shall not encumber the property without approval of 
the Federal awarding agency. When no longer needed for the originally 
authorized purpose, disposition of the intangible property shall occur 
in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 105-72.404(g).


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.407  Property trust relationship.

    Real property, equipment, intangible property and debt instruments 
that are acquired or improved with Federal funds shall be held in trust 
by the recipient as trustee for the beneficiaries of the project or 
program under which the property was acquired or improved. Agencies may 
require recipients to record liens or other appropriate notices of 
record to indicate that personal or real property has been acquired or 
improved with Federal funds and that use and disposition conditions 
apply to the property.


<R04>
    Subpart 105-72.50--Post-Award Requirements/Procurement Standards


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.500  Purpose of procurement standards.

    Sections 105-72.501 through 105-72.508 set forth standards for use 
by recipients in establishing procedures for the procurement of supplies 
and other expendable property, equipment, real property and other 
services with Federal funds. These standards are furnished to ensure 
that such materials and services are obtained in an effective manner and 
in compliance with the provisions of applicable Federal statutes and 
executive orders. No additional procurement standards or requirements 
shall be imposed by the Federal awarding agencies upon recipients, 
unless specifically required by Federal statute or executive order or 
approved by OMB.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.501  Recipient responsibilities.

    The standards contained in this section do not relieve the recipient 
of the

[[Page 171]]

contractual responsibilities arising under its contract(s). The 
recipient is the responsible authority, without recourse to the Federal 
awarding agency, regarding the settlement and satisfaction of all 
contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements 
entered into in support of an award or other agreement. This includes 
disputes, claims, protests of award, source evaluation or other matters 
of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of statute are to 
be referred to such Federal, State or local authority as may have proper 
jurisdiction.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.502  Codes of conduct.

    The recipient shall maintain written standards of conduct governing 
the performance of its employees engaged in the award and administration 
of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent shall participate in the 
selection, award, or administration of a contract supported by Federal 
funds if a real or apparent conflict of interest would be involved. Such 
a conflict would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member 
of his or her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization 
which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, 
has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for an award. The 
officers, employees, and agents of the recipient shall neither solicit 
nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from 
contractors, or parties to subagreements. However, recipients may set 
standards for situations in which the financial interest is not 
substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The 
standards of conduct shall provide for disciplinary actions to be 
applied for violations of such standards by officers, employees, or 
agents of the recipient.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.503  Competition.

    All procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner to 
provide, to the maximum extent practical, open and free competition. The 
recipient shall be alert to organizational conflicts of interest as well 
as noncompetitive practices among contractors that may restrict or 
eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. In order to ensure 
objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive 
advantage, contractors that develop or draft specifications, 
requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids and/or requests 
for proposals shall be excluded from competing for such procurements. 
Awards shall be made to the bidder or offeror whose bid or offer is 
responsive to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the 
recipient, price, quality and other factors considered. Solicitations 
shall clearly set forth all requirements that the bidder or offeror 
shall fulfill in order for the bid or offer to be evaluated by the 
recipient. Any and all bids or offers may be rejected when it is in the 
recipient's interest to do so.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.504  Procurement procedures.

    (a) All recipients shall establish written procurement procedures. 
These procedures shall provide for, at a minimum, that paragraphs 
(a)(1), (2) and (3) of this section apply.
    (1) Recipients avoid purchasing unnecessary items.
    (2) Where appropriate, an analysis is made of lease and purchase 
alternatives to determine which would be the most economical and 
practical procurement for the Federal Government.
    (3) Solicitations for goods and services provide for all of the 
following.
    (i) A clear and accurate description of the technical requirements 
for the material, product or service to be procured. In competitive 
procurements, such a description shall not contain features which unduly 
restrict competition.
    (ii) Requirements which the bidder/offeror must fulfill and all 
other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.
    (iii) A description, whenever practicable, of technical requirements 
in terms of functions to be performed or performance required, including 
the range of acceptable characteristics or minimum acceptable standards.
    (iv) The specific features of ``brand name or equal'' descriptions 
that bidders are required to meet when such items are included in the 
solicitation.
    (v) The acceptance, to the extent practicable and economically 
feasible,

[[Page 172]]

of products and services dimensioned in the metric system of 
measurement.
    (vi) Preference, to the extent practicable and economically 
feasible, for products and services that conserve natural resources and 
protect the environment and are energy efficient.
    (b) Positive efforts shall be made by recipients to utilize small 
businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises, 
whenever possible. Recipients of Federal awards shall take all of the 
following steps to further this goal.
    (1) Ensure that small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's 
business enterprises are used to the fullest extent practicable.
    (2) Make information on forthcoming opportunities available and 
arrange timeframes for purchases and contracts to encourage and 
facilitate participation by small businesses, minority-owned firms, and 
women's business enterprises.
    (3) Consider in the contract process whether firms competing for 
larger contracts intend to subcontract with small businesses, minority-
owned firms, and women's business enterprises.
    (4) Encourage contracting with consortiums of small businesses, 
minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises when a contract is 
too large for one of these firms to handle individually.
    (5) Use the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such 
organizations as the Small Business Administration and the Department of 
Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency in the solicitation and 
utilization of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's 
business enterprises.
    (c) The type of procuring instruments used (e.g., fixed price 
contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, purchase orders, and incentive 
contracts) shall be determined by the recipient but shall be appropriate 
for the particular procurement and for promoting the best interest of 
the program or project involved. The ``cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost'' 
or ``percentage of construction cost'' methods of contracting shall not 
be used.
    (d) Contracts shall be made only with responsible contractors who 
possess the potential ability to perform successfully under the terms 
and conditions of the proposed procurement. Consideration shall be given 
to such matters as contractor integrity, record of past performance, 
financial and technical resources or accessibility to other necessary 
resources. In certain circumstances, contracts with certain parties are 
restricted by agencies' implementation of E.O.s 12549 and 12689, 
``Debarment and Suspension.''
    (e) Recipients shall, on request, make available for the Federal 
awarding agency, pre-award review and procurement documents, such as 
request for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost 
estimates, etc., when any of the following conditions apply.
    (1) A recipient's procurement procedures or operation fails to 
comply with the procurement standards in the Federal awarding agency's 
implementation of this regulation.
    (2) The procurement is expected to exceed the small purchase 
threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403 (11) (currently $25,000) and is to be 
awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in 
response to a solicitation.
    (3) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the small purchase 
threshold, specifies a ``brand name'' product.
    (4) The proposed award over the small purchase threshold is to be 
awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under a sealed bid 
procurement.
    (5) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract 
or increases the contract amount by more than the amount of the small 
purchase threshold.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.505  Cost and price analysis.

    Some form of cost or price analysis shall be made and documented in 
the procurement files in connection with every procurement action. Price 
analysis may be accomplished in various ways, including the comparison 
of price quotations submitted, market prices and similar indicia, 
together with discounts. Cost analysis is the review and evaluation of 
each element of cost to determine reasonableness, allocability and 
allowability.

[[Page 173]]


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.506  Procurement records.

    Procurement records and files for purchases in excess of the small 
purchase threshold shall include the following at a minimum:
    (a) Basis for contractor selection,
    (b) Justification for lack of competition when competitive bids or 
offers are not obtained, and
    (c) Basis for award cost or price.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.507  Contract administration.

    A system for contract administration shall be maintained to ensure 
contractor conformance with the terms, conditions and specifications of 
the contract and to ensure adequate and timely follow up of all 
purchases. Recipients shall evaluate contractor performance and 
document, as appropriate, whether contractors have met the terms, 
conditions and specifications of the contract.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.508  Contract provisions.

    The recipient shall include, in addition to provisions to define a 
sound and complete agreement, the following provisions in all contracts. 
The following provisions shall also be applied to subcontracts.
    (a) Contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall 
contain contractual provisions or conditions that allow for 
administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances in which a 
contractor violates or breaches the contract terms, and provide for such 
remedial actions as may be appropriate.
    (b) All contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall 
contain suitable provisions for termination by the recipient, including 
the manner by which termination shall be effected and the basis for 
settlement. In addition, such contracts shall describe conditions under 
which the contract may be terminated for default as well as conditions 
where the contract may be terminated because of circumstances beyond the 
control of the contractor.
    (c) Except as otherwise required by statute, an award that requires 
the contracting (or subcontracting) for construction or facility 
improvements shall provide for the recipient to follow its own 
requirements relating to bid guarantees, performance bonds, and payment 
bonds unless the construction contract or subcontract exceeds $100,000. 
For those contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000, the Federal 
awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the 
recipient, provided the Federal awarding agency has made a determination 
that the Federal Government's interest is adequately protected. If such 
a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements shall be as 
follows.
    (1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of 
the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist of a firm commitment 
such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument 
accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder shall, upon acceptance 
of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within 
the time specified.
    (2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent 
of the contract price. A ``performance bond'' is one executed in 
connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's 
obligations under such contract.
    (3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of 
the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed in connection 
with a contract to assure payment as required by statute of all persons 
supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for 
in the contract.
    (4) Where bonds are required in the situations described herein, the 
bonds shall be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority 
as acceptable sureties pursuant to 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety Companies 
Doing Business with the United States.''
    (d) All negotiated contracts (except those for less than the small 
purchase threshold) awarded by recipients shall include a provision to 
the effect that the recipient, the Federal awarding agency, the 
Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly 
authorized representatives, shall have access to any books, documents, 
papers and records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to a 
specific program for the purpose of making audits, examinations, 
excerpts and transcriptions.

[[Page 174]]

    (e) All contracts, including small purchases, awarded by recipients 
and their contractors shall contain the procurement provisions of 
appendix A to this part, as applicable.


<R04>
     Subpart 105-72.60--Post-Award Requirements/Reports and Records


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.600  Purpose of reports and records.

    Sections 105-72.601 through 105-72.603 set forth the procedures for 
monitoring and reporting on the recipient's financial and program 
performance and the necessary standard reporting forms. They also set 
forth record retention requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.601  Monitoring and reporting program performance.

    (a) Recipients are responsible for managing and monitoring each 
project, program, subaward, function or activity supported by the award. 
Recipients shall monitor subawards to ensure subrecipients have met the 
audit requirements as delineated in Sec. 105-72.306.
    (b) The Federal awarding agency shall prescribe the frequency with 
which the performance reports shall be submitted. Except as provided in 
paragraph (f) of this section, performance reports shall not be required 
more frequently than quarterly or, less frequently than annually. Annual 
reports shall be due 90 calendar days after the grant year; quarterly or 
semiannual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. The 
Federal awarding agency may require annual reports before the 
anniversary dates of multiple year awards in lieu of these requirements. 
The final performance reports are due 90 calendar days after the 
expiration or termination of the award.
    (c) If inappropriate, a final technical or performance report shall 
not be required after completion of the project.
    (d) When required, performance reports shall generally contain, for 
each award, brief information on each of the following.
    (1) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals and 
objectives established for the period, the findings of the investigator, 
or both. Whenever appropriate and the output of programs or projects can 
be readily quantified, such quantitative data should be related to cost 
data for computation of unit costs.
    (2) Reasons why established goals were not met, if appropriate.
    (3) Other pertinent information including, when appropriate, 
analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.
    (e) Recipients shall not be required to submit more than the 
original and two copies of performance reports.
    (f) Recipients shall immediately notify the Federal awarding agency 
of developments that have a significant impact on the award-supported 
activities. Also, notification shall be given in the case of problems, 
delays, or adverse conditions which materially impair the ability to 
meet the objectives of the award. This notification shall include a 
statement of the action taken or contemplated, and any assistance needed 
to resolve the situation.
    (g) Federal awarding agencies may make site visits, as needed.
    (h) Federal awarding agencies shall comply with clearance 
requirements of 5 CFR part 1320 when requesting performance data from 
recipients.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.602  Financial reporting.

    (a) The following forms or such other forms as may be approved by 
OMB are authorized for obtaining financial information from recipients.
    (1) SF-269 or SF-269A, Financial Status Report. (i) Each Federal 
awarding agency shall require recipients to use the SF-269 or SF-269A to 
report the status of funds for all nonconstruction projects or programs. 
A Federal awarding agency may, however, have the option of not requiring 
the SF-269 or SF-269A when the SF-270, Request for Advance or 
Reimbursement, or SF-272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions, is 
determined to provide adequate information to meet its needs, except 
that a final SF-269 or SF-269A shall be required at the completion of 
the project when the SF-270 is used only for advances.
    (ii) The Federal awarding agency shall prescribe whether the report 
shall be on a cash or accrual basis. If the Federal awarding agency 
requires accrual information and the recipient's

[[Page 175]]

accounting records are not normally kept on the accrual basis, the 
recipient shall not be required to convert its accounting system, but 
shall develop such accrual information through best estimates based on 
an analysis of the documentation on hand.
    (iii) The Federal awarding agency shall determine the frequency of 
the Financial Status Report for each project or program, considering the 
size and complexity of the particular project or program. However, the 
report shall not be required more frequently than quarterly or less 
frequently than annually. A final report shall be required at the 
completion of the agreement.
    (iv) The Federal awarding agency shall require recipients to submit 
the SF-269 or SF-269A (an original and no more than two copies) no later 
than 30 days after the end of each specified reporting period for 
quarterly and semiannual reports, and 90 calendar days for annual and 
final reports. Extensions of reporting due dates may be approved by the 
Federal awarding agency upon request of the recipient.
    (2) SF-272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions. (i) When funds are 
advanced to recipients the Federal awarding agency shall require each 
recipient to submit the SF-272 and, when necessary, its continuation 
sheet, SF-272a. The Federal awarding agency shall use this report to 
monitor cash advanced to recipients and to obtain disbursement 
information for each agreement with the recipients.
    (ii) Federal awarding agencies may require forecasts of Federal cash 
requirements in the ``Remarks'' section of the report.
    (iii) When practical and deemed necessary, Federal awarding agencies 
may require recipients to report in the ``Remarks'' section the amount 
of cash advances received in excess of three days. Recipients shall 
provide short narrative explanations of actions taken to reduce the 
excess balances.
    (iv) Recipients shall be required to submit not more than the 
original and two copies of the SF-272, 15 calendar days following the 
end of each quarter. The Federal awarding agencies may require a monthly 
report from those recipients receiving advances totaling $1 million or 
more per year.
    (v) Federal awarding agencies may waive the requirement for 
submission of the SF-272 for any one of the following reasons:
    (A) When monthly advances do not exceed $25,000 per recipient, 
provided that such advances are monitored through other forms contained 
in this section;
    (B) If, in the Federal awarding agency's opinion, the recipient's 
accounting controls are adequate to minimize excessive Federal advances; 
or,
    (C) When the electronic payment mechanisms provide adequate data.
    (b) When the Federal awarding agency needs additional information or 
more frequent reports, the following shall be observed.
    (1) When additional information is needed to comply with legislative 
requirements, Federal awarding agencies shall issue instructions to 
require recipients to submit such information under the ``Remarks'' 
section of the reports.
    (2) When a Federal awarding agency determines that a recipient's 
accounting system does not meet the standards in Sec. 105-72.301, 
additional pertinent information to further monitor awards may be 
obtained upon written notice to the recipient until such time as the 
system is brought up to standard. The Federal awarding agency, in 
obtaining this information, shall comply with report clearance 
requirements of 5 CFR part 1320.
    (3) Federal awarding agencies are encouraged to shade out any line 
item on any report if not necessary.
    (4) Federal awarding agencies may accept the identical information 
from the recipients in machine readable format or computer printouts or 
electronic outputs in lieu of prescribed formats.
    (5) Federal awarding agencies may provide computer or electronic 
outputs to recipients when such expedites or contributes to the accuracy 
of reporting.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.603  Retention and access requirements for records.

    (a) This section sets forth requirements for record retention and 
access

[[Page 176]]

to records for awards to recipients. Federal awarding agencies shall not 
impose any other record retention or access requirements upon 
recipients.
    (b) Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, 
and all other records pertinent to an award shall be retained for a 
period of three years from the date of submission of the final 
expenditure report or, for awards that are renewed quarterly or 
annually, from the date of the submission of the quarterly or annual 
financial report, as authorized by the Federal awarding agency. The only 
exceptions are the following.
    (1) If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the 
expiration of the 3-year period, the records shall be retained until all 
litigation, claims or audit findings involving the records have been 
resolved and final action taken.
    (2) Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal 
funds shall be retained for 3 years after final disposition.
    (3) When records are transferred to or maintained by the Federal 
awarding agency, the 3-year retention requirement is not applicable to 
the recipient.
    (4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc., as 
specified in paragraph (g) of this section.
    (c) Copies of original records may be substituted for the original 
records if authorized by the Federal awarding agency.
    (d) The Federal awarding agency shall request transfer of certain 
records to its custody from recipients when it determines that the 
records possess long term retention value. However, in order to avoid 
duplicate recordkeeping, a Federal awarding agency may make arrangements 
for recipients to retain any records that are continuously needed for 
joint use.
    (e) The Federal awarding agency, the Inspector General, Comptroller 
General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized 
representatives, have the right of timely and unrestricted access to any 
books, documents, papers, or other records of recipients that are 
pertinent to the awards, in order to make audits, examinations, 
excerpts, transcripts and copies of such documents. This right also 
includes timely and reasonable access to a recipient's personnel for the 
purpose of interview and discussion related to such documents. The 
rights of access in this paragraph are not limited to the required 
retention period, but shall last as long as records are retained.
    (f) Unless required by statute, no Federal awarding agency shall 
place restrictions on recipients that limit public access to the records 
of recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when the Federal 
awarding agency can demonstrate that such records shall be kept 
confidential and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to 
the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if the records had 
belonged to the Federal awarding agency.
    (g) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. 
Paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) apply to the following types of documents, 
and their supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or 
proposals, cost allocation plans, and any similar accounting 
computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is 
chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe 
benefit rates).
    (1) If submitted for negotiation. If the recipient submits to the 
Federal awarding agency or the subrecipient submits to the recipient the 
proposal, plan, or other computation to form the basis for negotiation 
of the rate, then the 3-year retention period for its supporting records 
starts on the date of such submission.
    (2) If not submitted for negotiation. If the recipient is not 
required to submit to the Federal awarding agency or the subrecipient is 
not required to submit to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other 
computation for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year retention period 
for the proposal, plan, or other computation and its supporting records 
starts at the end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) 
covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.

 Subpart 105-72.70--Post-Award Requirements/Termination and Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.700  Purpose of termination and enforcement.

    Section 105-72.701 and Sec. 105-72.702 set forth uniform suspension, 
termination and enforcement procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.701  Termination.

    (a) Awards may be terminated in whole or in part only if paragraph 
(a)(1), (2) or (3) of this section apply.
    (1) By the Federal awarding agency, if a recipient materially fails 
to comply with the terms and conditions of an award.
    (2) By the Federal awarding agency with the consent of the 
recipient, in which case the two parties shall agree upon the 
termination conditions, including the effective date and, in the case of 
partial termination, the portion to be terminated.
    (3) By the recipient upon sending to the Federal awarding agency 
written notification setting forth the reasons for such termination, the 
effective date, and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to 
be terminated. However, if the Federal awarding agency determines in the 
case of partial termination that the reduced or modified portion of the 
grant will not accomplish the purposes for which the grant was made, it 
may terminate the grant in its entirety under either paragraphs (a) (1) 
or (2).
    (b) If costs are allowed under an award, the responsibilities of the 
recipient referred to in Sec. 105-72.801(a), including those for 
property management as applicable, shall be considered in the 
termination of the award, and provision shall be made for continuing 
responsibilities of the recipient after termination, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.702  Enforcement.

    (a) Remedies for noncompliance. If a recipient materially fails to 
comply with the terms and conditions of an award, whether stated in a 
Federal statute, regulation, assurance, application, or notice of award, 
the Federal awarding agency may, in addition to imposing any of the 
special conditions outlined in Sec. 105-72.204, take one or more of the 
following actions, as appropriate in the circumstances.
    (1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the 
deficiency by the recipient or more severe enforcement action by the 
Federal awarding agency.
    (2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable 
matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action 
not in compliance.
    (3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award.
    (4) Withhold further awards for the project or program.
    (5) Take other remedies that may be legally available.
    (b) Hearings and appeals. In taking an enforcement action, the 
awarding agency shall provide the recipient an opportunity for hearing, 
appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the recipient is 
entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the action 
involved.
    (c) Effects of suspension and termination. Costs of a recipient 
resulting from obligations incurred by the recipient during a suspension 
or after termination of an award are not allowable unless the awarding 
agency expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or 
termination or subsequently. Other recipient costs during suspension or 
after termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are 
allowable if paragraph (c) (1) and (2) of this section apply.
    (1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred 
by the recipient before the effective date of suspension or termination, 
are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are 
noncancellable.
    (2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or 
expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the 
termination takes effect.
    (d) Relationship to debarment and suspension. The enforcement 
remedies identified in this section, including suspension and 
termination, do not preclude a recipient from being subject to debarment 
and suspension under E.O.s 12549 and 12689 and the Federal awarding 
agency implementing regulations (see Sec. 105-72.203).

             Subpart 105-72.80--After-the-Award Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.800  Purpose.

    Sections 105-72.801 through 105-72.803 contain closeout procedures 
and other procedures for subsequent disallowances and adjustments.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.801  Closeout procedures.

    (a) Recipients shall submit, within 90 calendar days after the date 
of completion of the award, all financial, performance, and other 
reports as required by the terms and conditions of the award. The 
Federal awarding agency may approve extensions when requested by the 
recipient.
    (b) Unless the Federal awarding agency authorizes an extension, a 
recipient shall liquidate all obligations incurred under the award not 
later than 90 calendar days after the funding period or the date of 
completion as specified in the terms and conditions of the award or in 
agency implementing instructions.
    (c) The Federal awarding agency shall make prompt payments to a 
recipient for allowable reimbursable costs under the award being closed 
out.
    (d) The recipient shall promptly refund any balances of unobligated 
cash that the Federal awarding agency has advanced or paid and that is 
not authorized to be retained by the recipient for use in other 
projects. OMB Circular A-129 governs unreturned amounts that become 
delinquent debts.
    (e) When authorized by the terms and conditions of the award, the 
Federal awarding agency shall make a settlement for any upward or 
downward adjustments to the Federal share of costs after closeout 
reports are received.
    (f) The recipient shall account for any real and personal property 
acquired with Federal funds or received from the Federal Government in 
accordance with Sec. 105-72.401 through Sec. 105-72.407.
    (g) In the event a final audit has not been performed prior to the 
closeout of an award, the Federal awarding agency shall retain the right 
to recover an appropriate amount after fully considering the 
recommendations on disallowed costs resulting from the final audit.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.802  Subsequent adjustments and continuing responsibilities.

    (a) The closeout of an award does not affect any of the following.
    (1) The right of the Federal awarding agency to disallow costs and 
recover funds on the basis of a later audit or other review.
    (2) The obligation of the recipient to return any funds due as a 
result of later refunds, corrections, or other transactions.
    (3) Audit requirements in Sec. 105-72.306.
    (4) Property management requirements in Sec. 105-72.401 through 
Sec. 105-72.407.
    (5) Records retention as required in Sec. 105-72.603.
    (b) After closeout of an award, a relationship created under an 
award may be modified or ended in whole or in part with the consent of 
the Federal awarding agency and the recipient, provided the 
responsibilities of the recipient referred to in Sec. 105-72.803(a), 
including those for property management as applicable, are considered 
and provisions made for continuing responsibilities of the recipient, as 
appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.803  Collection of amounts due.

    (a) Any funds paid to a recipient in excess of the amount to which 
the recipient is finally determined to be entitled under the terms and 
conditions of the award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. If 
not paid within a reasonable period after the demand for payment, the 
Federal awarding agency may reduce the debt by paragraph (a) (1), (2) or 
(3) of this section.
    (1) Making an administrative offset against other requests for 
reimbursements.
    (2) Withholding advance payments otherwise due to the recipient.
    (3) Taking other action permitted by statute.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided by law, the Federal awarding agency 
shall charge interest on an overdue debt in accordance with 4 CFR 
Chapter II, Federal Claims Collection Standards.

    1. Equal Employment Opportunity--All contracts shall contain a 
provision requiring compliance with E.O. 11246, ``Equal Employment 
Opportunity,'' as amended by E.O. 11375, ``Amending Executive Order 
11246 Relating to Equal Employment Opportunity,'' and as supplemented by 
regulations at 41 CFR part 60, ``Office of Federal Contract Compliance 
Programs, Equal Employment Opportunity, Department of Labor.''
    2. Copeland ``Anti-Kickback'' Act (18 U.S.C. 874 and 40 U.S.C. 
276c)--All contracts and subgrants in excess of $2000 for construction 
or repair awarded by recipients and subrecipients shall include a 
provision for compliance with the Copeland ``Anti-Kickback'' Act (18 
U.S.C. 874), as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR 
part 3, ``Contractors and Subcontractors on Public Building or Public 
Work Financed in Whole or in Part by Loans or Grants from the United 
States''). The Act provides that each contractor or subrecipient shall 
be prohibited from inducing, by any means, any person employed in the 
construction, completion, or repair of public work, to give up any part 
of the compensation to which he is otherwise entitled. The recipient 
shall report all suspected or reported violations to the Federal 
awarding agency.
    3. Davis-Bacon Act, as amended (40 U.S.C. 276a to a-7)--When

awarded by the recipients and subrecipients of more than $2000 shall 
include a provision for compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 
276a to a-7) and as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29

contract shall be conditioned upon the acceptance of the wage 
determination. The recipient shall report all suspected or reported 
violations to the Federal awarding agency.
    4. Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-
333)--Where applicable, all contracts awarded by recipients in excess of 
$2000 for construction contracts and in excess of $2500 for other

Section 102 of the Act, each contractor shall be required to compute the 
wages of every mechanic and laborer on the basis of a standard work week 
of 40 hours. Work in excess of the standard work week is permissible 
provided that the worker is compensated at a rate of not less than 1\1/

Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), as amended--Contracts 
and subgrants of amounts in excess of $100,000 shall contain a provision 
that requires the recipient to agree to comply with all applicable 
standards, orders or regulations issued pursuant to the Clean Air Act 
(42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as 
amended (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.). Violations shall be reported to the 
Federal awarding agency and the Regional Office of the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA).
    7. Byrd Anti-Lobbying Amendment (31 U.S.C. 1352)--Contractors who

employee of any agency, a member of Congress, officer or employee of 
Congress, or an employee of a member of Congress in connection with 
obtaining any Federal contract, grant or any other award covered by 31 
U.S.C. 1352. Each tier shall also disclose any lobbying with non-Federal 
funds that takes place in connection with obtaining any Federal award.

<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5100  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart provides guidance on DOE standards and practices to be 
applied in the management of Government personal property.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5101  Definition.

    Sensitive items are those items of property, regardless of value, 
which are considered to be susceptible to being appropriated for 
personal use or which can be readily converted to cash, for example: 
firearms, portable photographic equipment, binoculars, portable tape 
recorders, portable calculators, and portable power tools.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5102  Official use of property.

    Property shall be used only in the performance of official work of 
the United States Government, except (a) in emergencies threatening loss 
of life or property, or (b) as otherwise authorized by law and approved 
by the Director of Administration and heads of field offices for their 
respective organizations, or by the contracting officer for contractor-
held property.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5103  Maximum use of property.

    Property management practices shall assure that the best possible 
use is made of property. Supplies and equipment shall be generally 
limited to those items essential for carrying out the programs of DOE 
effectively. Adequate staff review shall be made of operating programs 
to coordinate and plan future supply activities and to assure against 
overstocking, waste, and improper use of property.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5104  Loan of property.

    (a) Property which would otherwise be out of service for temporary 
periods (and not excess) may be loaned to other DOE offices and 
contractors, other Federal agencies, and to others for official 
purposes. Such loans shall be covered by written agreements or 
memorandum receipts which shall include all terms of the loan (such as 
loan period, delivery time, method of payment of transportation, point 
of delivery and return, conditions of use, responsibilities of the 
borrower for condition of property on return, inspection requirements, 
etc.) that may be required to ensure proper control and protect DOE's 
interest. The loan period should not exceed one year, but may be 
renewed.
    (b) Requests for loan by foreign Governments and other foreign 
organizations shall be submitted through the Property and Equipment 
Management Division (MA-422) to the Assistant Secretary for 
International Affairs for approval, with a copy to the cognizant 
Headquarters program office.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5105  Borrowing of property.

    (a) DOE organizations and contractors are encouraged to borrow 
property within DOE to further DOE programs.

[[Page 189]]

Property classified as ``Equipment Held For Future Projects (EHFFP)'' or 
as ``In Standby'' should be reviewed by those receiving availability 
inquiries for short-term loans (one year or less). Borrowing of 
Government property from other Federal agencies is also encouraged when 
required for short periods of time. Such transactions shall be covered 
by written agreements which include all the terms of the transaction.
    (b) In determining whether it is practical and economical to borrow 
property, consideration shall be given to suitability, condition, value, 
extent and nature of use, extent of availability, portability, cost of 
transportation, and other similar factors.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5106  Control of property.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5106-1  Identification marking of property.

    (a) Government property will be identified as U.S. Government 
property subject to the criteria below. Marking may be accomplished by 
any means which will produce a permanent marking and which is most 
adaptable to the particular item of property.
    (1) Capitalized and sensitive property shall be marked as U.S. 
Government property and by numbering for control purposes.
    (2) Other property susceptible to unauthorized personal use, such as 
hand tools, should be considered for marking as U.S. Government 
property, and by numbering for control purposes.
    (b) Property which by its nature cannot be marked, such as stores 
items, metal stock, etc., is exempted from this requirement. Such 
Government property in the custody of contractors should not be 
commingled with contractor-owned property unless it is determined by the 
contracting officer to be advantageous to the Government.
    (c) To the extent practicable and economical, markings shall be 
removed prior to disposal outside of DOE, or additional markings may be 
added to indicate such disposal.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5106-2  Segregation of property.

    Ordinarily, provisions shall be made for the contractor to keep 
Government property segregated from contrator-owned property. 
Commingling of Government-owned and contractor-owned property may be 
allowed only when--
    (a) The segregation of the property would materially hinder the 
progress of the work, i.e., segregation is not feasible for reasons such 
as small quantities, lack of space, or increased costs; and
    (b) Control procedures are adequate, i.e., the Government property 
is specifically marked or otherwise identified as being Government 
property.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5106-3  Physical protection of property.

    Controls such as property pass systems, memorandum records, regular 
or intermittent gate checks, marking of tools, and perimeter fencing 
shall be established as required to prevent loss, theft, or unauthorized 
movement of property from the premises on which such property is 
located.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5106-4  Control of sensitive items.

    (a) Controls shall be established over the acquisition, storage, 
issue, use, and return of sensitive items of property.
    (b) Items on capital equipment which are also designated as 
sensitive items will be controlled as sensitive items and as capital 
equipment.
    (c) A list of sensitive items shall be maintained for property 
considered to require special controls before and after issue. 
Determination of specific sensitive items shall be a matter for 
management judgment at individual locations, taking into consideration 
the dollar value of the items to be controlled and costs of 
administration.
    (d) Written procedures shall be established for control of sensitive 
items, to include:
    (1) Approval of purchase requisitions or issue documents at an 
appropriate supervisory level prior to acquisition or issue;
    (2) Establishment of administrative controls in the central 
receiving and warehousing department. Such controls should include 
extraordinary physical protection, guidance for receiving and 
warehousing personnel as to procedures for protection, and a current 
listing of sensitive items;

[[Page 190]]

    (3) Establishment and maintenance of appropriate property management 
records;
    (4) Requirements for tagging and identification;
    (5) Use of memorandum receipts or custody documents at time of 
assignment or change in custody;
    (6) Establishment of custodial responsibilities describing--
    (i) Need for extraordinary physical protection;
    (ii) Requirement for prompt reporting of apparent loss, damage or 
destruction;
    (iii) Requirement to return items in condition beyond economical 
repair to an appropriate organizational element;
    (iv) Requirement for promptly reporting changes in custody or 
extended loans;
    (v) Reminder of prohibition of use for other than official purposes, 
and penalties for misuse;
    (vi) Requirement for effective physical and administrative control 
of sensitive items assigned for general use within an organizational 
unit as appropriate to the type of property and the circumstances; and
    (vii) A clear definition of the extent of responsibility or 
financial accountability, depending on contractor policy.
    (7) Requirement for annual physical inventory;
    (8) Requirement for prompt and thorough investigation of losses;
    (9) Requirement for an employee transfer or termination checkout 
procedure and examination and adjustment of records; and
    (10) Other property management procedures which, through experience 
and independent audit, have demonstrated effective physical and 
administrative control over sensitive items.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5106-5  Physical inventories.

    (a) Physical inventories of property shall be conducted at all DOE 
and contractor locations, consistent with approved procedures and 
generally accepted accounting procedures.
    (b) The preferred method of performing physical inventories is by 
the use of personnel other than the property staff or custodian of the 
property. Where staffing restraints or other considerations require, the 
inventory may be performed by the property staff or the custodian.
    (c) Detailed procedures for the taking of physical inventories shall 
be developed for each DOE organization and contractor. The Director of 
Administration and heads of field offices shall approve the procedures 
for their respective DOE operation. The appropriate field organization 
staff shall review and approve contractor's procedures.
    (d) The taking of a physical inventory will be observed, or follow-
on audits made, by independent representatives, e.g., finance, audit, or 
property staffs, to the extent deemed necessary to assure that the 
procedures are being followed and the results are accurate. These 
observations or audits should be documented and the documentation should 
be retained in the inventory record file.
    (e) Procedures that are limited to a check-off of a listing of 
recorded property without actual verification of the location and 
existence of such property do not meet the requirements of a physical 
inventory.
    (f) The frequency of physical inventories shall be as follows:
    (1) Moveable capital equipment--not less frequently than every two 
years.
    (2) Sensitive items--not less frequently than every twelve months.
    (3) Stores inventories--not less frequently than every twelve 
months.
    (4) Precious metals--not less frequently than every six months.
    (g) A physical inventory shall be performed at intervals more 
frequently than required in Sec. 109-1.5106-5(f) whenever experience at 
any given location or with any given item or items indicates that this 
action is necessary for effective property accounting, utilization, or 
control.
    (h) Special inventories may be required on certain types of property 
or on certain items or kinds of items when circumstances arise requiring 
such action, such as audits or special reviews.
    (i) The results of physical inventories shall be reconciled with the 
property records and, except for non-capital sensitive items, with the 
financial control accounts in accordance with Chapter

[[Page 191]]

VI of the DOE Accounting Practices and Procedures Handbook.
    (j) Physical inventories of capital equipment and stores inventories 
may be conducted by the ``statistical sampling'' method in lieu of the 
normal ``wall-to-wall'' method. In addition, the ``inventory by 
exception'' method may be used for capital equipment physical 
inventories. However, the system and procedures for taking physical 
inventories by these methods must be fully documented and approved by 
the Director of Administration and by heads of field offices for their 
respective organizations.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5107  Retirement of property.

    When Government property is worn out, lost, stolen, destroyed, 
abandoned, or damaged beyond economical repair, it shall be listed on a 
retirement work order. A full explanation shall be supported by an 
investigation, if necessary, as to the date and circumstances 
surrounding loss, theft, destruction, abandonment, or damage. The 
retirement work order shall be reviewed by the property management staff 
and signed by the responsible official initiating the report and 
reviewed and approved by an official at least one supervisory echelon 
above the official initiating the report.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5108  Property belonging to others.

    Procedures shall be established which will provide for adequate 
attention to the management of property belonging to other Federal 
agencies in the possession or custody of DOE organizations or its 
contractors.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5109  Employee participation.

    Full advantage shall be taken of suitable methods for stimulating 
employee participation and cooperation in carrying out an effective and 
economical program of property management. Some examples of effective 
methods are (a) indoctrination of new employees and others who have 
access to or use property, (b) the use of incentive award plans to 
promote interest, and (c) the use of visual aids such as posters, plant 
publications, outdoor signboards, and displays to keep employees 
informed as to progress and to remind them of their responsibilities.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5110  Use of non-government-owned property.

    Non-government-owned personal property shall not be installed in, 
affixed to, or otherwise made a part thereof, of any Government-owned 
personal or real property. This restriction does not apply to the use 
and installation of privately owned decorative items or memorabilia to 
the workplace, provided that the structure or safety of the facility is 
not thereby degraded.

<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5200  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes policy and responsibilities for the 
establishment, maintenance, review and appraisal of a contractor's 
program and system for the management of Government personal property.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5201  Policy.

    (a) Contractors shall establish, maintain, and administer a program 
for the effective management of Government personal property consistent 
with the terms of the contract and directives for the contracting 
officer.
    (b) Contractors shall maintain their personal property management 
systems in writing on a current basis.
    (c) Contractors shall require those subcontractors provided 
Government property under the prime contract to establish and maintain a 
system for the management of such property. Procedures for assuring 
effective property management shall be included in the contractor's 
property control system. As a minimum, a subcontractor's system for

    (6) Reporting, redistribution, and disposal of excess and surplus 
property.
    (7) A retirement work order procedure to account for property that 
is worn out, lost, stolen, destroyed, abandoned, or damaged beyond 
economical repair.
    (8) Periodic reporting, including physical inventory results and, at 
least annually, the total acquisition cost of Government property in the 
possession of the subcontractor.
    (9) An internal surveillance system, including periodic reviews, to 
ensure that property is being managed in accordance with established 
procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5202  Designation of property administrator.

    The contracting officer shall designate a property administrator to 
be responsible for property administration. This property administrator 
will be delegated the authority to assist the contracting officer on all 
matters involving the Government-owned personal property held by the 
contractor. If a property administrator has not been designated, the 
contracting officer is the property administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5203  Review and approval of contractor's property management system.

    (a) A contractor's property management system should be reviewed by 
the property administrator within one year after the execution date of 
the contract, and the property administrator shall approve or disapprove 
the system in writing. If the system is disapproved, the property 
administrator shall advise the contractor, in writing, of deficiencies 
that need to be corrected, and a time schedule established for 
completion of the corrective actions.
    (b) The purpose of the review is to determine whether the system 
will adequately protect, maintain, utilize, and

[[Page 193]]

dispose of Government personal property in accordance with the FPMR, the 
DOE-PMR, and applicable DOE directives.
    (c) Appropriate follow-up will be made by the property administrator 
to ensure that corrective actions are taken.
    (d) Any change to the approved property management system made after 
the original review and approval should be reviewed by the property 
administrator at the earliest possible time. Such changes should then be 
approved/disapproved by the property administrator as appropriate.


<R05>

shall make an appraisal of the property management operation of the 
contractor. The appraisal may be based on a formal in-depth appraisal 
on-site or a series of formal appraisals of the functional segments of 
the contractor's property management system to determine if the 
contractor is managing the Government personal property in its custody 
in accordance with its previously approved policies and procedures, the 
FPMR, the DOE-PMR, and applicable DOE directives. The property 
administrator shall bring deficiencies in the contractor's property 
management operation to the attention of the contractor's management for 
correction.
    (b) Appropriate follow-up will be made by the property administrator 
to ensure that corrective actions are taken.

number and location of potential users and distances involved.
    (c) In accordance with FPMR Sec. 101-25.109-2(c), surveys of 
equipment holdings should be conducted periodically to determine those 
items which are suitable for pooling. Criteria for placing an item in a 
pool should include (but not be limited to) the following: The item is 
suitable for use by more than one individual or group; its use is 
intermittent rather than full time; it has a degree of portability; and 
it has sufficient cost or value to merit controlling. It is anticipated 
that items pooled would vary from one activity to another due to local 
conditions, and each activity should develop its own criteria for items 
to be pooled. Items to be considered for pooling include (but are not 
limited to) certain types of measuring and recording equipment, pumps, 
electric motors, photographic equipment, portable tools, microscopes, 
portable radios, power supplies, amplifiers, business machines, 
radiation detection instruments, and construction and automotive 
equipment. Where feasible, equipment pools should be combined with 
existing calibration and maintenance services to foster use and control 
of pooled equipment.
    (d) Records of usage shall be maintained to permit the evaluation of 
need for quantities and types of equipment in pools. Reviews of usage 
should be conducted periodically (at least annually) to eliminate items 
which are no longer required. Heads of field offices shall require DOE 
and contractor facilities to submit to them annually the report on the 
use and effectiveness of equipment pooling required by FPMR Sec. 101-
25.109-2(d).
    (e) Heads of field offices and contracting officers shall require 
periodic independent reviews of equipment pool

agreement with GSA, the DOE Supply Activity Report is prepared at 
Headquarters from supply management data available in DOE's financial 
reports and is sent to GSA by the Property and Equipment Management 
Division (MA-422). Therefore, no additional reports are required from 
those field organizations or contractors reporting under the DOE 
financial reporting system. Those activities with stores operations 
which do not report under the DOE financial reporting system shall 
submit Supply Activity Reports to the Property and Equipment Management 
Division (MA-422) by November 15 for inclusion in the Departmental 
report.

<R05>
Sec. 109-27.000  Scope of part.

    This part implements and supplements FPMR Part 101-27, Inventory 
Management, but excludes atomic weapons or byproducts and source or 
special nuclear materials as defined in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 
as amended, enriched uranium in stockpile storage, and petroleum in the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the Naval Petroleum Reserves.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.001-50  Definitions.

    As used in this part the following definitions apply:
    (a) Construction inventories are supplies, materials and parts held 
for exclusive use on construction projects.
    (b) Economic order quality (EOQ) means the size of the order which 
produces a level at which the combined costs of procuring and carrying 
inventory are at a minimum.
    (c) Expensed inventories are items for which the cost is charged to 
operations and are not under financial control.
    (d) Inventories are stocks of stores, construction, special reactor 
and other special materials, supplies and parts used in support of DOE 
programs.
    (e) Inventory level, usually expressed in the number of months 
supply on hand based on anticipated usage, is the amount of supplies 
authorized to be on hand and due-in less any amount due-out.
    (f) Inventory management means the effective use of methods, 
procedures and techniques for recording, analyzing, and adjusting 
inventories in accordance with established policy. The following related 
functions are included:
    (1) Providing adequate protection against misuse, theft, and 
misappropriation.
    (2) Providing accurate analyses of quantities to determine 
requirements so that only minimal obsolescence losses will be 
encountered, while ensuring adequate inventory levels to meet program 
schedules.
    (3) Providing adequate and accessible storage facilities and 
services based upon analyses of program requirements so that a minimum 
and economical amount of time is required to service the program.
    (g) Other special materials include precious metals and other rare 
materials having a very high monetary value in relation to volume or 
weight, special barrier materials, and any others that have been 
specifically approved by the DOE Controller.
    (h) Physical inventory means the process of counting the quantities 
of items on hand and reconciling quantities

[[Page 201]]

counted with the quantities shown on control records.
    (i) Quantity control means the management of inventories through 
control of levels, determination of requirements, and replenishment of 
stock.
    (j) Safety stock is that portion of inventories under stock control 
carried for protection against stock depletion due to an increase in 
demand or when lead time is greater than anticipated.
    (k) Shop, bench, cupboard or site stock is a collection or store of 
materials located at or near the point of use.
    (l) Special reactor materials include special materials approved for 
research and for use in reactors but not generally available through the 
usual channels in sufficient quantity because of limited commercial 
production applications.
    (m) Standardization is the reduction of stores inventories to the 
least practicable variety of sizes, shapes and materials compatible with 
program needs.
    (n) Stock record is a device for collecting, storing, and providing 
historical data on recurring transactions for each line item of 
inventory. The stock record of a line item may be a visible register of 
transactions recorded by hand or by machine for that item, or it may be 
the input, output, stored data, or the corresponding print-out of such 
data representing transactions on the item in an electronic data 
processing system.
    (o) Stores catalog means a listing of stock items for use in 
requisitioning supplies and materials.
    (p) Sub-store is a geographically removed part of the main store's 
operation conducted as a subordinate element of it and subject to the 
same management policies and inventory controls.


<R04>
                  Subpart 109-27.1--Stock Replenishment


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.102-2  Guidelines.

    Procedures and practices shall provide for replenishment of stock 
items having recurring demands to minimize costs involved. When 
considered more suitable, contractors may use other generally accepted 
approaches to EOQ.

<R04>
   Subpart 109-27.50--Inventory Management Policies, Procedures, and 
                               Guidelines


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5001  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart supplements FPMR Part 101-27 by providing additional 
policies, principles and guidelines for the economical and efficient 
management of inventories in support of DOE programs.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5002  Objectives.

    Necessary inventories shall be established and maintained at 
reasonable levels, consistent with program requirements. They shall be 
managed and controlled in the most practicable and economical manner 
consistent with

[[Page 202]]

program needs, applicable laws and regulations and the following 
objectives:
    (a) Provide materials and supplies as needed to meet DOE 
requirements.
    (b) Maintain reasonable inventory levels.
    (c) Provide adequate safeguards for protection.
    (d) Maintain adequate quantity controls for effective management 
over all inventories, including those not under financial controls.
    (e) Assure maximum efficient utilization and avoid waste.
    (f) Maintain an economical operation.
    (g) Standardize inventories to the greatest extent practicable.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5003  Stores inventory turnover ratio.

    Comparison of investment in stores inventories to annual issues 
shall be made to assure that minimum inventories are maintained for the 
support of programs. This comparison may be expressed either as a 
turnover ratio (issues divided by dollar value of inventory) or in the 
average number of month's supply on hand. Turnover or number of month's 
supply is calculated only on ``current-use'' inventory. Performance 
goals, i.e., a six months investment or a turnover ratio of 2.0, shall 
be established for each stores using activity. However, it is recognized 
that extenuating operating circumstances may preclude the achievement of 
such objectives.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5004  Stock control.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5004-1  General.

    Stock control shall be maintained on the basis of stock record 
accounts of inventories on hand, on order, received, issued, and 
disposed of, and supported by proper documents in evidence of these 
transactions. Stock record accounts shall be available for review and 
inspection.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5004-2  Construction inventories.

    Stock control from construction inventories shall be maintained by 
the regular checking of individual items to assure that the quantities 
ordered plus amounts on hand do not exceed current job requirements. To 
test the effectiveness of such checks, they should be supplemented with 
DOE reviews of inventory items on a selective basis at approximately the 
25 percent, 50 percent, and 75 percent construction completion stages. 
Undelivered portions of purchase orders, which these checks and reviews 
indicate are not needed to complete the project, should be canceled.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5005  Guide levels for construction inventories.

    To ensure that inventories maintained for construction programs and 
activities are reasonable, the following standards are established as 
guides (variations may be used where it is established by field 
organizations that they will more effectively or economically assure 
that inventory levels are held to the amount required to complete the 
construction project):
    (a) Ordinary construction materials and supplies readily available 
from commercial sources, and not available as Government excess, permit 
phasing of deliveries and cancellation of undelivered quantities that 
may prove excess to project requirements. The onhand inventory of such 
materials generally should not exceed a three or four months supply at 
the anticipated usage rates.
    (b) Ordinary construction materials and supplies readily obtainable 
from Government excess should be acquired only in the amounts estimated 
to complete the construction project.
    (c) Items obtainable only by special manufacture or fabrication 
should be limited to the estimates of requirements to complete the 
project as determined from project plans and specifications, except as 
outlined in (d) below.
    (d) Inventory levels in excess of estimates to complete the project 
should be confined to items so unusual in character or unique to the DOE 
project that they are obtainable only by special manufacture and will be 
required for maintenance purposes or for operation of the completed 
plant.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5006  Sub-stores.

    (a) Sub-stores shall be established when necessary to expedite 
delivery of

[[Page 203]]

materials and supplies to the users, serve emergencies, provide economy 
in transportation, reduce shop and site stocks, and enable stores 
personnel to provide assistance in obtaining materials and supplies as 
needed.
    (b) Items stored for issue in the sub-stores shall be treated as 
inventory items for control and reporting purposes. Stock records shall 
be integrated with central stock records so that the total amount on 
hand of any item at all locations is known.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5007  Shop, bench, cupboard or site stock.

    (a) Shop, bench, cupboard or site stocks are an accumulation of 
small inventories of fast-moving materials at the point of use. 
Normally, these inventories are expensed. However, when stocks of such 
inventories are not consumed or do not turn over in a reasonable period 
of time, which normally should not exceed 90 days, these items should be 
subject to the required physical controls and recorded in the proper 
inventory account.
    (b) Care shall be exercised to prevent excessive accumulation of 
inventories at such points. As a control measure, requisitions should be 
screened against issue data as reflected in stock records at the supply 
point. Also, work orders, retirement notices, minor construction 
projects, maintenance programs, and research and experimental projects, 
involving removal and dismantling should be reviewed and screened to 
prevent excessive inventories at point of use. However, the most 
effective control at point of use may be effected by administrative 
action through visual examination of quantities on hand, and close 
supervisory control and training of persons who requisition materials 
and supplies.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5008  Stores catalogs.

    A suitable stores catalog for customer use in requisitioning stores 
items shall be established for each stores operation. Exceptions to this 
requirement are authorized where establishment of a catalog is 
impracticable or uneconomical because of small total value or number of 
items involved, or temporary need for the facility. Revisions to the 
catalog should be made at reasonable intervals.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5009  Physical inventories.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5009-1  Procedures.

    The following procedures shall be established for taking physical 
inventory of stocks subjected to quantity controls as well as those 
under financial control:
    (a) Completion of a physical inventory not less frequently than 
every twelve months.
    (b) Reconciliation of inventory quantities with the stock records.
    (c) Preparation of a report of the physical inventory results.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5009-2  Inventory adjustments.

    (a) Discrepancies between physical inventories and stock records 
shall be adjusted and the supporting adjustment records shall be 
reviewed and approved by a responsible official at least one supervisory 
echelon above the supervisor in charge of the warehouse or storage 
facility. Items on an adjustment report which are not within reasonable 
tolerances for particular items shall be thoroughly investigated before 
approval.
    (b) Such inventory adjustment reports, when properly approved, 
support adjustments to the stock records and debits and credits to the 
financial inventory accounts. Adjustment reports shall be retained on 
file for inspection and review.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5010  Control of drug substances and potable alcohol.

    (a) The term ``controlled substance'' means any drug or substance 
which has been assigned a ``Bureau of Controlled Substance Code Number'' 
pursuant to 21 CFR part 1308-Schedule of Controlled Substances.
    (b) Effective procedures and practices shall provide for the 
management and physical security of controlled substances and potable 
alcohol from receipt to the point of use. Such procedures shall, as a 
minimum, provide for safeguarding, proper use, adequate records, and 
compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Controls and records of 
potable alcohol shall be

[[Page 204]]

maintained on quantities of one quart and above.
    (c) Effective procedures and practices shall provide for the 
management and physical security of hypodermic needles to prevent 
illegal use. Controls shall include supervisory approval for issue, 
storage in locked repositories, and the rendering of the needles useless 
upon disposal.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5011  Containers returnable to vendors.

    Containers furnished by vendors shall be administratively and 
physically controlled before and after issuance. Prompt action shall be 
taken to return such containers to vendors for credit after they have 
served their intended use.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5012  Identification marking of metals and metal products.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5012-1  General.

    Metals and metal products shall be identification marked in 
accordance with applicable Federal standards. This requirement applies 
to direct charges as well as to items procured for store, shop or floor 
stock, or for use on construction projects. Additional markings not 
covered by the Federal standards should be used to show special 
properties, corrosion data or test data as required. The preferred 
process is for the marking to be done in the manufacturing process, but 
it may be applied by jobbers or other vendors when circumstances 
warrant.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5012-2  Exception.

    Exception to the marking requirement may be made when--
    (a) It is necessary to procure small quantities from suppliers not 
equipped to do the marking;
    (b) It would delay delivery of emergency orders; or
    (c) Procurement is from DOE or other Federal agency excess.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5012-3  Federal standards applicable to marking.

    The Federal standards listed below can be obtained from the General 
Services Administration, Federal Supply Service (3 FRI), Washington, 
D.C. 20407.
    (a) Federal Standard 182A(2) ``Identification Marking of Nickel and 
Nickel Base Alloys.''
    (b) Federal Standard 183B ``Continuous Identification Marking of 
Iron and Steel Products.''
    (c) Federal Standard 184A ``Identification Marking of Aluminum, 
Magnesium and Titanium.''
    (d) Federal Standard 185 ``Continuous Marking of Copper and Copper 
Base Alloy Mill Products.''


<R04>
   Subpart 109-27.51--Management of Equipment Held for Future Projects


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5100  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart provides policies, principles and guidelines to be used 
in the management of equipment held for future projects.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5101  Definition.

    Equipment held for future projects (EHFFP) is equipment that is 
being retained, based on approved justifications, for a known future 
use, or for a potential use in planned projects. This classification 
excludes spare equipment retained as backup for equipment in service or 
equipment placed in equipment pools (classified as ``In Service''), 
spare and other equipment constituting a part of the facilities in 
standby (classified as ``Standby''), excess equipment, and equipment 
classified as ``Plant and Equipment Changes in Progress''.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5102  Objective.

    The objective of the ``equipment held for future projects'' program 
is to enable DOE offices and contractors to retain equipment not in use 
in current programs but which has a known or potential use in future DOE 
programs, while providing visibility on the types and amounts of 
equipment so retained through review and reporting procedures. It is 
intended that equipment be retained which is economically justifiable 
for retention, considering costs of replacement, storage, obsolescence, 
deterioration, or future availability, that it be made available for use 
by others, and that equipment no longer needed be promptly excessed.

[[Page 205]]


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5103  Records.

    Records of all EHFFP shall be maintained by the holding 
organization. Included shall be a listing of items with original date of 
classification as EHFFP, initial justifications for retaining EHFFP, 
rejustifications for retention, and documentation of reviews made by 
higher levels of management.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5104  Storage.

    EHFFP should be stored in warehouse space designated for that 
purpose. When such space cannot be made available, such equipment may be 
stored in storage yards or other areas with due consideration to the 
type of property and protection required.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5105  Justification and review procedures.

    Procedures shall provide for the following:
    (a) The original decision to classify and retain equipment as EHFFP 
shall be justified in writing, providing sufficient detail to support 
the need for retention of the equipment. This justification will cite 
the project for which retained, the potential use to be made of the 
equipment, or other reasons for retention.
    (b) The validity of initial classification of equipment held for 
future projects shall be reviewed at a level of management one echelon 
above that of the individual making the initial determination.
    (c) Retention of EHFFP must be rejustified annually to ensure that 
original justifications remain valid. These rejustifications will be 
supported with sufficient detail to support retention.
    (d) Annual rejustifications for retention of EHFFP for longer than 
one year shall be reviewed at a level of management at least two levels 
above that of the individual making the determination to retain the 
equipment as held for future projects. EHFFP retained for periods longer 
than three years should be approved by the head of the DOE field office 
or his designee.


<R05>

    This part implements and supplements FPMR Part 101-28, Storage and 
Distribution.


<R05>
Sec. 109-28.001-50  Policy.

    Storage and warehouse services shall be--
    (a) Established for the receipt, storage, issue, safekeeping and 
protection of Government-owned property when advantageous to the 
Government;
    (b) Provided in the most economical and efficient manner through the 
use of Government-owned facilities, and where necessary available 
commercial facilities, consistent with program requirements; and
    (c) Operated in accordance with generally accepted industrial 
management practices and principles.


<R05>
Sec. 109-28.001-51  Storage guidelines.

    (a) Adequate storage facilities shall be provided to ensure the 
proper safeguarding of all Government property.
    (1) Indoor storage areas should be arranged to obtain proper stock 
protection and maximum utilization of space within established floor 
load capacities.
    (2) Storage yards for items not requiring covered protection shall 
be protected by locked fenced enclosures to the extent necessary to 
protect the Government's interest.

[[Page 209]]

    (3) Storage areas shall be prominently posted to clearly indicate 
that the property stored therein is U.S. Government property. Entrance 
to such areas should be restricted to authorized personnel only.
    (b) The following general storage principles shall be observed in 
the planning for the storage of Government personal property:
    (1) Efficient storage demands the maximum utilization of space with 
a minimum amount of labor. Where practicable, labor should be conserved 
by use of modern materials handling equipment and storage aids which 
permit stacking by unit loads rather than by individual container units.
    (2) Fast-moving items should be stored in convenient locations from 
which they can be issued with minimum handling. Stocks of individual 
items or classes of items should be segregated to facilitate handling, 
issuing, and inventorying.
    (3) Property should be stored according to the kind of protection 
required. All items must be protected from fire and theft. Certain items 
require protection from dampness, heat, freezing, or extreme temperature 
changes. Others must be stored away from light and odors, protected from 
vermin infestation, or, because of their hazardous characteristics, 
stored separate from other stocks. These factors, as well as maximum 
protection of property against all causes of deterioration or 
destruction, must be considered in selecting proper storage locations.
    (4) Orderly arrangement is essential to efficient operation of 
storehouses. All items should be so arranged that nomenclature and 
quantity may be readily determined.
    (5) Stock rotation is based on the general storage principle of 
``first in, first out.'' Many items, such as perishables, food stuffs, 
medicines, paints, and chemicals, are subject to deterioration or 
infestation which require that the older stock be issued first.

head of the field office and the head of the Headquarters organization 
having ADPE responsibility for the equipment. However, when more than 
one request is received, the field office head shall notify the 
requestors that acquisition proposals prepared in accordance with 
instructions from the Office of the Director of Administration shall be 
forwarded to the field organization for review. After receipt of all 
proposals, the field office head shall--
    (1) Approve the request for transfer which is judged to be in the 
best interest of DOE; or
    (2) Where this judgment cannot be made locally, forward the 
proposals to the Director of Administration for action in a manner 
similar to proposals for equipment having a current market price equal 
to or greater than that specified for major items.


<R05>
Sec. 109-36.303-1  Designation of agency ADPE point of contact.

    The Director of Administration shall designate the DOE point of 
contact to carry out the responsibilities contained in FPMR Sec. 101-
36.303-1.


<R05>
Sec. 109-36.303-3-50  Reporting excess or exchange/sale ADPE within DOE.

    (a) All ADPE, either Government-owned or-leased, which is no longer 
needed or is scheduled for replacement, shall be made available for 
utilization within DOE as soon as plans for the release of such 
equipment are known.
    (b)(1) Government-owned ADPE shall be reported for utilization 
screening within DOE on Standard Form (SF) 120, Report of Excess 
Personal Property. The SF 120 shall contain the information required in 
FPMR 101-36.4702 and, for internal screening purposes, a release date 
(date of availability). If the release date is not firm, a tentative 
release date should be given, which would be subject to change until the 
actual release date is established.
    (2) The SF 120 shall be submitted to the Property and Equipment 
Management Division (MA-422) for inclusion in the Reportable Excess 
Automated Property System (REAPS) in accordance with Sec. 109-43.311-1-
50.
    (3) ADPE shall not be reported to GSA as excess until this screening 
has been accomplished and it has been established that there are no DOE 
claimants. Concurrent screening within DOE and GSA is not authorized. A 
minimum of 45 days should be allowed for screening ADPE prior to 
reporting it to GSA. In those instances where the release date can be 
determined sufficiently in advance, additional screening time should be 
allowed to permit maximum time for processing of requests to acquire 
excess ADPE.
    (c) The procedures prescribed in Sec. 109-36.303-3-50(b) shall be 
followed for leased ADPE. However, when time does not permit sequential 
DOE and GSA circularization, excess leased ADPE may be circularized 
concurrently in DOE and GSA to assure earned credits are not lost to the 
Government. The SF 120 should clearly indicate concurrent screening by 
DOE and GSA. Where time does not permit assurance that earned credits 
are not lost to the Government, announcement of availability of excess 
leased ADPE may be circularized within DOE by teletype (TWX). The TWX 
should be sent to all DOE field offices with a request to further 
distribute to applicable contractors, and copies should be sent to the 
Office

[[Page 214]]

of ADP Management (MA-24) and to the Property and Equipment Management 
Division (MA-422) at Headquarters.


<R05>
Sec. 109-36.304  Availability list.

    The Director of Administration shall develop and maintain 
distribution patterns for availability lists of excess and exchange/sale 
ADPE as contemplated in FPMR Sec. 101-36.304.


<R05>
Sec. 109-36.306  Requests for transfer of excess ADPE or exchange/sale ADPE.

    The Director of Administration, heads of field offices, the 
Administrator, Energy Information Administration and contracting 
officers are authorized to sign Standard Form (SF) 122, Transfer Order 
Excess Personal Property, after appropriate approvals, involving 
requests for transfer of excess or exchange/sale ADPE, as required by 
FPMR Sec. 101-36.306(a).

                       Subpart 109-36.47--Reports


<R05>
Sec. 109-36.4700  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart implements and supplements FPMR Subpart 101-36.47 as it 
relates to reporting excess or exchange/sale ADPE to GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 109-36.4702  Reporting excess or exchange/sale ADPE.

    Excess Government-owned or-leased ADPE and exchange/sale ADPE shall 
be reported to GSA on Standard Form (SF) 120, Report of Excess Personal 
Property, in accordance with the requirements of FPMR Sec. 101-36.4702. 
No provision is made in FPMR Sec. 101-36.4702 for the use of a TWX as a 
substitute for the SF 120 in reporting excess ADPE to GSA. When a TWX is 
used to report excess leased ADPE to GSA, it shall be followed up with 
an SF 120 to GSA, providing appropriate cross-reference information.

propelled or drawn by mechanical power, including motor vehicles, 
motorcycles and scooters, construction and maintenance equipment, 
materials handling equipment, aircraft and watercraft.
    (b) Motor vehicle means any equipment, self-propelled or drawn by 
mechanical power, designed to be operated principally on the highways in 
the transportation of property or passengers. This includes both 
motorcycles and motor scooters.
    (c) A replacement off-set is an authorization to one DOE field 
organization to acquire a new passenger motor vehicle to replace an old 
passenger motor vehicle which has become excess to another DOE field 
organization. The transaction does not require the physical transfer of 
the excess vehicle, but is limited to a documentary transfer.
    (d) Special purpose vehicles have limited but essential missions. 
They are not generally used to carry passengers, freight or other 
materials. Trucks with permanently mounted equipment, (such as fire 
trucks, special tank trucks, wreckers and trucks with compressors or 
generators in fixed mounting on the body), may be classified as special 
purpose trucks. Vehicles other than sedans and station wagons which are 
to be used only during a defined or specified contingency, such as 
evacuation or other similar emergency, may also be classified as special 
purpose vehicles. For reporting purposes within DOE, motorcycles and 
motor scooters will also be reported as special purpose vehicles.

[[Page 217]]

    (e) Experimental vehicles are those acquired solely for testing and 
research purposes or otherwise designated for experimental purposes. 
Such vehicles are to be the object of testing and research as 
differentiated from those used as vehicular support to testing and 
research. Experimental vehicles are not to be used for passenger 
carrying services, and they are not subject to statutory price 
limitations or to authorization limitations.

<R04>
          Subpart 109-38.9--Motor Vehicle Replacement Standards


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.900-50  Policy.

    It is the policy of DOE to continue in service motor vehicles which 
meet prescribed replacement standards, but which are in usable and 
workable condition, provided that--
    (a) A continued need exists for the vehicle;
    (b) The vehicle can be operated safely and dependably without 
excessive repair and maintenance costs. Normally, when any single repair 
job exceeds 25 percent of the estimated current market value of a 
vehicle, consideration should be given to replacement in lieu of repair 
and retention;
    (c) Repair parts are readily obtainable; and
    (d) Retention will not substantially reduce the exchange/sale value 
of the vehicle.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.907  Fleets.

    The replacement limitations cited in FPMR Sec. 101-38.907 are 
applicable to each of DOE's field organizations and may not be exceeded.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.908  Exception.

    Motor vehicles may be replaced without regard to the replacement 
standards in FPMR Sec. 101-38.9 only after certification by the 
appropriate head of the field or Headquarters organization that a 
vehicle is beyond economical repair due to accident damage or wear 
caused by abnormal operating conditions.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.908-50  Prompt disposal of replaced passenger vehicles.

    Because of the limitation on the total number of passenger vehicles 
which DOE may own, replaced passenger vehicles shall be removed from 
service and disposed of prior to or as soon as practicable after 
delivery of the replacement equipment to avoid concurrent operation of 
both vehicles. Because of disposal problems, there may be occasions 
where quick disposal of the old equipment may not be feasible or 
advantageous to the Government, e.g., it may be determined that there is 
an insufficient number for economical sale, or that sale would bring 
substantially better prices at a later date because of seasonal effects 
on sale prices. Under such circumstances, temporary retention of the 
replaced passenger vehicle may be justified. However, such retention may 
not be used as justification for concurrent operation of the new and 
replaced vehicles.


<R04>
       Subpart 109-38.10--Scheduled Maintenance of Motor Vehicles


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.1003-50  DOE guidelines.

    (a) Whenever practicable, existing Government service facilities 
shall be consolidated, or commercial services shall be utilized, to 
reduce to a minimum the maintenance facilities and

[[Page 220]]

equipment, supplies, parts, stocks and overhead costs.
    (b) Maintenance also shall be geared to a planned replacement 
program. Individual vehicle maintenance record files shall be kept and 
made readily available to appropriate maintenance personnel to provide 
historical records of past repairs, as a control against unnecessary 
repairs and excessive maintenance, and as an aid in determining the most 
economical time for replacement.
    (c) One-time maintenance and repair limitations shall be established 
by heads of field offices. To exceed repair limitations, approval from 
heads of field offices is required, particularly as the time of 
replacement approaches.
    (d) Adequate maintenance schedules shall be provided to accomplish 
the following objectives in the most economical manner:
    (1) To maintain equipment in safe and economical operating 
condition.
    (2) To prevent equipment failures resulting in program delays and 
excessive downtime.
    (3) To prevent premature wear and deterioration.
    (4) To prevent undue depreciation.
    (5) To conserve materials and manpower.
    (e) Warranties. (1) Special attention shall be devoted to the 
warranty on each motor vehicle to ensure that maximum benefits are 
realized. A system should be established to assure that defective 
materials and workmanship on vehicles under warranty are corrected under

            Subpart 109-38.50--Utilization of Motor Vehicles


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5000  General.

    It is DOE policy to keep the number of motor vehicles at the minimum 
needed to satisfy program requirements. To assure attainment of this 
goal, continuing attention shall be given to developing and implementing 
controls and practices which will help achieve the most practical and 
economical utilization of vehicles.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5001  Utilization controls and practices.

    Controls and practices to be used by DOE organizations and 
contractors for achieving maximum economical utilization of motor 
vehicles shall include, but not be limited to--
    (a) The maximum use of equipment pooling arrangements, taxicabs, 
shuttle buses, or other common service arrangements;
    (b) The minimum, practicable assignment of equipment to individuals, 
groups or specific organizational components with periodic documented 
reviews of such assignments to determine if underutilization exists and 
whether reassignment is necessary;
    (c) Frequent review of vehicle utilization statistics by appropriate 
levels of management, with prompt reassignment and/or disposal action 
performed as required;
    (d) The careful selection of equipment types to permit the maximum 
appropriate use of multi-purpose equipment;
    (e) The rotation of equipment between high and low mileage 
assignments where practicable to maintain the fleet in the best overall 
replacement age and mileage balance and operating economy; and
    (f) The maintenance of individual equipment use records, such as 
trip

[[Page 223]]

tickets or vehicle logs, showing sufficiently detailed information to 
evaluate appropriateness of assignment and adequacy of use being made. 
If one-time use is involved, such as assignments from motor pools, the 
individual's trip records must, as a minimum, identify the vehicle and 
show the name of the operator, dates, destination, time of departure and 
return, and mileage.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5002  Use objectives for motor vehicles.

    The following use goals are established for DOE as average 
objectives:
    (a) Sedans and station wagons--3,000 miles per quarter or 12,000 
miles per year.
    (b) Light trucks and general purpose vehicles, one ton and under 
(less than 12,500 GVW)--10,000 miles per year.
    (c) Medium trucks and general purpose vehicles, 1\1/2\ ton through 
2\1/2\ ton (12,500 to 16,999 GVW)--7,500 miles per year.
    (d) Heavy trucks and general purpose vehicles, three ton and over 
(17,000 GVW and over)--7,500 miles per year.
    (e) Truck tractors--10,000 miles per year.
    (f) All-wheel-drive vehicles--7,500 miles per year.
    (g) Other motor vehicles--No average use goals for other trucks, 
ambulances, buses, and special purpose vehicles are established. The use 
of such equipment shall be reviewed and necessary action taken to ensure 
that the equipment is fully utilized or declared excess to the 
Department's needs.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5003  Application of use goals.

    Individual motor vehicle utilization cannot always be measured or 
evaluated strictly on the basis of miles operated or against any 
Department-wide mileage standard. Other measures of use will need to be 
considered. Accordingly, as an aid in achieving maximum feasible 
utilization, local use objectives which represent practical units of 
measurement for vehicle utilization and for planning and evaluating 
future vehicle requirements must be established. Such objectives should 
generally be initiated by the organization involved and reviewed and 
adjusted as appropriate, but not less often than annually. The 
objectives will take into consideration past performance, future 
requirements and special operating conditions, and should be consistent 
with the justifications used to obtain vehicle authorizations. Both 
Department-wide and local use objectives should be applied in such a 
manner that their application does not stimulate vehicle use for the 
purpose of meeting the objective. The ultimate standard against which 
vehicle use must be measured is that the minimum number of vehicles will 
be retained to satisfy program requirements.

handling watercraft, knowledge of ``Rules of the Road,'' and other basic 
watercraft knowledge necessary for safe and efficient operation.
    (c) Rules of the Road means laws which govern the operation of 
watercraft on: (1) Great Lakes, (2) western rivers, (3) Inland, and (4) 
International Waters.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5302  General.

    Departmental-wide policies, standards, guidelines and procedures for 
management of watercraft are established by the Director of Procurement 
and Assistance Management.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5303  Watercraft safety.

    Policy development and general overview of watercraft safety in 
Departmental operations is exercised by the Assistant Secretary for 
Policy, Safety and Environment.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5304  Watercraft operations.

    (a) No person may operate a watercraft on a waterway until skill of 
operation, knowledge of rules of the road, and basic watercraft 
knowledge have been exhibited to the head of the field office. The U.S. 
Coast Guard Auxiliary (USCG), American Red Cross and U.S. Power 
Squadrons teach public courses in some locations which are applicable to 
small boat operations (non-commercial watercraft up to 65' overall 
length).
    (b) Before a watercraft is put underway, the operator shall check 
the vessel to ensure that the necessary equipment, including personal 
flotation devices and lights, as required by laws applicable to the area 
of operation, are present, properly stowed and in proper working order. 
Optional equipment recommended by USCG or other competent authority 
shall also be included when determined to be necessary by the 
responsible field office.
    (c) Operators shall comply with all applicable Federal, state and 
local laws pertaining to the operation of watercraft. Where no state 
boating law exists, the requirements of the Federal Boating Act of 1958, 
as amended, shall apply.
    (d) Operators shall not use watercraft or carry passengers except in 
the performance of official Departmental assignments.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5305  Watercraft identification and numbers.

    (a) Watercraft in the custody of DOE or DOE contractors shall 
display identifying numbers, whether issued by the U.S. Coast Guard, 
state or local field office. The numbers will be in addition to 
Departmental property control or other identification. Numbers shall be 
in block form affixed to the bow section, on both sides. Numbers and/or 
letters shall read from left to right in contrasting color to background 
not less than three (3) inches in height. When a watercraft is not 
registered by either the U.S. Coast Guard or state, the field 
organization shall assign an alpha-numeric designation, which will 
reflect Departmental and field office issue. Example--DOE-4560-SR. 
(Note: Some states specify the arrangement of numbers and letters which 
shall be used by Federal small boats home posted in the state's waters. 
Compliance with such a requirement is appropriate.)
    (b) DOE is not required to have DOE-owned watercraft inspected and 
registered by the U.S. Coast Guard, but these services may be provided 
upon request.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5306  Display of flags and seal.

    Watercraft with overall length of twenty (20) feet or more, except 
barges, shall display the U.S. Ensign (National Flag). The display of 
the Departmental flag is optional. Location and times of display of 
flags shall be in accordance with accepted practice. A facsimile of the 
Departmental seal may also be displayed. When the seal is used it shall 
be placed on the superstructure in a prominent place and a size 
appropriate to the superstructure; except that if there is no 
superstructure, the seal shall be placed above the water line in the 
midship section of watercraft.

     Subpart 109-38.54--Official Use of Motor Vehicles and Aircraft


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5400  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart supplements FPMR Part 101-38, implements the provisions 
of statutes concerning the use of Government-owned, -rented or -leased 
motor vehicles and aircraft for official purposes and prescribes 
policies and procedures governing the use of such vehicles and aircraft 
acquired for official purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5401  Statutory requirement.

    (a) 31 U.S.C. 1344(a) provides that, unless otherwise specifically 
provided, no appropriation available for any department shall be 
expended for the maintenance, operation, and repair of any Government-
owned passenger motor vehicle or aircraft not used exclusively for 
official purposes. Official purposes shall not normally include the 
transportation of officers and employees between their domiciles and 
places of employment, except in cases of medical officers on outpatient 
medical service, and where officers and employees are performing field 
work which makes such transportation necessary and which has been 
approved by the head of the department concerned.
    (b) In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 1349(b), any officer or employee of 
the Government who willfully uses or authorizes the use of any 
Government-owned motor vehicle or aircraft or any motor vehicle or 
aircraft leased by the Government, for other than official purposes, 
shall be suspended from duty by the head of the department concerned, 
without compensation, for not less than one month and shall be suspended 
for a longer period or summarily removed from office if circumstances 
warrant.
    (c) Under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 641, any person who knowingly 
misuses any Government property (which includes Government motor 
vehicles) is subject to criminal prosecution and, upon conviction, to 
fines up to $10,000 and/or imprisonment for up to 10 years.
    (d) In addition to the potential administrative sanctions and 
criminal prosecution cited above, 31 U.S.C. 1344 is interpreted to 
preclude reimbursement to Government contractors for the maintenance, 
operation or repair of Government-owned, -rented, or -leased passenger 
motor vehicles or aircraft which are used by contractor personnel for 
other than official purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5402  Policy.

    All Government-owned, -rented or -leased motor vehicles and aircraft 
operated by DOE and its contractors shall be utilized for official 
purposes only, and officers, employees and contractors of the Department 
shall not use or authorize others to use any Government-owned, -rented 
or -leased motor vehicle or aircraft for other than official purposes. 
It should be understood that use of Government-owned, -rented or -leased 
motor vehicles between an employee's domicile and place of employment 
when adequately justified may be authorized only as an exceptional 
action but not as a routine occurrence.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5403  Official purposes.

    (a) The term ``official purposes'' means those purposes required to 
carry out authorized programs, including program work carried out under 
contracts made pursuant to authority vested in the Department. 
``Official purpose'' largely is a matter of administrative discretion 
and determination based on the particular facts of the case and the 
Government interest in the proposed use of the Government motor vehicle. 
It is the responsibility of the person authorizing or approving the use 
to examine the circumstances surrounding such use and assure that the 
facts sufficiently justify a conclusion of ``official purpose.''
    (b) The term ``field work'' as used in 31 U.S.C. 1344a quoted above 
refers to the nature of the work performance; it is not restricted to 
``field service'' as distinguished from ``Headquarters service.''


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5404  Approval of authorizations.

    (a) The Director of Administration and heads of field offices for 
their respective organizations may approve the use of a Government-
owned, -rented, or -leased motor vehicle between a DOE

[[Page 230]]

employee's domicile and place of employment. This authority may be 
redelegated but not below the chief administrative officer level.
    (b) Heads of field offices and contracting officers shall require:
    (1) Contracting officer approval for all contractor authorizations 
over 10 days;
    (2) That contractors prescribe and issue, subject to approval by the 
head of the field organization or contracting officer, such local 
written guidelines regarding the official use of motor vehicles or 
aircraft and the penalties for unauthorized use as may be necessary and 
appropriate for particular operating situations; and
    (3) That the use of Government-owned, -rented, or -leased motor 
vehicles or aircraft by contractor employees for transportation between 
places of employment and domiciles, including storage at or near such 
domiciles, is justified in accordance with Sec. 109-38.5403, and that 
such justifications, administrative determinations, and authorizations 
for such use and storage by contractor employees are documented and 
approved at appropriate supervisory levels within the contractor's 
organization and by the contracting officer when required by Sec. 109-
38.5404(b)(1).
    (c) The approving official shall determine whether the official 
duties of the employees justify a conclusion of official purpose in 
accordance with Sec. 109-38.5403. All approvals and supporting 
documentation shall be in writing and retained for three calendar years.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5405  Duration of authorizations.

    An authorization to use a motor vehicle for transportation between a 
domicile and place of employment shall be limited to the period of 
actual need or 60 days, whichever is less. Requests for renewals of such 
authorizations shall be subject to the same justification and document 
retention procedures as original requests, and must also indicate what 
attempts were made during the original period to eliminate the necessity 
for such use.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5406  Use of a motor vehicle to drive to residence at start of official travel.

    The use of a Government motor vehicle by an officer or employee to 
drive to his/her residence when it is in the interest of the Government 
that the employee start on official travel in the vehicle from that 
point, rather than from his/her place of business, is not regarded as 
prohibited by 31 USC 1344(a), (25. Comp. Gen. 844) or by Departmental 
policy.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5407  Use of Government-owned or Government-furnished motor vehicles in travel status.

    The use of Government-owned or Government-furnished motor vehicles 
by Government employees while in travel is governed by the Federal 
Travel Regulations (FTR 1-2.6a) and Chapter III-3 of DOE Order 1500.2 
(DOE Travel Policy and Procedures Manual).


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5408  Use of Government-owned or -leased bus systems.

    The provisions of this subpart do not affect passenger use of 
Government-owned or -leased bus systems (regardless of type of vehicle 
used in such system) established under the provisions of section 161e of 
the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2201e).


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5409  Use of Government motor vehicles in emergencies.

    In limiting the use of Government motor vehicles to official 
purposes, it is not intended to preclude their use in emergencies 
threatening loss of life or property (see Sec. 109-1.5102). Such use 
shall be documented.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5410  Use of motor vehicles by the Postal Service.

    (a) Section 411 of the Postal Reorganization Act provides that 
executive agencies are authorized to furnish property and services to 
the Postal Service under such terms and conditions, including 
reimbursability, as the Postal Service and the agency concerned deem 
appropriate. Executive Order 11672 establishes a requirement for 
reimbursement at fair market value of such property or at a rate based 
on appropriate commercial

[[Page 231]]

charges for comparable property , as agreed to by the agency head and 
the Postmaster General, unless the Director of the Office of Management 
and Budget finds that a different basis of valuation is more equitable 
or better serves the public interest.
    (b) Pursuant to the authority in 39 U.S.C. 411, motor vehicles may 
be made available to the Postal Service for temporary use. The rental 
rate to be charged shall be the same as is charged by the General 
Services Administration for similar motor vehicles available from the 
interagency motor pool serving the geographical area involved, with 
appropriate allowances for any fuel and oil furnished by the Postal 
Service.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5411  Instructions to motor vehicle operators.

    Procedures shall be established to inform motor vehicle operators 
concerning--
    (a) The statutory requirement that motor vehicles shall be used only 
for official purposes;
    (b) Personal responsibility for safe driving and operation of motor 
vehicles, and for compliance with Federal, State, and local laws and 
regulations, and all accident reporting requirements;
    (c) Protection for DOE employees under the Federal Tort Claims Act 
(28 U.S.C. 2671) when acting within the scope of their employment;
    (d) The penalties for unauthorized use of motor vehicles;
    (e) The prohibition against picking up strangers or hitchhikers, and 
the transportation of non-official passengers:
    (f) The proper care, control and use of credit cards; and
    (g) Any other duties and responsibilities assigned to motor vehicle 
operators with regard to use, care, operation, and maintenance of motor 
vehicles.

                  Subpart 109-40.1--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.102  Representation before regulatory bodies.

    Participation in proceedings related to carrier applications to 
regulatory bodies for temporary or permanent authority to operate in 
specified geographical locations shall be confined to statements or 
testimony in support of a need for service and shall not extend to 
support of individual carriers or groups of carriers.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.103  Selection of carriers.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.103-1  Domestic transportation.

    (a) Preferential treatment, normally, shall not be accorded to any 
mode of transportation (motor, rail, air, water) or to any particular 
carrier when arranging for domestic transportation service. However, 
where, for valid reasons, a particular mode of transportation or a 
particular carrier within that mode must be used to meet specific 
program requirements and/or limitations, only that mode or carrier shall 
be considered. Examples of valid reasons for considering only a 
particular mode or carrier are (1) where only a certain mode of 
transportation or individual carrier is able to provide the needed 
service or is able to meet the required delivery date; and (2) where the 
consignee's installation and related facilities preclude or are not 
conducive to service by all modes of transportation.
    (b) The following factors are considered in determining whether a 
carrier or mode of transportation can meet DOE's transportation service 
requirements for each individual shipment:
    (1) Availability and suitability of carrier equipment;
    (2) Carrier terminal facilities at origin and destination;
    (3) Pickup and delivery service, if required;
    (4) Availability of required or accessorial and special services, if 
needed;
    (5) Estimated time in transit;
    (6) Record of past performance of the carrier; and
    (7) Availability and suitability of transit privileges.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.103-2  Disqualification and suspension of carriers.

    Disqualification and suspension are measures which exclude carriers 
from participation, for temporary periods of time, in DOE traffic. To 
ensure that the Government derives the benefits of full and free 
competition of interested carriers, disqualification and suspension 
shall not apply for any period of time longer than necessary to protect 
the interests of the Government.

international air transportation services shall be made

[[Page 234]]

in accordance with the provisions of section 5(a) of the International 
Air Transportation Fair Competitive Practices Act of 1974 (49 U.S.C. 
1517), which requires the use of U.S.-flag certificated air carriers for 
international travel of persons or property to the extent that service 
by these carriers is available.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.104  Use of Government owned transportation equipment.

    The preferred method of transporting property for the Government is 
through use of the facilities and services of commercial carriers. 
However, Government vehicles may be used when they are available to meet 
emergencies, and accomplishment of program objectives which cannot be 
attained through use of commercial carriers.

on a Government-wide or a DOE-wide basis and are applicable, generally 
to DOE shipments. The DOE-HQ Manager, Transportation Operations and 
Traffic, will distribute information on such agreements to field offices

lowest aggregate delivered cost, the carrier/mode determined to be the 
most fuel efficient will be selected. In determining the most fuel 
efficient carrier/mode, consideration will be given to such factors as 
use of the carrier's equipment in ``turn around'' service, proximity of 
carrier equipment to the shipping activity, and ability of carriers to 
provide the most direct service to the destination points.

Sec. 109-40.304  Rate tenders to the Government.

    Under the provisions of section 10721 (formerly section 22) of the 
Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S.C. 10721), common carriers are permitted 
to submit to the Government tenders which contain rates lower than 
published tariff rates available to the general public. In addition, 
rate tenders may be applied to shipments other than those made by the 
Government provided the total benefits accrue to the Government; that 
is, provided the Government pays the charges or directly and completely 
reimburses the party that initially bears the freight charges (323 ICC 
347 and 332 ICC 161).


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.305-50  Negotiations involving national security.

    Title 49 U.S.C., section 10721(b)(2) provides that rate tenders to 
the Government must be filed by the carriers with the Interstate 
Commerce Commission unless ``a carrier is advised by the U.S. Government 
that disclosure of a quotation or tender of a rate established * * * for 
transportation provided to the U.S. Government would endanger the 
National security.'' Carriers will be informed by the negotiating 
official if any quotation or tender to the Department of Energy involves 
such information.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.306-1  Recommended rate tender format.

    Only those rate tenders which have been submitted by the carriers in 
writing shall be considered for use. Carriers should be encouraged to 
use the format ``Uniform Tender of Rates and/or Charges for 
Transportation Services'' when preparing and submitting rate tenders to 
the Government. Rate tenders that are ambiguous in meaning shall be 
resolved in favor of the Government.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.306-2  Required shipping documents and annotations.

    (a) To qualify for transportation under section 10721 rates, 
property must be shipped by or for the Government on:
    (1) Government bills of lading;
    (2) Commercial bills of lading endorsed to show that these bills of 
lading are to be converted to Government bills of lading after delivery 
to the consignee:
    (3) Commercial bills of lading showing that the Government is either 
the consignor or the consignee and endorsed with the following 
statement:

    Transportation hereunder is for the U.S. Department of Energy, and 
the actual total transportation charges paid to the carrier(s) by the 
consignor or consignee are assignable to, and are to be reimbursed by, 
the Government.

    (b) When a rate tender is used for transportation furnished under a 
cost-reimbursable contract, the following endorsement shall be used on 
covering commercial bills of lading:

    Transportation hereunder is for the U.S. Department of Energy and 
the actual total transportation charges paid to the carrier(s) by the 
consignor or the consignee are to be reimbursed by the Government, 
pursuant to cost-reimbursable contract number (  ). This may be 
confirmed by contacting the agency representative at (name and telephone 
number). (See 332 ICC 161.)

    (c) To ensure proper application of a Government rate tender on all 
shipments qualifying for their use, the issuing officer shall show on 
the bills of lading covering such shipments the applicable rate tender 
number and carrier identification: such as, ``Section 10721 tender, ABC 
Transportation Company, ICC No. 374.'' In addition, if commercial bills 
of lading are used, they shall be endorsed as specified above.

[[Page 236]]


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.306-3  Distribution.

    Each agency receiving rate tenders shall promptly submit one signed 
copy to the Transportation and Public Utilities Service (WIT), General 
Services Administration, Washington, DC 20407. Also, two copies 
(including at least one signed copy) shall be promptly submitted to the 
General Services Administration (TA). Chester A. Arthur Building, 
Washington, DC 20406.

    (a) DOE's cost-type contractors using commercial bills of lading in 
making shipments for the account of the DOE shall include the following 
statement or one substantially the same on all commercial bills of 
lading:

    This shipment is for the account of the U.S. Government which will 
assume the freight charges and is subject to the terms and conditions 
set forth in the standard form of the U.S. Government bills of lading 
and to any available special rates or charges.

    (b) The foregoing language may be varied without materially changing 
its substance to satisfy the needs of particular cost-type contractors 
for the purpose of obtaining the benefit of the lowest available rates 
for account of the Government.
    (c) Where practicable, commercial bills of lading shall provide for 
consignment of a shipment to the DOE c/o the cost-type contractor or by 
the contractor ``for the DOE.''
    (d) Commercial bills of lading exceeding $10,000 issued by cost-type 
contractors shall be annotated with a typewritten, rubber stamp, or 
similar impression containing the following wording:

    Equal Employment Opportunity. All provisions of Executive Order 
11246 as amended by Executive Order 11375 and of the rules, regulations,

authorized to use Government bills of lading, specific employees of 
cost-type contractors will be authorized by the contracting officer to 
issue such Government bills of lading (see Title V, U.S. Government 
Accounting Office Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal 
Agencies).
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.5005  Description of property for shipment.

    (a) Each shipment shall be described on the bill of lading or other 
shipping document as specified by the governing freight classification, 
carrier's tariff, or rate tender. Shipments shall be described as 
specifically as possible. Trade names such as ``Foamite'' or ``Formica'' 
or general terms such as ``vehicles,'' ``furniture,'' or ``Government 
supplies,'' shall not be used as bill of lading descriptions.
    (b) A shipment containing hazardous materials, such as explosives, 
radioactives, flammable liquids, flammable solids, oxidizers, or poison 
A or poison B, shall be prepared for shipment and described on bills of 
lading or other shipping documents in accordance with the Department of 
Transportation Hazardous Materials Regulations, 49 CFR, parts 100-189.

                 Subpart 109-43.3--Utilization of Excess


<R05>
Sec. 109-43.301-50  Policy.

    It is the policy of DOE to consider excess property as the first 
source of supply. In no case, however, will excess property be acquired 
unless a present or foreseeable program need exists for the property. In 
carrying out this policy, the objective of which is to obtain maximum 
effective and economical utilization of property already owned by the 
Federal Government, consideration should be given to such factors as--

[[Page 240]]

    (a) Nature and cost of any repairs required to restore excess 
equipment to a safe, dependable, and economical operating condition;
    (b) Duration of the job on which the equipment will be used;
    (c) Economic feasibility of ownership vs. loan or rental of the 
equipment. Frequency of use, particularly where the equipment will be 
needed only infrequently, is one of the factors which must be considered 
in determining the most economical method of acquisition; and
    (d) Handling and transportation costs involved in acquisition of 
excess property.


<R05>
Sec. 109-43.302-50  Utilization and disposal by contractors.

    Heads of field offices may authorize contractors to perform the 
functions pertaining to utilization and disposal of excess property, 
provided such activities are in accordance with written policies and 
procedures which they have approved as being consistent with this part 
and those contained in FPMR Part 101-45 and Part 109-45.


<R05>
Sec. 109-43.303-1  Acquisition of mercury.

    Requests for 76 pound flasks of mercury, for use by DOE or its 
contractors, shall be forwarded to the Director, Supply Division, Oak 
Ridge Operations Office, Oak Ridge, Tennessee.


<R05>
Sec. 109-43.306  Property not required to be reported.

    To the extent practicable and economical, notification of 
availability of nonreportable excess property (See FPMR Sec. 101-43.312) 
shall be made on an informal basis to other DOE installations in the 
area known to use such property. If no requirement is established within 
a reasonable time, usually not more than 30 days after the availability 
of the property is announced, the property will be considered excess to 
the needs of the DOE and made available to GSA as provided for in FPMR 
Part 101-43.306.


<R05>
Sec. 109-43.311-1-50  DOE utilization screening.

    (a) Prior to reporting excess personal property to GSA as required 
by FPMR Sec. 101-43.311-1, reportable property, as identified in FPMR 
Sec. 101-43.4801, shall be reported to the Property and Equipment 
Management Division (MA-422) through the DOE Reportable Excess Automated 
Property System (REAPS) for completion of the 30-day DOE screening 
period. Information regarding REAPS reporting and screening procedures 
are provided in instructions and directives issued by MA-422.
    (b) In exceptional cases where time does not permit formal DOE 
utilization screening through REAPS, notification of the availability of 
excess property may be made by telegram, teletype or telephone, with due 
consideration to the additional costs involved.
    (c) Concurrent utilization screening within DOE and to other Federal 
agencies generally shall not be permitted.
    (d) If, after DOE circularization, reportable property is desired by 
another Federal agency, it may be transferred as provided in FPMR 
Sec. 101-43.315-5(a).


<R05>
Sec. 109-43.311-1-51  Procedures for effecting transfers within DOE.

    In accordance with instructions provided for the operation of the 
REAPS program, transfers between DOE organizations and contractors shall 
be effected by completion of an SF-122, Transfer Order Excess Personal 
Property. Except for those contractors authorized by the DOE contracting 
office to execute transfer orders, transfers to DOE contractors must be 
approved by the cognizant DOE contracting officer for the contractors 
receiving the property.


<R05>
Sec. 109-43.311-5  Property at installations due to be discontinued.

    (a) In closing out installations or any activities where it is 
important that upon completion of the work the personnel be released and 
activities ended as quickly as possible in order to avoid large 
expenditures, arrangements may be made for expediting the utilization 
and disposal of excess inventories and other excess property.
    (b) Personal and real property staffs of DOE field organizations 
shall work with appropriate GSA regional offices to develop a 
utilization and disposal program which takes into consideration all the 
factors involved, is expedited to the maximum degree, and is

[[Page 241]]

mutually satisfactory and in the best overall interest of the 
Government. When closeout involves an activity which is not located 
geographically in a DOE installation, information concerning the 
situation shall be given to the appropriate regional administrator of 
GSA, as early as possible, by letter (copy to the Property and Equipment 
Management Division (MA-422)). The information should include the types 
of property available and indicate that the activity is to be 
discontinued, the scheduled date for the removal of personnel from the 
location, and the last dates when the property will be needed. The 
following guidelines are furnished for possible use, although variations 
may be used as long as agreement is reached with GSA and there is no 
conflict with DOE requirements except as noted in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section:
    (1) If a proposed expedited program provides for deviation from the 
DOE policy or procedural requirements, approval of the Director of 
Procurement and Assistance Management shall be obtained.
    (2) Approval of the proposed program by the appropriate GSA regional 
office, when deviation from existing GSA regulations is involved, will 
be sufficient to validate the program. A copy of the approved program 
should be forwarded for information to the Property and Equipment 
Management Division (MA-422).
    (3) In developing an expedited disposal program, property shall be 
determined to be excess to DOE before it is reported to GSA. Concurrent 
circularization of lists of DOE excess property within DOE and to other 
Federal agencies generally is not permitted.
    (4) Summary catalog listings of certain categories of excess 
property, such as property in classes 48, 51, 55, 56, etc., showing 
estimated release dates, might be furnished GSA with good utilization 
results. Excess property in such classes as 23, 24, 32, 34 and 38 shall 
normally be listed by individual item with sufficient description for 
ready identification.
    (5) In order to obtain maximum utilization of the property by other 
Federal agencies, the disposal program shall provide that the field 
organization will furnish assistance to GSA, upon request, to arrange 
for invitational inspections by Federal agency representatives.
    (6) Upon request, DOE can provide assistance to GSA in its 
circularization of reportable items to other Federal agencies or in 
locating potential users within the government.
    (7) Care should be exercised to be sure that orders from other 
Federal agencies for excess property are processed through GSA, as may 
be required by the GSA regional office concerned.
    (8) Although it may be possible to arrange for expediting donations 
for educational, public health, or civil defense purposes, adequate time 
must be allowed for the screening of all donable property.
    (9) Provisions should be made for accelerated release by GSA of 
excess property for disposal as surplus, particularly where there is 
little or no potential use by other Federal Agencies.
    (10) Methods should be developed whereby last minute requests for 
surplus property, cataloged for an auction sale or listed in a sealed 
bid invitation and inspected by prospective bidders, can be kept to a 
minimum.


<R05>
Sec. 109-43.312  Exceptions to reporting.

    In addition to the categories of nonreportable property identified 
in FPMR Sec. 101-43.312 (a) through (g), the following property, when 
determined excess to a DOE installation, is not reportable and shall not 
be formally circularized within DOE or reported to GSA--
    (h) Asphalt products in less than carload (LCL) quantities (roofing 
tile, paving materials);
    (i) Cement and fabricated cement products in LCL quantities 
(concrete block, pumic block, cinder block, pipe and fittings);
    (j) Fabricated clay products in LCL quantities (brick, tile, pipe 
and fittings);
    (k) Fuels in LCL quantities (gasoline, diesel fuels, coal, coke and 
kerosene);
    (l) Special purpose or site fabricated shelving, cabinets, shop 
tables, etc., of limited adaptability or with high cost of disassembly 
or transportation;
    (m) Uncrated window glass; and

[[Page 242]]

    (n) Equipment, parts, accessories, jigs and components, which are of 
special design, composition, or manufacture and which are intended for 
use only by specific DOE installations, such as spare parts for 
equipment used in atomic processes.

    Classified personal property which is excess to DOE needs shall be 
stripped of all characteristics which cause it to be classified, or 
otherwise rendered unclassified prior to disposal, in accordance with 
instructions of the head of the field organization concerned. 
Declassification shall be accomplished in a manner which will preserve, 
so far as practicable, any civilian utility or commercial value of the 
property.


<R05>
Sec. 109-43.313-53  Naval gun mounts.

    When a naval gun mount obtained from the Naval Sea Systems Command, 
Department of the Navy, becomes excess, it may be listed, circularized, 
and transferred within DOE in the same manner as other excess property. 
However, when a naval gun mount is determined to be excess to DOE, it 
shall be reported to the Department of the Navy, Naval Sea Systems 
Command, Washington, D.C. 20360, and shall be disposed of in accordance 
with instructions of that Department.

which remain available.


<R05>
Sec. 109-43.313-56  Property in which the Government has an interest.

    Personal property in which the Government has an interest means: (a) 
Government-owned property which is available for exchange or sale, and 
(b) property leased with an option to purchase. Such property shall be 
circularized within DOE in accordance with Sec. 109-43.311-1-50 for 
possible utilization whenever it is practicable to do so, considering 
the contract terms, cost in relation to remaining useful life, location 
of item, purchase option time remaining, etc.


<R05>
Sec. 109-43.313-57  Lead.

    Excess lead and lead bearing scrap, such as batteries, with the 
exception of radioactively contaminated lead, should be reported to the

Sec. 109-43.315-5  Procedure for effecting transfers.

    In accordance with a DOE agreement with GSA, execution of transfer 
orders by a DOE official is not required in

[[Page 243]]

those cases where heads of field offices have authorized contractors to 
perform this function, and GSA has been notified of such authorization. 
GSA regional offices will furnish the cognizant DOE field organization a 
copy of each transfer ordered received from contractors. This copy of 
the transfer order will be reviewed by the cognizant DOE field 
organization to determine if the contractor has been authorized to 
submit orders for excess property. If the contractor submitting the 
transfer order to the GSA regional office has not been authorized in 
writing to submit such orders, GSA will not honor such requests unless 
they are subsequently executed by an appropriate DOE official.


<R05>
Sec. 109-43.317-1  Cost of care and handling.

    DOE field organizations and contractors shall comply with the 
provisions of Chapter III of the DOE Accounting Practices and Procedures 
Handbook as they relate to billings for direct costs incurred in the 
transfer of excess property.


<R05>
Sec. 109-43.317-2  Proceeds.

    For DOE procedures on the handling of proceeds from transfer of 
excess property to another Government agency with reimbursement, see 
Chapter III of the DOE Accounting Practices and Procedures Handbook.


<R05>
Sec. 109-43.319  Use of excess property on cost-reimbursement type contracts.

    (b) It is DOE policy for contractors to use Government excess 
personal property to the maximum extent possible to reduce contract 
costs. However, the determination required in FPMR Sec. 101-43.319(b) 
does not apply to such contracts and the acquisitions of Government 
excess personal property by these contractors are not subject to the 
annual reporting requirements of FPMR Sec. 101-43.4701(c). The 
procedures prescribed in Sec. 109-43.315-5 for execution of transfer 
orders apply.


<R05>
Sec. 109-43.321  Certification of non-Federal agency screeners.

    Contracting officers shall maintain a record of the number of 
certified non-Federal agency screeners operating under their authority 
and shall immediately notify the appropriate GSA regional office of any 
changes in screening arrangements.

Subpart 109-43.51--Utilization of Personal Property Held for Facilities 
                               in Standby


<R05>
Sec. 109-43.5100  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart supplements FPMR Part 101-43 by providing policies and 
procedures for the economic and efficient utilization of personal 
property associated with facilities placed in standby status.


<R05>
Sec. 109-43.5101  Definition.

    Facility in standby is a significant segment of plant and equipment, 
such as a complete plant or section of a plant, which is neither ``in 
service'' or declared ``excess''.


<R05>
Sec. 109-43.5102  Policy.

    Procedures and practices shall assure economical and efficient 
utilization of property associated with facilities placed in standby 
status as provided for in this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 109-43.5103  Reviews to determine need for retaining items.

    Procedures and practices shall require an initial review at the time 
the plant is placed in standby to determine which items can be made 
available for use elsewhere within the established startup criteria, 
periodic reviews (no less than biennially) to determine need for 
continued retention of property, and special reviews when a change in 
startup time is made or when circumstances warrant. Such procedures 
should recognize that:
    (a) Generally, equipment, spares, stores items, and materials 
peculiar to a plant should be retained for possible future operation of 
the plant,
    (b) Where practicable, common-use stores should be removed and used 
elsewhere, and
    (c) Uninstalled equipment and other personal property not required 
should be utilized elsewhere onsite or be disposed of as excess.


<R05>
Sec. 109-43.5104  Utilization of property in facilities in standby status.

    (a) Procedures and practices shall require that property comprising 
the plant in standby, to the extent consistent with program requirements 
reflected by the startup criteria, be considered as a source of supply 
prior to procurement. Such procedures should provide for:
    (1) Furnishing potential users and procurement officers or some 
other responsible screening office with listings of equipment and other 
significant property holdings available for loan or transfer, and
    (2) Removal and use elsewhere of installed equipment which can be 
replaced or returned within the established startup criteria.
    (b) In addition to the above procedures, DOE organizations and 
contractors should encourage informal contacts between their technical 
staffs and those engaged in similar work at other DOE locations for the 
purpose of ascertaining the availability of Government property to meet 
their program requirements.

                        Subpart 109-45.1--General


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.101-50  Applicability.

    The provisions of FPMR 101-45 and this part are applicable to 
contractors authorized to dispose of surplus personal property.


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.103-1  Responsibilities of the General Services Administration.

    GSA regional offices are responsible for the conduct of sales of 
surplus and replacement property in the custody of DOE direct 
operations, except that DOE will continue to sell replacement property 
where trade-in offers are also involved in the transaction.


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.103-2  Responsibilities of holding agencies.

    See Secs. 109-45.105-3 and 109-45.3 for policy and procedures

<R05>
Sec. 109-45.105-3  Exemptions.

    The General Services Administration, by letter dated May 28, 1965, 
authorized DOE contractors to sell contractor inventory, including 
replacement property. This exemption is for sales of contractor 
inventory only. All surplus property in the custody of DOE direct 
operations (except replacement property where trade-in offers are 
involved) will be reported to GSA in accordance with FPMR Sec. 101-
45.303.


<R04>
               Subpart 109-45.3--Sale of Personal Property


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.301-50  Sales by DOE contractors.

    Sales of surplus contractor inventory will be made by DOE 
contractors when heads of field offices determine that it is in the best 
interests of the Government to do so.


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.302-50  Sales to DOE and contractor employees.

    (a) Employees of DOE and DOE contractors shall be afforded the same 
opportunity to acquire Government-owned property as is afforded the 
general public, provided the employees warrant in writing prior to award 
that they have not either directly or indirectly--
    (1) Participated in the determination to dispose of the property;
    (2) Participated in the preparation of the property for sale;
    (3) Participated in determining the method of sale; or
    (4) Obtained information not otherwise available to the general 
public regarding usage, condition, quality, or value of the property.
    (b) Special clothing and other articles of personal property 
acquired for the exclusive use of and fitted to an individual employee, 
when not otherwise usable by, and in all respects excess to the needs 
of, the holding organization, may be sold to DOE or contractor employees 
at the best price obtainable in the event of termination of their 
employment or their permanent assignment to duties not requiring such 
clothing or property.


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.303-50  Contractor reporting of property for sale.

    GSA normally initiates sales action from the items remaining as 
surplus after utilization and donation screening. In order to assure no 
misunderstanding at GSA regional offices as to who is to perform the 
sales function for contractor inventory, each Standard Form 120 report 
forwarded to GSA shall bear a capitalized notation in a prominent place 
reading either ``TO BE SOLD BY GSA'' or ``NOT TO BE SOLD BY GSA'' as 
appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.304-2-50  Negotiated sales and negotiated sales at fixed prices.

    (a) Negotiated sales, including purchases or retentions at less than 
cost by the contractor, may be made when the contracting officer 
determines and documents that the use of this method of sale is 
essential to expeditious contract closeout, or is otherwise justified on 
the basis of circumstances enumerated below, provided that the 
Government's interests are adequately protected. Negotiated sales, 
including purchases or retentions at less than cost by the contractor, 
shall be at prices which are fair and reasonable and not less than the 
proceeds which could reasonably be expected to be obtained if

[[Page 247]]

the property was offered for competitive sale. Specific conditions 
justifying negotiated sales are when--
    (1) No acceptable bids have been received as a result of competitive 
bidding under a suitably advertised sale;
    (2) Property is of such small value that the proceeds to be derived 
would not warrant the expense of a formal competitive sale;
    (3) The disposal will be to States, territories, possessions, 
political subdivisions thereof, or tax-supported agencies therein, and 
the estimated fair market value of the property and other satisfactory 
terms of disposal are obtained;
    (4) The specialized nature and limited use potential of the property 
would create negligible bidder interest;
    (5) Removal of the property would result in a significant reduction 
in value, or the accrual of disproportionate expense in handling; or
    (6) It can be clearly established that such action is in the best 
interests of the Government.
    (b) Negotiated sales at fixed prices. When determined to be in the 
best interests of the Government, heads of field offices may authorize 
fixed-price sale of contractor inventory by DOE contractors provided (1) 
the reasonable recovery value of the property to be sold to any one 
purchaser at any one time does not exceed $1000, (2) adequate procedures 
for publicizing such sales have been established, (3) the sales prices 
are not less than could reasonably be expected if competitive bid sales 
were employed and the prices have been approved by a reviewing authority 
designated by the heads of field offices, and (4) the warranty 
prescribed in Sec. 109-45.302-50(a) is obtained when sales are made to 
employees.


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.304-6  Reviewing authority.

    The reviewing authority required under FPMR Sec. 101-45.304-6 may 
consist of one or more persons designated by the head of the field 
office who will be responsible for providing an adequate and independent 
review of proposed sales for the purpose of determining whether--
    (a) The method of sale is in accordance with established policies 
and procedures; and
    (b) Proceeds constitute a reasonable return for the property sold.


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.304-50  Processing bids and award of contract.

    The procedures established in Federal Acquisition Regulation 14.4 
and DEAR 914.4 shall be made applicable to execution, receipt, 
safeguarding, opening, abstracting, and evaluation of bids and awarding 
contracts, except that in evaluating bids and awarding contracts, 
disposal under conditions most advantageous to the Government based on 
high bids received shall be the determining factor. For mistakes in 
bids, see FPMR 101-45.8.


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.304-51  Documentation.

    Files pertaining to sales shall contain copies of all documents 
necessary to provide a complete record of the transaction and as a 
minimum shall include the following:
    (a) A copy of request for proposals if written proposals are 
employed.
    (b) A list of prospective bidders contacted.
    (c) An abstract of proposals received, whether oral or written.
    (d) Copies of written proposals or confirming proposals received, 
including Standard Forms 119 (see FPMR Sec. 101-45.313-9) which have 
been received from prospective bidders, together with other relevant 
information.
    (e) A notation concerning basis for determination that proceeds 
constitute a reasonable return for property sold.
    (f) Full and adequate justification for not advertising for 
competitive bids when the fair market value of property sold in this 
manner in any one case exceeds $1,000.
    (g) A notation concerning any award made to other than the high 
bidder.
    (h) The approval of reviewing authority when required.
    (i) A copy of notice of award.
    (j) All related correspondence.
    (k) In the case of auction or spot bid sales, the following 
additional information should be included:
    (1) A list of items or lots sold indicating book cost and sales 
price for each item or lot sold.
    (2) A copy of advertising literature distributed to prospective 
bidders.

[[Page 248]]

    (3) A summary listing of advertising by means of newspapers, radio, 
television, public posting, etc.
    (4) The names of prospective bidders who attended sale if list was 
made.

other items which offer potential as marketable materials and for 
economic returns to the Government. (See FPMR Parts 101-42 and Part 109-
42 for recovery of precious metals and reporting requirements.)
    (b) Scrap metals shall be segregated to the maximum economical 
extent consistent with good industrial practice.
    (c) Scrap metal which is contaminated with radioactive material and/
or chemically hazardous materials shall be segregated and appropriately

    (a) The finding required by FPMR Sec. 101-45.501-1(a) that property 
has no commercial value or the estimated cost of its continued care and 
handling would exceed the estimated proceeds from its sale shall be in 
writing and shall be made by an official designated by the head of the 
field office concerned.


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.501-2  Reviewing authority.

    The head of the field office concerned will be the reviewing 
authority for approval to abandon or destroy property with an

which has been radioactively or chemically contaminated.

[[Page 249]]


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.5002  Policy.

    When the holding organization determines it is appropriate to 
dispose of contaminated personal property, such contaminated personal 
property shall be disposed of by DOE in accordance with appropriate 
Federal regulations governing radiation/chemical exposure to the public 
and contamination in the environment. In special cases where Federal 
regulations do not exist or apply, appropriate national consensus

<R05>
Sec. 109-45.5004-1  Suspect personal property.

    (a) Each excess item of personal property (including scrap), having 
a history of use in an area where exposure to radioactively or 
chemically contaminated materials may occur, shall be considered suspect 
and shall be monitored using appropriate instruments and techniques by 
qualified personnel of the DOE office or contractor generating the 
excess.
    (b) Prior to utilization or disposal outside DOE, with due 
consideration to the economic factors involved, every effort shall be 
made to reduce the level of contamination of items of excess or surplus 
property to the lowest practicable level.
    (c) If contamination is suspect and the property is of such size, 
construction, or location as to make the contamination inaccessible for 
the purpose of measurement, such property shall not be utilized or 
disposed of outside DOE through normal channels.


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.5004-2  Handled as uncontaminated equipment.

    If monitoring of suspect equipment indicates that the contamination 
does not exceed applicable standards, it may be utilized and disposed of 
in the same manner as uncontaminated equipment, provided the guidance in 
Sec. 109-45.5004-1(b) has been considered. However, recipients shall be 
advised where levels of radioactive contamination require specific 
controls for shipment as provided in Department of Transportation 
Regulations for shipment of radioactive materials (49 CFR parts 171-179, 
inclusive). In addition, when any contaminated equipment is circularized 
within DOE, reported to GSA, or otherwise disposed of, the kind and 
degree of contamination must be plainly indicated on all pertinent 
documents.

Subpart 109-45.51--Disposal of Excess Personal Property in Foreign Areas


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.5100  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart sets forth policies and procedures governing the 
disposal of DOE-owned foreign excess and surplus personal property.


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.5101  Authority.

    The policies and procedures contained in this subpart are issued 
pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Property and Administrative 
Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 471). Title IV of that Act 
entitled ``Foreign Excess Property'' provides that, except where 
commitments exist under previous agreements, all excess property located 
in foreign areas shall be disposed of by the owning agency, and directs 
that the head of such agency conform to the foreign policy of the United 
States in making such disposals.


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.5102  General.

    Disposal of Government-owned property in the custody of DOE 
organizations or its contractors in foreign areas

[[Page 250]]

shall be made in an efficient and economical manner, and in conformance 
with the foreign policy of the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.5103  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, the following definitions apply:
    (a) Foreign means outside the United States, Puerto Rico, American 
Samoa, Guam, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and the Virgin 
Islands.
    (b) Foreign service post means the local diplomatic or consular post 
in the area where the excess property is located.


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.5104  Responsibilities.


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.5104-1  Director of Procurement and Assistance Management.

    The Director of Procurement and Assistance Management develops and 
interprets policies, principles, and general procedures for the disposal 
of excess property in foreign areas.


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.5104-2  Heads of offices in foreign areas.

    Heads of DOE foreign offices--
    (a) Are authorized to handle foreign excess disposal matters in 
accordance with Title IV, ``Foreign Excess Property'' of the Federal 
Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended and this 
subpart;
    (b) Shall refer to the Property and Equipment Management Division 
(MA-422), any requests for advice or approval of the State Department on 
proposed disposals of excess property in foreign areas for review, 
coordination and handling through appropriate channels; and
    (c) Shall approve the exchange or lease of foreign excess property 
when in their opinion such action is clearly in the best interest of the 
Government as provided in Sec. 109-45.5105-2(b).


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.5105  Disposal.


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.5105-1  General.

    (a) Foreign excess property which is not required for transfer 
within DOE or to other U.S. Government agencies shall be considered 
surplus and may be disposed of by transfer, sale, exchange, or lease, 
for cash, credit, or other property and upon such other terms and 
conditions as may be deemed proper. Such property may also be donated, 
abandoned, or destroyed under the conditions specified in Sec. 109-
45.5105-2(c). Most foreign governments have indicated to the State 
Department that they wish to be consulted before U.S. Government 
property is disposed of in their countries (except in the case of 
transfers to other U.S. Government agencies). Matters concerning customs 
duties and taxes, or similar charges, may require prior agreement with 
the foreign government involved. The State Department shall be contacted 
in regard to these problems. Whenever advice or approval of the State 
Department is required by this subpart, it may be obtained either 
through the foreign service post in the foreign area involved or from 
the State Department in Washington, D.C. If the problem is to be 
presented to the State Department in Washington, D.C., it shall be 
referred through appropriate administrative channels to the Director of 
Procurement and Assistance Management, for review, coordination and 
handling.
    (b) Foreign excess property which is not transferred for use may be 
transferred to other U.S. Government agencies for disposal. This 
procedure may often prove advantageous, particularly when only small 
amounts of property are involved or when personnel of the other agencies 
are generally engaged in disposal activities.


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.5105-2  Methods of disposal.

    (a) Sales of foreign excess shall be conducted in accordance with 
the following guidelines:
    (1) Generally, all sales of surplus foreign excess property shall be 
conducted under the competitive bid process unless it is advantageous 
and more practicable to the Government not to do so. When competitive 
bids are not solicited, reasonable inquiry of prospective purchasers 
shall be made in order that sales may be made on terms most advantageous 
to the U.S. Government.
    (2) In no event shall any property be sold in foreign areas without 
a condition which states that its importation into the United States is 
forbidden unless the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture

[[Page 251]]

(in the case of any agricultural commodity, food, or cotton or woolen 
goods), or the U.S. Secretary of Commerce (in the case of any other 
property), determines or has determined that the importation of such 
property would relieve domestic shortages or otherwise be beneficial to 
the economy of the United States.
    (3) Sales documents shall provide that the purchaser must pay any 
import duties or taxes levied against property sold in the country 
involved and further provide that the amount of this duty or tax shall 
not be included as a part of the price paid the U.S. Government for the 
property. In the event the levy is placed upon the seller by law, the 
buyer will be required to pay all such duties or taxes and furnish the 
seller copies of his receipt prior to the release of the property to 
him. However, if the foreign government involved will not accept payment 
from the buyer, the seller will collect the duties or taxes and turn the 
amounts collected over to the foreign government. Accounting for the 
amounts collected shall be coordinated with the disbursing officer of 
the nearest United States foreign service post. The property shall not 
be released to the purchaser until the disposal officer is satisfied 
that there is no responsibility for payment by the United States (as 
contrasted to collection by the United States) of taxes, duties, 
excises, etc.
    (4) Certain categories of property, including small arms and machine 
guns; artillary and projectiles; ammunition, bombs, torpedoes, rockets 
and guided missiles; fire control equipment and range finders; tanks and 
ordnance vehicles; chemical and biological agents, propellents and 
explosives; vessels of war and special naval equipment; aircraft and all 
components, parts and accessories for aircraft; military electronic 
equipment; aerial cameras, military photo-interpretation, stereoscopic 
plotting and photogrammetry equipment; and all material not enumerated 
which is classified from the standpoint of military security (United 
States Munitions List, 22 CFR 121.01), are subject to restrictions as to 
disposal. Advance approval must be obtained from the State Department 
for the sale of all such articles. Therefore, prior to the sale of any 
of the articles enumerated in the U.S. Munitions List, the foreign 
service post in the area shall be consulted.
    (5) Prior to the sale of property which had a total acquisition cost 
of $250,000 or more, plans for such sale shall be reported to the 
Property and Equipment Management Division (MA-422) in ample time to 
allow considerations of possible foreign policy aspects and advice 
thereon from the State Department. (See Sec. 109-45.5106(a)). All 
proposed sales, regardless of the total acquisition cost of the property 
involved, which the head of the DOE foreign office believes might have a 
significant effect on the economic or political situation in a 
particular area, shall be discussed with the foreign service post.
    (b) While there is authority for exchange or lease of foreign 
surplus property, such authority shall be exercised only when such 
action is clearly in the best interests of the U.S. Government. 
Disposals by exchange are subject to the same requirements as disposals 
by sale under Sec. 109-45.5105-2(a).
    (c) Foreign excess or surplus property (including waste, salvage, 
and scrap) may be donated, abandoned, or destroyed provided (1) the 
property has no commercial value, or the estimated cost of its care and 
handling would exceed the estimated proceeds from its sale, and (2) a 
written finding to that effect is made and approved by the head of the 
DOE foreign office. No property shall be abandoned or destroyed if 
donation is feasible. Donations under these conditions may be made to 
any agency of the U.S. Government, or to educational, public health or 
charitable nonprofit organizations of governments. Foreign excess 
property may also be abandoned or destroyed when such action is required 
by military necessity, safety, or considerations of health or security. 
A written statement explaining the basis for disposal by this means and 
approval by the head of the DOE foreign office is required. Property 
shall not be abandoned or destroyed in a manner which is detrimental or 
dangerous to public health and safety, or which will cause infringement 
on the rights of other persons.

[[Page 252]]


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.5106  Reports.

    (a) Proposed sales of foreign excess property having an acquisition 
cost of $250,000 or more reported to the Property and Equipment 
Management Division (MA-422) should present all pertinent data, 
including the following:
    (1) The description of property to be sold, including--
    (i) Identification of property (description should be in terms 
understandable to persons not expert in technical nomenclature); 
property covered by the Munitions List and regulations pertaining 
thereto (as published in 22 CFR 121.01) should be clearly indicated;
    (ii) Quantity;
    (iii) Condition; and
    (iv) Acquisition cost.
    (2) The proposed method of sale (i.e., bid, negotiated sale, etc.).
    (3) Any currency to be received and payment provisions (i.e., U.S. 
dollars, foreign currency, or credit, including terms of proposed 
agreement).
    (4) Any restrictions on use of property to be sold (such as 
retransfer of property, disposal as scrap, demilitarization, etc.).
    (5) Any special terms.
    (6) The categories of prospective purchasers (e.g., host country, 
other foreign countries, special qualifications, etc.).
    (7) How taxes, excises, duties, etc. will be handled.
    (b) Instructions for reporting foreign excess utilization and 
disposal transactions are contained in Chapter III of the DOE Accounting 
Practices and Procedures Handbook.

<R05>
Sec. 109-50.400  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart contains guidance to be followed when it is proposed to 
sell or otherwise transfer DOE personal property located in a mixed 
facility to the contractor who is the operator of that facility.


<R05>
Sec. 109-50.401  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, the following definitions apply:
    (a) DOE property is the DOE-owned personal property in a mixed 
facility.
    (b) Contractor is the operator of the mixed facility.
    (c) Mixed facility is a partly DOE-owned and partly contractor-owned 
facility. For purposes of this subpart, however, this definition does 
not apply to such a facility operated by an educational or other 
nonprofit institution under a basic research contract with DOE.
Sec. 109-50.402  Responsibilities and authorities.


<R05>
Sec. 109-50.402-1  Director of Procurement and Assistance Management.

    The Director of Procurement and Assistance Management is authorized 
to approve proposals for the programmatic disposal of DOE personal 
property in a mixed facility to the contractor operating that facility.


<R05>
Sec. 109-50.402-2  Heads of Headquarters program organizations.

    Heads of Headquarters program organizations shall review and forward 
to the Property and Equipment Management Division (MA-422) for approval, 
proposals for programmatic disposal of DOE personal property in a mixed 
facility to the contractor operating that facility.


<R05>
Sec. 109-50.402-3  Heads of field offices and contracting officers.

    Heads of field offices and contracting officers shall submit 
proposals involving programmatic disposals of DOE property in mixed 
facilities through appropriate administrative channels to the cognizant 
Headquarters program organization for review and forwarding for 
approval.


<R05>
Sec. 109-50.403  Programmatic disposal of DOE property in mixed facilities.


<R05>
Sec. 109-50.403-1  Submission of proposals.

    Proposals involving programmatic disposals for DOE personal property 
in mixed facilities to contractors operating the facility shall be 
forwarded through the appropriate program organization to the Property 
and Equipment Management Division (MA-422) for review and processing for 
approval. Each such request for review and approval shall include all 
information necessary for a proper evaluation of the proposal. The 
proposal shall include, as a minimum--
    (a) The purpose of the mixed facility;
    (b) The character, condition and present use of the DOE property 
involved, as well as its acquisition cost, accumulated depreciation, and 
net book value;
    (c) The programmatic benefits which would acrue to DOE from the 
disposal to the contractor (including the considerations which become 
important if the disposal is not made);
    (d) The appraised value of the DOE property (preferably by 
independent appraisers); and
    (e) The proposed terms and conditions of disposal (covering for 
example,

[[Page 258]]

(1) price, (2) priority to be given work for DOE requiring the use of 
the transferred property, and including the basis for any proposed 
charge to DOE for amortizing the cost of plant and equipment items, (3) 
recapture of the property if DOE foresees a possible future urgent need, 
and (4) delivery of the property, whether ``as is-where is,'' etc.).

Sec. 109-50.403-2  Need to establish DOE program benefit.

    When approval for a proposed programmatic disposal of DOE personal 
property in a mixed facility is being sought, it must be established 
that the disposal will benefit a DOE program. For example, approval 
might be contingent on a showing that--
    (a) The entry of the contractor as a private concern into the energy 
program is important and significant from a programmatic standpoint; and
    (b) The sale of property to the contractor will remove obstacles 
which otherwise discourage his entry into the field.


<R05>
Sec. 109-50.404  Notification.

    The Under Secretary will be advised prior to any disposal which is 
considered sensitive.

<R05>
Sec. 109-51.000  Scope of part.

    This part prescribes the policy and conditions for loans of 
industrial plant equipment (IPE) from the Department of Defense General 
Reserve under the management of the Defense Industrial Plant Equipment 
Center (DIPEC) and makes reference to the DOE DIPEC Handbook which 
prescribes procedures for arranging loans of IPE from DIPEC.


<R05>
Sec. 109-51.001  Policy.

    Since loan of DIPEC equipment is at no cost, except for packing, 
crating, handling, and transportation charges, DOE field organizations 
and contractors are encouraged to use DIPEC as a source of industrial 
plant equipment in lieu of purchasing such equipment.


<R05>
Sec. 109-51.002  Memorandum of Agreement.

    An agreement between DOE and the Defense Logistics Agency 
establishes the policies, procedures and conditions by which DOE may 
obtain loans of IPE from DIPEC. (Exhibit A of the DIPEC Handbook).


<R05>
Sec. 109-51.003  General provisions.

    (a) DOE field organizations and contractors may requisition IPE on a 
loan basis for periods up to five years. The IPE loan period may be 
extended on mutual agreement between DIPEC and the DOE field office 
involved.
    (b) DOE has a 30-day period to accept or reject IPE placed on hold 
by DIPEC.
    (c) DOE field organizations or contractors will pay costs of 
transportation, dismantling, crating and handling of IPE from and to 
DOD.
    (d) On completion of the loan period, the DOE field organization or 
contractor shall return the DIPEC-IPE in the same condition as received 
except for fair wear and tear.
    (e) DOE is required under terms of the agreement to decontaminate 
IPE prior to return or replace the equipment with an equivalent item.


<R05>
Sec. 109-51.004  DIPEC Handbook.

    The DIPEC Handbook is available through field organizations or by 
request to the Property and Equipment Management Division (MA-422). The 
Handbook cites the procedures for arranging loan of IPE, illustrates the 
forms used and provides a bibliography of DIPEC publications which list 
the available IPE by type of equipment and by DIPEC control numbers.

<R05>
Sec. 109-60.000  Scope and applicability of part.

    This part sets forth the minimum requirements to be observed by off-
site contractors in establishing and maintaining control over Government 
property provided pursuant to a contract with DOE. This part does not 
apply to transportation contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, 
contracts with state and local governments, and to operating and on-site 
service contractors. To the extent of any inconsistency between this 
part and the terms of the contract under which the Government property 
is provided, the terms of the contract shall govern.


<R05>
Sec. 109-60.001  Definitions.

    As used in this part the following definitions apply:

[[Page 261]]

    (a) Accessory item means an item that facilitates or enhances the 
operation of capitalized equipment but which is not essential for its 
operation, such as remote control devices.
    (b) Auxiliary item means an item without which the basic unit of 
equipment cannot operate, such as motors for pump and machine tools.
    (c) Capital equipment means personal property items having a unit 
acquisition cost of generally $1,000.00 or more and an anticipated 
service life in excess of one (1) year, regardless of type of funding, 
are not properly chargeable to buildings or utilities, and having the 
potential for maintaining their integrity as capital items, i.e., not 
expendable due to use.
    (d) Government personal property means all property provided at 
Goverment expense for performance of the contract, regardless of the 
method by which it is provided, including rented or leased equipment, 
except real property, records of the Federal Government, nuclear and 
special source materials, and atomic weapons and by-product materials.
    (1) Government-furnished property means property in the possession 
of or directly acquired by the Government and subsequently made 
available to the contractor for use in performance of the contract.
    (2) Contractor-acquired Government property means property acquired 
or otherwise provided by the contractor for performance of a contract 
and to which the Government has title or the right to take title under 
the contract terms.
    (e) Materials means property which may be incorporated into or 
attached to an end item to be delivered under a contract or which may be 
consumed or expended in normal use in the performance of a contract. It 
includes, but is not limited to, raw and processed material, parts, 
components, assemblies, or supplies.
    (f) Property administrator means an authorized representative of the 
contracting officer assigned to administer the contract requirements and 
obligations relative to Government property. If an authorized 
representative has not been designated as the property administrator, 
the contracting officer is the property administrator.
    (g) Plant and equipment means land, land rights, depletable 
resources, improvements to land, buildings and structures, utilities, 
and capital equipment having an anticipated service life of 1 year or 
more, the individual units of which satisfy the monetary and other 
criteria for capital charges and which therefore justify the maintenance 
of continuing plant and equipment records.
    (h) Salvage means that property which has some value in excess of 
its basic material content but which is in such condition that it has no 
reasonable prospect of use for any purpose as a unit and its repair or 
rehabilitation for use is clearly impracticable.
    (i) Scrap means property that has no value except for the 
recoverable value of its basic material content.
    (j) Sensitive items means those items of property which are 
susceptible to being appropriated for personal use or which can be 
readily converted to cash. Examples are firearms, photographic 
equipment, binoculars, tape recorders, calculators, and power tools.
    (k) Special test equipment means either single or multipurpose 
integrated test units engineered, designed, fabricated, or modified to 
accomplish special purpose testing in the performance of a contract. It 
consists of items or assemblies of equipment that are interconnected and 
interdependent so as to become a new functional entity for special 
testing purposes. It does not include material, special tooling, 
facilities (except foundations and similar improvements necessary for 
the installation of special test equipment), and equipment items used 
for general testing purposes.
    (l) Special tooling means jigs, dies, fixtures, molds, patterns, 
taps, gauges, other equipment and manufacturing aids, all components of 
these items, and replacement of these items, which are of such a 
specialized nature that without substantial modification or alteration 
their use is limited to the development or production of particular 
supplies or parts thereof or the performance of particular services. It 
does not include material, special test

[[Page 262]]

equipment, facilities (except foundations and similar improvements 
necessary for the installation of special tooling), general or special 
machine tools, or similar capital items.


<R04>
              Subpart 109-60.1--Contractor's Responsibility


<R05>
Sec. 109-60.100  General.

    (a) The contractor is directly responsible and accountable for all 
Government property in its possession or control in accordance with the 
provisions of the contract, including property provided under such 
contract which may be in the possession or control of a subcontractor. 
The contractor shall establish and maintain a system, in accordance with 
the provisions of this part, to control, protect, preserve and maintain 
all Government property. If the contractor is expected to acquire and be 
accountable for, or does acquire Government personal property with an 
acquisition value of $500,000 or more, the contractor's property 
management system shall be in writing. Contractors holding Government 
personal property with an acquisition value of less than $500,000 may, 
at the discretion of the contracting officer, be required to have their 
property management system in writing. The requirement for written 
systems may be waived in writing by the contracting officer where the 
contracting officer determines that maintenance of a written system is 
unnecessary. The system shall be reviewed and if satisfactory, approved 
in writing by the contracting officer.
    (b) The contractor shall maintain and make available such records as 
are required by subpart 109-60.2 and shall account for all Government 
property until relieved of that responsibility. Liability for loss, 
damage, or improper use of property in a given instance will depend upon 
all the circumstances surrounding the particular case and will be 
determined in accordance with the provisions of the contract. The 
contractor shall furnish all data necessary to substantiate any request 
for discharge from responsibility.
    (c) The contractor shall require subcontractors provided Government 
property under the prime contract to comply with the provisions of this 
part. Procedures for assuring subcontractor compliance shall be included 
in the contractor's property control system.
    (d) If any portion of the contractor's property control system is 
found to be inadequate upon review by the property administrator, 
necessary corrective action will be accomplished by the contractor prior 
to approval of the system. When agreement as to adequacy of control or 
corrective action cannot be reached between the contractor and the 
property administrator, the matter will be referred to the contracting 
officer.
    (e) The property records and the premises where any Government 
property is located shall be accessible to the property administrator or 
other authorized representative during contract performance, at contract 
completion or termination, or at all reasonable times. The contractor's 
property control system is subject to audit by the Government as often 
as circumstances warrant during the contract's performance, at its 
completion or termination, or at any time thereafter while the 
contractor is required to retain the contract records. All these 
records, including related correspondence, shall be made available to 
the auditors.


<R05>
Sec. 109-60.101  Assumption of responsibility.

    (a) The contractor becomes responsible for Government-furnished 
property upon its delivery into the contractor's custody or control. For 
contractor-acquired Government property, the contractor assumes 
responsibility in accordance with the property provisions of the 
contract.
    (b) All Government-furnished property shall be inspected and checked 
promptly at the time of receipt. Any visible or other external evidence 
of damage or error in quantity should be noted on the waybill with the 
signature of the carrier's agent. As soon as possible, the contractor 
shall send the contracting officer a full report of the damage or 
quantity error, including extent, apparent cause, and the estimated cost 
of repairs. The contracting officer will advise the contractor of the 
action to be taken.

[[Page 263]]

    (c) It is the contractor's responsibility to inspect, at the time of 
receipt, all property not furnished by the government that is acquired 
in the performance of the contract, and to take any necessary action 
with the vendor and/or carrier if there should be any damage or error in 
quantity.
    (d) Procedures shall be established to protect any warranty rights 
which accrue to the Government with the acquisition of Government 
property.


<R05>
Sec. 109-60.102  Contractor's liability.

    (a) Subject to the terms of the contract, the contractor may be 
liable for shortage, loss, damage, or destruction of Government property 
or when there is evidence of improper or unreasonable use or consumption 
of Government property.
    (b) The contractor shall report promptly to the property 
administrator any shortage, loss, damage, or destruction of Government 
property in its possession or control, or in the possession or control 
of any subcontractor, together with all the facts and circumstances of 
the case.
    (c) Any loss that may be due to theft shall be reported by the 
contractor immediately to the local police and/or Federal Bureau of 
Investigation and the property administrator.


<R05>
Sec. 109-60.103  Segregation of Government property.

    Ordinarily, provisions shall be made by the contractor to keep 
Government property segregated from contractor-owned property. 
Commingling of Government and contractor-owned property may be allowed 
only when the segregation of the property would materially hinder the 
progress of the work, (e.g., segregation is not feasible for reasons 
such as quantities, lack of space, or costs caused by additional 
handling), and where control procedures are adequate, i.e., the 
Government property is identified as being Government property. 
Commingling must be approved in advance by the property administrator, 
In case of research and development contracts with educational 
institutions, commingling is authorized without the requirement for 
advance approval unless physical segregation is otherwise required by 
the contracting officer.


<R05>
Sec. 109-60.104  Physical protection of property.

    (a) Controls such as property pass systems, memorandum records, 
marking of tools, regular or intermittent gate checks and perimeter 
fencing shall be implemented, recognizing the value of the property, to 
prevent loss, theft, or unauthorized movement of Government property 
from the premises on which such property is located.
    (b) Classified Government property will be handled in accordance 
with instructions of the contracting officer.

provided to the property administrator for review and approval.
    (b) At a minimum, controls on sensitive property shall include 
property records, memorandum receipts, bin or tool check systems, or 
combinations thereof. Procedures shall provide for physical inventories 
at least once each year, and methods for adjustment of inventory levels 
due to losses, thefts and damage. More frequent inventories of sensitive 
property may be necessary where the value of the property, degree of 
security achieved, or loss experience indicates greater controls are 
required in order to protect the Government's interest. Such procedures 
and practices shall be subject to review and approval by the property 
administrator.

contractor. Property identification numbers will be recorded on all 
applicable receiving, shipping, and disposal documents, and any other 
documents pertaining to the property control system where practicable.

<R05>
Sec. 109-60.400  General.

    The contractor shall periodically physically inventory Government 
property in its possession or control and shall require such inventories 
of property held by subcontractors. The physical inventory shall be 
consistent with approved contractor procedures and generally accepted 
accounting principles. Procedures that are limited solely to a check-off 
of a listing of recorded property do not meet the requirements of a 
physical inventory. Personnel who perform the physical inventory shall 
not be the same individuals who maintain the property records or have 
custody of the property unless the contractor's operation is too small 
to do otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 109-60.401  Frequency.

    Physical inventories of permanently affixed plant (such as fencing, 
buildings, other structures, utilities and systems) are to be taken not 
less frequently than every 10 years. Inventories of movable capital 
equipment are to be taken not less frequently than every 2 years. 
Inventories of sensitive items (capital and non-capital) shall be taken 
not less frequently than annually. Substantial quantities of materials 
(stores) held under inventory control shall be inventoried annually. 
Small quantities of material representing bench stock need not be 
inventoried.


<R05>
Sec. 109-60.402  Reporting results of inventories.

    The contractor shall, at a minimum, submit to the property 
administrator a listing of all discrepancies disclosed by a physical 
inventory, and a signed statement that the physical inventory was 
completed on a certain date and that the official property records were 
found to be in agreement with the physical inventory, except for the 
discrepancies reported. As a minimum, the discrepancy listing shall 
contain the property number, nomenclature,

[[Page 267]]

and unit cost. The listing and signed statement shall be furnished with 
a minimum of delay after completion of the physical inventory, but no 
later than 60 days after its completion.


<R05>
Sec. 109-60.403  Records of inventories.

    Appropriate inventory records and reports shall be maintained and 
will serve as a basis for (a) effecting maximum utilization of available 
property, (b) prompt identification and reporting of excess property, 
(c) effective physical protection of property, and (d) the preparation 
of special and recurring reports. Full use will be made of accounting 
records and reports to avoid duplication.


<R05>
Sec. 109-60.404  Inventories upon termination or completion.

    (a) Immediately upon termination or completion of a contract, the 
contractor shall submit an inventory report adequate for determining 
appropriate disposal of all Government property applicable to the 
terminated or completed contract. Further, this report shall include an 
inventory report of all Government property in a subcontractor's 
possession or control which is also applicable to the terminated or 
completed contract. This inventory report will be submitted to the 
property administrator for verification and disposition action.
    (b) Exception. The requirement for physical inventory of Government 
property at the completion of a contract may be waived by the 
contracting officer when the property is authorized for use on a follow-
on contract, provided that--
    (1) Past experience has established the adequacy of property 
controls; and
    (2) A statement is provided by the contractor indicating that 
transfer of record balances has been made in lieu of preparing a formal 
inventory list and the contractor accepts responsibility and 
accountability for those balances under the terms of the follow-on 
contract.

<R05>
Sec. 109-60.500  General.

    The contractor shall be responsible for the proper care and 
maintenance of Government property in its possession or control from the 
time of receipt until properly relieved of responsibility. The removal 
of Government property to storage, or its contemplated transfer, does 
not relieve the contractor of these responsibilities.


<R05>
Sec. 109-60.501  Contractor's maintenance program.

    The contractor's maintenance program shall be consistent with sound 
economic industrial practice, the manufacturer's recommendation, and the 
terms of the contract, and shall include the following:
    (a) Preventive maintenance. Preventive maintenance is generally 
performed on a regularly scheduled basis in order to detect and correct 
unfavorable conditions or defects before they result in breakdowns and 
to maximize the useful life of the equipment. An effective preventive 
maintenance program shall consist of, but not be limited to--
    (1) Inspection of equipment at periodic intervals to detect 
maladjustment, wear, or impending breakdown;
    (2) Regular lubrication of bearings and moving parts in accordance 
with a lubrication plan;
    (3) Adjustments for wear, repair, or replacement of worn or damaged 
parts and the elimination of causes of deterioration;
    (4) Removal of sludge, chips, and cutting oils from equipment which 
will not be used for a period of time;

contamination and corrosion; and
    (6) Proper storage and preservation of accessories and special tools 
furnished with an item of equipment but not regularly used with it.
    (b) Major repairs or rehabilitation. The maintenance program of the 
contractor shall provide for the disclosure and reporting to the 
property administrator

[[Page 268]]

of the need for major repairs, replacement, and other rehabilitation 
work on Government property in its possession or control.
    (c) Records of maintenance. The contractor shall keep records 
sufficient to disclose the maintenance and repair performed and 
associated cost.

surrounding loss, theft, destruction, or damage. The retirement work 
order shall be signed by the responsible contractor administrative 
official initiating the report and reviewed and approved by an official 
at least one supervisory echelon above the official initiating the 
report, and the property administrator. Detailed information concerning 
the retention and/or submission of retirement work orders will be 
furnished by the property administrator.

<R05>
Sec. 115-1.100   Scope of subpart.

    This subpart establishes the Environmental Protection Agency 
Property Management Regulations (EPPMR), chapter 115 of the Federal 
Property Management Regulations System (FPMR) (41 CFR chapter 101); 
states its relationship to the FPMR, and provides instructions governing

<R05>
Sec. 115-1.104-50   Publication of EPPMR.

    (a) Material published in the EPPMR will generally not be of 
interest to nor directly affect the public. Therefore, most EPPMR 
material will not be published in the Federal Register.
    (b) Arrows printed in the margin of a page indicate material 
changed, deleted, or added by the EPPMR Transmittal Notice cited at the 
bottom of that page. (See GSA, FPMR Amendment Transmittal pages for

Sec. 115-1.108   Agency implementation and supplementation of FPMR.

    (a) EPPMR implements and supplements the FPMR and follows the FPMR 
in style, arrangement and numbering sequence. Except to assure 
continuity and understanding FPMR material will not be repeated or 
paraphrased in the EPPMR.
    (b) Implementing material expands upon related material in the FPMR. 
Supplementing material deals with subject material not covered in the 
FPMR.


<R05>
Sec. 115-1.109   Numbering in FPMR system.

    (a) The numbering system used in EPPMR conforms to that of the FPMR 
except for the chapter number. The first three digits represent the 
Chapter number assigned to this Agency in title 41, Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR). In FPMR the chapter number is 101 and in EPPMR the 
Chapter number is 115.
    (b) Where EPA Chapter 115 implements Chapter 101 the material will 
be numbered and captioned to correspond to the FPMR part, subpart, 
section or subsection, e.g., 115-1.106 ``Applicability of FPMR'' 
implements 101-1.106 of FPMR.
    (c) Where Chapter 115 supplements the FPMR and deals with subject 
matter not contained in the FPMR, the EPPMR material is numbered to 
follow that which is most closely related to similar material in the 
FPMR, Supplementing material is numbered ``50'' or higher.


<R05>
Sec. 115-1.110   Deviations.

    Where deemed necessary that regulations set forth in the FPMR or 
EPPMR be changed in the interest of program effectiveness, a proposed 
revision will be submitted in accordance with FPR Sec. 1-1.009, to the 
Division of Data and Support Systems (DSSD) for review and 
consideration.

                   Subpart 128-1.1--Regulation System


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.100   Scope of subpart.

    This subpart introduces the Department of Justice Property 
Management Regulations (JPMR) as part of the Federal Property Management 
Regulations System (FPMR) (41 CFR part 101); states its relationship to 
the FPMR; and provides instructions for the issuance and use of these 
property management policies and procedures of the Department of 
Justice.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.101   Justice Property Management Regulations.

    The JPMR, established in this subpart, implement and supplement, as 
necessary, the FPMR provisions governing the acquisition, utilization, 
management, and disposal of real and personal property. The JPMR are 
issued to establish uniform property management policies, regulations, 
and, as necessary, procedures in the Department of Justice.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.105   Authority for JPMR.

    The Department of Justice Property Management Regulations are 
prescribed by the Assistant Attorney General for Administration under 
authority of 5 U.S.C. 301, 40 U.S.C. 486(c), 41 CFR 101-1.108, and 28 
CFR 0.75(j).


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.152   Citation.

    The JPMR will be cited in accordance with the Federal Register 
standards applicable to the FPMR. Accordingly, when this section is 
referred to formally in official documents, it should be cited as ``41 
CFR 128-1.152.'' When a section of the JPMR is referred to informally, 
however, it may be identified simply by ``JPMR'' followed by the 
complete paragraph reference number, e.g., ``JPMR 128-1.152.''

<R05>
Sec. 128-1.5002-1   Acquire.

    To procure, purchase, or obtain in any manner, except by lease, 
including transfer, donation or forfeiture, manufacture, or production

Administration; the Immigration and Naturalization Service; the Drug 
Enforcement Administration; the Bureau of Prisons; the Federal Prison 
Industries, Incorporated; and the Operations Support Staff (OSS) of the

<R05>
Sec. 128-1.5002-5   Personal property.

    Property of any kind or interest therein, except real and related 
property (as defined in FPMR 41 CFR 101-43.104-15), records of the 
Federal Government, and naval vessels, cruisers, aircraft-carriers, 
destroyers, and submarines (FPMR 41 CFR 101-43.104-13). For management 
and accounting control, personal property is categorized as follows:
    (a) ``Expendable personal property'' is that which, by its nature or 
function, is consumed in use; is used as repair parts or components of 
an end product considered nonexpendable; or has an expected service life 
of less than one year.
    (b) ``Non-expendable personal property'' is that which is complete 
within itself, does not lose its identity or become a component part of 
another article when put into use, and is of a durable nature with an 
expected service life one or more years.
    (c) ``Controlled personal property'' is that personal property for 
which good management practice dictates that it would be in the interest 
of the Government to assign and record accountability to assure the 
proper use, maintenance, protection and disposal of property for which 
the Government is responsible. Includes, but is not restricted to 
property which:
    (1) Is leased by, in the custody of, or is loaned to or from the 
Department.
    (2) Due to inherent attractiveness and/or portability is subject to 
a high probability of theft or misuse.
    (3) Is warranted, requires knowledge of age and/or previous repair 
data when determining whether repair or replacement is appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.5002-6   Personal property management.

    A system for controlling the acquisition, receipt, storage issue, 
utilization, maintenance, protection, accountability, and disposal of 
personal property to best satisfy the program needs of the Department.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.5002-7   Property management officer (PMO).

    An individual responsible for the overall administration, 
coordination, and control of the personal property management program of 
a bureau. The designation as PMO may or may not correspond to the 
individual's official job title.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.5002-8   Property custodian (PC).

    An individual responsible for the immediate physical custody of all 
personal property under his control and for providing documentation as 
required on all actions affecting the personal property within his 
jurisdiction. The designation as PC may or may not correspond to the 
individual's official job title.

[[Page 278]]


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.5002-9   Supply support system.

    The sum of all actions taken in providing buildings, equipment, 
supplies, and services to support program areas.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.5003   Primary authority and responsibility.

    (a) The Attorney General of the United States has the primary 
authority and responsibility for providing direction, leadership, and 
general supervision in the development and administration of an 
effective and efficient supply support system for the Department, to 
include:
    (1) The establishment of Department-wide policies, directions, 
regulations, and procedures satisfying the requirements of law, 
regulations, and sound management practice; and
    (2) The review, evaluation, and improvement of personal property 
management programs, functions, operations, and procedures throughout 
the Department.
    (b) Pursuant to 28 CFR 0.75 and subject to the general supervision 
of the Attorney General and the direction of the Deputy Attorney 
General, the functions described above are assigned to the Assistant 
Attorney General for Administration as delegations of authority.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.5004   Basis for delegations of authority and assignment of responsibilities.

    Certain personal property management functions can be performed by 
an individual only under a specific grant of authority to that 
individual. Other functions may be performed simply on the basis of 
general instructions or directions or by virtue of an individual 
occupying the position to which the responsibility for the function is 
assigned. In either situation, to eliminate excessive delay and to 
reduce unnecessary involvement of multiple management levels, it is 
considered generally desirable to place authority and responsibility for 
and to exercise property management actions at the lowest organizational 
unit practical. Accordingly, specific redelegations of the authority 
vested in the Assistant Attorney General for Administration are made to 
the heads of bureaus for the personal property management functions 
listed in Sec. 128-1.5005 below. The authority to prescribe and issue 
Department-wide policies, regulations, and procedures for personal 
property management is not redelegated and remains solely within the 
jurisdiction of the Assistant Attorney General for Administration.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.5005   Delegations of authority.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.5005-1   Primary delegations.

    The following authorities are redelegated to the heads of bureaus 
for use within their respective jurisdictions and shall be exercised in 
accordance with the policies and procedures established by the Assistant 
Attorney General for Administration.
    (a) Designating the PMO, for the bureau, within the following 
limitations:
    (1) Only one PMO is to be designated for the bureau, at the bureau 
level. Neither the title designation nor the responsibilities of the PMO 
are to be delegated below that level.
    (2) One or more PC's also may be designated for the bureau, 
depending upon the size and complexity of the organizational structure. 
Each PC is responsible solely for that property within his respective 
jurisdiction. The number and distribution of PC's designated is entirely 
at the option of the head of the bureau.
    (3) There is no restriction on designating a single individual as 
PMO and PC providing that the functions and responsibilities are 
compatible and are within the capabilities of a single person.
    (b) Authorizing exceptions to the FPMR use and replacement standards 
for office machines, furniture, furnishings and typewriters specified in 
Secs. 101-25.3 and 101-25.4.
    (c) Authorizing exceptions to FPMR replacement standards for 
materials handling equipment specified in Sec. 101-25.304.

    (h) Transferring property forfeited to the Government to other 
authorized recipients or requesting judicial transfer of such property 
from others to the bureau.
    (i) Determining fair market value of abandoned and other unclaimed 
property retained for official use by the bureau, for deposit to a 
special fund for reimbursement of owners.
    (j) Approving claims and reimbursing, less direct costs, former 
owners of abandoned or other unclaimed personal property which has been 
sold or retained for official use.
    (k) Recommending non-Federal grantee excess property screeners to 
GSA as required in FPMR 101-43.320(h).
    (l) When authorized by statutory authority, vesting title to 
Government-furnished personal property in contractors or grantees.
    (m) Acquiring excess personal property from other bureaus and from 
other Federal agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.5005-2   Redelegations of authority.

    (a) The authorities delegated by the Assistant Attorney General for 
Administration to heads of bureaus may, in turn, be redelegated as 
necessary to enable personal property management functions to be 
performed at the organizational level best equipped to handle such 
functions, unless otherwise prohibited by this regulation.
    (b) Such redelegations can be made without the specific approval of 
the Assistant Attorney General for Administration to deputies, principal 
administrative officers, heads of field offices and installations and 
their respective deputies. Such redelegations shall not conflict with 
the duties or responsibilities assigned to the PMO, or PC under the 
JPMR.

General for Administration in matters of personal property management 
which are not covered in this section shall continue in effect until

<R05>
Sec. 128-1.8000  Scope.

    This subpart establishes a Seismic Safety Program for the Department 
of Justice and sets forth the policies and procedures for obtaining 
compliance with Executive Order 12699 (Executive Order), ``Seismic 
Safety of Federal and Federally Assisted or Regulated New Building 
Construction.''

[[Page 281]]


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.8001  Background.

    The Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 (Act), 42 U.S.C. 7701, 
et seq., as amended, directs the Federal government to establish and 
maintain an effective earthquake hazards reduction program to reduce the 
risks to life and property from future earthquakes. Executive Order 
12699 implements certain provisions of the Act by requiring Federal 
agencies responsible for the design and construction of new buildings to 
develop and implement a seismic safety program. The regulations in this 
subpart implement the Executive Order, and apply to buildings designed 
and constructed under the responsibility of the Department of Justice. 
These regulations do not apply to buildings used by the Department and 
obtained, through purchase or lease, by the General Services 
Administration or other Federal agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.8002  Definitions of terms.

    (a) Construction documents--Detailed plans and specifications for 
the construction of a building.
    (b) Building--Any structure, fully or partially enclosed, used or 
intended for sheltering persons or property.

building, for which development of construction documents was initiated 
after January 5, 1990.
    (d) Leased building--A new building constructed expressly for lease 
by the Department of Justice, and for which the Department contracted 
with the lessor or owner to develop construction documents to meet the 
specifications of the Department.
    (e) Purchased building--A new building constructed expressly for 
purchase by the Department, and for which the Department contracted with 
the owner/developer to develop construction documents meeting the 
specifications of the Department.
    (f) Assisted or regulated building--A new building designed and 
constructed with funding assistance from the Department through Federal 
grants or loans, or guarantees of financing, through loan or mortgage 
insurance programs.
    (g) Covered building--a new building owned, leased, purchased, or 
assisted or regulated by the Department of Justice.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.8003  Objective.

    The Department shall comply with Executive Order 12699 for the 
purpose of reducing the risks to lives of occupants of new buildings 
owned by the Department, leased for Department uses, or purchased and 
constructed with assistance from the Department, and to other persons 
who would be affected by the failure of such buildings in earthquakes; 
improving the capability of essential new Department buildings to 
function during or after an earthquake; and protecting public 
investments in all covered buildings; all in a cost-effective manner.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.8004  Seismic Safety Coordinators.

    (a) The Justice Management Division shall designate an individual

Sec. 128-1.8005  Seismic safety standards.

    (a) To meet the building and construction requirements of this 
subpart, the Department, except as noted, adopts as its seismic safety 
standards the seismic safety levels set forth in the model building 
codes that the Interagency Committee on Seismic Safety in Construction 
(ICSSC) recognizes and recommends as appropriate for implementing the 
Executive Order. The ICSSC, as of the date of this rule, recognizes and 
recommends:
    (1) The 1991 International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO) 
Uniform Building Code (UBC);
    (2) The 1992 Supplement to the Building Officials and Code 
Administrators International (BOCA) National Building Code (NBC); and
    (3) The 1992 Amendments to the Southern Building Code Congress 
(SBCC) Standard Building Code (SBC).
    (b) The seismic design and construction of a covered building shall 
conform to the model code applicable in the locality where the building 
is constructed, unless:
    (1) The building code for the locality provides a higher level of 
seismic safety than provided by the appropriate model code, in which 
case the local code shall be utilized as the standard; or
    (2) The locality does not have seismic safety building requirements, 
in which case the ICSSC model building code appropriate for that 
geographic area shall be utilized as the standard.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.8006  Seismic Safety Program requirements.

    The Department Seismic Safety Coordinator and each Component Seismic 
Safety Coordinator shall ensure that an individual familiar with seismic 
design provisions of the Seismic Safety Standards (appropriate 
standards), or a professional, licensed engineer shall conduct the 
reviews required under this section, as appropriate.
    (a) New building projects--Construction documents initiated after 
August 12, 1993, and which apply to new construction projects, shall 
comply with the appropriate standards and shall be reviewed for 
compliance. Once the reviewer determines that the documents comply, the 
reviewer shall affix his/her signature and seal (if a licensed engineer) 
to the approved documents and provide a statement certifying compliance 
with the appropriate standards.
    (b) Existing building projects.--For new buildings with construction 
documents that were initiated prior to August 12, 1993, the documents 
shall be reviewed to determine whether they comply with the appropriate 
standards. If the reviewer determines that the documents comply with the 
standard, the reviewer shall affix his/her signature and seal (if a 
licensed engineer) to the approved documents and provide a statement 
certifying compliance with the appropriate standards. If the reviewer 
determines that seismic deficiencies exist, the appropriate Component 
Head shall ensure completion of one of the following:
    (1) For a new building project for which a contract for construction 
has

[[Page 283]]

not been awarded, the construction documents shall be revised to 
incorporate the appropriate standards. The revised construction 
documents shall then be reviewed for compliance. Once the reviewer 
determines that the documents comply with the standard, the reviewer 
shall affix his/her signature and seal (if a licensed engineer) to the 
approved documents and provide a statement certifying compliance with 
the Department standards.
    (2) For a new building under construction, or for which construction 
has been completed, a corrective action plan shall be devised to bring 
the building into compliance with the appropriate standards. The plan 
shall then be reviewed for compliance. Once the reviewer determines that 
the plan complies with the standard, the reviewer shall affix his/her 
signature and seal (if a licensed engineer) to the approved documents 
and provide a statement certifying compliance with the Department 
standards. The Component Head shall ensure implementation of the 
approved plan.
    (3) For an addition to an existing building, the review shall 
account for, in addition to the requirements provided in paragraphs (b) 
(1) or (2) of this section, as appropriate, any effect the addition will 
have on the seismic resistance of the existing portion of the structure. 
If the reviewer determines that the addition will decrease the level of 
seismic resistance of the existing building, the appropriate Component 
Head shall develop a plan of corrective action to restore the seismic 
integrity of the existing structure. Once the plan of corrective action 
has been accomplished, the reviewer shall verify that the current level 
of seismic resistance of the existing building at least equals the 
seismic resistance level of the building before the addition.
    (c) The Department Seismic Safety Coordinator and each Component 
Seismic Safety Coordinator shall ensure that statements verifying 
compliance made under this subpart have been completed and retained by 
the appropriate contracting officer when the Department contracted for 
design or design review services, or by an individual designated by the 
Component Head where the Department has not contracted for either design 
or design review.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.8007  Reporting.

    The Department shall file reports on the execution of the Executive 
Order as required under the Order, and as required by the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency.

only those categories of buildings exempted by the ``National Earthquake 
Hazards Reduction Program Recommended Provisions for the Development of 
Seismic Regulations for New Buildings.'' The Department Seismic Safety 
Coordinator shall maintain the latest version of this document.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.8009  Review of Seismic Safety Program.

    The Department shall review and, as necessary, revise the Seismic 
Safety Program once every three years from August 12, 1993.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.8010  Judicial review.

    (a) Abandoned or other unclaimed property, subject to the provisions 
of section 203(m) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services 
Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 484(m)), shall remain in the custody 
of and be the responsibility of the bureau finding such property.
    (b) If the owner of such property is known, the owner shall be 
notified within 20 days of finding such property by certified mail at 
the owner's address of record that the property may be claimed by the 
owner or his designee and that if the property is not claimed within 30 
days from the date the letter of notification is postmarked, the title 
of the property will vest in the United States.
    (c) If the owner of such property is not known and the estimated 
value of the property exceeds $100, the bureau shall post notice within 
20 days of finding such property, which contains the following 
information:
    (1) A description of the property including model or serial numbers, 
if known.
    (2) A statement of the location where the property was found and the 
office that has custody of it.
    (3) A statement that any person desiring to claim the property must 
file with the bureau within 30 days from the date of first publication a 
claim for said property.
    (4) A complete mailing address is to be provided as a point of 
contact within the bureau for any person to obtain additional 
information concerning the property or the procedures involved in filing 
a claim.


[[Page 285]]


Notice must be published once a week for at least three successive 
weeks. Sound judgment and discretion must be used in selecting the 
publication medium. Advertisements should be placed in a publication of 
general circulation within the judicial district where the property was 
found.
    (d) Property, as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section, shall be held for a period of 30 days from the date of the 
first publication of notice. Upon the expiration of this 30-day period, 
title to such property vests in the United States, except that title 
reverts to the owner where a proper claim is filed within three years 
from the date of vesting of title in the United States, but if the 
property has been in official use, transferred for official use, or sold 
at the time the proper claim is approved, title shall not revert back to 
the former owner. The former owner shall instead obtain reimbursement in 
accordance with 41 CFR 101-48.102-4 or 101-48.305-1.
    (e) If the owner of such property is unknown and the estimated value 
of the property is $100 or less, no notice is required, and the property 
shall be held for a period of 30 days from the date of finding the 
property. Upon expiration of this 30-day period, title to such property 
vests in the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 128-48.102-4  Proceeds.

    (a) Records of abandoned or other unclaimed property will be 
maintained in such a manner as to permit identification of the property 
with the original owner, if known, when such property is put into 
official use or transferred for official use by the finding bureau. 
Records will be maintained until the three-year period for filing claims 
has elapsed to enable the bureau to determine the amount of 
reimbursement due to a former owner who has filed a proper claim for 
abandoned or other unclaimed property.
    (b) Reimbursement for official use by the finding bureau or transfer 
for official use of abandoned or other unclaimed property that has been 
placed in a special fund by the bureau for more than three years shall
