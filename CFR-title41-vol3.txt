                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2001, consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vii]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

                      Subpart A--Regulation System

                                 General


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.5  What is the Federal Management Regulation (FMR)?

    The Federal Management Regulation (FMR) is the successor regulation 
to the Federal Property Management Regulations (FPMR). It contains 
updated regulatory policies originally found in the FPMR. However, it 
does not contain FPMR material that described how to do business with 
the General Services Administration (GSA). ``How to'' materials on this 
and other subjects are available in customer service guides, handbooks, 
brochures and Internet websites provided by GSA. (See Sec. 102-2.125.)


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.10  What is the FMR's purpose?

    The FMR prescribes policies concerning property management and 
related administrative activities. GSA issues the FMR to carry out the 
Administrator of General Services' functional responsibilities, as 
established by statutes, Executive orders, Presidential memoranda, 
Circulars and bulletins issued by the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB), and other policy directives.

[[Page 8]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.15  What is the authority for the FMR system?

    The Administrator of General Services prescribes and issues the FMR 
under the authority of the Federal Property and Administrative Services 
Act of 1949, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 486(c), as well as other applicable 
Federal laws and authorities.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.20  Which agencies are subject to the FMR?

    The FMR applies to executive agencies unless otherwise extended to 
Federal agencies in various parts of this chapter. The difference 
between the two terms is that Federal agencies include executive 
agencies plus establishments in the legislative or judicial branch of 
the Government. See paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section for the 
definitions of each term.
    (a) What is an executive agency? An executive agency is any 
executive department or independent establishment in the executive 
branch of the Government, including any wholly-owned Government 
corporation. (See 40 U.S.C. 472(a).)
    (b) What is a Federal agency? A Federal agency is any executive 
agency or any establishment in the legislative or judicial branch of the 
Government (except the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the 
Architect of the Capitol and any activities under that person's 
direction). (See 40 U.S.C. 472(b).)


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.25  When are other agencies involved in developing the FMR?

    Normally, GSA will ask agencies to collaborate in developing parts 
of the FMR.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.30  Where and in what formats is the FMR published?

    Proposed rules are published in the Federal Register. FMR bulletins 
are published in looseleaf format. FMR interim and final rules are 
published in the following formats--
    (a) Federal Register under the ``Rules and Regulations'' section.
    (b) Loose-leaf. (See Sec. 102-2.35.)
    (c) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), which is an annual 
codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal 
Register. The CFR is available on line and in a bound-volume format.
    (d) Electronically on the Internet.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.35  How is the FMR distributed?

    (a) A liaison appointed by each agency provides GSA with their 
agency's distribution requirements of the looseleaf version of the FMR. 
Agencies must submit GSA Form 2053, Agency Consolidated Requirements for 
GSA Regulations and Other External Issuances, to--General Services 
Administration, Office of Communications (X), 1800 F Street, NW, 
Washington, DC 20405.
    (b) Order Federal Register and Code of Federal Regulations copies of 
FMR material through your agency's authorizing officer.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.40  May an agency issue implementing and supplementing regulations for the FMR?

    Yes, an agency may issue implementing regulations (see Sec. 102-
2.50) to expand upon related FMR material and supplementing regulations 
(see Sec. 102-2.55) to address subject material not covered in the FMR. 
The Office of the Federal Register assigns chapters in Title 41 of the 
Code of Federal Regulations for agency publication of implementing and 
supplementing regulations.

                                Numbering


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.45  How is the FMR numbered?

    (a) All FMR sections are designated by three numbers. The following 
example illustrates the chapter (it's always 102), part, and section 
designations:

[[Page 9]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR21JY99.001

    (b) In the looseleaf version, the month, year, and number of FMR 
amendments appear at the bottom of each page.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.50  How do I number my agency's implementing regulations?

    The first three-digit number represents the chapter number assigned 
to your agency in Title 41 of the CFR. The part and section numbers 
correspond to FMR material. For example, if your agency is assigned 
Chapter 130 in Title 41 of the CFR and you are implementing Sec. 102-
2.60 of the FMR, your implementing section would be numbered Sec. 130-
2.60.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.55  How do I number my agency's supplementing regulations?

    Since there is no corresponding FMR material, number the 
supplementing material ``601'' or higher. For example, your agency's 
supplementing regulations governing special services to states might 
start with Sec. 130-601.5.

                               Deviations


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.60  What is a deviation from the FMR?

    A deviation from the FMR is an agency action or policy that is 
inconsistent with the regulation. (The deviation policy for the FPMR is 
in 41 CFR part 101-1.)


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.65  When may agencies deviate from the FMR?

    Because, it consists primarily of set policies and mandatory 
requirements, deviation from the FMR should occur infrequently. However, 
to address unique circumstances or to test the effectiveness of 
potential policy changes, agencies may be able to deviate from the FMR 
after following the steps described in Sec. 102-2.80.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.70  What are individual and class deviations?

    An individual deviation is intended to affect only one action. A 
class deviation is intended to affect more than one action (e.g., 
multiple actions, the actions of more than one agency, or individual 
agency actions that are expected to recur).


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.75  What timeframes apply to deviations?

    Timeframes vary based on the nature of the deviation. However, 
deviations cannot be open-ended. When consulting with GSA about using an 
individual or class deviation, you must set a timeframe for the 
deviation's duration.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.80  What steps must an agency take to deviate from the FMR?

    (a) Consult informally with appropriate GSA program personnel to 
learn more about how your agency can work within the FMR's requirements 
instead of deviating from them. The consultation process may also 
highlight reasons why an agency would not be permitted to deviate from 
the FMR; e.g., statutory constraints.
    (b) Formally request a deviation, if consultations indicate that 
your agency needs one. The head of your agency or a designated official 
should write to GSA's Regulatory Secretariat to the attention of a GSA 
official in the program office that is likely to consider the deviation. 
(See the FMR bulletin that lists contacts in GSA's program offices and 
Sec. 102-2.90.) The written request must fully explain the reasons for 
the deviation, including the benefits that the agency expects to 
achieve.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.85  What are the reasons for writing to GSA about FMR deviations?

    The reasons for writing are to:

[[Page 10]]

    (a) Explain your agency's rationale for the deviation. Before it can 
adequately comment on a potential deviation from the FMR, GSA must know 
why it is needed. GSA will compare your need against the applicable 
policies and regulations.
    (b) Obtain clarification from GSA as to whether statutes, Executive 
orders, or other controlling policies, which may not be evident in the 
regulation, preclude deviating from the FMR for the reasons stated.
    (c) Establish a timeframe for using a deviation.
    (d) Identify potential changes to the FMR.
    (e) Identify the benefits and other results that the agency expects 
to achieve.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.90  Where should my agency send its correspondence on an FMR deviation?

    Send correspondence to: General Services Administration, Regulatory 
Secretariat (MVRS), Office of Governmentwide Policy, 1800 F Street, NW, 
Washington, DC 20405.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.95  What information must agencies include in their deviation letters to GSA?

    Agencies must include:
    (a) The title and citation of the FMR provision from which the 
agency wishes to deviate;
    (b) The name and telephone number of an agency contact who can 
discuss the reason for the deviation;
    (c) The reason for the deviation;
    (d) A statement about the expected benefits of using the deviation 
(to the extent possible, expected benefits should be stated in 
measurable terms);
    (e) A statement about possible use of the deviation in other 
agencies or Governmentwide; and
    (f) The duration of the deviation.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.100  Must agencies provide GSA with a follow-up analysis of their experience in deviating from the FMR?

    Yes, agencies that deviate from the FMR must also write to the 
relevant GSA program office at the Regulatory Secretariat's address (see 
Sec. 102-2.90) to describe their experiences in using a deviation.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.105  What information must agencies include in their follow-up analysis?

    In your follow-up analysis, provide information that may include, 
but should not be limited to, specific actions taken or not taken as a 
result of the deviation, outcomes, impacts, anticipated versus actual 
results, and the advantages and disadvantages of taking an alternative 
course of action.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.110  When must agencies provide their follow-up letters?

    (a) For an individual deviation, once the action is complete.
    (b) For a class deviation, at the end of each twelve-month period 
from the time you first took the deviation and at the end of the 
deviation period.

                         Non-Regulatory Material


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.115  What kinds of non-regulatory material does GSA publish outside of the FMR?

    As GSA converts the FPMR to the FMR, non-regulatory materials in the 
FPMR, such as guidance, procedures, standards, and information, that 
describe how to do business with GSA, will become available in separate 
documents. These documents may include customer service guides, 
handbooks, brochures, Internet websites, and FMR bulletins. GSA will 
eliminate non-regulatory material that is no longer needed.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.120  How do I know whom to contact to discuss the regulatory requirements of programs addressed in the FMR?

    Periodically, GSA will issue for your reference an FMR bulletin that 
lists program contacts with whom agencies can discuss regulatory 
requirements. At a minimum, the list will contain organization names and 
telephone numbers for each program addressed in the FMR.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.125  What source of information can my agency use to identify materials that describe how to do business with GSA?

    The FMR establishes policy; it does not specify procedures for the 
acquisition of GSA services. However, as a service to users during the 
transition

[[Page 11]]

from the FPMR to the FMR and as needed thereafter, GSA will issue FMR 
bulletins to identify where to find information on how to do business 
with GSA. References include customer service guides, handbooks, 
brochures, Internet websites, etc.


<R04>
                            Subpart B--Forms


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.130  Where are FMR forms prescribed?

    In any of its parts, the FMR may prescribe forms and the 
requirements for using them.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.135  How do agencies obtain forms prescribed by the FMR?

    For copies of the forms prescribed by in the FMR, do any of the 
following:
    (a) Write to us at: General Services Administration, National Forms 
and Publications Center (7CPN), Warehouse 4, Dock No. 1, 501 West Felix 
Street, Fort Worth, TX 76115.
    (b) Send e-mail messages to: NFPC@gsa-7FDepot.
    (c) Visit our web site at: www.gsa.gov/forms/forms.htm.


<R04>
               Subpart C--Plain Language Regulatory Style


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.140  What elements of plain language appear in the FMR?

    The FMR is written in a ``plain language'' regulatory style. This 
style is easy to read and uses a question and answer format directed at 
the reader, active voice, shorter sentences, and, where appropriate, 
personal pronouns.


<R05>
Sec. 102-2.145  To what do pronouns refer when used in the FMR?

    Throughout its text, the FMR may contain pronouns such as, but not 
limited to, we, you, and I. When pronouns are used, each subchapter of 
the FMR will indicate whether they refer to the reader, an agency, GSA, 
or some other entity. In general, pronouns refer to who or what must 
perform a required action.

or criminal law enforcement duties when designated in writing as such by 
their agency head.


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.25  What additional guidance concerning home-to-work transportation should Federal agencies issue?

    Each Federal agency using Government passenger carriers to provide 
home-to-work transportation for employees who are essential for the safe 
and efficient performance of intelligence, counterintelligence, 
protective services, or criminal law enforcement duties should issue 
guidance concerning such use.


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.30  What definitions apply to this part?

    The following definitions apply to this part:
    Agency head means the highest official of a Federal agency.
    Clear and present danger means highly unusual circumstances that 
present a threat to the physical safety of the employee or their 
property when the danger is:
    (1) Real; and
    (2) Immediate or imminent, not merely potential; and
    (3) The use of a Government passenger carrier would provide 
protection not otherwise available.
    Compelling operational considerations means those circumstances 
where home-to-work transportation is essential to the conduct of 
official business or would substantially increase a Federal agency's 
efficiency and economy.
    Emergency means circumstances that exist whenever there is an 
immediate, unforeseeable, temporary need to provide home-to-work 
transportation for those employees necessary to the uninterrupted 
performance of the agency's mission. (An emergency may occur where there 
is a major disruption of available means of transportation to or from a 
work site, an essential Government service must be provided, and there 
is no other way to transport those employees.)
    Employee means a Federal officer or employee of a Federal agency, 
including an officer or enlisted member of the Armed Forces.
    Federal agency means:

[[Page 13]]

    (1) A department (as defined in section 18 of the Act of August 2, 
1946 (41 U.S.C. 5a));
    (2) An executive department (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 101);

regulatory agency specified in 44 U.S.C. 3502(10));
    (9) The Smithsonian Institution;
    (10) Any nonappropriated fund instrumentality of the United States; 
and
    (11) The United States Postal Service.
    Field work means official work requiring the employee's presence at 
various locations other than his/her regular place of work. (Multiple 
stops (itinerant-type travel) within the accepted local commuting area, 
limited use beyond the local commuting area, or transportation to remote 
locations that are only accessible by Government-provided transportation 
are examples of field work.)
    Home means the primary place where an employee resides and from 
which the employee commutes to his/her place of work.
    Home-to-work transportation means the use of a Government passenger 
carrier to transport an employee between his/her home and place of work.
    Passenger carrier means a motor vehicle, aircraft, boat, ship, or 
other similar means of transportation that is owned (including those 
that have come into the possession of the Government by forfeiture or 
donation), leased, or rented (non-TDY) by the United States Government.
    Work means any place within the accepted commuting area, as 
determined by the Federal agency for the locality involved, where an 
employee performs his/her official duties.


<R04>
           Subpart B--Authorizing Home-to-Work Transportation


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.35  Who is authorized home-to-work transportation?

    By statute, certain Federal officials are authorized home-to-work 
transportation, as are employees who meet certain statutory criteria as 
determined by their agency head. The Federal officials authorized by 
statute are the President, the Vice-President, and other principal 
Federal officials and their designees, as provided in 31 U.S.C. 
1344(b)(1) through (b)(7). Those employees engaged in field work, or 
faced with a clear and present danger, an emergency, or a compelling 
operational consideration may be authorized home-to-work transportation 
as determined by their agency head. No other employees are authorized 
home-to-work transportation.


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.40  May the agency head delegate the authority to make home-to-work determinations?

    No, the agency head may not delegate the authority to make home-to-
work determinations.


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.45  Should determinations be completed before an employee is provided with home-to-work transportation?

    Yes, determinations should be completed before an employee is 
provided with home-to-work transportation unless it is impracticable to 
do so.


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.50  May determinations be made in advance for employees who respond to unusual circumstances when they arise?

    Yes, determinations may be made in advance when the Federal agency 
wants to have employees ready to respond to:
    (a) A clear and present danger;
    (b) An emergency; or
    (c) A compelling operational consideration.

    Note to Sec. 102-5.50: Implementation of these determinations is 
contingent upon one of the three circumstances occurring. Thus, these 
may be referred to as ``contingency determinations.''

[[Page 14]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.55  How do we prepare determinations?

    Determinations must be in writing and include the:
    (a) Name and title of the employee (or other identification, if 
confidential);
    (b) Reason for authorizing home-to-work transportation; and
    (c) Anticipated duration of the authorization.


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.60  How long are initial determinations effective?

    Initial determinations are effective for no longer than:
    (a) Two years for field work, updated as necessary; and
    (b) Fifteen days for other circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.65  What procedures apply when the need for home-to-work transportation exceeds the initial period?

    The agency head may approve unlimited subsequent determinations, 
when the need for home-to-work transportation exceeds the initial 
period, for no longer than:
    (a) Two years each for field work, updated as necessary; and
    (b) Ninety calendar days each for other circumstances.


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.70  What considerations apply in making a determination to authorize home-to-work transportation for field work?

    Agencies should consider the following when making a determination 
to authorize home-to-work transportation for field work:
    (a) The location of the employee's home in proximity to his/her work 
and to the locations where non-TDY travel is required; and
    (b) The use of home-to-work transportation for field work should be 
authorized only to the extent that such transportation will 
substantially increase the efficiency and economy of the Government.


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.75  What circumstances do not establish a basis for authorizing home-to-work transportation for field work?

    The following circumstances do not establish a basis for authorizing 
home-to-work transportation for field work:
    (a) When an employee assigned to field work is not actually 
performing field work.
    (b) When the employee's workday begins at his/her work; or
    (c) When the employee normally commutes to a fixed location, however 
far removed from his/her official duty station (for example, auditors or 
investigators assigned to a defense contractor plant).

    Note to Sec. 102-5.75: For instances where an employee is authorized 
home-to-work transportation under the field work provision, but performs 
field work only on an intermittent basis, the agency shall establish 
procedures to ensure that a Government passenger carrier is used only 
when field work is actually being performed. Although some employees' 
daily work station is not located in a Government office, these 
employees are not performing field work. Like all Government employees, 
employees working in a ``field office'' are responsible for their own 
commuting costs.


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.80  What are some examples of positions that may involve field work?

    Examples of positions that may involve field work include, but are 
not limited to:
    (a) Quality assurance inspectors;
    (b) Construction inspectors;
    (c) Dairy inspectors;
    (d) Mine inspectors;
    (e) Meat inspectors; and
    (f) Medical officers on outpatient service.

    Note to Sec. 102-5.80: The assignment of an employee to such a 
position does not, of itself, entitle an employee to receive daily home-
to-work transportation.


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.85  What information should our determination for field work include if positions are identified rather than named individuals?

    If positions are identified rather than named individuals, your 
determination for field work should include sufficient

[[Page 15]]

information to satisfy an audit, if necessary. This information should 
include the job title, number, and operational level where the work is 
to be performed (e.g., five recruiter personnel or, positions at the 
Detroit Army Recruiting Battalion).

    Note to Sec. 102-5.85: An agency head may elect to designate 
positions rather than individual names, especially in positions where 
rapid turnover occurs.


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.90  Should an agency consider whether to base a Government passenger carrier at a Government facility near the employee's home or work rather than authorize the employee home-to-work transportation?

    Yes, situations may arise where, for cost or other reasons, it is in 
the Government's interest to base a Government passenger carrier at a 
Government facility located near the employee's home or work rather than 
authorize the employee home-to-work transportation.


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.95  Is the comfort and/or convenience of an employee considered sufficient justification to authorize home-to-work transportation?

    No, the comfort and/or convenience of an employee is not considered 
sufficient justification to authorize home-to-work transportation.


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.100  May we use home-to-work transportation for other than official purposes?

    No, you may not use home-to-work transportation for other than 
official purposes. However, if your agency has prescribed rules for the 
incidental use of Government vehicles (as provided in 31 U.S.C. note), 
you may use the vehicle in accordance with those rules in connection 
with an existing home-to-work authorization.


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.105  May others accompany an employee using home-to-work transportation?

    Yes, an employee authorized home-to-work transportation may share 
space in a Government passenger carrier with other individuals, provided 
that the passenger carrier does not travel additional distances as a 
result and such sharing is consistent with his/her Federal agency's 
policy. When a Federal agency establishes its space sharing policy, the 
Federal agency should consider its potential liability for and to those 
individuals. Home-to-work transportation does not extend to the 
employee's spouse, other relatives, or friends unless they travel with 
the employee from the same point of departure to the same destination, 
and this use is consistent with the Federal agency's policy.


<R04>
           Subpart C--Documenting and Reporting Determinations


<R05>
Sec. 102-5.110  Must we report our determinations outside of our agency?

    Yes, you must submit your determinations to the following 
Congressional Committees:
    (a) Chairman, Committee on Governmental Affairs, United States 
Senate, Suite SD-340, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC 
20510-6250; and
    (b) Chairman, Committee on Governmental Reform, United States House 
of Representatives, Suite 2157, Rayburn House Office Building, 
Washington, DC 20515-6143.


<R05>

\3\ Fleet average fuel economy for light trucks is the combined fleet
  average fuel economy for all 4  x  2 and 4  x  4 light trucks.
\4\ Requirements not yet set by the Secretary of Transportation.


<R05>
Sec. 102-34.60  How do we calculate the average fuel economy for our fleet?

    (a) Due to the variety of motor vehicle configurations, you must 
take an average of all motor vehicles, by category (passenger 
automobiles or light truck) purchased and leased by your agency during 
the fiscal year. This calculation is the sum of passenger automobiles or 
light trucks that your executive agency purchases or leases from 
commercial sources divided by the sum of the fractions representing the 
number of motor vehicles of each category by model divided by the 
unadjusted city/highway mile-per-gallon ratings for that model, 
developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for each fiscal 
year. The EPA mile-per-gallon rating for each motor vehicle make, model, 
and model year may be obtained from the: General Services 
Administration, Attn: FFA, Washington, DC 20406.
    (b) An example follows:

    Light trucks: i. 600 light trucks acquired in a specific year. These 
are broken down into:
    A. 200 Six cylinder automatic transmission pick-up trucks, EPA 
rating: 24.3 mpg, plus
    B. 150 Six cylinder automatic transmission mini-vans, EPA rating 
24.8 mpg, plus
    C. 150 Eight cylinder automatic transmission pick-up trucks, EPA 
rating: 20.4 mpg, plus
    D. 100 Eight cylinder automatic transmission cargo vans, EPA rating: 
22.2 mpg.

[[Page 22]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR02NO99.009

    ii. Fleet average fuel economy for light trucks in this case is 23.0 
mpg.


<R05>
Sec. 102-34.65  How may we request an exemption from the fuel economy standards?

    (a) You must submit your reasons for the exemption in a written 
request to the: Administrator of General Services, ATTN: MTV, 
Washington, DC 20405.
    (b) GSA will review the request and advise you of the determination 
within 30 days of receipt. Passenger automobiles and light trucks 
exempted under the provisions of this section must not be included in 
calculating your fleet average fuel economy.


<R05>
Sec. 102-34.70  How does GSA monitor the fuel economy of purchased and leased motor vehicles?

    (a) Executive agencies report to GSA their leases and purchases of 
passenger automobiles and light trucks. GSA keeps a master record of the 
miles per gallon for passenger automobiles and light trucks acquired by 
each agency during the fiscal year. GSA verifies that each agency's 
passenger automobile and light truck leases and purchases achieve the 
fleet average fuel economy for the applicable fiscal year, as required 
by Executive Order 12375.
    (b) The GSA Federal Vehicle Policy Division (MTV) issues information 
about the EPA miles-per-gallon ratings to executive agencies at the 
beginning of each fiscal year to help agencies with their acquisition 
plans.


<R05>
Sec. 102-34.75  How must we report fuel economy data for passenger automobiles and light trucks we purchase or commercially lease?

    (a) You must send copies or synopses of motor vehicle leases and 
purchases to GSA. Use the unadjusted combined city/highway mile-per-
gallon ratings for passenger automobiles and light trucks developed each 
fiscal year by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). All 
submissions for a fiscal year must reach GSA by December 1 of the next 
fiscal year. Submit the information as soon as possible after the 
purchase or effective date of each lease to the: General Services 
Administration, ATTN: MTV, Washington, DC 20405. Email: 
vehicle.policy@gsa.gov.
    (b) Include in your submission to GSA motor vehicles purchased or 
leased by your agency for use in any State, Commonwealth, territory or 
possession of the United States, and the District of Columbia.
    (c) Your submission to GSA must include:
    (1) Number of passenger automobiles and light trucks, by category.
    (2) Year.
    (3) Make.
    (4) Model.
    (5) Transmission type (if manual, number of forward speeds).
    (6) Cubic inch displacement of engine.
    (7) Fuel type (i.e., gasoline, diesel, or type of alternative fuel).
    (8) Monthly lease cost, if applicable.

    Note to Sec. 102-34.75: Do not include passenger automobile and 
light truck lease renewal options as new acquisition motor vehicle 
leases. Do not report passenger automobiles and light trucks exempted 
from fleet

the District of Columbia may have the letter code designation prescribed 
in Sec. 102-34.160 stenciled in the blank space beside the embossed 
numbers. If you add a letter code designation, stencil it on the license 
plate so that the letters resemble the embossed numbers in size and 
color. License plates issued by the District of Columbia without an 
agency letter code designation will usually have the letter code 
designation ``US''.
    (c) Transfer of U.S. Government license plates issued by the 
District of Columbia between your agency's own motor vehicles requires 
prior approval from the District of Columbia, Department of 
Transportation.
    (d) You must have each registered motor vehicle inspected annually 
according to section 40-204 of the District of Columbia Code and

<R05>
Sec. 102-34.285  What kind of maintenance programs must we have?

    You must have a scheduled maintenance program for each motor vehicle 
you own or lease. This requirement applies to motor vehicles operated in 
any State, Commonwealth, territory or possession of the United States, 
and the District of Columbia. The GSA Fleet will develop maintenance 
programs for GSA Fleet vehicles. The scheduled maintenance program must:

Federally-mandated emission inspections in the jurisdictions in which 
they operate when required by State motor vehicle administrations or 
State environmental departments. You must reimburse State activities for 
the cost of these inspections if the fee is not waived. GSA will pay the 
cost of these inspections for motor vehicles leased from the GSA Fleet.
    (b) Motor vehicles owned or leased by the Government that are 
exempted from the display of U.S. Government license plates and motor 
vehicle identification must comply with emission and mechanical 
inspection programs of the State, Commonwealth, territory or possession 
of the United States or the District of Columbia in which they are 
regularly operated. Your agency must pay for these inspections, unless 
the fee is waived. Payment for these inspections for motor vehicles 
leased from the GSA Fleet are the responsibility of the using agency.

<R05>

Origin, to the new owner. Detailed instructions on the disposal process 
are in parts 101-45 and 101-46 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 102-34.315  What forms do we use to transfer ownership when selling a motor vehicle?

    Use the following forms to transfer ownership:
    (a) Standard Form 97, The United States Government Certificate to 
Obtain Title to a Motor Vehicle, if both of the following apply:
    (1) The motor vehicle will be retitled by a State, Commonwealth, 
territory or possession of the United States or the District of 
Columbia; and
    (2) The purchaser intends to operate the motor vehicle on highways.

    Note to Sec. 102-34.315(a)(2):
    Do not use Standard Form 97 if the Government-owned motor vehicle is 
either not designed or not legal for operation on highways. Examples are 
construction equipment, farm machinery, and certain military-design 
motor vehicles. Instead, use an appropriate bill of sale or award 
document. Examples are Optional Form 16, Sales Slip-Sale of Government 
Personal Property, and Standard Form 114, Sale of Government Property--
Bid and Award.

    (b) Standard Form 97 is optional in foreign countries because

secure paper to identify readily any attempt to alter the form. The form 
is also pre-numbered to prevent duplicates. State motor vehicle agencies

<R05>
Sec. 102-34.325  How do we obtain fuel for motor vehicles?

    You may obtain fuel for any motor vehicle owned or leased by the 
Government by using:
    (a) A Government-issued charge card;
    (b) A Government agency fueling facility; or
    (c) Personal funds and obtaining reimbursement from your agency.


<R05>
Sec. 102-34.330  What Government-issued charge cards may I use to purchase fuel and motor vehicle related services?

    (a) You may use a fleet charge card specifically issued for this 
purpose. These cards are designed to collect motor vehicle data at the 
time of purchase. Where appropriate, State sales and motor fuel taxes 
are deducted from fuel purchases by the fleet charge card services 
contractor before your agency is billed. The GSA contractor issued fleet 
charge card is the only Government-issued charge card that may be used 
for GSA Fleet motor vehicles. For further information on acquiring these 
fleet charge cards and their use, contact the: General Services 
Administration, Attn: FCX, Washington, DC 20406.

[[Page 32]]

    (b) You may use a Government purchase card if you do not have a 
fleet charge card or if the use of such a government purchase card is 
required by your agency mission. However, the Government purchase card 
does not collect motor vehicle data nor does it deduct State sales and 
motor fuel taxes.


<R05>
Sec. 102-34.335  What type of fuel do I use in motor vehicles?

    (a) Use the grade (octane rating) of fuel recommended by the motor

vehicles designed to operate on gasoline and used overseas unless:
    (1) Such use would be in conflict with country-to-country or multi-
national logistics agreements; or
    (2) Such gasoline is not available locally.


<R05>

period, the owning agency reports all data.
    (2) For motor vehicles transferred from one owning agency to 
another, each agency reports data for the time it retained 
accountability.
    (c) Detailed instructions are included as part of the form. You can

Sec. 102-36.30  When is personal property excess?

    Personal property is excess when it is no longer needed by the 
activities within your agency to carry out the functions of official 
programs, as determined by the agency head or designee.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.35  What is the typical process for disposing of excess personal property?

    (a) You must ensure personal property not needed by your activity is 
offered for use elsewhere within your agency. If the property is no 
longer needed by any activity within your agency, your agency declares 
the property excess and reports it to GSA for possible transfer to 
eligible recipients, including Federal agencies for direct use or for 
use by their contractors, project grantees, or cooperative agreement 
recipients. All executive agencies must, to the maximum extent 
practicable, fill requirements for personal property by using existing 
agency property or by obtaining excess property from other Federal 
agencies in lieu of new procurements.
    (b) If GSA determines that there are no Federal requirements for 
your excess personal property, it becomes surplus property and is 
available for donation to State and local public agencies and other 
eligible non-Federal activities. The Property Act requires that surplus 
personal property be distributed to eligible recipients by an agency 
established by each State for this purpose, the State Agency for Surplus 
Property.
    (c) Surplus personal property not selected for donation is offered 
for sale to the public by competitive offerings such as sealed bid 
sales, spot bid sales or auctions. You may conduct or contract for the 
sale of your surplus personal property, or have GSA or another executive 
agency conduct the sale on behalf of your agency in accordance with part 
101-45 of this title. You must inform GSA at the time the property is 
reported as excess if you do not want GSA to conduct the sale for you.
    (d) If a written determination is made that the property has no 
commercial value or the estimated cost of its continued care and 
handling would exceed the estimated proceeds from its sale, you may 
dispose of the property by abandonment or destruction, or donate it to 
public bodies.

dismantling of the property when required for the purpose of 
transporting the property.
    (b) You may be required to reimburse the holding agency for excess

reimbursement.
    (3) The property was acquired with appropriated funds, but 
reimbursement is required or authorized by law.
    (4) You or the holding agency is the U.S. Postal Service (USPS).

percent of the original acquisition cost of the property, except for 
transfers under the conditions cited in Sec. 102-36.190.
    (c) When you or the holding agency is the DC Government or a wholly 
owned or mixed-ownership Government corporation (Sec. 102-36.75(b)(6) or

original acquisition cost for new or unused property (i.e., condition 
code 1), and zero percent for other personal property. Where 
circumstances warrant, a higher fair value may be used if the agencies 
concerned agree. Due to special circumstances or the unusual nature of

Sec. 102-36.155  What are our responsibilities when acquiring excess personal property for use by a non-Federal recipient?

    When acquiring excess personal property for use by a non-Federal 
recipient, your authorized agency official must:
    (a) Ensure the use of excess personal property by the non-Federal 
recipient is authorized and complies with applicable Federal regulations 
and agency guidelines.
    (b) Determine that the use of excess personal property will reduce 
the costs to the Government and/or that it is in the Government's best 
interest to furnish excess personal property.
    (c) Review and approve transfer documents for excess personal 
property as the sponsoring Federal agency.
    (d) Ensure the non-Federal recipient is aware of his obligations 
under the FMR and your agency regulations regarding the management of 
excess personal property.
    (e) Ensure the non-Federal recipient does not stockpile the property 
but places the property into use within a reasonable period of time, and 
has a system to prevent nonuse, improper use, or unauthorized disposal 
or destruction of excess personal property furnished.
    (f) Establish provisions and procedures for property accountability 
and disposition in situations when the Government retains title.
    (g) Report annually to GSA excess personal property furnished to 
non-Federal recipients during the year (see Sec. 102-36.295).


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.160  What additional information must we provide on the SF 122 when acquiring excess personal property for non-Federal recipients?

    Annotate on the SF 122, the name of the non-Federal recipient and 
the contract, grant or agreement number, when applicable, and the 
scheduled completion/expiration date of the contract, grant or 
agreement. If the remaining time prior to the expiration date is less 
than 60 calendar days, you must certify that the contract, grant or 
agreement will be extended or renewed or provide other written 
justification for the transfer.

                     Nonappropriated Fund Activities


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.165  Do we retain title to excess personal property furnished to a nonappropriated fund activity within our agency?

    Yes, title to excess personal property furnished to a 
nonappropriated fund activity remains with the Federal Government and 
you are accountable for establishing controls over the use of such 
excess property in accordance with Sec. 102-36.45(d). When such property 
is no longer required by the nonappropriated fund activity, you must 
reuse or dispose of the property in accordance with this part.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.170  May we transfer personal property owned by one of our nonappropriated fund activities?

    Property purchased by a nonappropriated fund activity is not Federal 
property. A nonappropriated fund activity has the option of making its

[[Page 44]]

privately owned personal property available for transfer to a Federal 
agency, usually with reimbursement. If such reimbursable personal 
property is not transferred to another Federal agency, it may be offered 
for sale. Such property is not available for donation.

[65 FR 31218, May 16, 2000, as amended at 65 FR 33778, May 25, 2000]

                               Contractors


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.175  Are there restrictions to acquiring excess personal property for use by our contractors?

    Yes, you may acquire and furnish excess personal property for use by 
your contractors subject to the criteria and restrictions in the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR part 45). When such property is no longer 
needed by your contractors or your agency, you must dispose of the 
excess personal property in accordance with the provisions of this part.

                              Cooperatives


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.180  Is there any limitation/condition to acquiring excess personal property for use by cooperatives?

    Yes, you must limit the total dollar amount of property transfers 
(in terms of original acquisition cost) to the dollar value of the 
cooperative agreement. For any transfers in excess of such amount, you 
must ensure that an official of your agency at a level higher than the 
officer administering the agreement approves the transfer. The Federal 
Government retains title to such property, except when provided by 
specific statutory authority.

                            Project Grantees


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.185  What are the requirements for acquiring excess personal property for use by our grantees?

    You may furnish excess personal property for use by your grantees 
only when:
    (a) The grantee holds a Federally sponsored project grant;
    (b) The grantee is a public agency or a nonprofit tax-exempt 
organization under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 
U.S.C. 501);
    (c) The property is for use in connection with the grant; and
    (d) You pay 25 percent of the original acquisition cost of the 
excess personal property, such funds to be deposited into the 
miscellaneous receipts fund of the U.S. Treasury. Exceptions to paying 
this 25 percent are provided in Sec. 102-36.190. Title to property vests 
in the grantee when your agency pays 25 percent of the original 
acquisition cost.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.190  Must we always pay 25 percent of the original acquisition cost when furnishing excess personal property to project grantees?

    No, you may acquire excess personal property for use by a project 
grantee without paying the 25 percent fee when any of the following 
conditions apply:
    (a) The personal property was originally acquired from excess 
sources by your agency and has been placed into official use by your 
agency for at least one year. The Federal Government retains title to 
such property.
    (b) The property is furnished under section 203 of the Department of 
Agriculture Organic Act of 1944 (16 U.S.C. 580a) through the U.S. Forest 
Service in connection with cooperative State forest fire control 
programs. The Federal Government retains title to such property.
    (c) The property is furnished by the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
to State or county extension services or agricultural research 
cooperatives under 40 U.S.C. 483(d)(2)(E). The Federal Government 
retains title to such property.
    (d) The property is not needed for donation under part 101-44 of 
this title, and is transferred under section 608 of the Foreign 
Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (22 U.S.C. 2358). Title to such 
property transfers to the grantee. (You need not wait until after the 
donation screening period when furnishing excess personal property to 
recipients under the Agency for International Development (AID) 
Development Loan Program.)
    (e) The property is scientific equipment transferred under section 
11(e) of the National Science Foundation (NSF) Act of 1950, as amended 
(42 U.S.C. 1870(e)). GSA will limit such transfers to property within 
Federal Supply

[[Page 45]]

Classification (FSC) groups 12, 14, 43, 48, 58, 59, 65, 66, 67, 68 and 
70. GSA may approve transfers without reimbursement for property under 
other FSC groups when NSF certifies the item is a component of or 
related to a piece of scientific equipment or is a difficult-to-acquire 
item needed for scientific research. Regardless of FSC, GSA will not 
approve transfers of common-use or general-purpose items without 
reimbursement. Title to such property transfers to the grantee.
    (f) The property is furnished in connection with grants to Indian 
tribes, as defined in section 3(c) of the Indian Financing Act (24 
U.S.C. 1452(c)). Title passage is determined under the authorities of 
the administering agency.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.195  What type of excess personal property may we furnish to our project grantees?

    You may furnish to your project grantees any property, except for 
consumable items, determined to be necessary and usable for the purpose 
of the grant. Consumable items are generally not transferable to project 
grantees. GSA may approve transfers of excess consumable items when 
adequate justification for the transfer accompanies such requests. For 
the purpose of this section ``consumable items'' are items which are 
intended for one-time use and are actually consumed in that one time; 
e.g., drugs, medicines, surgical dressings, cleaning and preserving 
materials, and fuels.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.200  May we acquire excess personal property for cannibalization purposes by the grantees?

    Yes, subject to GSA approval, you may acquire excess personal 
property for cannibalization purposes. You may be required to provide a 
supporting statement that indicates disassembly of the item for 
secondary use has greater benefit than utilization of the item in its 
existing form and cost savings to the Government will result.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.205  Is there a limit to how much excess personal property we may furnish to our grantees?

    Yes, you must monitor transfers of excess personal property so the 
total dollar amount of property transferred (in original acquisition 
cost) does not exceed the dollar value of the grant. Any transfers above 
the grant amount must be approved by an official at an administrative 
level higher than the officer administering the grant.


<R04>
           Subpart D--Disposition of Excess Personal Property


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.210  Why must we report excess personal property to GSA?

    You must report excess personal property to promote reuse by the 
Government to enable Federal agencies to benefit from the continued use 
of property already paid for with taxpayers' money, thus minimizing new 
procurement costs. Reporting excess personal property to GSA helps 
assure that the information on available excess personal property is 
accessible and disseminated to the widest range of reuse customers.

                  Disposing of Excess Personal Property


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.245  Are we accountable for the personal property that has been reported excess, and who is responsible for the care and handling costs?

    Yes, you are accountable for the excess personal property until the 
time it is picked up by the designated recipient or its agent. You are 
responsible for all care and handling charges while the excess personal 
property is going through the screening and disposal process.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.250  Does GSA ever take physical custody of excess personal property?

    Generally you retain physical custody of the excess personal 
property prior to its final disposition. Very rarely GSA may consider 
accepting physical custody of excess personal property. Under special 
circumstances, GSA may take custody or may direct the transfer of 
partial or total custody to other executive agencies, with their 
consent.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.255  What options do we have when unusual circumstances do not allow adequate time for disposal through GSA?

    Contact your regional GSA Personal Property Management office for 
any existing interagency agreements that would allow you to turn in 
excess personal property to a Federal facility. You are responsible for 
any turn-in costs and all costs related to transporting the excess 
personal property to these facilities.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.260  How do we promote the expeditious transfer of excess personal property?

    For expeditious transfer of excess personal property you should:
    (a) Provide complete and accurate property descriptions and 
condition codes on the report of excess to facilitate the selection of 
usable property by potential users.
    (b) Ensure that any available operating manual, parts list, diagram, 
maintenance log, or other instructional publication is made available 
with the property at the time of transfer.
    (c) Advise the designated recipient of any special requirements for 
dismantling, shipping/transportation.
    (d) When the excess personal property is located at a facility due 
to be closed, provide advance notice of the scheduled date of closing, 
and ensure there is sufficient time for screening and removal of 
property.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.265  What if there are competing requests for the same excess personal property?

    (a) GSA will generally approve transfers on a first-come, first-
served basis. When more than one Federal agency requests the same item, 
and the quantity available is not sufficient to meet the demand of all 
interested agencies, GSA will consider factors such as national defense 
requirements, emergency needs, avoiding the necessity of a new 
procurement, energy conservation, transportation costs, and retention of 
title in the Government. GSA will normally give preference to the agency 
that will retain title in the Government.
    (b) Requests for property for the purpose of cannibalization will 
normally be subordinate to requests for use of the property in its 
existing form.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.270  What if a Federal agency requests personal property that is undergoing donation screening or in the sales process?

    Prior to final disposition, GSA will consider requests from 
authorized Federal activities for excess personal property undergoing 
donation screening or in the sales process. Federal transfers may be 
authorized prior to removal of the property under a donation or sales 
action.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.275  May we dispose of excess personal property without GSA approval?

    No, you may not dispose of excess personal property without GSA 
approval except under the following limited situations:
    (a) You may transfer to another Federal agency excess personal 
property that has not yet been reported to GSA, under direct transfer 
procedures contained in Sec. 102-36.145.

[[Page 48]]

    (b) You may dispose of excess personal property that is not required 
to be reported to GSA (see Sec. 102-36.220(b)).
    (c) You may dispose of excess personal property without going 
through GSA when such disposal is authorized by law.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.280  May we withdraw from the disposal process excess personal property that we have reported to GSA?

    Yes, you may withdraw excess personal property from the disposal 
process, but only with the approval of GSA and to satisfy an internal 
agency requirement. Property that has been approved for transfer or 
donation or offered for sale by GSA may be returned to your control with 
proper justification.

                      Transfers With Reimbursement


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.285  May we charge for personal property transferred to another Federal agency?

    (a) When any one of the following conditions applies, you may 
require and retain reimbursement for the excess personal property from 
the recipient:
    (1) Your agency has the statutory authority to require and retain 
reimbursement for the property.
    (2) You are transferring the property under the exchange/sale 
authority.
    (3) You had originally acquired the property with funds not 
appropriated from the general fund of the Treasury or appropriated 
therefrom but by law reimbursable from assessment, tax, or other 
revenue. It is current executive branch policy that working capital fund 
property shall be transferred without reimbursement.
    (4) You or the recipient is the U.S. Postal Service.
    (5) You or the recipient is the DC Government.
    (6) You or the recipient is a wholly owned or mixed-ownership 
Government corporation.
    (b) You may charge for direct costs you incurred incident to the 
transfer, such as packing, loading and shipping of the property. The 
recipient is responsible for such charges unless you waive the amount 
involved.
    (c) You may not charge for overhead or administrative expenses or 
the costs for care and handling of the property pending disposition.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.290  How much do we charge for excess personal property on a transfer with reimbursement?

    (a) You may require reimbursement in an amount up to the fair market 
value of the property when the transfer involves property meeting 
conditions in Sec. 102-36.285(a)(1) through (a)(4).
    (b) When you or the recipient is the DC Government or a wholly owned 
or mixed-ownership Government corporation (Sec. 102-36.285(a)(5) and 
(a)(6)), you may only require fair value reimbursement. Fair value 
reimbursement is 20 percent of the original acquisition cost for new or 
unused property (i.e., condition code 1), and zero percent for other 
personal property. A higher fair value may be used if you and the 
recipient agency agree. Due to special circumstances or the nature of 
the property, you may use other criteria for establishing fair value if 
approved or directed by GSA. You must refer any disagreements to the 
appropriate regional GSA Personal Property Management office.

                       Report of Disposal Activity


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.295  Is there any reporting requirement on the disposition of excess personal property?

    Yes, you must report annually to GSA personal property furnished in 
any manner in that year to any non-Federal recipients, with respect to 
property obtained as excess or as property determined to be no longer 
required for the purposes of the appropriation from which it was 
purchased. GSA will subsequently submit a summary of these Non-Federal 
Recipients Reports to Congress.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.300  How do we report the furnishing of personal property to non-Federal recipients?

    (a) Submit your annual report of personal property furnished to non-
Federal recipients, in letter form, to GSA, Personal Property Management 
Policy Division (MTP), 1800 F Street, NW, Washington, DC 20405, within 
90 calendar days after the close of each fiscal

[[Page 49]]

year. The report must cover personal property disposed during the fiscal 
year in all areas within the United States, the U.S. Virgin Islands, 
American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Negative reports are 
required.
    (b) The report (interagency report control number 0154--GSA--AN) 
must reference this part and contain the following:
    (1) Names of the non-Federal recipients.
    (2) Status of the recipients (contractor, cooperative, project 
grantee, etc.).
    (3) Total original acquisition cost of excess personal property 
furnished to each type of recipient, by type of property (two-digit FSC 
groups).

                         Abandonment/Destruction


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.305  May we abandon or destroy excess personal property without reporting it to GSA?

    Yes, you may abandon or destroy excess personal property when you 
have made a written determination that the property has no commercial 
value or the estimated cost of its continued care and handling would 
exceed the estimated proceeds from its sale. An item has no commercial 
value when it has neither utility nor monetary value (either as an item 
or as scrap).


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.310  Who makes the determination to abandon or destroy excess personal property?

    To abandon or destroy excess personal property, an authorized 
official of your agency makes a written finding that must be approved by 
a reviewing official who is not directly accountable for the property.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.315  Are there any restrictions to the use of the abandonment/destruction authority?

    Yes, the following restrictions apply:
    (a) You must not abandon or destroy property in a manner which is 
detrimental or dangerous to public health or safety. Additional 
guidelines for the abandonment/destruction of hazardous materials are 
prescribed in part 101-42 of this title.
    (b) If you become aware of an interest from an entity in purchasing 
the property, you must implement sales procedures in lieu of 
abandonment/destruction.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.320  May we transfer or donate excess personal property that has been determined appropriate for abandonment/destruction without GSA approval?

    In lieu of abandonment/destruction, you may donate such excess 
personal property only to a public body without going through GSA. A 
public body is any department, agency, special purpose district, or 
other instrumentality of a State or local government; any Indian tribe; 
or any agency of the Federal Government. If you become aware of an 
interest from an eligible non-profit organization (see part 101-44 of 
this title) that is not a public body in acquiring the property, you 
must contact the regional GSA Personal Property Management office and 
implement donation procedures in accordance with part 101-44 of this 
title.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.325  What must be done before the abandonment/destruction of excess personal property?

    Except as provided in Sec. 102-36.330, you must provide public 
notice of intent to abandon or destroy excess personal property, in a 
format and timeframe specified by your agency regulations (such as 
publishing a notice in a local newspaper, posting of signs in common use 
facilities available to the public, or providing bulletins on your 
website through the internet). You must also include in the notice an 
offer to sell in accordance with part 101-45 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.330  Are there occasions when public notice is not needed regarding abandonment/destruction of excess personal property?

    Yes, you are not required to provide public notice when:
    (a) The value of the property is so little or the cost of its care 
and handling, pending abandonment/destruction, is so great that its 
retention for advertising for sale, even as scrap, is clearly not 
economical;

[[Page 50]]

    (b) Abandonment or destruction is required because of health, 
safety, or security reasons; or
    (c) When the original acquisition cost of the item (estimated if 
unknown) is less than $500.

<R04>
  Subpart E--Personal Property Whose Disposal Requires Special Handling


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.335  Are there certain types of excess personal property that must be disposed of differently from normal disposal procedures?

    Yes, you must comply with the additional provisions in this subpart 
when disposing of the types of personal property listed in this subpart.

                       Aircraft and Aircraft Parts


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.340  What must we do when disposing of excess aircraft?

condition or dollar value, and provide the following information on the 
SF 120:
    (1) Manufacturer, date of manufacture, model, serial number.
    (2) Major components missing from the aircraft (such as engines, 
electronics).

<R05>
Sec. 102-36.345  May we dispose of excess Flight Safety Critical Aircraft Parts (FSCAP)?

    Yes, you may dispose of excess FSCAP, but first you must determine 
whether the documentation available is adequate to allow transfer, 
donation, or sale of the part in accordance with part 101-37, subpart 
101-37.6, of this title. Otherwise, you must mutilate undocumented FSCAP 
that has no traceability to its original equipment manufacturer and 
dispose of it as scrap. When reporting excess FSCAP, annotate the 
manufacturer, date of manufacture, part number, serial number, and the 
appropriate Criticality Code on the SF 120, and ensure that all 
available historical and maintenance records accompany the part at the 
time of issue.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.350  How do we identify a FSCAP?

    Any aircraft part designated as FSCAP is assigned an alpha 
Criticality

[[Page 51]]

Code, and the code is annotated on the original transfer document when 
you acquire the part. You must perpetuate the appropriate FSCAP 
Criticality Code on all personal property records. You may contact the 
Federal agency or Military service that originally owned the part for 
assistance in making this determination, or query DOD's Federal 
Logistics Information System (FLIS) using the National Stock Number 
(NSN) for the part. For assistance in subscribing to the FLIS service 
contact the FedLog Consumer Support Office, 800-351-4381.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.355  What are the FSCAP Criticality Codes?

    The FSCAP Criticality Codes are contained in the following table:

<R05>
Sec. 102-36.360  How do we dispose of aircraft parts that are life-limited but have no FSCAP designation?

    When disposing of life-limited aircraft parts that have no FSCAP 
designation, you must ensure that tags and labels, historical data and 
maintenance records accompany the part on any transfers, donations or 
sales. For additional information regarding the disposal of life-limited 
parts with or without tags or documentation refer to part 101-37 of this 
title.

                        Canines, Law Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.365  May we transfer or donate canines that have been used in the performance of law enforcement duties?

    Yes, under Public Law 105-27 (111 Stat. 244), when the canine is no 
longer needed for law enforcement duties, you may donate the canine to 
an individual who has experience handling canines in the performance of 
those official duties.

                        Disaster Relief Property


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.370  Are there special requirements concerning the use of excess personal property for disaster relief?

    Yes, upon declaration by the President of an emergency or a major 
disaster, you may loan excess personal property to State and local 
governments, with or without compensation and prior to reporting it as 
excess to GSA, to alleviate suffering and damage resulting from any 
emergency or major disaster (Disaster Relief Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-
288 (42 U.S.C. 5121)) and Executive Orders 11795 (3 CFR, 1971-1975 
Comp., p. 887) and 12148 (3 CFR, 1979 Comp., p. 412), as amended). If 
the loan involves property that has already been reported excess to GSA, 
you may withdraw the item from the disposal process subject to approval 
by GSA. You may also withdraw excess personal property for use by your 
agency in providing assistance in disaster relief. You are still 
accountable for this property and your agency is responsible for 
developing agencywide procedures for recovery of such property.

                                Firearms


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.375  May we dispose of excess firearms?

    Yes, unless you have specific statutory authority to do otherwise, 
excess firearms may be transferred only to those Federal agencies 
authorized to acquire firearms for official use. GSA may donate certain 
classes of surplus firearms to State and local government activities 
whose primary function is the enforcement of applicable Federal, State, 
and/or local laws and whose compensated law enforcement officers have 
the authority to apprehend and arrest. Firearms not transferred or 
donated must be destroyed and sold as scrap. For additional guidance on 
the disposition of firearms refer to part 101-42 of this title.

                    Foreign Excess Personal Property


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.380  Who is responsible for disposing of foreign excess personal property?

    Your agency is responsible for disposing of your foreign excess 
personal property, as provided by title IV of the Property Act.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.385  What are our responsibilities in the disposal of foreign excess personal property?

    When disposing of foreign excess personal property you must:
    (a) Determine whether it is in the interest of the U.S. Government 
to return foreign excess personal property to the U.S. for further re-
use or to dispose of the property overseas.
    (b) Ensure that any disposal of property overseas conforms to the 
foreign policy of the United States and the terms and conditions of any 
applicable Host Nation Agreement.
    (c) Ensure that, when foreign excess personal property is donated or 
sold overseas, donation/sales conditions include a requirement for 
compliance with U.S. Department of Commerce and Department of 
Agriculture regulations when transporting any personal property back to 
the U.S.
    (d) Inform the U.S. State Department of any disposal of property to 
any foreign governments or entities.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.390  How may we dispose of foreign excess personal property?

    To dispose of foreign excess personal property, you may:
    (a) Offer the property for re-use by U.S. Federal agencies overseas;
    (b) Return the property to the U.S. for re-use by eligible 
recipients;
    (c) Sell, exchange, lease, or transfer such property for cash, 
credit, or other property;
    (d) Donate medical materials or supplies to nonprofit medical or 
health organizations, including those qualified under sections 214(b) 
and 607 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (22 U.S.C. 
2174, 2357); or
    (e) Abandon, destroy or donate such property when you determine that 
it has no commercial value or the estimated cost of care and handling 
would exceed the estimated proceeds from its sale, in accordance with 
sec. 402(a) of the Property Act. Abandonment, destruction or donation 
actions must also comply with the laws of the country in which the 
property is located.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.395  How may GSA assist us in disposing of foreign excess personal property?

    You may request GSA's assistance in the screening of foreign excess 
personal property for possible re-use by eligible recipients within the 
U.S. GSA may, after consultation with you, designate property for return 
to the United States for transfer or donation purposes.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.400  Who pays for the transportation costs when foreign excess personal property is returned to the United States?

    When foreign excess property is to be returned to the U.S. for the 
purpose of an approved transfer or donation under the provisions of 
Sections 202 and 203 of the Property Act, the receiving agency is 
responsible for all direct costs involved in the transfer, which include 
packing, handling, crating, and transportation.

                                  Gifts


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.405  May we keep gifts given to us from the public?

    If your agency has gift retention authority, you may retain gifts 
from the public. Otherwise, you must report gifts you receive on a SF 
120 to GSA. You must report gifts received from a foreign government in 
accordance with part 101-49 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.410  How do we dispose of a gift in the form of money or intangible personal property?

    Report intangible personal property to GSA, Personal Property 
Management Division (FBP), Washington, D.C. 20406. You must not transfer 
or dispose of this property without prior approval of GSA. The Secretary 
of the Treasury will dispose of money and negotiable instruments such as 
bonds, notes, or other securities under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 324.

[[Page 53]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.415  How do we dispose of gifts other than intangible personal property?

    (a) When the gift is offered with the condition that the property be 
sold and the proceeds used to reduce the public debt, report the gift to 
the regional GSA Personal Property Management office in which the 
property is located. GSA will convert the gift to money upon acceptance 
and deposit the proceeds into a special account of the U.S. Treasury.
    (b) When the gift is offered with no conditions or restrictions, and 
your agency has gift retention authority, you may use the gift for an 
authorized official purpose without reporting to GSA. The property will 
then lose its identity as a gift and you must account for it in the same 
manner as Federal personal property acquired from authorized sources. 
When the property is no longer needed, you must report it as excess 
personal property to GSA.
    (c) When the gift is offered with no conditions or restrictions, but 
your agency does not have gift retention authority, you must report it 
to the regional GSA Personal Property Management office. GSA will offer 
the property for screening for possible transfer to a Federal agency or 
convert the gift to money and deposit the funds with U.S. Treasury. If 
your agency is interested in keeping the gift for an official purpose, 
you must annotate your interest on the SF 120 and also submit a SF 122.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.420  How do we dispose of gifts from foreign governments or entities?

    Report foreign gifts on a SF 120 to GSA, Personal Property 
Management Division (FBP), Washington, DC 20406, for possible use by 
your agency, or for transfer, donation or sale in accordance with the 
provisions of part 101-49 of this title.

                       Hazardous Personal Property


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.425  May we dispose of excess hazardous personal property?

    Yes, but only in accordance with part 101-42 of this title. When 
reporting excess hazardous property to GSA, certify on the SF 120 that 
the property has been packaged and labeled as required. Annotate any 
special requirements for handling, storage, or use, and provide a 
description of the actual or potential hazard.

      Munitions List Items/Commerce Control List Items (MLIs/CCLIs)


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.430  May we dispose of excess Munitions List Items (MLIs)/Commerce Control List Items (CCLIs)?

    You may dispose of excess MLIs/CCLIs only when you comply with the 
additional disposal and demilitarization (DEMIL) requirements contained 
in part 101-42 of this title. MLIs may require demilitarization when 
issued to any non-DoD entity, and will require appropriate licensing 
when exported from the U.S. CCLIs usually require export licensing when 
transported from the U.S.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.435  How do we identify Munitions List Items (MLIs)/Commerce Control List Items (CCLIs) requiring demilitarization?

    You identify MLIs/CCLIs requiring demilitarization by the 
demilitarization code that is assigned to each MLI or CCLI. The code 
indicates the type and scope of demilitarization and/or export controls 
that must be accomplished, when required, before issue to any non-DOD 
activity. For a listing of the codes and additional guidance on DEMIL 
procedures see DOD Demilitarization and Trade Security Control Manual, 
DOD 4160.21-M-1.

                     Printing Equipment and Supplies


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.440  Are there special procedures for reporting excess printing and binding equipment and supplies?

    Yes, in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 312, you must submit reports of 
excess printing and binding machinery, equipment, materials, and 
supplies to the Public Printer, Government Printing Office (GPO), 
Customer Service Manager, North Capitol and H Streets, NW, Washington, 
DC 20401. If GPO has no requirement for the property, you must then 
submit the report to GSA.

[[Page 54]]

                           Red Cross Property


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.445  Do we report excess personal property originally acquired from or through the American National Red Cross?

    Yes, when reporting excess personal property which was processed, 
produced, or donated by the American National Red Cross, note ``RED 
CROSS PROPERTY'' on the SF 120 or report document. GSA will offer to 
return this property to the Red Cross if no other Federal agency has a 
need for it. If the Red Cross has no requirement the property continues 
in the disposal process and is available for donation.

                            Shelf-Life Items


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.450  Do we report excess shelf-life items?

    (a) When there are quantities on hand that would not be utilized by 
the expiration date and cannot be returned to the vendor for credit, you 
must report such expected overage as excess for possible transfer and 
disposal to ensure maximum use prior to deterioration.
    (b) You need not report expired shelf-life items. You may dispose of 
property with expired shelf-life by abandonment/destruction in 
accordance with Sec. 102-36.305 and in compliance with Federal, State, 
and local waste disposal and air and water pollution control standards.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.455  How do we report excess shelf-life items?

    You must identify the property as shelf-life items by ``SL'', 
indicate the expiration date, whether the date is the original or an 
extended date, and if the date is further extendable. GSA may adjust the 
screening period based on re-use potential and the remaining useful 
shelf life.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.460  Do we report excess medical shelf-life items held for national emergency purposes?

    When the remaining shelf life of any medical materials or supplies 
held for national emergency purposes is of too short a period to justify 
their continued retention, you should report such property excess for 
possible transfer and disposal. You must make such excess determinations 
at such time as to ensure that sufficient time remains to permit their 
use before their shelf life expires and the items are unfit for human 
use. You must identify such items with ``MSL'' and the expiration date, 
and indicate any specialized storage requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.465  May we transfer or exchange excess medical shelf-life items with other Federal agencies?

    Yes, you may transfer or exchange excess medical shelf-life items 
held for national emergency purposes with any other Federal agency for 
other medical materials or supplies, without GSA approval and without 
regard to part 101-46 of this title. You and the transferee agency will 
agree to the terms and prices. You may credit any proceeds derived from 
such transactions to your agency's current applicable appropriation and 
use the funds only for the purchase of medical materials or supplies for 
national emergency purposes.

                                 Vessels


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.470  What must we do when disposing of excess vessels?

    (a) When you dispose of excess vessels you must indicate on the SF 
120 the following information:
    (1) Whether the vessel has been inspected by the Coast Guard.
    (2) Whether testing for hazardous materials has been done. And if 
so, the result of the testing, specifically the presence or absence of 
PCB's and asbestos and level of contamination.
    (3) Whether hazardous materials clean-up is required, and when it 
will be accomplished by your agency.
    (b) In accordance with section 203(i) of the Property Act, the 
Federal Maritime Administration (FMA), Department of Transportation, is 
responsible for disposing of surplus vessels determined to be merchant 
vessels or capable of conversion to merchant use and weighing 1,500 
gross tons or more. The SF 120 for such vessels shall be forwarded to 
GSA for submission to FMA.
    (c) Disposal instructions regarding vessels in this part do not 
apply to battleships, cruisers, aircraft carriers, destroyers, and 
submarines.

                  Subpart F--Miscellaneous Disposition


<R05>
Sec. 102-36.475  What is the authority for transfers under ``Computers for Learning''?

    (a) The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, as 
amended (15 U.S.C. 3710(i)), authorizes Federal agencies to transfer 
excess education-related Federal equipment to educational institutions 
or nonprofit organizations for educational and research activities. 
Executive Order 12999 (3 CFR, 1996 Comp., p. 180) requires, to the 
extent permitted by law and where appropriate, the transfer of computer 
equipment for use by schools or non-profit organizations.
    (b) Each Federal agency is required to identify a point of contact 
within the agency to assist eligible recipients, and to publicize the 
availability of such property to eligible communities. Excess education-
related equipment may be transferred directly under established agency 
procedures, or reported to GSA as excess for subsequent transfer to 
potential eligible recipients as appropriate. You must include transfers 
under this authority in the annual Non-Federal Recipients Report (See 
Sec. 102-36.295) to GSA.
    (c) The ``Computers for Learning'' website has been developed to 
streamline the transfer of excess and surplus Federal computer equipment 
to schools and nonprofit educational organizations. For additional 
information about this program access the ``Computers for Learning'' 
website, http://www.computers.fed.gov.

    Employees, with the approval of their employing agencies, may accept 
and retain:
    (a) Gifts of minimal value received as souvenirs or marks of 
courtesy. When a gift of more than minimal value is accepted, the gift 
becomes the property of the U.S. Government, not the employee, and must 
be reported.
    (b) Decorations that have been offered or awarded for outstanding or 
unusually meritorious performance. If the employing agency disapproves 
retention of the decoration by the employee, the decoration becomes the 
property of the U.S. Government.


<R05>
Sec. 102-42.20  What is the typical disposition process for gifts and decorations that employees are not authorized to retain?

    (a) Non-monetary gifts or decorations. When an employee receives a

employing agency within 60 days after accepting it.
    (2) The employing agency determines if it will keep the gift or 
decoration for official use.
    (3) If it does not return the gift or decoration to the donor or 
keep it for official use, the employing agency reports it as excess 
personal property to GSA for Federal utilization screening under 
Sec. 102-42.95.
    (4) If GSA does not transfer the gift or decoration during
    Federal utilization screening, the employee may purchase the gift or 
decoration (see Sec. 102-42.140).
    (5) If the employee declines to purchase the gift or decoration, and 
there is no Federal requirement for either, GSA may offer it for 
donation through State Agencies for Surplus Property (SASP) under part 
101-44 of this title.
    (6) If no SASP requests the gift or decoration for donation, GSA may 
offer it for public sale, with the approval of the Secretary of State, 
or will authorize the destruction of the gift or decoration under part 
101-45 of this title.
    (b) Monetary gifts. When an employee receives a monetary gift above 
the minimal value:
    (1) The employee must report the gift to his/her employing agency 
within 60 days after accepting it.
    (2) The employing agency must:
    (i) Report a monetary gift with possible historic or numismatic 
(i.e., collectible) value to GSA; or
    (ii) Deposit a monetary gift that has no historic or numismatic 
value with the Department of the Treasury.

the direct costs incurred by the employing agency in packing,

at reasonable times for inspection of the gift or decoration by duly 
authorized representatives of the SASP or the U.S. Government.
    (d) During the period of restriction, the donee must not:

[[Page 70]]

Government's total space needs in the community. Prior to acquiring, 
constructing or leasing buildings (or sites for such buildings), Federal 
agencies must use, to the maximum extent feasible, historic properties 
available to the agency. In site selections, Executive agencies must 
consider Executive Orders 12072 (3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 213) and 13006 
(40 U.S.C. 601a note). In addition, Executive agencies must consider all 
of the following:

    (b) A site adjacent to or in the proximity of an existing Federal 
building which is well located and is to be retained for long-term 
occupancy.
    (c) The environmental condition of proposed sites prior to purchase: 
The sites must be free from contamination, unless it is otherwise 
determined to be in the best interests of the Government to purchase a 
contaminated site (e.g., reuse of a site under an established 
``Brownsfields'' program).
    (d) Purchase options to secure the future availability of a site.
    (e) All applicable policies concerning the location of Federal 
facilities (e.g., to give first priority to locating facilities in rural 
areas under the Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 2204b-1)).


<R05>
Sec. 102-73.85  What land acquisition policy must Federal agencies follow?

Appropriate relocation assistance means that the Federal agency must pay 
the displaced person for actual reasonable moving expenses (in moving 
himself, his family, business, etc.); actual direct losses of tangible 
personal property as a result of moving or discontinuing a business; 
actual reasonable expenses in searching for a replacement business or 
farm; and actual reasonable expenses necessary to reestablish a 
displaced farm, nonprofit organization, or small business at its new

    (a) No, a prospectus is not required if the dollar value of a 
project does not exceed the prospectus threshold. The Public Buildings 
Act of 1959, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 601-619, establishes a prospectus 
threshold, applicable to Federal agencies operating under, or subject 
to, the authorities of the Administrator of General Services, for the 
construction, alteration, purchase, and acquisition of any building to 
be used as a public building, and establishes a prospectus threshold to 
lease any space for use for public purposes. (Because of the important 
role the prospectus approval process plays in the budget preparation and 
planning process and with Congressional oversight responsibilities, 
Federal agencies must continue to prepare and submit prospectuses for 
all projects that exceed the prospectus threshold identified in 
Sec. 102-73.55. All GSA delegations of leasing, alteration, and 
construction authority are subject to this policy.)
    (b) Public Law 104-66, 109 Stat. 734, eliminated the prospectus 
submission requirement of the Public Buildings Act of 1959 (40 U.S.C. 
606(a) and 610(b)).

[[Page 71]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-73.100  What happens if the project exceeds the prospectus threshold?

    Such projects require approval by the Senate and the House of 
Representatives if the dollar value exceeds the prospectus threshold. In 
order to obtain this approval, prospectuses for such projects must be 
submitted to GSA and the Administrator of General Services will transmit 
the proposed prospectuses to Congress for consideration by the Senate 
and the House of Representatives.

Sec. 102-74.10  What is the basic facility management policy?

    Executive agencies must manage, operate, and maintain Government-
owned and leased buildings in a manner that provides for quality space 
and services consistent with their operational needs and that accomplish 
overall Government objectives. The management, operation, and 
maintenance of buildings and building systems must:
    (a) Be cost effective and energy efficient;
    (b) Be adequate to meet the agencies' missions;
    (c) Meet nationally recognized standards; and
    (d) Be at an appropriate level to maintain and preserve the physical 
plant assets, consistent with available funding.


<R05>

occupancy services.


<R05>
Sec. 102-74.25  What standard in providing occupancy services must Executive agencies follow?

    Executive agencies must provide occupancy services that 
substantially conform to nationally recognized standards. As needed, 
Executive agencies may adopt other standards for buildings and services 
in Federally-

[[Page 72]]

controlled facilities in order to conform to statutory requirements and 
to implement cost-reduction efforts.


<R05>
Sec. 102-74.30  What building services must Executive agencies provide?

    Executive agencies, upon approval from GSA, must provide:

maintenance, tenant alterations, minor repairs, building maintenance, 
integrated pest management, signage, parking, and snow removal, at 
appropriate levels to support Federal agency missions; and
    (b) Arrangements for raising and lowering the United States flags at 
appropriate times. In addition, agencies must display P.O.W. and M.I.A. 
flags at locations specified in 36 U.S.C. 189a on P.O.W./M.I.A. flag 
display days.


<R05>
Sec. 102-74.35  What are concessions services?

    With certain exceptions, the Randolph-Sheppard Act requires that 
blind persons licensed under the provisions of the Act be authorized to 
operate vending facilities on any Federal property, including leased 
buildings. The Act imposes a positive obligation on Federal agencies to 
have suitable sites for vending facilities in buildings that they 
acquire.


<R05>
Sec. 102-74.50  What are conservation programs?

    Conservation programs are programs that improve energy and water 
efficiency and promote the use of solar and other renewable energy. 
These programs must promote and maintain an effective source reduction 
activity (reducing consumption of resources such as energy, water and 
paper), resource recovery activity (obtaining materials from the waste 
stream that can be recycled into new products), and reuse activity 
(reusing same product before disposition, such as reusing unneeded memos 
for scratch paper).


<R05>
Sec. 102-74.55  What are asset services?

    Asset services include repairs (as opposed to those minor repairs 
identified in Sec. 102-74.30(a)), alterations, and modernizations for

    Executive agencies, upon approval from GSA, must provide asset 
services such as repairs (in addition to those minor repairs identified 
in Sec. 102-74.30(a)), alterations, and modernizations for real property 
assets. Federal agencies must follow the prospectus submission and 
approval policy identified in Sec. Sec. 102-73.95 and 102-73.100.


<R05>
Sec. 102-74.65  What standard in providing asset services must Executive agencies follow?

operations, extend the useful life of buildings and related building 
systems, and provide a quality workplace environment that enhances 
employee productivity.

[[Page 73]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-74.70  What Federal facility ridesharing policy must Executive agencies follow?

    Executive agencies must actively promote the use of ridesharing 
(carpools, vanpools, privately leased buses, public transportation, and 
other multi-occupancy modes of travel) by personnel working at Federal 
facilities to conserve energy, reduce congestion, improve air quality, 
and provide an economical way for Federal employees to commute to work.


<R05>
Sec. 102-74.75  What steps must Executive agencies take to promote ridesharing at Federal facilities?

    Agencies must:

Sec. 102-75.5  What is the scope of this part?

    The real property policies contained in this part apply to Federal 
agencies, including the GSA/Public Buildings Service (PBS), operating 
under, or subject to, the authorities of the Administrator of General 
Services.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.10  What basic real property disposal policy governs Executive agencies?

    Executive agencies must provide, in a timely, efficient, and cost 
effective manner, the full range of real estate services necessary to 
support their real property utilization and disposal needs. Landholding 
agencies must make surveys of real property under their jurisdiction to 
identify property that is unutilized, underutilized, or not being put to 
optimum use. Executive agencies must have adequate procedures in place 
to promote the effective utilization and disposal of such real property.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.15  What real property disposal services must Executive agencies provide?

    Executive agencies must provide real property disposal services for 
real property assets under their custody and control. These real 
property disposal services include utilization of excess property, 
surveys, disposal of surplus property, public benefit conveyances, 
negotiated sales, public sales, related disposal services, and 
appraisals.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.20  What are Executive agencies' responsibilities concerning the utilization of excess property?

    Executive agencies' responsibilities concerning the utilization of 
excess property are to:
    (a) Increase the identification and reporting of their excess real 
property;
    (b) Achieve maximum use of their excess real property, in terms of 
economy and efficiency, to minimize expenditures for the purchase of 
real property;
    (c) Provide for the transfer of excess real property among Federal 
agencies, to mixed-ownership Government corporations, and to the 
municipal government of the District of Columbia; and
    (d) Obtain assistance from GSA in resolving conflicting requests for 
transferring real property that the involved agencies cannot resolve.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.25  What are Executive agencies' responsibilities concerning real property surveys?

    A landholding agency's responsibilities concerning real property 
surveys are to:
    (a) Survey real property under its control (i.e., that property 
reported on its financial statements) at least annually to identify 
property that is not needed, underutilized, or not being put to optimum 
use. When other needs for the property are identified or recognized, the 
agency must determine whether continuation of the current use or another 
use would better serve the public interest, considering both the Federal 
agency's needs and the property's location. In conducting annual reviews 
of their property holdings, Sec. 101-47.801(b) of this title and other 
applicable GSA regulations provide guidelines for Executive agencies to 
consider in identifying unneeded Federal real property;
    (b) Maintain its inventory of real property at the absolute minimum 
consistent with economical and efficient conduct of the affairs of the 
agency; and
    (c) Promptly report to GSA real property that it has determined to 
be excess.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.30  When may landholding Federal agencies grant rights for non-Federal interim use of excess property reported to GSA?

    Landholding Federal agencies may grant rights for non-Federal 
interim use of excess property reported to GSA, when it is determined 
that such excess property is not required for the needs of any Federal 
agency.

[[Page 75]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.35  What are Executive agencies' responsibilities concerning the disposal of surplus property?

    Executive agencies must obtain from GSA a determination that their 
excess real property is not needed for Federal use and is surplus to the 
needs of the Federal Government. After receiving this determination, 
Executive agencies, upon approval from GSA, must expeditiously make the 
surplus property available for acquisition by State and local 
governmental units and nonprofit institutions (see Sec. 102-75.55) or 
for sale by public advertising, negotiation, or other disposal action. 
Executive agencies must consider the availability of real property for 
public purposes on a case-by-case basis, based on highest and best use 
and estimated fair market value. See Sec. 101-47.202-2(b) of this title 
for the requirements for reporting excess real property. Where hazardous 
substance activity is identified, see Sec. 101-47.304-14 of this title 
for required information that the disposal agency must incorporate into 
Invitation for Bids/Offers to Purchase.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.40  When may Executive agencies dispose of surplus real property by exchange for privately owned property?

    Executive agencies may dispose of surplus real property by exchange 
for privately owned property only:
    (a) For property management considerations such as boundary 
realignment or provision of access; or
    (b) Where authorized by law, when the requesting Federal agency 
receives approval from the Office of Management and Budget and the 
appropriate oversight committees, and where the transaction offers 
substantial economic or unique program advantages not otherwise 
obtainable by any other acquisition method.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.45  When may Executive agencies outlease surplus real property for non-Federal interim use?

    Executive agencies may outlease surplus real property for non-
Federal interim use, pending its disposition, when both of the following 
conditions exist:
    (a) The lease or permit does not exceed one year and is revocable 
with not more than a 30-day notice by the disposal agency; and
    (b) The use and occupancy will not interfere with, delay, or impede 
the disposal of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.50  What are Federal agencies' reporting responsibilities under the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11411)?

    By December 31 of each year, each landholding agency responsible for 
reporting must notify the Department of Housing and Urban Development 
(HUD) regarding the current availability status and classification of 
each property controlled by the agency that:
    (a) Was included in a list of suitable properties published that 
year by HUD; and
    (b) Remains available for application for use to assist the 
homeless, or has become available for application during that year.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.55  What are Executive agencies' responsibilities concerning public benefit conveyances?

    Based on a highest and best use analysis, Executive agencies, upon 
approval from GSA, may make surplus real property available to State and 
local governments and certain nonprofit institutions at up to 100 
percent public benefit discount for public benefit purposes. Some 
examples of such purposes are education, health, park and recreation, 
the homeless, historic monuments, public airports, highways, 
correctional facilities, ports, and wildlife conservation. The 
implementing regulations are found at Sec. 101-47.308 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.60  When may Executive agencies conduct negotiated sales?

    Executive agencies may conduct negotiated sales only when:
    (a) The estimated fair market value of the property does not exceed 
$15,000; or
    (b) Bid prices after advertising are unreasonable (for all or part 
of the property) or were not independently arrived at in open 
competition; or
    (c) The character or condition of the property or unusual 
circumstances make it impractical to advertise for competitive bids and 
the fair market

[[Page 76]]

value of the property and other satisfactory terms of disposal are 
obtainable by negotiation; or
    (d) The disposals will be to States, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 
possessions, political subdivisions thereof, or tax-supported agencies 
therein, and the estimated fair market value of the property and other 
satisfactory terms of disposal are obtainable by negotiations. Such 
negotiated sales to public bodies must be limited to where a public 
benefit will result from a negotiated sale which would not be realized 
from a competitive sale disposal (some examples of such purposes are 
administrative offices and economic development); or
    (e) Negotiation is otherwise authorized by the Federal Property and 
Administrative Services Act of 1949 or other law, such as disposals of 
power transmission lines for public or cooperative power projects.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.65  What are Executive agencies' responsibilities concerning negotiated sales?

    Executive agencies must:
    (a) Obtain such competition as is feasible in all negotiations of 
disposals and contracts for disposal of surplus property; and
    (b) Prepare and transmit an explanatory statement, identifying the 
circumstances of each disposal by negotiation for any real property 
specified in 40 U.S.C. 484(e)(6)(A), to the appropriate committees of 
the Congress in advance of such disposal.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.70  What can Executive agencies do to eliminate the potential for windfall profits to public agencies in negotiated sales?

    To eliminate the potential for windfall profits to public agencies, 
Executive agencies must include in negotiated sales to public agencies 
an excess profits clause, which usually runs for 3 years. This clause 
states that, if the purchaser should sell or enter into agreements to 
sell the property within 3 years from the date of title transfer by the 
Federal Government, all proceeds in excess of the purchasers costs will 
be remitted to the Federal Government. (Put the clause found in 
Sec. 101-47.4908 of this title in the offer to purchase and in the 
conveyance document.)


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.75  What is a negotiated sale for economic development purposes?

    A negotiated sale for economic development purposes means that the 
public body purchasing the property will develop or make substantial 
improvements to the property with the intention of reselling or leasing 
the property in parcels to users to advance the community's economic 
benefit. This type of negotiated sale is acceptable where the expected 
public benefits to the community are greater than the anticipated 
proceeds derived from a competitive public sale.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.80  What are Executive agencies' responsibilities concerning public sales?

    Executive agencies must make available by competitive public sale 
any surplus property that is not disposed of by public benefit discount 
conveyance or by negotiated sale. Awards must be made to the responsible 
bidder whose bid will be most advantageous to the Government, price and 
other factors considered.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.85  How can Federal agencies obtain related disposal services?

    Federal agencies with independent disposal authority are encouraged 
to obtain disposal related services from those agencies with expertise 
in real property disposal, such as GSA, as allowed by 31 U.S.C. 1535 
(the Economy Act), so that agencies may remain focused on their core 
mission.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.90  What type of appraisal value must be obtained for real property disposal transactions?

    For all real property transactions requiring appraisals, Executive 
agencies must in all cases obtain, as appropriate, an appraisal of 
either the fair market value or the fair annual rental value of property 
available for disposal.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.95  Are appraisals required for all real property disposal transactions?

    Generally, yes, appraisals are required for all real property 
disposal

[[Page 77]]

transactions. However, appraisals are not required when either of the 
following conditions exist:
    (a) An appraisal will serve no useful purpose (e.g., legislation 
authorizes conveyance without monetary consideration or at a fixed 
price). This exception does not apply to negotiated sales to public 
agencies intending to use the property for a public purpose not covered 
by any of the special disposal provisions in Sec. 101-47.308 of this 
title.
    (b) The estimated fair market value of property to be offered on a 
competitive sale basis does not exceed $50,000.


<R05>
Sec. 102-75.100  Who must appraise the real property?

    Executive agencies must use only experienced and qualified real 
estate appraisers familiar with types of property to be appraised when 
conducting the appraisal. When an appraisal is required for the purposes 
of disposing of surplus property by negotiation under Sec. 102-75.60(c), 
(d), or (e), contract appraisers that meet this same standard must be 
used. However, Executive agencies may authorize any other method of 
obtaining an estimate of the fair market value or the fair annual rental 
when the cost of obtaining such data from a contract appraiser would be 
out of proportion to the expected recoverable value of the property.

<R05>
Sec. 102-79.65  When an agency's mission and program requirements call for the location in an urban area, are Executive agencies required to give first           consideration to central business areas?

    Yes, when agency mission and program requirements call for location 
in an urban area and new space must be acquired, constructed or leased, 
Executive agencies must give first consideration to central business 
areas (CBAs) and other areas designated by local officials (Executive 
Order 12072 (43 FR 36869, 3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 213.) and Executive 
Order 13006 (61 FR 26071, 3 CFR, 1996 Comp., p. 195)).


<R05>
Sec. 102-79.70  What is a central business area?

applicable laws, regulations, and Executive orders.


<R05>
Sec. 102-79.85  Are Executive agencies required to consider whether the central business area will provide for adequate competition when acquiring leased space?

    In accordance with the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 
(CICA), as amended, (41 U.S.C. 253(a)) Executive agencies must consider 
whether restricting the delineated area for obtaining leased space to 
the central business area will provide for adequate competition when 
acquiring leased space. Where an Executive agency determines that the 
delineated area must be expanded beyond the CBA in order to provide 
adequate competition, the agency may expand the delineated area in 
consultation with local officials. Executive agencies must continue to 
include the CBA in such expanded areas.


<R05>
Sec. 102-79.90  Are Executive agencies required to give preference to historic properties when acquiring leased space?

    Yes, section 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, 
as amended (16 U.S.C. 470h-2), requires that agencies first consider 
historic properties already under agency control. However, the Act also 
provides that prior to acquiring, constructing or leasing new space, and 
subject to the requirements of Section 601 of Title VI of the Rural 
Development Act of 1972, as amended (7 U.S.C. 2204b-1), Executive Order 
13006 and Executive Order 12072, Executive agencies must first consider 
historic properties within historic districts when locating Federal 
facilities. If no such suitable historic property is available, 
Executive agencies must then consider other developed or undeveloped 
sites within historic districts. Finally, Executive agencies must 
consider suitable historic properties outside of historic districts, if 
no suitable site exists within a historic district.

<R05>
Sec. 102-85.10  What is the scope of this part?

    (a) This part describes GSA policy and principles for the assignment 
and occupancy of space under its control and the rights and obligations 
of GSA and the customer agencies that request or occupy such space 
pursuant to GSA Occupancy Agreements (OA).
    (b) Space managed by agencies under delegation of authority from GSA 
is subject to the provisions of this part.

the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended 
(40 U.S.C. 490(h)(2)).


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.15  What are the basic policies for charging Rent for space and services?

    (a) GSA will charge for space and services furnished by GSA (unless 
otherwise exempted by the Administrator of General Services) a Rent 
charge which will approximate commercial charges for comparable space 
and services. Rent for all assignments for GSA-controlled space will be 
priced according to the principles of the pricing policy in this part. 
These principles are reflected in the following elements of GSA Rent 
charges:
    (1) ``Shell'' Rent based on approximate commercial charges for 
comparable space and services for Federally owned space (accomplished 
using appraisal procedures);
    (2) Rent based on actual cost of the lease, including the costs (if 
any) of services not provided by the lessor, plus a GSA fee;
    (3) Amortization of any tenant improvement allowance used;
    (4) Any applicable real estate taxes, operating costs, parking, 
security and joint use fees; and
    (5) For certain projects involving new construction or major 
renovation of Federally-owned buildings, a return on investment pricing 
approach if an appraisal-determined rental value does not provide a 
minimum return (OMB discount rate for calculating the present value of 
yearly costs plus 2%) on the cost of the prospective capital investment. 
Each specific use of Return on Investment (ROI) pricing must be approved 
by OMB and duly recorded in an Occupancy Agreement (OA) with the 
customer agency. Once the ROI methodology is employed to establish Rent 
for a capital investment, the ROI method must be retained for the 
duration of the OA term.
    (b) Special services not included in the standard levels of service 
may be provided by GSA on a reimbursable basis. GSA may also furnish 
alterations on a reimbursable basis in buildings where GSA is 
responsible for alterations only.
    (c) The financial terms and conditions under which GSA assigns, and 
a

[[Page 91]]

customer agency occupies, each block of GSA-controlled space, shall be 
documented in a written OA.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.20  What does an Occupancy Agreement (OA) do?

    An OA defines GSA's relationship with each customer agency and:
    (a) Establishes specific financial terms, provisions, rights, and 
obligations of GSA and its customer for each space assignment;
    (b) Minimizes exposure to future unknown costs for both GSA and 
customer agencies;
    (c) Stabilizes Rent payments to the extent reasonable and desired by 
customers; and
    (d) Allows tailoring of space and related services to meet customer 
agency needs.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.25  What is the basic principle governing OAs?

    The basic principle governing OAs is to adopt the private sector 
practice of capturing in a written document the business terms to which 
GSA and a customer agency agree concerning individual space assignments.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.30  Are there special rules for certain Federal customers?

    Yes, in lieu of OAs, GSA is able to enter into agreements with 
customer agencies that reflect the parties particular needs. For 
example, the space and services provided to the U.S. House of 
Representatives and the U.S. Senate are governed by existing memoranda 
of agreement (MOA). When there are conflicts between the provisions of 
this part and MOAs, the MOAs prevail.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.35  What definitions apply to this part?

    The following definitions apply to this part:
    Accept space or acceptance of space means a commitment from an 
agency to occupy specified GSA-controlled space.
    Agency-controlled and/or operated space means:
    (1) Space that is owned, leased, or otherwise controlled or operated 
by Federal agencies under any authority other than the Federal Property 
and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended; and
    (2) it also includes agency-acquired space for which acquisition 
authority has been delegated or otherwise granted to the agency by GSA. 
It does not include space covered by an OA.
    Assign or assignment is defined in the definition for space 
assignment.
    Building shell means the complete enveloping structure, the base-
building systems, and the finished common areas (building common and 
floor common) of a building that bound the tenant areas.
    Customer agency means any department, agency, or independent 
establishment in the Federal Government, including any wholly-owned 
corporation; any executive agency or any establishment in the 
legislative or judicial branch of the Government (except the Senate, the 
House of Representatives, and the Architect of the Capitol, and any 
activities under his direction).
    Emergency relocation is a customer move that results from an 
extraordinary event such as a fire, natural disaster, or immediate 
threat to the health and safety of occupants that renders a current 
space assignment unusable and requires that it be vacated, permanently 
or temporarily.
    Federal Buildings Fund means the fund into which Rent charges and 
other revenues are deposited, and collections cited in section 210(j) of 
the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended 
(U.S.C. 490(j)), and from which monies are available for expenditures 
for real property management and related activities in such amounts as 
are specified in annual appropriations acts without regard to fiscal 
year limitations.
    Federally controlled space means workspace for which the United 
States Government has a right of occupancy by ownership, by lease, or by 
any other means, such as by contract, barter, license, easement, permit, 
requisition, or condemnation. Such workspace excludes space owned or 
leased by private sector entities performing work on Government 
contracts.
    Federally owned space means space, the title to which is vested in 
the United States Government or which

[[Page 92]]

will vest automatically according to an existing agreement.
    Forced move means the involuntary physical relocation, from one 
space assignment to another, of a customer agency housed in GSA-
controlled space initiated by another customer agency or by GSA, before 
the expiration of a lease or an OA term. (See also the definition of 
GSA-initiated move.)
    General use space means all types of space other than ``warehouse,'' 
``parking,'' or ``unique'' space, as defined elsewhere in this part. 
Examples of general use space are:
    (1) Office and office-related space such as file areas, libraries, 
meeting rooms, computer rooms, mail rooms, training and conference, 
automated data processing operations, courtrooms, and judicial chambers; 
and
    (2) Storage space that contains different quality and finishes from 
general use space, but that is within a building where predominantly 
general use space is located.
    GSA-controlled space means Federally controlled space under the 
custody or control of GSA. It includes space for which GSA has delegated 
operational, maintenance, or protection authority to the customer 
agency.
    GSA-delegated space (or GSA delegated building) means GSA-controlled 
space for which GSA has delegated operational, maintenance or protection 
authority to the customer agency.
    GSA-initiated move means any relocation action in GSA-controlled 
space that:
    (1) Is involuntary to the customer agency and required to be 
effective prior to the expiration of an effective OA, or in the case of 
leased space, prior to the expiration of the lease; or
    (2) Is an emergency relocation initiated by GSA.
    Initial space alteration (ISA). See definition of ``tenant 
improvement.''
    Initial space layout means the specific placement of workstations, 
furniture and equipment within new space assignments.
    Inventory means a summary or itemized list of the real property, and 
associated descriptive information, that is under the control of a 
Federal agency.
    Joint-use space means common space within a Federally controlled 
facility, not specifically assigned to any one agency, and available for 
use by multiple agencies, such as cafeterias, auditoriums, conference 
rooms, credit unions, visitor parking spaces, snack bars, certain 
wellness/physical fitness facilities, and child care centers.
    Leased space means space for which the United States Government has 
a right of use and occupancy by virtue of having acquired a leasehold 
interest.
    Non-cancelable space means space that, due to its layout, design, 
location, or other characteristics, is unlikely to be needed by another 
GSA customer agency. Typical conditions that might cause space to be 
defined as non-cancelable are:
    (1) Special space construction features;
    (2) Lack of any realistic Federal need for the space other than by 
the requesting agency; and
    (3) Remote location or unusual term (short or long) desired by the 
agency.
    Occupancy Agreement (OA) means a written agreement descriptive of 
the financial terms and conditions under which GSA assigns, and a 
customer agency occupies, the GSA-controlled space identified therein.
    Parking or parking space means surface land, structures, or areas 
within structures designed and designated for the purpose of parking 
vehicles.
    Personnel means the peak number of persons to be housed during a 
single shift, regardless of how many workstations are provided for them. 
In addition to permanent employees of the agency, personnel includes 
temporaries, part-time, seasonal, and contractual employees, budgeted 
vacancies, and employees of other agencies and organizations who are 
housed in a space assignment.
    Portfolio leases mean long term or ``master'' leases, usually 
negotiated to house several agencies whose individual term requirements 
differ from the terms of the underlying GSA lease with the lessor, and 
from each other. These may also be leases housing single agencies, but 
which entail for GSA responsibilities (burdens and benefits) which mimic 
an ownership position, or equity rights, even though no equity

[[Page 93]]

interest or ownership liability exists. An example of the latter would 
be long term renewal options on a lease which, in order to enjoy, 
involve substantial capital outlays by GSA to improve the building 
infrastructure. In both these cases, GSA is assuming risks or capital 
expenditures outside of the conventions of single transactions or 
occupancies. Accordingly, for a portfolio lease, it is not appropriate 
merely to pass through to the customer agency(ies) the rental rate of 
the underlying GSA lease. Portfolio leases are treated for pricing 
purposes as owned space, with Rent set by appraisal.
    Predominant use means the use to which the greatest portion of a 
location is put. Predominant use is determined by the Public Buildings 
Service (PBS), GSA, and will typically result in the designation of a 
location as one of four types of space--General Use, Warehouse, Unique, 
or Parking--even though some smaller portions of the space may be used 
for one or more of the other types of uses.
    Rent means the amounts charged by GSA for space and related services 
to the customer agencies with tenancy in GSA-controlled space. The word 
``Rent'' is capitalized to differentiate it from the contract ``rent'' 
that GSA pays lessors.
    Rentable square footage means the amount of space as defined in 
``Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA)/American National 
Standards Institute (ANSI) Standard Z65.1-1996.'' The BOMA/ANSI standard 
also defines ``gross,'' ``office area,'' ``floor common,'' and 
``building common'' areas. Any references to these terms in this part 
refer to the BOMA/ANSI standard definitions. This standard has been 
adopted in accordance with GSA's interest in conforming its practices to 
nationally recognized industry standards to the extent possible.

    Note to the Definition of Rentable Square Footage: Rentable square 
footage generally includes square footage of areas occupied by customers 
plus a prorated share of floor common areas such as elevator lobbies, 
building corridors, public restrooms, utility closets, and machine 
rooms. Rentable square footage also includes a prorated share of 
building common areas located throughout the building. Examples of 
building common space include ground floor entrance lobby, enclosed 
atrium, loading dock, and mail room.

    Request for space or space request means a written or electronically 
submitted document or an oral request, within which an agency's space 
needs are summarized. A request for space is requisite for development 
of an OA. Thus, it must be submitted to GSA by a duly authorized 
official of the customer agency, and it must be accompanied by 
documentation of the customer agency's ability to fund payment of 
required Rent charges.
    Return on Investment (ROI) pricing is one possible methodology used 
to establish a Rent rate for certain owned space. Typically, ROI pricing 
is a Rent rate that ensures GSA a reasonable return on its cost to 
acquire and improve the asset. ROI pricing may be used where no other 
comparable commercial space is available or no other appraisal method 
would be appropriate. It may also be used in cases in which an 
appraisal-based rental rate will not meet GSA's minimum return 
requirements for the planned level of investment.
    Security fees mean Rent charges for building services provided by 
GSA's Federal Protective Service. Security fees are comprised of basic 
and building specific charges.
    (a) A basic security fee is assessed in all PBS-controlled 
properties where the Federal Protective Service (FPS) provides security 
services. The rate is set annually on a per-square-foot basis. The 
charge includes the following services:
    (1) General law enforcement on PBS-controlled property;
    (2) Physical security assessments;
    (3) Crime prevention and awareness training;
    (4) Advice and assistance to building security committees;
    (5) Intelligence sharing program;
    (6) Criminal investigation;
    (7) Assistance and coordination in Occupancy Emergency Plan 
development;
    (8) Coordination of mobilization and response to terrorist threat or 
civil disturbance;
    (9) Program administration for security guard contracts; and
    (10) Megacenter operations for monitoring building perimeter alarms 
and

[[Page 94]]

dispatching appropriate law enforcement response.
    (b) The building specific security charge is comprised of two 
elements: Operating expenses and amortized capital costs. Building 
specific charges, whether operating expenses or capital costs, are 
distributed overall federal users by building or facility in direct 
proportion to each customer agency's percentage of federal occupancy. As 
with joint use charges, the distribution of building-specific charges 
among customer agencies is not re-adjusted for vacancy.
    Space means a defined area within a building and/or parcel of land. 
(Personal property and furniture are not included.)
    Space allocation standard (SAS) means a standard agreed upon by GSA 
and a customer agency, written in terms that permit nationwide or 
regional application, that is used as a basis for establishing that 
agency's space requirements. An SAS may describe special GSA and 
customer agency funding responsibilities, although such responsibilities 
will be covered in OAs for space assignments. An SAS may also be 
developed between GSA and customer agencies on a regional level to 
standardize or simplify transactions, provided that the terms of a 
regional SAS are consistent with the terms of that agency's national SAS 
and the terms of this part.
    Space assignment or assignments means a transaction between GSA and 
a customer agency that results in a customer agency's right to occupy 
certain GSA-controlled space, usually in return for customer agency 
payment(s) to GSA for use of the space. Space assignment rights, 
obligations, and responsibilities not covered in this part, or in the 
customer guides, are formalized in an OA.
    Space planning means the process of using recognized professional 
techniques of planning, layout and interior design to determine the best 
internal location and the most efficient configuration for satisfying 
agency space needs.
    Space program of requirements means a summary statement of an 
agency's space needs. These requirements will generally include 
information about location, square footage, construction requirements, 
and duration of the agency's space need. They may be identified in any 
format mutually agreeable to GSA and the agency.
    Special space means space which has unusual architectural/
construction features, requires the installation of special equipment, 
or requires disproportionately high or low costs to construct, maintain 
and/or operate as compared to office or storage space. Special space 
generally refers to space which has construction features, finishes, 
services, utilities, or other additional costs beyond those specified in 
the customer general allowance (e.g., courtrooms, laboratories).
    Standard level of service. See Sec. 102-85.165 for the definition of 
standard level of service.
    Telecommunications means electronic processing of information, 
either voice or data or both, over a wide variety of media, (e.g., 
copper wire, microwave, fiber optics, radio frequencies), between 
individuals or offices within a building (e.g., local area networks), 
between buildings, and between cities.
    Tenant improvement (TI) means a finished component of an interior 
block of space. Tenant improvements represent additions to or 
alterations of the building shell that adapt the workspace to the 
specific uses of the customer. If made at initial occupancy, the TIs are 
known as initial space alterations or ISAs.
    Tenant improvement (TI) allowance means the dollar amount, including 
design, labor, materials, contractor costs (if contractors are used), 
management, and inspection, that GSA will spend to construct, alter, and 
finish space for customer occupancy (excluding personal property and 
furniture, which are customer agency responsibilities) at initial 
occupancy. The dollar amounts for the allowances are different for each 
agency and bureau to accommodate agencies' different mission needs. The 
dollar amounts also may vary by locations reflecting different costs in 
different markets. The PBS bill will only reflect the actual amount the 
customers spend, not the allowance. The amount of the TI allowance is 
determined by GSA. Agencies can request that GSA revise the TI allowance

[[Page 95]]

amount by project or categorically for an entire bureau. The cost of 
replacement of tenant improvements is borne by the customer agency.
    Unique space means space for which there is no commercial market 
comparable (e.g., border stations).
    Warehouse or warehouse space means space contained in a structure 
primarily intended for the housing of files, records, equipment, or 
other personal property, and is not primarily intended for housing 
personnel and office operations. Warehouse space generally is designed 
and constructed to lower specifications than office buildings, with 
features such as exposed ceilings, unfinished perimeter and few dividing 
partitions. Warehouse space also is usually heated to a lesser degree 
but not air-conditioned, and is cleaned to lesser standards than office 
space.
    Workspace means Federally controlled space in buildings and 
structures (permanent, semi-permanent, or temporary) that provides an 
acceptable environment for the performance of agency mission 
requirements by employees or by other persons occupying it.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.40  What are the major components of the pricing policy?

    The major components of the pricing policy are:
    (a) An OA between a customer agency and GSA;
    (b) Tenant improvement allowance; and
    (c) The establishment of Rent the agency pays to GSA based on the OA 
for:
    (1) Leased space, a pass-through to the customer agency of the 
underlying GSA lease contract costs, and a PBS fee; or
    (2) GSA-owned space, Rent determined by appraisal.


<R04>
                     Subpart B--Occupancy Agreement


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.45  When is an Occupancy Agreement required?

    An Occupancy Agreement (OA) is required for each customer agency's 
space assignment. The OA must be agreed to by GSA and the customer 
agency prior to GSA's commitment of funds for occupancy and formal 
assignment of space.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.50  When does availability of funding have to be certified?

    The customer agency must sign an OA prior to GSA's making any major 
contractual commitments associated with the space request. Typically, 
this should occur at the earliest possible opportunity-i.e., when funds 
become available. However, in no event shall certification occur later 
than just prior to the award of the contract to a design architect in 
the case of Federal construction or renovation in Federally owned space 
or prior to the award of a lease. This serves as a customer agency's 
funding commitment unless certification is provided on another document.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.55  What are the terms and conditions included in an OA?

    The terms and conditions are modeled after commercial practice. They 
are intended to reflect a full mutual understanding of the financial 
terms and agreement of the parties. The OA describes the actual space 
and services to be provided and all associated actual costs to the 
customer during the term of occupancy. The OA does not include any 
general provisions or terms contained in this part. OAs typically 
describe the following, depending on whether the space is leased or 
Federally owned:
    (a) Assigned square footage;
    (b) Shell Rent and term of occupancy;
    (c) Amortized amount of customer allowance used;
    (d) Operating costs and escalations;
    (e) One time charges; e.g., lump sum payments by the customer;
    (f) Real estate tax and escalations;
    (g) Parking and escalations;
    (h) Additional/reduced services;
    (i) Security services and associated Rent;
    (j) Joint use space and associated Rent;
    (k) PBS fee;
    (l) Customer rights and provisions for occupancy after OA 
expiration;
    (m) Cancellation provisions if different from this part or the 
customer service guides;

[[Page 96]]

    (n) Any special circumstances associated with the occupancy, such as 
environmental responsibilities, unusual use restrictions, or agreements 
with local authorities;
    (o) Emergency relocations;
    (p) Clauses specific to the agreement;
    (q) Other Rent, e.g., charges for antenna sites, land;
    (r) Agency standard clauses; and
    (s) General clauses defining the obligations of both parties.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.60  Who can execute an OA?

    Authorized GSA and customer agency officials who can commit or 
obligate the funds of their respective agencies can execute an OA. 
Higher level signatories may be appropriate from both agencies for space 
assignments in owned or leased space, that are unusual in size, 
location, duration, public interest, or other factors. Each agency 
decides its appropriate signatory level.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.65  How does an OA obligate the customer agency?

    An OA obligates the executing customer agency to fund the current-
year Rent obligation owed GSA, as well as to reimburse GSA for any other 
bona fide obligations that GSA may have incurred on behalf of the 
customer agency. Although the OA is an interagency agreement, 
memorializing the understanding of GSA and its customer agency, the OA 
may not be construed as obligating future year customer agency funds 
until they are legally available. A multi-year OA commitment assumes the 
customer agency will seek the necessary funding through budget and 
appropriations processes.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.70  Are the standard OA terms appropriate for non-cancelable space?

    Yes, most of the standard terms apply; however, the right to cancel 
upon a 4-month (120 day) notice is not available. See Sec. 102-85.35 for 
the definition of non-cancelable space.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.75  When can space assignments be terminated?

    (a) Customer agencies can terminate any space assignments, except 
those designated as non-cancelable, with the following stipulations:
    (1) The agency must give GSA written notice at least four months 
prior to termination.
    (2) The agency is responsible for reimbursing GSA for the unpaid 
balance of the cost of tenant improvements, generally prior to GSA 
releasing the agency from the space assignment. In the event the 
customer agency received a rent concession (e.g., free rent) at the 
inception of the assignment as part of the consideration for the entire 
lease term, then the amount of the concession applicable to the 
remaining term must be repaid to GSA.
    (3) If the space to be vacated is ready for occupancy by another 
customer and marketable, GSA accepts the termination of assignment.
    (4) If the agency has vacated all of the space and removed all 
personal property and equipment from the space by the cancellation date 
in the written notice, the agency will be released effective that date 
from further Rent payments.
    (5) An agency may terminate a GSA space assignment with less than a 
four-month advance written notice to GSA, if:
    (i) Either GSA or the terminating agency has identified another 
agency customer for the assigned space and that substitute agency wants 
and is able to fully assume the Rent payments due from the terminating 
agency; and
    (ii) The terminating agency continues to pay Rent until the new 
agency starts paying Rent.
    (b) GSA can terminate space assignments according to GSA regulations 
for emergency or forced moves.
    (c) OAs terminate automatically at expiration.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.80  Who is financially responsible for expenses resulting from tenant non-performance?

    The customer agencies are financially responsible for expenses 
incurred by the Government as a result of any failure on their part to 
fulfill a commitment outlined in an OA or other written agreements in 
advance of, or in addition to, the OA. Customer agencies

[[Page 97]]

are also financially responsible for revised design costs and any 
additional costs resulting from changes to space requirements or space 
layouts made by the agency after a lease, alteration, design, or 
construction contract has been awarded by GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.85  What if a customer agency participates in a consolidation?

    If an agency agrees to participate in a consolidation upon 
expiration of an OA, the relocation expenses will be addressed in the 
new OA negotiated by GSA and the customer agency. The customer agency 
generally pays such costs.


<R04>
                 Subpart C--Tenant Improvement Allowance


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.90  What is a tenant improvement allowance?

    A tenant improvement (TI) allowance enables the customer agency to 
design, configure and build out space to support its program operations. 
It is based on local market construction costs and the specific bureau's 
historical use of space. (See also the definition at Sec. 102-85.35.)


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.95  Who pays for the TI allowance?

    The customer agency pays for the amount of the tenant improvement 
allowance actually used.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.100  How does a customer agency pay for tenant improvements?

    To pay for the installation of tenant improvements, the customer 
agency may spend an amount not to exceed the tenant allowance. The 
amount spent by the customer agency for TIs is amortized over a period 
of time specified in the OA, not to exceed the useful life of the 
improvements. This amortization payment is in addition to the shell rent 
and services.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.105  How does an agency pay for customer alterations that exceed the TI allowance?

    Amounts exceeding the TI allowance are paid in a one-time lump sum 
and are not amortized over the term of the occupancy. The agency 
certifies lump sum funds are available prior to GSA proceeding with the 
work.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.110  Can the allowance amount be changed?

    The GSA schedule of allowances for new assignments is adjusted 
annually for design and construction cost changes. As the need arises, 
GSA may adjust an agency or bureau's TI allowance. GSA may also adjust a 
TI allowance for a specific project, if conditions warrant. This 
decision is solely GSA's. In addition, the customer agency may waive any 
part or all of its customization allowance in the case of a new space 
assignment. In the case of backfill space (also known as relet space), 
the customer agency can also waive any part or all of the tenant general 
allowance, if the customer agency will use the existing tenant 
improvements, with or without modifications.


<R04>
                         Subpart D--Rent Charges


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.115  How is the Rent determined?

    Unless an exemption is granted under the authority of the 
Administrator of General Services, the Rent charged approximates 
commercial charges for comparable space and space-related services as 
follows:
    (a) Generally, Rent for Federally owned space provided by GSA is 
based on market appraisals of fully serviced rental values for the 
predominant use to which space in a building is put; e.g., general use, 
warehouse use, and parking use. In cases where market appraisals are not 
practical; e.g., in cases involving unique space or when market 
comparables are not available, GSA may establish Rent on the basis of 
alternate commercial practices. See the discussion of alternate 
valuation methods in Sec. 102-85.125. Amortization of tenant 
improvements, parking fees, and security charges are calculated 
separately and added to the appraised shell Rent to establish the Rent 
charge. Customer agencies also pay for a pro rata share of joint use 
space.
    (b) Generally, Rent for space leased by GSA is based on the actual 
cost of the lease, including the costs (if any) of services not provided 
by the lessor,

[[Page 98]]

plus a GSA fee, and security charges and parking (if not in the lease).
    (1) The Rent is based on the terms and conditions of the OA, 
starting with the shell Rent.
    (2) In addition to the shell Rent, the Rent includes amortization of 
TI allowances used, real estate taxes, operating costs, extra services, 
parking, GSA fee for its services, and charges for security, joint-use, 
and other applicable rental charges (e.g., antenna site, land, 
wareyard).


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.120  What is shell Rent?

    Shell Rent is that portion of GSA Rent charged for the building 
envelope and land. (See Sec. 102-85.35 for the definition of building 
shell.)


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.125  What alternate methods may be used to establish Rent in Federally-owned space?

    Alternate methods of establishing Rent are based on private sector 
models. They include, but are not limited to:
    (a) Return on investment (ROI) approach or a similar cost recovery 
method used when market comparables are not available and/or GSA must 
``build to suit'' to fulfill customer agency requirements; e.g., border 
stations; and
    (b) Rent schedules for the right to use rooftops and other floor 
areas not suitable for workspace; e.g., antenna sites and signage.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.130  How are exemptions from Rent granted?

    Exemptions from Rent are rare. However, the Administrator of General 
Services may exempt any GSA customer from Rent after a determination 
that application of Rent would not be feasible or practical. Customer 
agency requests for exemptions must be addressed to the Administrator of 
General Services and submitted in accordance with GSA Order PBS 4210.1, 
``Rent Exemption Procedures,'' dated December 20, 1991, or in accordance 
with any superseding GSA order. A copy of the order may be obtained from 
the Office of Portfolio Management, General Services Administration, 
1800 F Street, NW., Washington, DC 20405.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.135  What if space and services are provided by other executive agencies?

    Any executive agency other than GSA providing space and services is 
authorized to charge the occupant for the space and services at rates 
approved by the Administrator of General Services and the Director of 
the Office of Management and Budget. If space and services are of the 
type provided by the Administrator of General Services, the executive 
agency providing the space and services must credit the monies derived 
from any fees or charges to the appropriation or fund initially charged 
for providing the space or services, as prescribed by Subsection 210(k) 
of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as 
amended (40 U.S.C. 490(k)).


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.140  How are changes in Rent reflected in OAs?

    (a) If Rent changes in ways that are identified in the OA, then no 
change to the OA is required. Typically, OAs state that certain 
components of Rent are subject to annual escalation; e.g., operating 
expenses, real estate taxes, parking charges, the basic security charge, 
and building-specific security operating and amortized capital expenses 
which do not entail a change in service level. Also, in Federally-owned 
space, OAs state that the shell rent is re-marked to market every five 
years. In leased space, the OA will identify any programmed changes in 
the lease contract rent (such as pre-set increases or steps in the 
contract rent rate) that will translate into a change in the customer 
agency's Rent. Changes in Rent specified in OAs will serve as notice to 
agencies of future Rent changes for budgeting purposes. For a discussion 
of budgeting for Rent, see Sec. 102-85.160.
    (b) Changes to Rent other than those identified in paragraph (a) of 
this section typically require an amended OA. There are many events that 
might occasion a change in Rent, and an amended OA, such as:
    (1) An agency expands or contracts at an existing location;
    (2) PBS agrees to fund additional tenant improvements that are then 
amortized over the remaining OA term, or over an extended OA term;

[[Page 99]]

    (3) Upon physical re-measurement, the true square footage of the 
space assignment is found to be different from the square footage of 
record;
    (4) The amount of joint use space in the building changes;
    (5) The level of building-specific security services changes; or
    (6) PBS undertakes new capital expenditures for new or enhanced 
security countermeasures.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.145  When are customer agencies responsible for Rent charges?

    (a) When a customer agency occupies cancelable space, it is 
responsible for Rent charges until:
    (1) The date of release specified in the OA, or until the date space 
is actually vacated, whichever occurs later; or
    (2) Four months after having provided GSA written notice of release; 
or
    (3) The date space is actually vacated, whenever occupancy extends 
beyond the date agreed upon under either paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this 
section.
    (b) When a customer agency releases non-cancelable space, it is 
responsible for all attributable Rent and other space charges until the 
OA expires. This responsibility is mitigated to the extent that GSA is 
able to assign the space to another user or dispose of it. (See 
Sec. 102-85.65 How does an OA obligate the customer agency?)
    (c) When a customer agency commits to occupy space in an OA or other 
binding document, but never occupies that space, that agency is 
responsible for:
    (1) Non-cancelable space: Rent payments due for the space until the 
OA expires, unless GSA can mitigate; or
    (2) All other space: Either GSA's space charges for 4 months plus 
the cost of tenant improvements or GSA's actual costs, whichever is 
less.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.150  How will Rent charges be reflected on the customer agency's Rent bill?

    Rent charges are billed monthly, in arrears, based on an annual rate 
which is divided by 12. Billing commences the first month in which the 
agency occupies the space for more than half of the month, and ends in 
the last month the agency occupies the space.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.155  What does a customer agency do if it does not agree with a Rent bill?

    (a) If a customer agency does not agree with the way GSA has 
determined its Rent obligation (e.g., the agency does not agree with 
GSA's space classification, appraised Rent, or the allocation of space), 
the agency may appeal its Rent bill to GSA.
    (b) GSA will not increase or otherwise change Rent for any 
assignment, except as agreed in an OA, in the case of errors, or when 
the OA is amended. However, customer agencies may at any time request a 
regional review of the measurement, classification, service levels 
provided, or charges assessed that pertain to the space assignment 
without resorting to formal procedures. Such requests do not constitute 
appeals and should be directed to the appropriate GSA Regional 
Administrator.
    (c) If a customer agency still wants to pursue a formal appeal of 
Rent charges, they may do so, but with the following limitations:
    (1) Terms, including rates, to which the parties agree in an OA are 
not appealable;
    (2) In leased space, the contract rent passed through from the 
underlying lease cannot be appealed;
    (3) In GSA-owned space, when the fully-serviced shell Rent is 
established through appraisal, the appraised rate must exceed comparable 
commercial square foot rates by 20 percent. When shell Rent in owned 
space is established on the basis of ROI at the inception of an OA, and 
the customer agency executes the OA, then the ROI rate cannot later be 
appealed. Other components of Rent that are established on the basis of 
actual cost--eg., amortization of TIs and building specific security 
charges--also cannot be appealed.
    (4) Additionally, the customer agency is required to compare its 
assigned space with other space in the surrounding community that:
    (i) Is available in similar size block of space in a comparable 
location;
    (ii) Is comparable in quality to the space provided by GSA;
    (iii) Provides similar service levels as part of the charges;

[[Page 100]]

    (iv) Contains similar contractual terms, conditions, and escalations 
clauses; and
    (v) Represents a lease transaction completed at a similar point in 
time.
    (5) Data from at least three comparable locations will be necessary 
to demonstrate a market trend sufficient to warrant revising an 
appraised Rent charge.
    (d) A customer agency filing an appeal for a particular location or 
building must develop documentation supporting the appeal and file the 
appeal with the appropriate Regional Administrator. The GSA regional 
office will verify all pertinent information and documentation 
supporting the appeal. The GSA Regional Administrator will accept or 
deny the appeal and will notify the appealing agency of his or her 
ruling.
    (e) A further appeal may be filed by the customer agency's 
headquarters level officials with the Commissioner, Public Buildings 
Service, if equitable resolution has not been obtained from the initial 
appeal. A head of a customer agency may further appeal to the 
Administrator of the General Services. Documentation of the procedures 
followed for prior resolution must accompany an appeal to the 
Administrator. Decisions made by the Administrator are final.
    (f) Adjustments of Rent resulting from reviews and appeals will be 
effective in the month that the agency submitted a properly documented 
appeal. Adjustments in Rent made under this section remain in effect for 
the remainder of the 5-year period in which the charges cited in the OA 
were applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.160  How does a customer agency know how much to budget for Rent?

    GSA normally provides customer agencies an estimate of Rent 
increases approximately 2 months prior to the agencies' Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) submission for the fiscal year in which GSA 
will charge Rent. This gives the affected customer agencies an 
opportunity to budget for an increase or decrease. However, GSA must 
obtain the concurrence of OMB for such changes prior to notifying 
customer agencies. In the event GSA is unable to provide timely notice 
of a future Rent increase, customer agencies are nonetheless obligated 
to pay the increased Rent amount. For existing assignments in owned 
buildings, GSA charges for fully serviced shell Rent, in aggregate, 
shall not exceed the bureau level budget estimates provided to the 
customer agencies annually. This provision does not apply to:
    (a) New assignments;
    (b) Changes in current assignments;
    (c) Leased space;
    (d) New tenant improvement amortization;
    (e) Building specific security costs; and
    (f) New amortization of capital expenditures under ROI pricing due 
to changes in scope of proposed projects or repair and/or replacement of 
building components


<R04>
                  Subpart E--Standard Levels of Service


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.165  What are standard levels of service?

    (a) The standard levels of service covered by GSA Rent are 
comparable to those furnished in commercial practice. They are based on 
the effort required to service the customer agency's space for a 5-day 
week (Monday to Friday), one-shift regular work schedule. GSA will 
provide adequate building startup services, before the beginning of the 
customer's regular one-shift work schedule, and shutdown services after 
the end of this schedule.
    (b) Without additional charge, GSA customers may use their assigned 
space and supporting automatic elevator systems, lights and small office 
and business machines including personal computers on an incidental 
basis, unless specified otherwise in the OA.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.170  Can flexitime and other alternative work schedules cost the customer agency more?

    Yes, GSA customers who extend their regular work schedule by a 
system of flexible hours shall reimburse GSA for its approximate cost of 
the additional services required.

[[Page 101]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.175  Are the standard level services for cleaning, mechanical operation, and maintenance identified in an OA?

    Unless specified otherwise in the OA, standard level services for 
cleaning, mechanical operation, and maintenance shall be provided in 
accordance with the GSA standard level of services as defined in 
Sec. 102-85.165, and in the PBS Customer Guide to Real Property. A copy 
of the guide may be obtained from the General Services Administration, 
Office of Business Performance (PX), 1800 F Street, NW., Washington, DC 
20405.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.180  Can there be other standard services?

    GSA may provide additional services to its customers at the levels 
and times deemed by the Administrator of General Services to be 
necessary for efficient operations and proper servicing of space under 
the assignment responsibility of GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.185  Can space be exempted from the standard levels of service

    Yes, customer agencies may be excused from paying for standard 
service levels for space assignments when:
    (a) In GSA-delegated space, the customer agency provides for these 
services itself and thus pays Rent minus charges for these services; or
    (b) In rare instances, standard service levels may be waived by the 
Administrator of General Services in instances where charging for such 
standard services would not be feasible or practical, e.g., in 
assignments of limited square footage or functional use.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.190  Can GSA Rent be adjusted when standard levels of service are performed by other customer agencies?

    Customer agencies that arrange and pay separately for the costs of 
standard level services normally covered by GSA Rent will receive a Rent 
credit or other type of reimbursement by GSA for the amount GSA would 
have charged for such services. The type of reimbursement is at GSA's 
discretion. The reimbursement is limited to the amount included for the 
services in GSA Rent. Approval to perform or contract for such services 
must be obtained in advance by the customer agency from the appropriate 
GSA regional office.


<R04>
                       Subpart F--Special Services


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.195  Does GSA provide special services?

    Yes, GSA provides special services on a cost-reimbursable basis:
    (a) In GSA-controlled space, GSA may provide for special services 
that cannot be separated from the building or space costs (inseparable 
services, such as utilities, which are not individually metered). GSA's 
estimate of the special service cost is the basis for the bill amount. 
The bill amount for separable special services is either based on a 
previously agreed upon fixed price or the actual cost, including a fee 
for GSA's services.
    (b) GSA can also provide special services to other Federal agencies 
in agency-controlled and operated space on a cost-reimbursable basis.


<R04>
       Subpart G--Continued Occupancy, Relocation and Forced Moves


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.200  Can customer agencies continue occupancy of space or must they relocate at the end of an OA?

    The answer is contingent upon whether the customer agency is in 
Federally owned or leased space.
    (a) Unless stated otherwise in the OA, a customer agency within a 
GSA controlled, Federally owned building has automatic occupancy rights 
at the end of the OA term for occupied space. However, a new OA must be 
negotiated.
    (b) In leased space, the OA generally reflects the provisions of the 
underlying lease and will specify whether or not renewal options are 
available. If the OA does not include a renewal option, customer 
agencies should assume relocation would be necessary upon OA expiration, 
and budget for it. Further, renewal options are not, in themselves, a 
guarantee of continued occupancy at that location. In some cases, the 
renewal rate is substantially above market or the option was not part of 
the

[[Page 102]]

initial price evaluation for the occupancy. In such cases, GSA may be 
required to run a competition for the replacement lease, and a 
relocation may ensue. Nonetheless, it is also possible that GSA may 
execute a succeeding lease with the incumbent lessor, in which case 
there is no move.
    (c) GSA and customer agencies should initiate discussions at least 
18-20 months in advance of OA expiration to address an action for the 
replacement or continued occupancy of the existing space assignment. 
This allows both agencies time to budget for the work and the cost.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.205  What happens if a customer agency continues occupancy after the expiration of an OA?

    A mutual goal of GSA and its customers is to have current OAs in 
place for all space assignments. However, provisions are necessary to 
cover the GSA and customer relationship if an OA expires prior to 
execution of a mutually desired succeeding agreement. Because the risks, 
liabilities, and consequences of a customer's continued occupancy depend 
on whether the assigned space is leased or Federally owned, different 
provisions in the following table apply:

   Holdover Tenancy--Customer Agency Responsibilities in the Event of
                     Tenant Delay in Vacating Space
------------------------------------------------------------------------
              In leased space                 In federally owned space
------------------------------------------------------------------------
To pay those costs associated with lease    To pay Rent as determined by
 contract, GSA fee, and damages/claims,      GSA's pricing policy, as
 arising from changes in GSA contract        described in this part, and
 costs which are caused by the tenant's      those added costs to GSA
 delay.                                      (claims, damages, changes,
                                             etc.) resulting from the
                                             tenant-caused delay.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.210  What if a customer agency has to relocate?

    If the agency or GSA determines relocation is necessary at the 
expiration of an OA for either Federally owned or leased space, the 
customer agency is responsible for all costs associated with relocation 
at that time.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.215  What if another customer agency forces a GSA customer to move?

    If a GSA customer agency, or GSA, forces the relocation of another 
GSA customer agency prior to the expiration of the customer's OA, the 
``forcing'' agency is responsible:
    (a) For all reasonable costs associated with the relocation of the 
agency being ``forced'' to move, including architectural-engineering 
design, move coordination and physical relocation, telecommunications 
and ADP equipment relocation and installation;
    (b) To GSA for all of the relocated agency's unpaid tenant 
improvements, if any; and
    (c) To the customer agency for the undepreciated amount of any lump 
sum payment that was already made by the agency for alterations.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.220  Can a customer agency forced to relocate waive the reimbursements?

    Yes, a customer agency forced to relocate can waive some or all of 
the reimbursements from the forcing agency that are prescribed in 
Sec. 102-85.215. However, a relocated customer agency cannot waive the 
requirement for the forcing customer agency to reimburse GSA for unpaid 
tenant improvements. If GSA is the ``forcing'' agency, it is responsible 
for the same costs as any other forcing customer agency.


<R05>
Sec. 102-85.225  What are the funding responsibilities for relocations resulting from emergencies?

    (a) In emergencies, swift remedies, including the possible 
relocation of a customer agency to alternate space, are required. The 
remedies may include requests for funding authorizations from OMB and 
Congress. GSA may serve as the central coordinator of such remedies.
    (b) Funding responsibility will vary by situation. If a customer 
agency is only temporarily displaced from its space, GSA typically 
covers the cost of temporary set-up in a provisional location. If the 
agency is obliged to relocate permanently, an OA will be prepared which 
will address all terms of

[[Page 103]]

the occupancy. In such cases, new tenant improvements will be 
constructed which can be amortized over the life of a new occupancy 
term, and a new Rent rate will be developed.

         Subpart B--Acquiring Transportation or Related Services


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.30  What choices do I have when acquiring transportation or related services?

    When you acquire transportation or related services you may:
    (a) Use the GSA tender of service;
    (b) Use another agency's contract or rate tender with a TSP only if 
allowed by the terms of that agreement or if the Administrator of 
General Services delegates authority to another agency to enter an 
agreement available to other Executive agencies;
    (c) Contract directly with a TSP using the acquisition procedures 
under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR chapter 1); or
    (d) Negotiate a rate tender under a Federal transportation 
procurement statute, 49 U.S.C. 10721 or 13712.

[[Page 108]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.35  What are the advantages and disadvantages of using GSA's tender of service?

    (a) It is an advantage to use GSA's tender of service when you want 
to:
    (1) Use GSA's authority to negotiate on behalf of the Federal 
Government and take advantage of the lower rates and optimum service 
that result from a larger volume of business;
    (2) Use a uniform tender of service; and
    (3) Obtain assistance with loss and damage claims.
    (b) It is a disadvantage to use GSA's tender of service when:
    (1) You want an agreement that is binding for a longer term than the 
GSA tender of service;
    (2) You have sufficient time to follow FAR contracting procedures; 
and
    (3) You do not want to pay for the GSA administrative service charge 
as a participant in the GSA rate tender programs.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.40  When is it advantageous for me to use another agency's contract or rate tender for transportation services?

for transportation services when the contract or rate tender offers 
better or equal value than otherwise available to you.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.45  What other factors must I consider when using another agency's contract or rate tender?

    When using another agency's contract or rate tender, you must:
    (a) Assure that the contract or rate tender meets any special 
requirements unique to your agency;
    (b) Pay any other charges imposed by the other agency for external 
use of their contract or rate tender; and
    (c) Ensure the terms of the other agency's contract or rate tender 
allow you to use it.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.50  What are the advantages and disadvantages of contracting directly with a TSP under the FAR?

    (a) The FAR is an advantage to use when:
    (1) You ship consistent volumes in consistent traffic lanes;
    (2) You have sufficient time to follow FAR contracting procedures; 
and
    (3) Your contract office is able to handle the requirement.
    (b) The FAR may be a disadvantage when you:
    (1) Cannot prepare and execute a FAR contract within your time 
frame; or
    (2) Have recurring shipments between designated places, but do not 
expect sufficient volume to obtain favorable rates.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.55  What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a rate tender?

    (a) Using a rate tender is an advantage when you:
    (1) Have a shipment that must be made within too short a time frame 
to identify or solicit for a suitable contract; or
    (2) Have shipments recurring between designated places, but do not 
expect sufficient volume to obtain favorable rates.
    (b) Using a rate tender may be a disadvantage when:
    (1) You have sufficient time to use the FAR and this would achieve 
better results;
    (2) You require transportation service for which no rate tender 
currently exists; or
    (3) A TSP may revoke or terminate the tender on short notice.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.60  What is the importance of terms and conditions in a rate tender or other transportation document?

    Terms and conditions are important to protect the Government's 
interest and establish the performance and standards expected of the 
TSP. It is important to remember that terms and conditions are:
    (a) Negotiated between the agency and the TSP before movement of any 
item; and
    (b) Included in all contracts and rate tenders listing the services 
the TSP is offering to perform at the cost presented in the rate tender 
or other transportation document.

    Note to Sec. 102-117.60: You must reference the negotiated contract 
or rate tender on all transportation documents. For further information 
see Sec. 102-117.65.

Collection Act of 1982, 31 U.S.C. 3717.
    (d) To qualify for the rates specified in a rate tender filed under 
the provisions of the Federal transportation procurement statutes (49 
U.S.C. 10721 or 13712), property must be shipped by or for the 
Government and the rate tender must indicate the Government is either 
the consignor or the consignee and include the following statement:

    Transportation is for the (agency name) and the total charges paid 
to the transportation service provider by the consignor or consignee are 
for the benefit of the Government.

    (e) When using a rate tender for transportation under a cost-
reimbursable contract, include the following statement in the rate 
tender:

    Transportation is for the (agency name), and the actual total 
transportation charges paid to the transportation service provider by 
the consignor or consignee are to be reimbursed by the Government 
pursuant to cost reimbursable contract (number). This may be confirmed 
by contacting the agency representative at (name, address and telephone 
number).

    (f) Other terms and conditions that may be specific to your agency 
or the TSP such as specialized packaging requirements or HAZMAT. For

    (a) A Government bill of lading (GBL), Optional Forms 1103 and 1203, 
is a controlled document that conveys specific terms and conditions to 
protect the Government interest and serves as the contract of carriage.
    (b) A bill of lading, sometimes referred to as a commercial bill of 
lading, is the document used as a receipt of goods and documentary 
evidence of title.
    (c) Use a bill of lading for Government shipments if the specific 
terms and conditions of a GBL are included in any contract or rate 
tender (see Sec. 102-117.65) and the bill of lading makes reference to 
that contract or rate tender (see Sec. 102-117.75 and the ``U.S. 
Government Freight Transportation Handbook'').

[[Page 110]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.90  May I use U.S. Government bill of lading (GBL) (Optional Forms 1103 and 1203), to acquire freight, household goods or other related 
          transportation services?

    You may use the GBL, Optional Forms 1103 or 1203, to acquire 
transportation services offered under a contract or rate tender until 
September 30, 2001. The GBL will completely phase out for domestic 
shipments on September 30, 2001, and be replaced by commercial bills of 
lading. After September 30, 2001, you may use the GBL only for 
international shipments (including domestic offshore shipments).


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.95  After the GBLs retire for domestic shipments, what transportation documents must I use to acquire freight, household goods or other transportation services?

    Bills of lading and purchase orders are the transportation documents 
you use to acquire freight, household goods and other transportation

<R04>
    Subpart C--Business Rules To Consider Before Shipping Freight or 
                             Household Goods


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.100  What business rules must I consider before acquiring transportation or related services?

    When acquiring transportation or related services you must:
    (a) Use the mode or individual transportation service provider (TSP) 
that provides the overall best value to the agency. For more 
information, see Secs. 102-117.105 through 102-117.130;
    (b) Demonstrate no preferential treatment to any TSP when arranging 
for transportation services except on international shipments. 
Preference on international shipments must be given to United States 
registered commercial vessels and aircraft;
    (c) Ensure that small businesses receive equal opportunity to 
compete for all business they can perform to the maximum extent 
possible, consistent with the agency's interest (see 48 CFR part 19);
    (d) Encourage minority-owned businesses and women-owned businesses, 
to compete for all business they can perform to the maximum extent 
possible, consistent with the agency's interest (see 48 CFR part 19);
    (e) Review the need for insurance. Generally, the Government is 
self-insured; however, there are instances when the Government will 
purchase insurance coverage for Government property. An example may be 
cargo insurance for international air cargo shipments to cover losses 
over those allowed under the International Air Transport Association 
(IATA) or for ocean freight shipments; and
    (f) Consider the added requirements on international transportation 
found in subpart D of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.105  What does best value mean when routing a shipment?

    Best value to your agency when routing a shipment means using the 
mode or individual TSP providing the best combination of satisfactory 
service factors.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.110  What is satisfactory service?

    You should consider the following factors in assessing whether a TSP 
offers satisfactory service:
    (a) Availability and suitability of the TSP's equipment;
    (b) Adequacy of shipping and receiving facilities at origin and 
destination;
    (c) Adequacy of pickup and/or delivery service;
    (d) Availability of accessorial and special services;
    (e) Estimated time in transit;
    (f) Record of past performance of the TSP including accuracy of 
billing;
    (g) Capability of warehouse equipment and storage space; and
    (h) Experience of company, management, and personnel to perform the 
requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.115  How do I calculate total delivery costs?

    You calculate total delivery costs for a shipment by considering all 
costs related to the shipping or receiving process, such as packing, 
blocking, bracing,

[[Page 111]]

drayage, loading and unloading, and transporting.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.120  To what extent must I equally distribute orders for transportation and related services among TSPs?

    You must assure that small businesses, socially or economically 
disadvantaged and women-owned TSPs have equal opportunity to provide the 
transportation or related services.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.125  How detailed must I describe property for shipment when communicating to a TSP?

    You must describe property in enough detail for the TSP to determine 
the type of equipment or any special precautions necessary to move the 
shipment. Details might include weight, volume, measurements, routing, 
hazardous cargo, or special handling designations.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.130  Must I select TSPs who use alternative fuels?

    No, but, whenever possible, you are encouraged to select TSPs that 
use alternative fuel vehicles and equipment, under policy in the Clean 
Air Act Amendments of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 7612) or the Energy Policy Act of 
1992 (42 U.S.C. 13212).

                       Freight and Household Goods


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.135  What are the international transportation restrictions?

    Several statutes mandate the use of U.S. flag carriers for 
international shipments (see 48 CFR part 47, subparts 47.4 and 47.5). 
For example:
    (a) Arrangements for international air transportation services must 
follow the Fly America Act (International Air Transportation Fair 
Competitive Practices Act of 1974) (49 U.S.C. 40118); and
    (b) International movement of property by water is subject to the 
cargo preference laws (see 46 CFR part 381 and 48 CFR part 47, subpart 
47.5), which require the use of a U.S. flag carrier when service is 
available. The Maritime Administration (MARAD) monitors agency 
compliance of these laws. All Government shippers must send a rated copy 
of the ocean carrier's bill of lading to MARAD within 30 days of loading 
aboard a vessel to:

Sec. 102-117.220  What choices do I have to ship HHG?

    (a) You may choose to ship HHG by:
    (1) Using the commuted rate system;
    (2) GSA's Centralized Household Goods Traffic Management Program 
(CHAMP);
    (3) Contracting directly with a TSP, (including a relocation company 
that offers transportation services) using the acquisition procedures 
under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (see Sec. 102-117.35);
    (4) Using another agency's contract with a TSP (see Sec. Sec. 102-
117.40 and 102-117.45);
    (5) Using a rate tender under the Federal transportation procurement 
statutes (49 U.S.C. 10721 or 13712) (see Sec. 102-117.35).
    (b) As an alternative to the choices in paragraph (a) of this 
section, you may request the Department of State to assist with 
shipments of HHG moving to, from, and between foreign countries or 
international shipments originating in the continental United States. 
The nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate may assist with arrangements of 
movements originating abroad. For further information contact:

Department of State
Transportation Operations

Washington, DC 20520

    Note to Sec. 102-117-220: Agencies must use the commuted rate system 
for civilian employees who transfer between points inside the 
continental United States unless it is evident from the cost comparison 
that the Government will incur a savings ($100 or more) using another 
choice listed. The use of household goods rate tenders is not authorized 
when household goods are shipped under the commuted rate system.

<R05>
Sec. 102-117.225  What is the difference between a contract or a rate tender and a commuted rate system?

    (a) Under a contract or a rate tender, the agency prepares the bill 
of lading and books the shipment. The agency is the shipper and pays the 
TSP the applicable charges. If loss or damage occurs, the agency may 
either file a claim on behalf of the employee directly with the TSP, or 
help the employee in filing a claim against the TSP.
    (b) Under the commuted rate system an employee arranges for shipping 
HHG and is reimbursed by the agency for the resulting costs. Use this 
method only within the continental United States (not Hawaii or Alaska). 
The agency reimburses the employee according to the Commuted Rate 
Schedule published by the GSA. The Commuted Rate Schedule (without rate 
table) is available on the Internet at http://www.policyworks.gov.
    (c) For rate table information or a subscription for the Commercial 
Relocation Tariff contact:

Sec. 102-117.230  Must I compare costs between a contract or a rate tender and the commuted rate system before choosing which method to use?

    Yes, you must compare the cost between a contract or a rate tender, 
and the commuted rate system before you make a decision.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.235  How do I get a cost comparison?

    (a) You may calculate a cost comparison internally according to 41 
CFR 302-8.3.
    (b) You may request GSA to perform the cost comparison if you 
participate in the CHAMP program by sending GSA the following 
information as far in advance as possible (preferably 30 calendar days):
    (1) Name of employee;
    (2) Origin city, county and State;
    (3) Destination city, county, and State;
    (4) Date of household goods pick up;
    (5) Estimated weight of shipments;
    (6) Number of days storage-in-transit (if applicable); and

<R05>
Sec. 102-117.240  What is my agency's financial responsibility to an employee who chooses to move all or part of his/her HHG under the commuted rate system?

    (a) Your agency is responsible for reimbursing the employee what it 
would cost the Government to ship the employee's HHG by the most cost-
effective means available or the employee's actual moving expenses, 
whichever is less.
    (b) The employee is liable for the additional cost when the cost of 
transportation arranged by the employee is more than what it would cost 
the Government.
    Note to Sec. 102-117.240: For more information on how to ship 
household goods, refer to 41 CFR 302-8.3.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.245  What is my responsibility in providing guidance to an employee who wishes to use the commuted rate system?

    You must counsel employees that they may be liable for all costs 
above the amount reimbursed by the agency if they select a TSP that 
charges more than provided under the Commuted Rate Schedule.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.250  What are my responsibilities after shipping the household goods?

    (a) Each agency should develop an evaluation survey for the employee 
to complete following the move.
    (b) Under the CHAMP program, you must counsel employees to fill out

[[Page 115]]

their portion of the GSA Form 3080, Household Goods Carrier Evaluation 
Report. This form reports the quality of the TSP's performance. After 
completing the appropriate sections of this form, the employee must send 
it to the bill of lading issuing officer who in turn will complete the 
form and forward it to:

<R05>
Sec. 102-117.255  What actions may I take if the TSP's performance is not satisfactory?

    If the TSP's performance is not satisfactory, you may place a TSP in 
temporary nonuse, suspended status, or debarred status. For more 
information on doing this, see subpart I of this part and the FAR (48 
CFR 9.406-3 and 9.407-3).


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.260  What are my responsibilities to employees regarding the TSP's liability for loss or damage claims?

    Regarding the TSP's liability for loss or damage claims, you must:
    (a) Advise employees on the limits of the TSP's liability for loss 
of and damage to their HHG so the employee may evaluate the need for 
added insurance;
    (b) Inform the employee about the procedures to file claims for loss 
and damage to HHG with the TSP; and
    (c) Counsel employees, who have a loss or damage to their HHG that 
exceeds the amount recovered from a TSP, on procedures for filing a 
claim against the Government for the difference. Agencies may compensate 
employees up to $40,000 on claims for loss and damage under 31 U.S.C. 
3721, 3723 (41 CFR 302-8.2(f)).


<R05>

other administrative or judicial action against a TSP. Refer to part 
102-118 of this chapter for information on claims.


<R04>
                     Subpart H--Performance Measures


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.270  What are agency performance measures for transportation?

    (a) Agency performance measures are indicators of how you are 
supporting your customers and doing your job. By tracking performance 
measures you can report specific accomplishments and your success in 
supporting the agency mission. The Government Performance and Results 
Act (GPRA) of 1993 (31 U.S.C. 1115) requires agencies to develop 
business plans and set up program performance measures.
    (b) Examples of performance measurements in transportation would 
include how well you:
    (1) Increase the use of electronic commerce;
    (2) Adopt industry best practices and services to meet your agency 
requirements;
    (3) Use TSPs with a track record of successful past performance or 
proven superior ability;
    (4) Take advantage of competition in moving agency freight and 
household goods;
    (5) Assure that delivery of freight and household goods is on time 
against measured criteria; and
    (6) Create simplified procedures to be responsive and adaptive to 
the customer needs and concerns.


<R04>
      Subpart I--Transportation Service Provider (TSP) Performance


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.275  What performance must I expect from a TSP?

    You must expect the TSP to provide consistent and satisfactory 
service to meet your agency transportation needs.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.280  What aspects of the TSP's performance are important to measure?

    Important TSP performance measures may include, but are not limited 
to the:
    (a) TSP's percentage of on-time deliveries;
    (b) Percentage of shipments that include overcharges or 
undercharges;

[[Page 116]]

    (c) Percentage of claims received in a given period;
    (d) Percentage of returns received on-time;
    (e) Percentage of shipments rejected;
    (f) Percentage of billing improprieties;
    (g) Average response time on tracing shipments;
    (h) TSP's safety record (accidents, losses, damages or misdirected 
shipments) as a percentage of all shipments;
    (i) TSP's driving record (accidents, traffic tickets and driving 
complaints) as a percentage of shipments; and
    (j) Percentage of customer satisfaction reports on carrier 
performance.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.285  What are my choices if a TSP's performance is not satisfactory?

    You may choose to place a TSP in temporary nonuse, suspension, or 
debarment if performance is unsatisfactory.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.290  What is the difference between temporary nonuse, suspension and debarment?

    (a) Temporary nonuse is limited to your agency and initiated by the 
agency transportation officers for a period not to exceed 90 days for:
    (1) Willful violations of the terms of the rate tender;
    (2) Persistent or willful failure to meet requested packing and 
pickup service;
    (3) Failure to meet required delivery dates;
    (4) Violation of Department of Transportation (DOT) hazardous 
material regulations;
    (5) Mishandling of freight, damaged or missing transportation seals, 
improper loading, blocking, packing or bracing of property;
    (6) Improper routing of property;
    (7) Subjecting your shipments to unlawful seizure or detention by 
failing to pay debts;
    (8) Operating without legal authority;
    (9) Failure to settle claims according to Government regulations; or
    (10) Repeated failure to comply with regulations of DOT, Surface 
Transportation Board, State or local governments or other Government 
agencies.
    (b) Suspension is disqualifying a TSP from receiving orders for 
certain services under a contract or rate tender pending an 
investigation or legal proceeding. A TSP may be suspended on adequate 
evidence of:
    (1) Fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, 
attempting to obtain, or performing a contract for transportation;
    (2) Violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes;
    (3) Embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or 
destruction of records, making false statements, or receiving stolen 
property; and
    (4) Any other offense indicating a lack of business integrity or 
business honesty that seriously and directly affects the present 
responsibility of the TSP as a transporter of the Government's property 
or the HHG of its employees relocated for the Government.
    (c) Debarment means action taken to exclude a contractor from 
contracting with all Federal agencies. The seriousness of the TSP's acts 
or omissions and the mitigating factors must be considered in making any 
debarment decisions. A TSP may be debarred for the following reasons:
    (1) Failure of a TSP to take the necessary corrective actions within 
the period of temporary nonuse; or
    (2) Conviction of or civil judgment for any of the causes for 
suspension.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.295  Who makes the decisions on temporary nonuse, suspension and debarment?

    (a) The transportation officer may place a TSP in temporary nonuse 
for a period not to exceed 90 days.
    (b) The serious nature of suspension and debarment requires that 
these sanctions be imposed only in the public interest for the 
Government's protection and not for purposes of punishment. Only the 
agency head or his/her designee may suspend or debar a TSP.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.300  Do the decisions on temporary nonuse, suspension and debarment go beyond the agency?

    (a) Temporary nonuse does not go beyond the agency.
    (b) GSA compiles and maintains a current list of all suspended or

[[Page 117]]

debarred TSPs and periodically distributes the list to all agencies and 
the General Accounting Office.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.305  Where do I go for information on the process for suspending or debarring a TSP?

9.4) for policies and procedures governing suspension and debarment of a 
TSP.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.310  What records must I keep on temporary nonuse, suspension or debarment of a TSP?

    (a) You must set up a program consistent with your agency's internal 
record retention procedures to document the placement of TSPs in a 
nonuse, suspended or debarred status.
    (b) For temporary nonuse, your records must contain the following 
information:
    (1) Name, address, and Standard Carrier Alpha Code and Taxpayer 
Identification Number of each TSP placed in temporary nonuse status;
    (2) The duration of the temporary nonuse status;
    (3) The cause for imposing temporary nonuse, and the facts showing 
the existence of such a cause;
    (4) Information and arguments in opposition to the temporary nonuse 
period sent by the TSP or its representative; and
    (5) The reviewing official's determination about keeping or removing 
temporary nonuse status.
    (c) For suspended or debarred TSPs, your records must include the 
same information as paragraph (b) of this section and you must:
    (1) Assure your agency does not award contracts to a suspended or 
debarred TSP; and
    (2) Notify GSA (see Sec. 102-117.315).


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.315  Who must I notify on suspension or debarment of a TSP?

Commission. The proceeding may be at the Federal or State level 
depending on the activity regulated.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.325  May my agency appear on its own behalf before a transportation regulatory body proceeding?

    Generally, no executive agency may appear on its own behalf in any 
proceeding before a transportation regulatory body, unless the 
Administrator of General Services delegates the authority to the agency. 
The statutory authority for the Administrator of General Services to 
participate in regulatory proceedings on behalf of all Federal agencies 
is in section 201(a)(4) of the Federal Property and Administrative 
Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 481(a)(4)).


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.330  When, or under what circumstances, would GSA delegate authority to an agency to appear on its own behalf before a transportation regulatory body proceeding?

    GSA will delegate authority when it does not have the expertise, or 
when it is outside of GSA's purview, to make a determination on an issue 
such as a protest of rates, routings or excessive charges.


<R05>
Sec. 102-117.335  How does my agency ask for a delegation to represent itself in a regulatory body proceeding?

    You must send your request for delegation with enough detail to 
explain the circumstances surrounding the need for delegation of 
authority for representation to:

<R05>
Sec. 102-117.340  What other types of assistance may GSA provide agencies in dealing with regulatory bodies?

    (a) GSA has oversight of all public utilities used by the Federal 
Government including transportation. There are specific regulatory 
requirements a TSP must meet at the State level, such as the requirement 
to obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity.
    (b) GSA has a list of TSPs, which meet certain criteria regarding 
insurance and safety, approved by DOT. You must furnish GSA with an 
affidavit to determine if the TSP meets the basic qualification to 
protect the Government's interest. As an oversight mandate, GSA 
coordinates this function. For further information contact:

    (a) Currently, there is no requirement for reporting to GSA on your 
transportation activities. However, GSA will work with your agency and 
other agencies to develop reporting requirements and procedures. In 
particular, GSA will develop a Governmentwide transportation reporting 
system by October 1, 2002.

<R05>
Sec. 102-117.350  How will GSA use reports I submit?

    (a) Reporting on transportation and transportation related services 
will provide GSA with:
    (1) The ability to assess the magnitude and key characteristics of 
transportation within the Government (e.g., how much agencies spend; 
what type of commodity is shipped; etc.);
    (2) Data to analyze and recommend changes to policies, standards, 
practices, and procedures to improve Government transportation; and
    (3) A better understanding of how your activity relates to other 
agencies and your influence on the Governmentwide picture of 
transportation services.
    (b) In addition, this information will assist you in showing your 
management the magnitude of your agency's transportation program and the 
effectiveness of your efforts to control cost and improve service.

                           Subpart A--General

                              Introduction


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.5  What is the purpose of this part?

    The purpose of this part is to interpret statutes and other policies 
that assure that payment and payment mechanisms for agency 
transportation services are uniform and appropriate. This part 
communicates the policies clearly to agencies and transportation service 
providers (TSPs). (See Sec. 102-118.35 for the definition of TSP.)


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.10  What is a transportation audit?

    A transportation audit is a thorough review and validation of 
transportation related bills. The audit must examine the validity, 
propriety, and conformity of the charges with tariffs, quotations, 
agreements, or tenders, as appropriate. Each agency must ensure that its 
internal transportation audit procedures prevent duplicate payments and 
only allow payment for authorized services, and that the TSP's bill is 
complete with required documentation.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.15  What is a transportation payment?

    A transportation payment is a payment made by an agency to a TSP for 
the movement of goods or people and/or transportation related services.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.20  Who is subject to this part?

    All agencies and TSPs defined in Sec. 102-118.35 are subject to this 
part. Your agency is required to incorporate this part into its internal 
regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.25  Does GSA still require my agency to submit its overall transportation policies for approval?

    GSA no longer requires your agency to submit its overall 
transportation policies for approval. However, as noted in Sec. 102-
118.325, agencies must submit their prepayment audit plans for approval. 
In addition, GSA may from time to time request to examine your agency's 
transportation policies to verify the correct performance of the 
prepayment audit of your agency's transportation bills.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.30  Are Government corporations bound by this part?

    No, Government corporations are not bound by this part. However, 
they may choose to use it if they wish.

                               Definitions


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.35  What definitions apply to this part?

    Agency means Executive agency, but does not include:

[[Page 123]]

    (1) A Government Controlled Corporation;
    (2) The Tennessee Valley Authority;
    (3) The Virgin Islands Corporation;
    (4) The Atomic Energy Commission;
    (5) The Central Intelligence Agency;
    (6) The Panama Canal Commission; and
    (7) The National Security Agency, Department of Defense.
    Note to the definition of Agency: All agencies' payments for 
transportation services are subject to the transportation audit 
provisions of section 322 of the Transportation Act of 1940, as amended 
(31 U.S.C. 3726).
    Agency claim means any demand by an agency upon a TSP for the 
payment of overcharges, ordinary debts, fines, penalties, administrative 
fees, special charges, and interest.
    Bill of lading, sometimes referred to as a commercial bill of lading 
(but includes GBLs), is the document used as a receipt of goods, and 
documentary evidence of title. It is also a contract of carriage when 
movement is under 49 U.S.C. 10721 and 49 U.S.C. 13712.
    Document reference number means the unique number on a bill of 
lading, Government Bill of Lading, Government Transportation Request, or 
transportation ticket, used to track the movement of shipments and 
individuals.
    EDI signature means a discrete authentication code which serves in 
place of a paper signature and binds parties to the terms and conditions 
of a contract in electronic communication.
    Electronic commerce means electronic techniques for performing 
business transactions (ordering, billing, and paying for goods and 
services), including electronic mail or messaging, Internet technology, 
electronic bulletin boards, charge cards, electronic funds transfers, 
and electronic data interchange.
    Electronic data interchange means electronic techniques for carrying 
out transportation transactions using electronic transmissions of the 
information between computers instead of paper documents. These 
electronic transmissions must use established and published formats and 
codes as authorized by the applicable Federal Information Processing 
Standards.
    Electronic funds transfer means any transfer of funds, other than 
transactions initiated by cash, check, or similar paper instrument, that 
is initiated through an electronic terminal, telephone, computer, or 
magnetic tape, for the purpose of ordering, instructing, or authorizing 
a financial institution to debit or credit an account. The term includes 
Automated Clearinghouse transfers, Fed Wire transfers, and transfers 
made at automatic teller machines and point of sale terminals.
    Government Bill of Lading (GBL) means Optional Forms 1103 and 1203, 
the transportation documents issued by GSA and used as a receipt of 
goods, evidence of title, and generally a contract of carriage.
    Government contractor-issued charge card means both an individually 
billed travel card, which the individual is required to pay, and a 
centrally billed account for paying travel expenses, which the agency is 
required to pay.
    Government Transportation Request (GTR) means Optional Form 1169, 
the Government document used to buy transportation services. The 
document normally obligates the Government to pay for the transportation 
services provided.
    Offset means agency use of money owed by the agency to a 
transportation service provider (TSP) to cover a previous debt incurred 
to the agency by the TSP.
    Ordinary debt means an amount that a TSP owes an agency other than 
for the repayment of an overcharge. Ordinary debts include, but are not 
limited to, payments for transportation services ordered and not 
provided (including unused transportation tickets), duplicate payments, 
and amounts for which a TSP is liable because of loss and/or damage to 
property it transported.
    Overcharge means those charges for transportation and travel 
services that exceed those applicable under the contract for carriage. 
This also includes charges more than those applicable under rates, fares 
and charges established pursuant to section 13712 and 10721 of the 
Revised Interstate Commerce Act, as amended (49 U.S.C. 13712 and 10721), 
or other equivalent contract, arrangement or exemption from regulation.

[[Page 124]]

    Postpayment audit means an audit of transportation billing documents 
after payment to decide their validity, propriety, and conformity with 
tariffs, quotations, agreements, or tenders. This process may also 
include subsequent adjustments and collections actions taken against a 
TSP by the Government.
    Prepayment audit means an audit of transportation billing documents 
before payment to determine their validity, propriety, and conformity 
with tariffs, quotations, agreements, or tenders.
    Privately Owned Personal Property Government Bill of Lading, 
Optional Form 1203, means the agency transportation document used as a 
receipt of goods, evidence of title, and generally a contract of 
carriage. It is only available for the transportation of household 
goods. Use of this form is mandatory for Department of Defense, but 
optional for other agencies.
    Rate authority means the document that establishes the legal charges 
for a transportation shipment. Charges included in a rate authority are 
those rates, fares, and charges for transportation and related services 
contained in tariffs, tenders, and other equivalent documents.
    Released value is stated in dollars and is considered the assigned 
value of the cargo for reimbursement purposes, not necessarily the 
actual value of the cargo. Released value may be more or less than the 
actual value of the cargo. The released value is the maximum amount that 
could be recovered by the agency in the event of loss or damage for the 
shipments of freight and household goods. In return, when negotiating 
for rates and the released value is proposed to be less than the actual 
value of the cargo, the TSP should offer a rate lower than other rates 
for shipping cargo at full value. The statement of released value may be 
shown on any applicable tariff, tender, contract, transportation 
document or other documents covering the shipment.
    Reparation means the payment involving a TSP to or from an agency of 
an improper transportation billing as determined by a postpayment audit. 
Improper routing, overcharges, or duplicate payments may cause such 
improper billing. This is different from payments to settle a claim for 
loss and damage to items shipped under those rates.
    Standard carrier alpha code (SCAC) means an unique four-letter code 
assigned to each TSP by the National Motor Freight Traffic Association, 
Inc.
    Statement of difference means a statement issued by an agency or its 
designated audit contractor during a prepayment audit when they 
determine that a TSP has billed the agency for more than the proper 
amount for the services. This statement tells the TSP on the invoice, 
the amount allowed and the basis for the proper charges. The statement 
also cites the applicable rate references and other data relied on for 
support. The agency issues a separate statement of difference for each 
transportation transaction.
    Statement of difference rebuttal means a document used by the agency 
to respond to a TSP's claim about an improper reduction made against the 
TSP's original bill by the paying agency.
    Supplemental bill means a bill for services that the TSP submits to 
the agency for additional payment after reimbursement for the original 
bill. The need to submit a supplemental bill may occur due to an 
incorrect first bill or due to charges which were not included on the 
original bill.
    Taxpayer identification number (TIN) means the number required by 
the Internal Revenue Service to be used by the TSP in reporting income 
tax or other returns. For a TSP, the TIN is an employer identification 
number.
    Transportation document (TD) means any executed agreement for 
transportation service, such as a bill of lading (including a Government 
Bill of Lading), a Government Transportation Request, or transportation 
ticket.
    Transportation service means service involved in the physical 
movement (from one location to another) of products, people, household 
goods, and any other objects by a TSP for an agency as well as 
activities directly relating to or supporting that movement. Examples of 
this are storage, crating, or connecting appliances.

[[Page 125]]

    Transportation service provider (TSP) means any party, person, 
agent, or carrier that provides freight or passenger transportation and 
related services to an agency. For a freight shipment this would include 
packers, truckers, and storers. For passenger transportation this would 
include airlines, travel agents and travel management centers.
    Transportation service provider claim means any demand by the TSP 
for amounts not included in the original bill that the TSP believes an 
agency owes them. This includes amounts deducted or offset by an agency; 
amounts previously refunded by the TSP, which they now believe they are 
owed; and any subsequent bills from the TSP resulting from a transaction 
that was pre- or postpayment audited by the GSA Audit Division.
    Virtual GBL (VGBL) means the use of a unique GBL number on a 
commercial document, which binds the TSP to the terms and conditions of 
a GBL.

    Note to Sec. 102-118.35: 49 U.S.C. 13102, et seq., defines 
additional transportation terms not listed in this section.

    Your agency orders:
    (a) Transportation of freight and household goods and related 
transportation services (e.g., packing, storage) with a charge card, 
bill of lading, purchase order (or electronic equivalent), or for 
domestic shipments until September 30, 2001, a Government Bill of Lading 
(GBL). GBLs will continue to be available after that date, if needed, 
for international shipments (including domestic overseas shipments).
    (b) Transportation of people through the purchase of transportation 
tickets with a Government issued charge card (or centrally billed travel 
account citation), Government issued individual travel charge card,

<R05>
Sec. 102-118.50  How does my agency pay for transportation services?

    Your agency may pay for transportation services in three ways:
    (a) Electronic funds transfer (EFT) (31 U.S.C. 3332, et seq.). Your 
agency is required by statute to make all payments by EFT unless your 
agency receives a waiver from the Department of the Treasury.
    (b) Check. For those situations where EFT is not possible and the 
Department of the Treasury has issued a waiver, your agency may make 
payments by check.
    (c) Cash. In very unusual circumstances and as a last option, your 
agency payments may be made in cash in accordance with Department of the 
Treasury regulations (31 CFR part 208).


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.55  What administrative procedures must my agency establish for payment of freight, household goods, or other transportation services?

    Your agency must establish administrative procedures which assure 
that the following conditions are met:
    (a) The negotiated price is fair and reasonable;
    (b) A document of agreement signifying acceptance of the 
arrangements with terms and conditions is filed with the participating 
agency by the TSP;
    (c) The terms and conditions are included in all transportation 
agreements and referenced on all transportation documents (TDs);
    (d) Bills are only paid to the TSP providing service under the bill 
of lading to your agency and may not be waived;
    (e) All fees paid are accounted for in the aggregate delivery costs;
    (f) All payments are subject to applicable statutory limitations;
    (g) Procedures (such as an unique numbering system) are established 
to prevent and detect duplicate payments, properly account for 
expenditures and discrepancy notices;
    (h) All transactions are verified with any indebtedness list. On 
charge card transactions, your agency must consult any indebtedness list 
if the charge card contract provisions allow for it; and
    (i) Procedures are established to process any unused tickets.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.60  To what extent must my agency use electronic commerce?

    Your agency should use electronic commerce (i.e., electronic methods 
for ordering, receiving bills, and paying for transportation and 
transportation services) to the maximum extent possible.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.65  Can my agency receive electronic billing for payment of transportation services?

    Yes, when mutually agreeable to the agency and the GSA Audit 
Division, your agency is encouraged to use electronic billing for the 
procurement and billing of transportation services.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.70  Must my agency make all payments via electronic funds transfer?

    Yes, under 31 U.S.C. 3332, et seq., your agency must make all 
payments for goods and services via EFT (this includes goods and 
services ordered using charge cards).


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.75  What if my agency or the TSP does not have an account with a financial institution or approved payment agent?

    Under 31 U.S.C. 3332, et seq., your agency must obtain an account 
with a financial institution or approved payment agent in order to meet 
the statutory requirements to make all Federal payments via EFT unless 
your agency receives a waiver from the Department

[[Page 127]]

of the Treasury. To obtain a waiver, your agency must contact:

The Commissioner
Financial Management Service
Department of the Treasury
401 Fourteenth Street, SW.
Washington, DC 20227
http://www.fms.treas.gov/


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.80  Who is responsible for keeping my agency's electronic commerce transportation billing records?

    Your agency's internal financial regulations will identify 
responsibility for recordkeeping. In addition, the GSA Audit Division 
keeps a central repository of electronic transportation billing records 
for legal and auditing purposes. Therefore, your agency must forward all 
relevant electronic transportation billing documents to:

General Services Administration
Federal Supply Service
Audit Division (FBA)
1800 F Street, NW.
Washington, DC 20405
http://pub.fss.gsa.gov/transtrav


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.85  Can my agency use a Government contractor issued charge card to pay for transportation services?

    Yes, your agency may use a Government contractor issued charge card 
to purchase transportation services if permitted under the charge card 
contract or task order. In these circumstances your agency will receive 
a bill for these services from the charge card company.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.90  If my agency orders transportation and/or transportation services with a Government contractor issued charge card or charge account citation, 
          is this subject to prepayment audit?

    Generally, no transportation or transportation services ordered with 
a Government contractor issued charge card or charge account citation 
can be prepayment audited because the bank or charge card contractor 
pays the TSP directly, before your agency receives a bill that can be 
audited from the charge card company. However, if your agency contracts 
with the charge card or charge account provider to provide for a 
prepayment audit, then, as long as your agency is not liable for paying 
the bank for improper charges (as determined by the prepayment audit 
verification process), a prepayment audit can be used. As with all 
prepayment audit programs, the charge card prepayment audit must be 
approved by the GSA Audit Division prior to implementation. If the 
charge card contract does not provide for a prepayment audit, your 
agency must submit the transportation line items on the charge card to 
the GSA Audit Division for a postpayment audit.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.95  What forms can my agency use to pay transportation bills?

    Your agency must use commercial payment practices and forms to the 
maximum extent possible; however, when viewed necessary by your agency, 
your agency may use the following Government forms to pay transportation 
bills:
    (a) Standard Form (SF) 1113, Public Voucher for Transportation 
Charges, and SF 1113-A, Memorandum Copy;
    (b) Optional Form (OF) 1103, Government Bill of Lading and OF 1103A 
Memorandum Copy (used for movement of things, both privately owned and 
Government property for official uses);
    (c) OF 1169, Government Transportation Request (used to pay for 
tickets to move people); and
    (d) OF 1203, Privately Owned Personal Property Government Bill of 
Lading, and OF 1203A, Memorandum Copy (used by the Department of Defense 
to move private property for official transfers).

    Note to Sec. 102-118.95: By September 30, 2001, your agency may no 
longer use the GBLs (OF 1103 and OF 1203) for domestic shipments. After 
September 30, 2000, your agency should minimize the use of GTRs (OF 
1169).


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.100  What must my agency ensure is on each SF 1113?

    Your agency must ensure during its prepayment audit of a TSP bill 
that the TSP filled out the Public Vouchers, SF 1113, completely 
including the taxpayer identification number (TIN), and standard carrier 
alpha code (SCAC). An SF 1113 must accompany all billings.

<R05>
Sec. 102-118.115  Must my agency use a GBL?

    No, your agency is not required to use a GBL and must use commercial 
payment practices to the maximum extent possible. Effective September 
30, 2001, your agency must phase out the use of the Optional Forms 1103 
and 1203 for domestic shipments. After this date, your agency may use 
the GBL solely for international shipments.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.120  Must my agency use a GTR?

    No, your agency is not required to use a GTR. Your agency must adopt 
commercial practices and eliminate GTR use to the maximum extent 
possible.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.125  What if my agency uses a TD other than a GBL?

    If your agency uses any other TD for shipping under its account, the 
requisite and the named safeguards must be in place (i.e., terms and 
conditions found herein and in the ``U.S. Government Freight 
Transportation--Handbook,'' appropriate numbering, etc.).


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.130  Must my agency use a GBL for express, courier, or small package shipments?

    No, however, in using commercial forms all shipments must be subject 
to the terms and conditions set forth for use of a bill of lading for 
the Government. Any other non-conflicting applicable contracts or 
agreements between the TSP and an agency involving buying transportation 
services for Government traffic remain binding. This purchase does not 
require a SF 1113. When you are using GSA's schedule for small package 
express delivery, the terms and conditions of that contract are binding.


<R05>
102-118.135  Where are the mandatory terms and conditions governing the use of bills of lading?

    The mandatory terms and conditions governing the use of bills of 
lading are contained in this part and the ``U.S. Government Freight 
Transportation Handbook.''


<R05>
102-118.140  What are the major mandatory terms and conditions governing the use of GBLs and bills of lading?

    The mandatory terms and conditions governing the use of GBLs and 
bills of lading are:
    (a) Unless otherwise permitted by statute, the TSP must not demand 
prepayment or collect charges from the consignee. The TSP, providing 
service under the bill of lading, must present the original, properly 
certified GBL or bill of lading attached to an SF 1113, Public Voucher 
for Transportation Charges, to the paying office for payment;
    (b) The shipment must be made at the restricted or limited valuation 
specified in the tariff or classification or limited contract, 
arrangement or exemption at or under which the lowest rate is available, 
unless indicated on the GBL or bill of lading. (This is commonly 
referred to as an alternation of rates);
    (c) Receipt for the shipment is subject to the consignee's 
annotation of loss, damage, or shrinkage on the delivering TSP's 
documents and the consignee's copy of the same documents. If

[[Page 129]]

loss or damage is discovered after delivery or receipt of the shipment, 
the consignee must promptly notify the nearest office of the last 
delivering TSP and extend to the TSP the privilege of examining the 
shipment;
    (d) The rules and conditions governing commercial shipments for the 
time period within which notice must be given to the TSP, or a claim 
must be filed, or suit must be instituted, shall not apply if the 
shipment is lost, damaged or undergoes shrinkage in transit. Only with 
the written concurrence of the Government official responsible for 
making the shipment is the deletion of this item considered to valid;
    (e) Interest shall accrue from the voucher payment date on the 
overcharges made and shall be paid at the same rate in effect on that 
date as published by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the Debt 
Collection Act of 1982 31 U.S.C. 3717); and
    (f) Additional mandatory terms and conditions are in this part and 
the ``U.S. Government Freight Transportation--Handbook.''


<R05>
102-118.145  Where are the mandatory terms and conditions governing the use of passenger transportation documents?

    The mandatory terms and conditions governing the use of passenger 
transportation documents are contained in this part and the ``U.S. 
Government Passenger Transportation--Handbook.''


<R05>
102-118.150  What are the major mandatory terms and conditions governing the use of passenger transportation documents?

    The mandatory terms and conditions governing the use of passenger 
transportation documents are:
    (a) Government travel must be via the lowest cost available, that 
meets travel requirements; e.g., Government contract, fare, through, 
excursion, or reduced one way or round trip fare. This should be done by 
entering the term ``lowest coach'' on the Government travel document if 
the specific fare basis is not known;
    (b) The U.S. Government is not responsible for charges exceeding 
those applicable to the type, class, or character authorized in 
transportation documents;
    (c) The U.S. Government contractor-issued charge card must be used 
to the maximum extent possible to procure passenger transportation 
tickets. GTRs must be used minimally;
    (d) Government passenger transportation documents must be in 
accordance with Federal Travel Regulation Chapters 300 and 301 (41 CFR 
chapters 300 and 301), and the ``U.S. Government Passenger 
Transportation--Handbook'';
    (e) Interest shall accrue from the voucher payment date on 
overcharges made hereunder and shall be paid at the same rate in effect 
on that date as published by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to 
the Debt Collection Act of 1982;
    (f) The TSP must insert on the TD any known dates on which travel 
commenced;
    (g) The issuing official or traveler, by signature, certifies that 
the requested transportation is for official business;
    (h) The TSP must not honor any request containing erasures or 
alterations unless the TD contains the authentic, valid initials of the 
issuing official; and
    (i) Additional mandatory terms and conditions are in this part and 
the ``U. S. Government Passenger Transportation--Handbook.''


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.155  How does my agency handle supplemental billings from the TSP after payment of the original bill?

    Your agency must process, review, and verify supplemental billings 
using the same procedures as on an original billing. If the TSP disputes 
the findings, your agency must attempt to resolve the disputed amount.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.160  Who is liable if my agency makes an overpayment on a transportation bill?

    If the agency conducts prepayment audits of its transportation 
bills, agency transportation certifying and disbursing officers are 
liable for any overpayments made. If GSA has granted a waiver to the 
prepayment audit requirement and the agency performs a postpayment audit 
(31 U.S.C. 3528 and 31 U.S.C. 3322) neither the certifying

[[Page 130]]

nor disbursing officers are liable for the reasons listed in these two 
cited statutes.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.165  What must my agency do if it finds an error on a TSP bill?

    Your agency must advise the TSP via statement of difference of any 
adjustment that you make either electronically or in writing within 7 
days of receipt of the bill, as required by the Prompt Payment Act (31 
U.S.C. 3901, et seq.). This notice must include the TSP's taxpayer 
identification number, standard carrier alpha code, bill number and 
document reference number, agency name, amount requested by the TSP, 
amount paid, payment voucher number, complete tender or tariff 
authority, the applicable rate authority and the complete fiscal 
authority including the appropriation.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.170  Will GSA continue to maintain a centralized numbering system for Government transportation documents?

    Yes, GSA will maintain a numbering system for GBLs and GTRs. For 
commercial TDs, each agency must create a unique numbering system to 
account for and prevent duplicate numbers. The GSA Audit Division must 
approve this system. Write to:

         Subpart D--Prepayment Audits of Transportation Services

                Agency Requirements for Prepayment Audits


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.265  What is a prepayment audit?

    A prepayment audit is a review of a transportation service provider 
(TSP) bill that occurs prior to your agency making payment to a TSP. 
This review compares the charges on the bill against the charge 
permitted under the contract, rate tender, or other agreement under 
which the TSP provided the transportation and/or transportation related 
services.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.270  Must my agency establish a prepayment audit program?

    (a) Yes, under 31 U.S.C. 3726, your agency is required to establish 
a prepayment audit program. Your agency must send a preliminary copy of 
your prepayment audit program to:

General Services Administration
Office of Transportation and Personal Property (MT)
1800 F Street, NW.
Washington, DC 20405
http://policyworks.gov/org/main/MT

    (b) The final plan must be approved and in place by April 20, 2000.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.275  What must my agency consider when designing and implementing a prepayment audit program?

    As shown in Sec. 102-118.45, the manner in which your agency orders 
transportation services determines how and by whom the bill for those 
services will be presented. Your agency's prepayment audit program must 
consider all of the methods that you use to order and pay for 
transportation services. With each method of ordering transportation 
services, your agency should ensure that each TSP bill or employee 
travel voucher contains enough information for the prepayment audit to 
determine which contract or rate tender is used and that the type and 
quantity of any additional services are clearly delineated. Each method 
of ordering transportation and transportation services may require a 
different kind of prepayment audit.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.280  What advantages does the prepayment audit offer my agency?

    Prepayment auditing will allow your agency to detect and eliminate 
billing errors before payment and will eliminate the time and cost of 
recovering agency overpayments.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.285  What options for performing a prepayment audit does my agency have?

    Your agency may perform a prepayment audit by:
    (a) Creating an internal prepayment audit program;
    (b) Contracting directly with a prepayment audit service provider; 
or
    (c) Using the services of a prepayment audit contractor under GSA's 
multiple award schedule covering audit and financial management 
services.


[[Page 133]]


    Note to Sec. 102-118.285: Either of the choices in paragraph (a), 
(b) or (c) of this section might include contracts with charge card 
companies that provide prepayment audit services.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.290  Must every electronic and paper transportation bill undergo a prepayment audit?

    Yes, all transportation bills and payments must undergo a prepayment 
audit unless your agency's prepayment audit program uses a statistical 
sampling technique of the bills or the Administrator of General Services 
grants a specific waiver from the prepayment audit requirement. If your 
agency chooses to use statistical sampling, all bills must be at or 
below the Comptroller General specified limit of $2,500.00 (31 U.S.C. 
3521(b) and General Accounting Office Policy and Procedures Manual 
Chapter 7, obtainable from:

U.S. General Accounting Office
P.O. Box 6015
Gaithersburg, MD 20884-6015
http://www.gao.gov


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.295  What are the limited exceptions to every bill undergoing a prepayment audit?

    The limited exceptions to bills undergoing a prepayment audit are 
those bills subject to a waiver from GSA (which may include bills 
determined to be below your agency's threshold). The waiver to 
prepayment audit requirements may be for bills, mode or modes of 
transportation or for an agency or subagency.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.300  How does my agency fund its prepayment audit program?

    Your agency must pay for the prepayment audit from those funds 
appropriated for transportation services.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.305  Must my agency notify the TSP of any adjustment to the TSP's bill?

    Yes, your agency must notify the TSP of any adjustment to the TSP's 
bill either electronically or in writing within 7 days of receipt of the 
bill. This notice must refer to the TSP's bill number, agency name, 
taxpayer identification number, standard carrier alpha code, document 
reference number, amount billed, amount paid, payment voucher number, 
complete tender or tariff authority, including item or section number.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.310  Must my agency prepayment audit program establish appeal procedures whereby a TSP may appeal any reduction in the amount billed?

    Yes, your agency must establish an appeal process that directs TSP 
appeals to an agency official who is able to provide adequate 
consideration and review of the circumstances of the claim. Your agency 
must complete the review of the appeal within 30 days.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.315  What must my agency do if the TSP disputes the findings and my agency cannot resolve the dispute?

    (a) If your agency is unable to resolve the disputed amount with the 
TSP, your agency should forward all relevant documents including a 
complete billing history, and the appropriation or fund charged, to:

General Services Administration
Federal Supply Service
Audit Division (FBA)
1800 F Street, NW.
Washington, DC 20405
http://pub.fss.gsa.gov/transtrav

    (b) The GSA Audit Division will review the appeal of an agency's 
final, full or partial denial of a claim and issue a decision. A TSP 
must submit claims within 3 years under the guidelines established in

                     Maintaining an Approved Program


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.325  Must I get approval for my agency's prepayment audit program?

    Yes, your agency must get approval for your prepayment audit 
program. The highest level budget or financial official of each agency, 
such as the Chief Financial Officer, initially approves your agency's 
prepayment audit program. After internal agency approval, your agency 
submits the plan in writing to the GSA Audit Division for final 
approval.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.330  What are the elements of an acceptable prepayment audit program?

    An acceptable prepayment audit program must:
    (a) Verify all transportation bills against filed rates and charges 
before payment;
    (b) Comply with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3901, et seq.);
    (c) Allow for your agency to establish minimum dollar thresholds for 
transportation bills subject to audit;
    (d) Require your agency's paying office to offset debts from amounts 
owed to the TSP within the 3 years as per 31 U.S.C. 3726(b);
    (e) Be approved by the GSA Audit Division. After the initial 
approval, the agency may be subject to periodic program review and 
reapproval;
    (f) Complete accurate audits of transportation bills and notify the 
TSP of any adjustment within 7 calendar days of receipt;
    (g) Create accurate notices to the TSPs that describe in detail the 
reasons for any full or partial rejection of the stated charges on the 
invoice. An accurate notice must include the TSP's invoice number, the 
billed amount, TIN, standard carrier alpha code, the charges calculated 
by the agency, and the specific reasons including applicable rate 
authority for the rejection;
    (h) Forward documentation monthly to the GSA Audit Division, which 
will store paid transportation bills under the General Records Schedule 
9, Travel and Transportation (36 CFR Chapter XII, 1228.22) which 
requires keeping records for 3 years. GSA will arrange for storage of 
any document requiring special handling (e.g., bankruptcy, court case, 
etc.). These bills will be retained pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 3309 until 
claims have been settled;
    (i) Establish procedures in which transportation bills not subject 
to prepayment audit (i.e., bills for unused tickets and charge card 
billings) are handled separately and forwarded to the GSA Audit 
Division; and
    (j) Implement a unique agency numbering system to handle commercial 
paper and practices (see Sec. 102-118.55).


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.335  What does the GSA Audit Division consider when verifying an agency prepayment audit program?

    The GSA Audit Division bases verification of agency prepayment audit 
programs on objective cost-savings, paperwork reductions, current audit 
standards and other positive improvements, as well as adherence to the 
guidelines listed in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.340  How does my agency contact the GSA Audit Division?

    Your agency may contact the GSA Audit Division by writing to:

General Services Administration
Federal Supply Service
Audit Division (FBA)
1800 F Street, NW.
Washington, DC 20405

<R05>
Sec. 102-118.345  If my agency chooses to change an approved prepayment audit program, does the program need to be reapproved?

    Yes, you must receive approval of any changes in your agency's 
prepayment audit program from the GSA Audit Division.

            Liability for Certifying and Disbursing Officers


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.350  Does establishing a prepayment audit system or program change the responsibilities of the certifying officers?

    Yes, in a prepayment audit environment, an official certifying a 
transportation voucher is held liable for verifying transportation 
rates, freight classifications, and other information provided on a 
transportation billing instrument or transportation request undergoing a 
prepayment audit (31 U.S.C. 3528).


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.355  Does a prepayment audit waiver change any liabilities of the certifying officer?

    Yes, a certifying official is not personally liable for verifying 
transportation rates, freight classifications, or other information 
provided on a GBL or passenger transportation request when the 
Administrator of General Services or designee waives the prepayment 
audit requirement and your agency uses postpayment audits.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.360  What relief from liability is available for the certifying official under a postpayment audit?

    The agency counsel relieves a certifying official from liability for 
overpayments in cases where postpayment is the approved method of 
auditing and:
    (a) The overpayment occurred solely because the administrative 
review before payment did not verify transportation rates; and
    (b) The overpayment was the result of using improper transportation 
rates or freight classifications or the failure to deduct the correct 
amount under a land grant law or agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.365  Do the requirements of a prepayment audit change the disbursing official's liability for overpayment?

    Yes, the disbursing official has a liability for overpayments on all 
transportation bills subject to prepayment audit (31 U.S.C. 3322).


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.370  Where does relief from prepayment audit liability for certifying, accountable, and disbursing officers reside in my agency?

    Your agency's counsel has the authority to relieve liability and 
give advance opinions on liability issues to certifying, accountable, 
and disbursing officers (31 U.S.C. 3527).

                 Waivers from Mandatory Prepayment Audit


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.375  Who has the authority to grant a waiver of the prepayment audit requirement?

    Only the Administrator of General Services or designee has the 
authority to grant waivers from the prepayment audit requirement.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.380  How does my agency apply for a waiver from a prepayment audit of requirement?

    Your agency must submit a request for a waiver from the requirement 
to perform a prepayment in writing to:

General Services Administration
Office of Transportation and Personal Property (MT)
1800 F Street, NW.
Washington, DC 20405
 http://policyworks.gov/org/main/MT


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.385  What must a waiver request include?

    A waiver request must explain in detail how the use of a prepayment 
audit increases costs over a postpayment audit, decreases efficiency, 
involves a relevant public interest, adversely affects the agency's 
mission, or is not feasible for the agency. A waiver request must 
identify the mode or modes of transportation, agency or subagency to 
which the waiver would apply.

[[Page 136]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.390  On what basis does GSA grant a waiver to the prepayment audit requirement?

    GSA issues waivers to the prepayment audit requirement based on:
    (a) Cost-effectiveness;
    (b) Government efficiency;
    (c) Public interest; or
    (d) Other factors the Administrator of General Services considers 
appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.395  How long will GSA take to respond to a waiver request?

    GSA will respond to a written waiver request within 30 days from the 
receipt of the request.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.400  Must my agency renew a waiver of the prepayment audit requirements?

    Yes, your agency waiver to the prepayment audit requirement will not 
exceed 2 years. Your agency must reapply to ensure the circumstances at 
the time of approval still apply.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.405  Are my agency's prepayment audited transportation bills subject to periodic postpayment audit oversight from the GSA Audit Division?

    Yes, two years or more after starting prepayment audits, the GSA 
Audit Division (depending on its evaluation of the results) may subject 
your agency's prepayment audited transportation bills to periodic 
postpayment audit oversight rather than blanket postpayment audits. The 
GSA Audit Division will then prepare a report analyzing the success of 
your agency's prepayment audit program. This report will be on file at 
GSA and available for your review.

             Suspension of Agency Prepayment Audit Programs


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.410  Can GSA suspend my agency's prepayment audit program?

    (a) Yes, the Director of the GSA Audit Division may suspend your 
agency's prepayment audit program based on his or her determination of a 
systematic or frequent failure of the program to:
    (1) Conduct an accurate prepayment audit of your agency's 
transportation bills;
    (2) Abide by the terms of the Prompt Payment Act;
    (3) Adjudicate TSP claims disputing prepayment audit positions of 
the agency regularly within 30 days of receipt;
    (4) Follow Comptroller General decisions, GSA Board of Contract 
Appeals decisions, the Federal Management Regulation and GSA 
instructions or precedents about substantive and procedure matters; and/
or
    (5) Provide information and data or to cooperate with on-site 
inspections necessary to conduct a quality assurance review.
    (b) A systematic or a multitude of individual failures will result 
in suspension. A suspension of an agency's prepayment audit program may 
be in whole or in part for failure to conduct proper prepayment audits.


<R04>
              Subpart E--Postpayment Transportation Audits


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.415  Will the widespread mandatory use of prepayment audits eliminate postpayment audits?

    No, the mandatory use of prepayment audits will not eliminate 
postpayment audits because:
    (a) Postpayment audits will continue for those areas which do not 
lend themselves to the prepayment audit; and
    (b) The GSA Audit Division will continue to review and survey the 
progress of the prepayment audit by performing a postpayment audit on 
the bills. The GSA Audit Division has a Congressionally mandated 
responsibility under 31 U.S.C. 3726 to perform oversight on 
transportation bill payments. During the early startup period for 
prepayment audits, transportation bills are subject to a possible 
postpayment audit to discover the effectiveness of the prepayment audit 
process.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.420  Can the Administrator of General Services waive the postpayment auditing provisions of this subpart?

    Yes, in certain circumstances, the Administrator of General Services 
or designee may waive the postpayment

[[Page 137]]

audit oversight requirements of this subpart on a case by case basis.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.425  Is my agency allowed to perform a postpayment audit on our transportation bills?

    No, your agency must forward all transportation bills to GSA for a 
postpayment audit regardless of any waiver allowing for postpayment 
audit.


<R05>

    (a) The date received from a TSP;
    (b) A TSP's bill number;
    (c) Your agency name;
    (d) A Document Reference Number;
    (e) The amount requested;
    (f) The amount paid;
    (g) The payment voucher number;
    (h) Complete tender or tariff authority, including contract price 
(if purchased under the Federal Acquisition Regulation), item or section 
number;
    (i) The TSP's taxpayer identification number; and
    (j) The TSP's standard carrier alpha code (SCAC).


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.435  What procedures does GSA use to perform a postpayment audit?

    When GSA performs a postpayment audit, the GSA Audit Division has 
the delegated authority to implement the following procedures:
    (a) Audit selected TSP bills after payment;
    (b) Audit selected TSP bills before payment as needed to protect the 
Government's interest (i.e., bankruptcy, fraud);
    (c) Examine, settle, and adjust accounts involving payment for 
transportation and related services for the account of agencies;
    (d) Adjudicate and settle transportation claims by and against 
agencies;
    (e) Offset an overcharge by any TSP from an amount subsequently 
found to be due that TSP;
    (f) Issue a Notice of Overcharge stating that a TSP owes a debt to 
the agency. This notice states the amount paid, the basis for the proper 
charge for the document reference number, and cites applicable tariff or 
tender along with other data relied on to support the overcharge. A 
separate Notice of Overcharge is prepared and mailed for each bill; and
    (g) Issue a GSA Notice of Indebtedness when a TSP owes an ordinary 
debt to an agency. This notice states the basis for the debt, the TSP's 
rights, interest, penalty, and other results of nonpayment. The debt is 
due immediately and subject to interest charges, penalties, and 
administrative cost under 31 U.S.C. 3717.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.440  What are the postpayment audit responsibilities and roles of the GSA Audit Division?

    When the GSA Audit Division performs a postpayment audit for your 
agency, GSA will:
    (a) Examine and analyze payments to discover their validity, 
relevance and conformity with tariffs, quotations, contracts, agreements 
or tenders and make adjustments to protect the interest of an agency;
    (b) Examine, adjudicate, and settle transportation claims by and 
against the agency;
    (c) Collect from TSPs by refund, setoff, offset or other means, the 
amounts determined to be due the agency;
    (d) Adjust, terminate or suspend debts due on TSP overcharges;
    (e) Prepare reports to the Attorney General of the United States 
with recommendations about the legal and technical bases available for 
use in prosecuting or defending suits by or against an agency and 
provide technical, fiscal, and factual data from relevant records;
    (f) Provide transportation specialists and lawyers to serve as 
expert witnesses, assist in pretrial conferences, draft pleadings, 
orders, and briefs, and participate as requested in connection with 
transportation suits by or against an agency;
    (g) Review agency policies, programs, and procedures to determine 
their adequacy and effectiveness in the audit of freight or passenger 
transportation payments, and review related fiscal and transportation 
practices;

[[Page 138]]

    (h) Furnish information on rates, fares, routes, and related 
technical data upon request;
    (i) Tell an agency of irregular shipping routing practices, 
inadequate commodity descriptions, excessive transportation cost 
authorizations, and unsound principles employed in traffic and 
transportation management; and
    (j) Confer with individual TSPs or related groups and associations 
presenting specific modes of transportation to resolve mutual problems 
concerning technical and accounting matters and acquainting them with 
agency requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.445  Must my agency pay for a postpayment audit when using the GSA Audit Division?

    No, the expenses of postpayment audit contract administration and 
audit-related functions are financed from overpayments collected from 
the TSP's bills previously paid by the agency and similar type of 
refunds.

    (a) An agency must report all voluntary refunds to the GSA Audit 
Division (so that no Notice of Overcharge or financial offset occurs), 
unless other arrangements are made (e.g., charge card refunds, etc.). 
These reports must be addressed to:

General Services Administration
Federal Supply Service
Audit Division (FBA)
Code: CC
1800 F Street, NW.
Washington, DC 20405
http://pub.fss.gsa.gov/transtrav

    (b) Once a Notice of Overcharge is issued by the GSA Audit Division, 
then any refund is no longer considered voluntary and the agency must 
forward the refund to the GSA Audit Division.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.505  Must my agency send a voluntary refund to the Treasurer of the United States?

    No, your agency may keep and use voluntary refunds submitted by a 
TSP, if the refund was made prior to a Notice of Overcharge issued by 
the GSA Audit Division.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.510  Can my agency revise or alter a GSA Form 7931, Certificate of Settlement?

    Generally, no, an agency must not revise or alter amounts on a GSA 
Form 7931. The only change an agency can make to a GSA Form 7931 is to 
change the agency financial data to a correct cite. Any GSA Form 7931 
that cannot be paid (e.g., an amount previously paid), must be 
immediately returned to

[[Page 141]]

the GSA Audit Division with an explanation.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.515  Does my agency have any recourse not to pay a Certificate of Settlement?

    No, a Certificate of Settlement is the final administrative action.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.520  Who is responsible for determining the standards for collection, compromise, termination, or suspension of collection action on any 
          outstanding debts to my agency?

    Under the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended (31 
U.S.C. 3711, et seq.), the Comptroller General and the Attorney General 
have joint responsibility for issuing standards for your agency.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.525  What are my agency's responsibilities for verifying the correct amount of transportation charges?

    Your agency's employees are responsible for diligently verifying the 
correct amount of transportation charges prior to payment (31 U.S.C. 
3527).


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.530  Will GSA instruct my agency's disbursing offices to offset unpaid TSP billings?

    Yes, GSA will instruct one or more of your agency's disbursing 
offices to deduct the amount due from an unpaid TSP's bill. A 3-year 
limitation applies on the deduction of overcharges from amounts due a 
TSP (31 U.S.C. 3726) and a 10-year limitation applies on the deduction 
of ordinary debts (31 U.S.C. 3716).


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.535  Are there principles governing my agency's TSP debt collection procedures?

    Yes, the principles governing your agency collection procedures for 
reporting debts to the General Accounting Office (GAO) or the Department 
of Justice are found in 4 CFR parts 101 through 105 and in the GAO 
Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies. The 
manual may be obtained by writing:

Superintendent of Documents
Government Printing Office
Washington, DC 20402
http://www.access.gpo.gov/


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.540  Who has the authority to audit, settle accounts, and/or start collection action for all transportation services provided for my agency?

    The Director of the GSA Audit Division has the authority and 
responsibility to audit and settle all transportation related accounts 
(31 U.S.C. 3726). The reason for this is that he or she has access to 
Governmentwide data on a TSP's payments and billings with the 
Government. Your agency has the responsibility to correctly pay 
individual transportation claims.

        Transportation Service Provider (TSP) Filing Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.545  What information must a TSP claim include?

    Transportation service provider (TSP) claims received by GSA or its 
designee must include one of the following:
    (a) The signature of an individual or party legally entitled to 
receive payment for services on behalf of the TSP;
    (b) The signature of the TSP's agent or attorney accompanied by a 
duly executed power of attorney or other documentary evidence of the 
agent's or attorney's right to act for the TSP; or
    (c) An electronic signature, when mutually agreed upon.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.550  How does a TSP file an administrative claim using EDI or other electronic means?

    The medium and precise format of data for an administrative claim 
filed electronically must be approved in advance by the GSA Audit 
Division. GSA will use an authenticating EDI signature to certify 
receipt of the claim. The data on the claim must contain proof of the 
delivery of goods, and an itemized bill reflecting the services 
provided, with the lowest charges available for service. The TSP must be 
able to locate, identify, and reproduce the records in readable form 
without loss of clarity.

[[Page 142]]


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.555  Can a TSP file a supplemental administrative claim?

    Yes, a TSP may file a supplemental administrative claim. Each

    A TSP must bill for charges claimed on a SF 1113, Public Voucher for 
Transportation Charges, in the manner prescribed in the ``U.S. 
Government Freight Transportation--Handbook'' or the ``U.S. Government 
Passenger Transportation--Handbook.'' To get a copy of these handbooks,

submitted by the TSP. Oral presentations supplementing the written 
record are not acceptable.

 Transportation Service Provider (TSP) and Agency Appeal Procedures for 
                            Prepayment Audits


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.570  If my agency denies the TSP's challenge to the statement of difference, may the TSP appeal?

    Yes, the TSP may appeal if your agency denies its challenge to the 
statement of difference. However, the appeal must be handled at a higher 
level in your agency.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.575  If a TSP disagrees with the decision of my agency, can the TSP appeal?

    Yes, the TSP may file a claim with the GSA Audit Division, which 
will review the TSP's appeal of your agency's final full or partial 
denial of a claim. The TSP may also appeal to the GSA Audit Division if 
your agency has not responded to a challenge within 30 days.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.580  May a TSP appeal a prepayment audit decision of the GSA Audit Division?

    (a) Yes, the TSP may appeal to the GSA's Board of Contract Appeals 
(GSBCA), under guidelines established in this subpart, or file a claim 
with the United States Court of Federal Claims. The TSP's request for 
review must be received by the GSBCA in writing within 6 months (not 
including time of war) from the date the settlement action was taken or 
within the periods of limitation specified in 31 U.S.C. 3726, as 
amended, whichever is later. The TSP must address requests to:

GSA Board of Contract Appeals
1800 F Street, NW.
Room 7022
Washington, DC 20405

    (b) The GSBCA will accept legible submissions via facsimile (FAX) on 
(202) 501-0664.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.585  May a TSP appeal a prepayment audit decision of the GSBCA?

    No, a ruling by the GSBCA is the final administrative remedy 
available and the TSP has no statutory right of appeal. This subpart 
governs administrative actions only and does not affect any of the TSP's 
rights. A TSP may still pursue a legal remedy through the courts.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.590  May my agency appeal a prepayment audit decision of the GSA Audit Division?

    No, your agency may not appeal. A GSA Audit Division decision is 
administratively final for your agency.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.595  May my agency appeal a prepayment audit decision by the GSBCA?

    No, your agency may not appeal a prepayment audit decision. Your 
agency must follow the ruling of the GSBCA.

claim decision; and/or
    (c) Enter a written agreement for the payment of the claims.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.610  Is a TSP notified when GSA allows a claim?

    Yes, the GSA Audit Division will acknowledge each payable claim 
using GSA Form 7931, Certificate of Settlement. The certificate will

forward the certificate to the agency whose funds are to be charged for 
processing and payment.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.615  Will GSA notify a TSP if they internally offset a payment?

    Yes, the GSA Audit Division will inform the TSP if they internally 
offset a payment.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.620  How will a TSP know if the GSA Audit Division disallows a claim?

    The GSA Audit Division will furnish a GSA Form 7932, Settlement 
Certificate, to the TSP explaining the disallowance.

    (a) TSPs must promptly refund amounts due to GSA, preferably by EFT. 
If an EFT is not used, checks must be made payable to ``General Services 
Administration'', including the document reference number, TSP name, 
bill number(s), taxpayer identification number and standard carrier 
alpha code, then mailed to:

    Note to Sec. 102-118.630: Amounts collected by GSA are returned to 
the Treasurer of the United States (31 U.S.C. 3726).


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.635  Can the Government charge interest on an amount due from a TSP?

    Yes, the Government can charge interest on an amount due from a TSP. 
This procedure is provided for under the Debt Collection Act (31 U.S.C. 
3717), the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR parts 101 through 
105), and 41 CFR part 105-55.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.640  If a TSP fails to pay or to appeal an overcharge, what actions will GSA pursue to collect the debt?

    GSA will pursue debt collection through one of the following 
methods:
    (a) When an indebted TSP files a claim, GSA will apply all or any 
portion of the amount it determines to be due the TSP, to the 
outstanding balance owed by the TSP, under the Federal Claims Collection 
Standards (4 CFR parts 101 through 105) and 41 CFR part 105-55;

[[Page 144]]

    (b) When the action outlined in paragraph (a) of this section cannot 
be taken by GSA, GSA will instruct one or more Government disbursing 
offices to deduct the amount due to the agency from an unpaid TSP's 
bill. A 3-year limitation applies on the deduction of overcharges from 
amounts due a TSP (31 U.S.C. 3726) and a 10-year limitation applies on 
the deduction of ordinary debt (31 U.S.C. 3716);
    (c) When collection cannot be accomplished through either of the 
procedures in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, GSA normally sends 
two additional demand letters to the indebted TSP requesting payment of 
the amount due within a specified time. Lacking a satisfactory response, 
GSA may place a complete stop order against amounts otherwise payable to 
the indebted TSP by adding the name of that TSP to the Department of the 
Army ``List of Contractors Indebted to the United States''; and/or
    (d) When collection actions, as stated in paragraphs (a) through (c) 
of this section are unsuccessful, GSA may report the debt to the 
Department of Justice for collection, litigation, and related 
proceedings, as prescribed in 4 CFR parts 101 through 105.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.645  Can a TSP file an administrative claim on collection actions?

    Yes, a TSP may file an administrative claim involving collection 
actions resulting from the transportation audit performed by the GSA 
directly with the GSA Audit Division. Any claims submitted to GSA will 
be considered ``disputed claims'' under section 4(b) of the Prompt 
Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3901, et seq.). The TSP must file all other 
transportation claims with the agency out of whose activities they 
arose. If this is not feasible (e.g., where the responsible agency 
cannot be determined or is no longer in existence) claims may be sent to 
the GSA Audit Division for forwarding to the responsible agency or for 
direct settlement by the GSA Audit Division. Claims for GSA processing 
must be addressed to:

General Services Administration
Federal Supply Service
Audit Division (FBA)
1800 F Street, NW.
Washington, DC 20405
http://pub.fss.gsa.gov/transtrav


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.650  Can a TSP request a review of a settlement action by the Administrator of General Services?

    Yes, a TSP desiring a review of a settlement action taken by the 
Administrator of General Services may request a review by the GSA Board 
of Contract Appeals (GSBCA) or file a claim with the United States Court 
of Federal Claims (28 U.S.C. 1491).


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.655  Are there time limits on a TSP request for an administrative review by the GSBCA?

    (a) Yes, the GSBCA must receive a request for review from the TSP 
within six months (not including time of war) from the date the 
settlement action was taken or within the periods of limitation 
specified in 31 U.S.C. 3726, as amended, whichever is later. The request 
must be addressed to:

GSA Board of Contract Appeals
1800 F Street, NW.
Room 7022
Washington, DC 20405

    (b) The GSBCA will accept legible submissions via facsimile (FAX) on 
(202) 501-0664.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.660  May a TSP appeal a postpayment audit decision of the GSBCA?

    No, a ruling by the GSBCA is the final administrative remedy and the 
TSP has no statutory right of appeal. This subpart governs 
administrative actions only and does not affect any rights of the TSPs. 
A TSP may still pursue a legal remedy through the courts.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.665  May my agency appeal a postpayment audit decision by the GSBCA?

    No, your agency may not appeal a postpayment audit decision and must 
follow the ruling of the GSBCA.

      Transportation Service Provider (TSP) Non-Payment of a Claim


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.670  If a TSP cannot immediately pay a debt, can they make other arrangements for payment?

    Yes, if a TSP is unable to pay the debt promptly, the Director of 
the GSA

[[Page 145]]

Audit Division has the discretion to enter into alternative arrangements 
for payment.


<R05>
Sec. 102-118.675  What recourse does my agency have if a TSP does not pay a transportation debt?

    If a TSP does not pay a transportation debt, GSA may refer 
delinquent debts to consumer reporting agencies and Federal agencies 
including the Department of the Treasury and Department of Justice.

    This subpart establishes the General Services Administration 
Property Management Regulations (GSPMR) and provides certain 
introductory material.


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.101  General Services Administration Property Management Regulations.

    The General Services Administration Property Management Regulations 
(GSPMR) include the GSA property management policies and procedures 
which, together with the Federal Property Management Regulations, 
certain regulations prescribed by other agencies, and various GSA orders 
govern the management of property and records and certain related 
activities of GSA. They may contain policies and procedures of interest 
to other agencies and the general public and are prescribed by the 
Administrator of General Services in this chapter 105.


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.101-50  Exclusions.

    (a) Certain GSA property management and related policies and 
procedures which come within the scope of this chapter 105 nevertheless 
may be excluded therefrom when there is justification. These exclusions 
may include the following categories:
    (1) Subject matter that bears a security classification;
    (2) Policies and procedures that are expected to be effective for a 
period of less than 6 months;
    (3) Policies and procedures that are effective on an experimental 
basis for a reasonable period;
    (4) Policies and procedures pertaining to other functions of GSA as 
well as property management functions and there is need to make the 
issuance available simultaneously to all GSA employees involved; and
    (5) Where speed of issuance is essential, numerous changes are 
required in chapter 105, and all necessary changes cannot be made 
promptly.
    (b) Property management policies and procedures issued in other than 
the FPMR system format under paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) of this section, 
shall be codified into chapter 105 at the earliest practicable date, but 
in any event not later than 6 months from date of issuance.

Sec. 105-1.102  Relationship of GSPMR to FPMR.

    (a) GSPMR implement and supplement the FPMR and implement certain 
other regulations. They are part of the General Services Administration 
Regulations System. Material published in the FPMR (which has 
Governmentwide applicability) becomes effective throughout GSA upon the 
effective date of the particular FPMR material. In general, the FPMR 
that are implemented and supplemented shall not be repeated, 
paraphrased, or otherwise restated in chapter 105.
    (b) Implementing is the process of expanding upon the FPMR or other 
Government-wide regulations.

[[Page 152]]

Supplementing is the process of prescribing material for which there is 
no counterpart in the Government-wide regulations.
    (c) GSPMR may deviate from the regulations that are implemented when 
a deviation (see Sec. 105-1.110) is authorized in and explicitly 
referenced to such regulations. Where chapter 105 contains no material 
implementing the FPMR, the FPMR shall govern.


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.104  Publication of GSPMR.

    (a) Most GSPMR are published in the Federal Register. This practice 
helps to ensure that interested business concerns, other agencies, and 
the public are apprised of GSA policies and procedures pertaining to 
property and records management and certain related activities.
    (b) Most GSPMR are published in cumulative form in chapter 105 of 
title 41 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The Federal Register and 
title 41 of the Code of Federal Regulations may be purchased from the 
Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, 
D.C. 20402.


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.106  Applicability.

    Chapter 105 applies to the management of property and records and to 
certain other programs and activities of GSA. Unless otherwise 
specified, chapter 105 applies to activities outside as well as within 
the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.109  Numbering.


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.109-50  General plan.

    Chapter 105 is divided into parts, subparts, and further 
subdivisions as necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.109-51  Arrangement.

    (a) Parts 105-2 through 105-49 are used for GSPMR that implement 
regulations in the corresponding parts of chapter 101. This practice 
results in comparable grouping by subject area without establishment of 
subchapters.
    (b) Parts 105-50 and above are used for GSPMR that supplement 
regulations in the FPMR and implement regulations of other agencies. 
Part numbers are assigned so as to accomplish a similar subject area 
grouping. Regulations on advisory committee management are recodified as 
part 105-54 to place them in the appropriate subject area category. 
Regulations on standards of conduct remain in part 105-735 because the 
number 735 identifies regulations of the U.S. Civil Service Commission 
and various civil agencies on this subject.


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.109-52  Cross-references.

    (a) Within chapter 105, cross-references to the FPMR shall be made 
in the same manner as used within the FPMR. Illustrations of cross-
references to the FPMR are:
    (1) Part 101-3;
    (2) Subpart 101-3.1;
    (3) Sec. 101-3.413-5.
    (b) Within chapter 105, cross-references to parts, subparts, 
sections, and subsections of chapter 105 shall be made in a manner 
generally similar to that used in making cross-references to the FPMR. 
For example, this paragraph would be referenced as Sec. 105-1.109-52(b).


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.110  Deviation.

    (a) In the interest of establishing and maintaining uniformity to 
the greatest extent feasible, deviations; i.e., the use of any policy or 
procedure in any manner that is inconsistent with a policy or procedure 
prescribed in the Federal Property Management Regulations, are 
prohibited unless such deviations have been requested from and approved 
by the Administrator of General Services or his authorized designee. 
Deviations may be authorized by the Administrator of General Services or 
his authorized designee when so doing will be in the best interest of 
the Government. Request for deviations shall clearly state the nature of 
the deviation and the reasons for such special action.
    (b) Requests for deviations from the FPMR shall be sent to the 
General Services Administration for consideration in accordance with the 
following:
    (1) For onetime (individual) deviations, requests shall be sent to 
the address provided in the applicable regulation. Lacking such 
direction, requests shall be sent to the Administrator of General 
Services, Washington, DC 20405.

[[Page 153]]

    (2) For class deviations, requests shall be sent to only the 
Administrator of General Services.

[55 FR 1673, Jan. 18, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 105-1.150  Citation.

    (a) In formal documents, such as legal briefs, citations of chapter 
105 material shall include a citation to title 41 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations or other titles as appropriate; e.g., 41 CFR 105-1.150.
    (b) Any section of chapter 105, for purpose of brevity, may be 
informally identified as ``GSPMR'' followed by the section number. For 
example, this paragraph would be identified as ``GSPMR 105-1.150(b).''

<R05>
Sec. 105-8.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Secs. 105-8.150 and 105-8.154, no 
qualified individual with handicaps shall, because

[[Page 157]]

the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals 
with handicaps, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from 
participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any 
program or activity conducted by the agency.

Sec. 105-8.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.


<R05>
Sec. 105-8.150-1  General.

    The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the 
program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible 
to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This section does not--
    (a) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps; or
    (b) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the 
agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment 
of significant historic features of an historic property.


<R05>
Sec. 105-8.150-2  Methods.

    (a) General. The agency may comply with the requirements of 
Sec. 105-8.150 through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment 
of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to 
beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible 
sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new 
facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that 
result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and 
usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is not required to make 
structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are 
effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in 
making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility 
requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations 
implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the 
requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those 
methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with 
handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (b) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 105-8.105-1 in historic preservation programs, the agency shall 
give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals 
with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to a historic 
property is not required because of Secs. 105-8.105-1(b) or 105-8.154 
alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include--
    (1) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those 
portions of a historic property that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible;
    (2) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or 
through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible; or
    (3) Adopting other innovative methods.


<R05>
Sec. 105-8.150-3  Time period for compliance.

    The agency shall comply with the obligations established under 
Sec. 105-8.150 by May 7, 1991; except where structural changes in 
facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by March 8, 1994, 
but in any event as expeditiously as possible.


<R05>
Sec. 105-8.150-4  Transition plan.

    In the event that structural changes to facilities will be 
undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, 
by March 9, 1992; the transition plan setting forth the steps necessary 
to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to 
interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or 
organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in 
the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral 
and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for 
public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (a) Identify physical obstacles in the facilities occupied by GSA 
that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to 
individuals with handicaps;

[[Page 158]]

    (b) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (c) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with Sec. 105-8.150 and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (d) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 105-8.151  Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, of for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards 
of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established 
in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this 
section.


<R05>
Sec. 105.8.152  Program accessibility: Assignment of space.

    (a) When GSA assigns or reassigns space to an agency, it shall 
consult with the agency to ensure that the assignment or reassignment 
will not result in one or more of the agency's programs or activities 
being inaccessible to individuals with handicaps.
    (b) Prior to the assignment or reassignment of space to an agency, 
GSA shall inform the agency of the accessibility, and/or the absence of 
accessibility features, of the space in which GSA intends to locate the 
agency. If the agency informs GSA that the use of the space will result 
in one or more of the agency's programs being inaccessible, GSA shall 
take one or more of the following actions to make the programs 
accessible:
    (1) Arrange for alterations, improvements, and repairs to buildings 
and facilities;
    (2) Locate and provide alternative space that will not result in one 
or more of the agency's programs being inaccessible; or
    (3) Take any other actions that result in making this agency's 
programs accessible.

The responsibility for payment to make the physical changes in the space 
shall be assigned on a case-by-case basis as agreed to by GSA and the 
user agency, dependent on individual circumstances.
    (c) GSA may not require the agency to accept space that results in 
one or more of the agency's programs being inaccessible.


<R05>
Sec. 105-8.153  Program accessibility: Interagency cooperation.


<R05>
Sec. 105-8.153-1  General.

    GSA, upon request from an occupant agency engaged in the development 
of a transition plan under section 504, shall participate with the 
occupant agency in the development and implementation of the transition 
plan and shall provide information and guidance to the occupant agency. 
Upon request, GSA shall conduct space inspections to assist the agency 
in determining whether a current assignment of space results in one or 
more of the occupant agency's programs or activities being inaccessible. 
GSA shall provide the occupant agency with a written summary of 
significant findings and recommendations, together with data concerning 
programmed repairs and alterations planned by GSA and alterations that 
can be effected by the agency.

Sec. 105-8.153-2  Requests from occupant agencies.

    (a) Upon receipt of an occupant agency's request for new space, 
additional space, relocation to accessible space, alterations, or other 
actions under GSA's control that are needed to ensure program 
accessibility in the requesting agency's program(s) as required by the 
agency's section 504 transition plan, GSA shall assist or advise the 
requesting agency in providing or arranging for the requested action 
within the timeframes specified in the requesting agency's transition 
plan.
    (b) If the requested action cannot be completed within the time 
frame specified in an agency's transition plan, GSA shall so advise the 
requesting agency within 30 days of the request by submitting, after 
consultation with the agency, a revised schedule specifying the date by 
which the action shall be

[[Page 159]]

completed. If the delay in completing the action results in or continues 
the inaccessibility of the requesting agency's program, GSA and the 
agency shall, after consultation, take interim measures to make the 
agency's program accessible.
    (c) If GSA determines that it is unable to take the requested 
action, GSA shall--
    (1) Within 30 days, set forth in writing to the requesting agency 
the reasons for denying the agency's request, and
    (2) Within 90 days, propose to the requesting agency other methods 
for making the agency's program accessible.
    (d) Receipt of a copy of an occupant agency's transition plan under 
section 504 shall constitute notice to GSA of the requested actions in 
the transition plan and of the times frames which the actions are 
required to be completed.


<R05>
Sec. 105-8.154  Program accessibility: Exceptions.

    Sections 105-8.150, 105-8.152, and 105-8.153 do not require GSA to 
take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental 
alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial 
and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where GSA personnel 
believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program 
or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative 
burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance would 
result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would 
result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Administrator 
or his or her designee after considering all resources available for use 
in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and 
must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching 
that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in 
such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that 
individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the 
program or activity.


<R05>
Secs. 105-8.155--105-8.159  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 105-8.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
individual with handicaps.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate 
with persons with impaired hearing.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 150.8.160 would 
result in such alteration or burdens.

[[Page 160]]

The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens 
must be made by the Administrator or his or her designee after 
considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and 
operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied 
by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If 
an action required to comply with Sec. 105-8.160 would result in such an 
alteration or such burdnes, the agency shall take any other action that 
would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would 
nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals 
with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or 
activity.

    (b) The complainant and respondent shall be parties to the hearing. 
Any interested person or organization may petition to become a party or 
amicus curiae. The ALJ may, in his or her discretion, grant such a 
petition if, in his or her opinion, the petitioner has a legitimate 
interest in the proceedings and the participation will not unduly delay 
the outcome and may contribute materially to the proper disposition of 
the proceedings.

shall be conducted in conformity with 5 U.S.C. 554-557 (sections 5-8 of 
the Administrative Procedure Act). The ALJ shall have the duty to

to maintain order. He or she shall have all powers necessary to these 
ends, including (but not limited to) the power to--

a hearing, or to consider other matters that may aid in the expeditious 
disposition of the hearing;

to the various issues in the hearing and to exchange such statements 
with all other parties;
    (4) Examine witnesses and direct witnesses to testify;
    (5) Receive, rule on, exclude, or limit evidence;
    (6) Rule on procedural items pending before him or her; and
    (7) Take any action permitted to the ALJ as authorized by this part, 
or by the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551-
559).
    (d) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings 
conducted pursuant to Sec. 105-8.170-11, but rules or principles 
designed to assure production of credible evidence available and to 
subject testimony to cross-examination shall be applied by the ALJ 
whenever reasonably necessary. The ALJ may exclude irrelevant, 
immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other 
evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by 
the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments 
advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the 
oral evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated

on official duty status for this purpose. They shall not receive witness 
fees.
    (2) Employees of other Federal agencies called to testify at a 
hearing shall, at the request of the ALJ and with the approval of the 
employing agency, be on official duty status during any period of 
absence from normal duties caused by their testimony, and shall not 
receive witness fees.
    (3) The fees and expenses of other persons called to testify at a 
hearing shall be paid by the party requesting their appearance.
    (4) The ALJ may require the agency to pay travel expenses necessary 
for the complainant to attend the hearing.
    (5) The respondent shall pay the required expenses and charges for 
the ALJ and court reporter.
    (6) All other expenses shall be paid by the party, the intervening 
party, or amicus curiae incurring them.
    (f) The ALJ shall submit in writing recommended findings of fact, 
conclusions of law, and remedies to all parties and the Special Counsel 
for Ethics and Civil Rights within 30 days after receipt of the hearing 
transcripts, or within 30 days after the conclusion of the hearing if no 
transcript is made. This time limit may be extended with the permission 
of the Special Counsel.
    (g) Within 15 days after receipt of the recommended decision of the 
ALJ any party may file exceptions to the decision with the Speical 
Counsel. Thereafter, each party will have ten days to file reply 
exceptions with the Special Counsel.


<R05>
Sec. 105-8.170-12  Decision.

    (a) The Special Counsel shall make the decision of the agency based 
on information in the investigative record and, if a hearing is held, on 
the hearing record. The decision shall be made within 60 days of receipt 
of the transmittal of the notice of appeal and investitive record 
pursuant to Sec. 105-8.170-9(c) or after the period for filing 
exceptions ends, which ever is applicable. If the Special Counsel for 
Ethics and Civil Rights determines that he or she needs additional 
information from any party, he or she shall request the information and 
provide the other party or parties an opportunity to respond to that 
information. The Special Counsel shall have 60 days from receipt of the 
additional information to render the decision on the appeal. The Special 
Counsel shall transmit his or her decision by letter to the parties. The 
time limits established in this paragraph may be extended with the 
permission of the Assistant Attorney General. The decision shall set 
forth the findings, remedial action required, and reasons for the 
decision. If the decision is based on a hearing record, the Special 
Counsel shall consider the recommended decision of the ALJ and render a 
final decision based on the entire record. The Special Counsel may also 
remand the hearing record to the ALJ for a fuller development of the 
record.
    (b) Any respondent required to take action under the terms of the 
decision of the agency shall do so promptly. The Official may require 
periodic compliance reports specifying--
    (1) The manner in which compliance with the provisions of the 
decision has been achieved;
    (2) The reasons any action required by the final decision has not 
yet been taken; and
    (3) The steps being taken to ensure full compliance. The Official 
may retain responsibility for resolving disagreements that arise between 
the parties over interpretation fo the final agency decision or for 
specific adjudicatory decisions arising out of implementation.

Administration. The fees so established shall cover all direct costs, 
such as salaries of personnel involved plus personnel benefits, travel, 
and other related expenses and all indirect costs such as management, 
supervisory, and staff support expenses determined or estimated from the

basis, upon receipt of a request from a State or local government for 
such services, a written reply shall be prepared by the service or staff 
office receiving the request stating the basis for reimbursement for the 
services to be performed. The proposal shall be based on an estimate of 
all direct costs, such as salaries of personnel involved plus personnel 
benefits, travel, and other related expenses and on such indirect costs 
as management, supervisory, and staff support expenses. An appropriate 
surcharge may be developed to recover these indirect costs. The terms 
thereof shall be concurred in by the Director of Administration. 
Acceptance in writing by the requester shall constitute a binding 
agreement between GSA and the requesting governmental unit.

Sec. 105-50.304  Services provided through revolving funds.

    Where the service furnished is of the type which GSA is now billing 
through revolving funds, reimbursement shall be obtained from State and 
local governments on the same basis; i.e., the same pricing method, 
billing forms, and billing support shall be used.


<R05>
Sec. 105-50.304a  Deposits.

    Reimbursements to GSA for furnishing special or technical services 
to State and local units of government will be deposited to the credit 
of the appropriation from which the cost of providing such services has 
been paid or is to be charged if such reimbursements are authorized. 
Otherwise, the reimbursements will be credited to miscellaneous receipts 
in the U.S. Treasury (42 U.S.C. 4223).


<R05>
Sec. 105-50.305  Exemptions.

    (a) Single copies of existing reports covering studies and

which instance the actual cost thereof shall be charged.
    (b) GSA may, pursuant to section 302 of the Intergovernmental 
Personnel Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. 4742), admit employees of State and

serves as an ad hoc body convened to consider any other type of dispute, 
including appeals involving violations of post-Federal employment 
restrictions pursuant to the Ethics in Govenment Act of 1978. 
Additionally, the Board hears, considers, and decides ADP protests by

Sec. 105-54.000  Scope of part.

    This part sets forth policies and procedures in GSA regarding the 
establishment, operation, termination, and control of advisory 
committees for which GSA has responsibility. It implements the Federal 
Advisory Committee Act (Pub. L. 92-463), which authorizes a system 
governing the establishment and operation of advisory committees in the 
executive branch of the Federal Government, and Executive Order 11686 of 
October 7, 1972, which directs the heads of all executive departments 
and agencies to take appropriate action to ensure their ability to 
comply with the provisions of the Act.


<R04>
                  Subpart 105-54.1--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.101  Applicability.

    This part 105-54 applies to all advisory committees for which GSA 
has responsibility. This part also applies to any committee that advises 
GSA officials even if the committee were not established for that 
purpose. This applicability, however, is limited to the period of the 
committee's use as an advisory body. This part does not apply to:
    (a) An advisory committee exempted by an Act of Congress;
    (b) A local civic group whose primary function is to render a public 
service in connection with a Federal program;
    (c) A State or local committee, council, board, commission, or 
similar group established to advise or make recommendations to State or 
local officials or agencies;
    (d) A meeting initiated by the President or one or more Federal 
official(s) for the purpose of obtaining advice or recommendations from 
one individual;
    (e) A meeting with a group initiated by the President or one or more 
Federal official(s) for the sole purpose of exchanging facts or 
information;
    (f) A meeting initiated by a group with the President or one or more 
Federal official(s) for the purpose of expressing the group's views, 
provided that the President or Federal official(s) does not use the 
group recurrently as a preferred source of advice or recommendations;
    (g) A committee that is established to perform primarily operational 
as opposed to advisory functions. Operational functions are those 
specifically provided by law, such as making or implementing Government 
decisions or policy. An operational committee would be covered by the 
Act if it becomes primarily advisory in nature;
    (h) A meeting initiated by a Federal official(s) with more than one 
individual for the purpose of obtaining the advice of individual 
attendees and not for the purpose of utilizing the group to obtain 
consensus advice or recommendations. However, such a group would be 
covered by the Act when an agency accepts the group's deliberations as a 
source of consensus advice or recommendations;
    (i) A meeting of two or more advisory committee or subcommittee 
members convened solely to gather information or conduct research for a 
chartered advisory committee, to analyze relevant issues and facts, or 
to draft proposed position papers for deliberation by the advisory 
committee or a subcommittee of the advisory committee; and
    (j) A committee composed wholly of full-time officers or employees 
of the Federal Government.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.102  Definitions.

    (a) The term ``advisory committee'' means any committee, board, 
commission, council, conference, panel, task force, or other similar 
group or any subcommittee thereof that is:
    (1) Established by statute,
    (2) Established or utilized by the President, or
    (3) Established or utilized by any agency official to obtain advice 
or recommendations that are within the scope of his/her responsibilies.

The term ``advisory committee'' excludes the Advisory Committee on 
Intergovernmental Relations and any

[[Page 178]]

committees composed wholly of full-time officers or employees of the 
Federal Government.
    (b) ``Presidential advisory committee'' means any committee that 
advises the President. It may be established by the President or by the 
Congress, or may be used by the President to obtain advice or 
recommendations.
    (c) ``Independent Presidential advisory committee'' means any 
Presidential advisory committee not assigned by the President, or the 
President's delegate, or by the Congress in law, to an agency for 
administrative and other support and for which the Administrator of 
General Services may provide administrative and other support on a 
reimbursable basis.
    (d) ``Committee member'' means an individual who serves by 
appointment on a committee and has the full right and obligation to 
participate in the activities of the committee, including voting on 
committee recommendations.
    (e) ``Staff member'' means any individual who serves in a support 
capacity to an advisory committee.
    (f) ``Secretariat'' means the General Services Administration's 
Committee Management Secretariat. Established pursuant to the Federal 
Advisory Committee Act, it is responsible for all matters relating to 
advisory committees, and carries out the Administrator's 
responsibilities under the Act and Executive Order 12024.
    (g) ``Utilized'' (or used), as stated in the definition of 
``advisory committee'' above, refers to a situation in which a GSA 
official adopts a committee or other group composed in whole or in part 
of other than full-time Federal officers or employees with an 
established existence outside GSA as a preferred source from which to 
obtain advice or recommendations on a specific issue or policy within 
the scope of his/her responsibilities in the same manner as that 
official would obtain advice or recommendations from an established 
advisory committee.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.103  Policy.

    The basic GSA policy on committee management is as follows:
    (a) Advisory committees will be formed or used by GSA only when 
specifically authorized by law, or by the President, or specifically 
determined as a matter of formal record by the Administrator of General 
Services to be in the public interest in connection with the performance 
of duties imposed on GSA by law;
    (b) Advisory committees will not be used to administer a function 
that is the assigned responsibility of a service or staff office;
    (c) The assigned responsibility of a GSA official may not be 
delegated to any committee;
    (d) No advisory committee may be used for functions that are not 
solely advisory unless specifically authorized by statute or 
Presidential directive. Making policy decisions and determining action 
to be taken with respect to any matter considered by an advisory 
committee is solely the responsibility of GSA; and
    (e) In carrying out its responsibilities, GSA will consult with and 
obtain the advice of interested groups substantially affected by its 
programs. The use of advisory committees for this purpose is considered 
to be in the public interest and necessary for the proper performance by 
GSA of its assigned functions.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.104  Responsibilities.

    (a) Responsibility for coordination and control of committee 
management in GSA is vested in the Associate Administrator for 
Administration, who serves as the GSA Committee Management Officer 
(CMO). This Officer carries out the functions prescribed in section 8(b) 
of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. In doing so, the Officer controls 
and supervises the establishment, procedures, and accomplishments of 
GSA-sponsored advisory committees. The Organization and Productivity 
Improvement Division, Office of Management Services, Office of 
Administration, provides staff resources and furnishes the Staff Contact 
Person (SCP) to the CMO.
    (b) The Head of each Service and Staff Office and each Regional 
Administrator selects a Committee Management Officer (CMO) to coordinate 
and control committee management within the service, staff office, or 
regional office and to act as liaison to the GSA

[[Page 179]]

Committee Management Officer. The duties of the CMOs are as follows:
    (1) Assemble and maintain the reports, records, and other papers of 
any GSA-sponsored committee during its existence (Arrangements may be 
made, however, for the Government chairperson or other GSA 
representative to retain custody of reports, records, and other papers 
to facilitate committee operations. After the committee is terminated, 
all committee records are disposed of following existing regulations.); 
and
    (2) Under agency regulations in 41 CFR 105-60, carry out the 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552 with respect to the reports, records, and 
other papers of GSA-sponsored advisory committees.

must consider the functions of similar committees in GSA to ensure that 
no duplication of effort will occur.
    (c) The HSSO proposes the establishment of a Central Office or 
regional advisory committee within the scope of assigned program 
responsibilities. In doing so, the HSSO assures that advisory committees 
are established only if they are essential to the conduct of agency 
business. Advisory committees are established only if there is a 
compelling need for the committees, the committees have a truly balanced 
membership, and the committees conduct their business as openly as 
possible under the law and their mandate. Each proposal is submitted to 
the GSA Committee Management Officer for review and coordination and 
includes:
    (1) A letter addressed to the Committee Management Secretariat 
signed by the HSSO with information copies for the Administrator, Deputy 
Administrator, the Associate Administrator for Congressional and 
Industry Relations, and the Special Counsel for Ethics and Civil Rights, 
describing the nature and purpose of the proposed advisory committee; 
why it is essential to agency business and in the public interest; why 
its functions cannot be performed by an existing committee of GSA, by 
GSA, or other means such as a public hearing; and the plans to ensure 
balanced membership;
    (2) A notice for publication in the Federal Register containing the 
Administrator's certification that creation of the advisory committee is 
in the public interest and describing the nature and purpose of the 
committee; and
    (3) A draft charter for review by the Committee Management 
Secretariat.
    (d) Subcommittees that do not function independently of the full or 
parent advisory committee need not follow the requirements of paragraph 
(c) of this section. However, they are subject to all other requirements 
of the Federal Advisory Committee Act.
    (e) The requirements of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section 
apply to any subcommittee of a chartered committee, whether its members 
are drawn in whole or in part from the full or parent advisory 
committee, that functions independently of the parent advisory 
committee, such as by making recommendations directly to a GSA official 
rather than for consideration by the chartered advisory committee.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.202  Review and approval of proposals.

    (a) The GSA Committee Management Officer reviews each proposal to 
make sure it conforms with GSA policies and procedures. The Officer 
sends the letter of justification, including the draft charter, to the 
Committee Management Secretariat. The Secretariat reviews the proposal 
and provides its views within 15 calendar days of receipt, if possible. 
The Administrator retains final authority for establishing a particular 
advisory committee.

[[Page 180]]

    (b) When the Secretariat notifies the Officer that establishing the 
committee conforms with the Federal Advisory Committee Act, the Officer 
obtains the Administrator's approval of the charter and the Federal 
Register notice. The Officer publishes the notice in the Federal 
Register at least 15 calendar days before the filing of the charter 
under Sec. 105-54.203 with the standing committees of the Senate and the 
House of Representatives having legislative jurisdiction over GSA. The 
date of filing constitutes the date of establishment.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.203  Advisory committee charters.

    No advisory committee may operate, meet, or take any action until 
the Administrator approves its charter and the Committee Management 
Officer sends a copy of it to the standing committees of the Senate and 
the House of Representatives having legislative jurisdiction over GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.203-1  Preparation of charters.

    Each committee charter contains the following information:
    (a) The committee's official designation;
    (b) The committee's objectives and the scope of its activities;
    (c) The period of time necessary for the committee to carry out its 
purpose (if the committee is intended to function as a standing advisory 
committee, this should be made clear);
    (d) The official to whom the committee reports, including the 
official's name, title, and organization;
    (e) The agency and office responsible for providing the necessary 
support for the committee;
    (f) A description of the duties for which the committee is 
responsible (if the duties are not solely advisory, the statutory or 
Presidential authority for additional duties shall be specified);
    (g) The estimated annual operating costs in dollars and person-years 
for the committee;
    (h) The estimated number and frequency of committee meetings;
    (i) The committee's termination date, if it is less than 2 years 
from the date of its establishment; and
    (j) The date the charter is filed. This date is inserted by the GSA 
Committee Management Officer after the Administrator approves the 
charter.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.203-2  Active charters file.

    The GSA Committee Management Officer retains each original signed 
charter in a file of active charters.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.203-3  Submission to Library of Congress.

    The GSA Committee Management Officer furnishes a copy of each 
charter to the Library of Congress when or shortly after copies are 
filed with the requisite committees of the Congress. Copies for the 
Library are addressed: Library of Congress, Exchange and Gift Division, 
Federal Documents Section, Federal Advisory Committee Desk, Washington, 
DC 20540.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.204  Advisory committee membership.

    (a) Advisory committees that GSA establishes represent the points of 
view of the profession, industry, or other group to which it relates, 
taking into account the size, function, geographical location, 
affiliation, and other considerations affecting the character of a 
committee. To ensure balance, the agency considers for membership a 
cross-section of interested persons and groups with professional or 
personal qualifications or experience to contribute to the functions and 
tasks to be performed. This should be construed neither to limit the 
participation nor to compel the selection of any particular individual 
or group to obtain different points of view relevant to committee 
business. The Administrator designates members, alternates, and 
observers, as appropriate, of advisory committees. He/she designates a 
Federal officer or employee to chair or attend each meeting of each 
advisory committee. The Administrator also designates GSA employees to 
serve on advisory committees sponsored by other Government agencies. The 
HSSO or Regional Administrator submits nominations and letters of 
designation for the Administrator's signature to

[[Page 181]]

the GSA Committee Management Officer and to the Special Counsel for 
Ethics and Civil Rights for review and forwarding to the Administrator.
    (b) Discrimination is prohibited on the basis of race, color, age, 
national origin, religion, sex, or mental and physical handicap in 
selecting advisory committee members.
    (c) Nominees for membership must submit a Statement of Employment 
and Financial Interests (provided to the nominee by the HSSO or Regional 
Administrator) and may not be appointed until cleared by the Designated 
Agency Ethics Official.


<R04>
             Subpart 105-54.3--Advisory Committee Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.300  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart sets forth the procedures that will be followed in the 
operation of advisory committees within GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.301  Meetings.

    (a) Each GSA advisory committee meeting is open to the public unless 
the Administrator decides otherwise;
    (b) Each meeting is held at a reasonable time and in a place 
reasonably accessible to the public;
    (c) The meeting room size is sufficient to accommodate committee 
members, committee or GSA staff, and interested members of the public;
    (d) Any private citizen is permitted to file a written statement 
with the advisory committee;
    (e) Any private citizen is permitted to speak at the advisory 
committee meeting, at the chairperson's discretion;
    (f) All persons attending committee meetings at which classified 
information will be considered are required to have an adequate security 
clearance;
    (g) The Designated Federal Officer (who may be either full time or 
permanent part-time) for each advisory committee and its subcommittees 
does the following:
    (1) Approves or calls the meetings of the advisory committee;
    (2) Approves the meeting agenda, which lists the matters to be 
considered at the meeting and indicates whether any part of the meeting 
will be closed to the public under the Government in the Sunshine Act (5 
U.S.C. 552b(c)). Ordinarily, copies of the agenda are distributed to 
committee members before the date of the meeting;
    (3) Attends all meetings (no part of a meeting may proceed in the 
Designated Federal Officer's absence);
    (4) Adjourns the meeting when he or she determines that adjournment 
is in the public interest; and
    (5) Chairs the meeting when asked to do so.
    (h) The Committee Chairperson makes sure that detailed minutes of 
each meeting are kept and certifies to their accuracy. The minutes 
include:
    (1) Time, date, and place;
    (2) A list of the following persons who were present;
    (i) Advisory committee members and staff;
    (ii) Agency employees; and
    (iii) Private citizens who presented oral or written statements;
    (3) The estimated number of private citizens present;
    (4) An accurate description of each matter discussed and the 
resolution of the matter, if any; and
    (5) Copies of each report or other document the committee received, 
issued, or approved.
    (i) The responsible HSSO or the Regional Administrator publishes at 
least 15 calendar days before the meeting a notice in the Federal 
Register that includes:
    (1) The name of the advisory committee as chartered;
    (2) The time, date, place, and purpose of the meeting;
    (3) A summary of the agenda; and
    (4) A statement whether all or part of the meeting is open to the 
public of closed; and if closed, the reasons why, and citing the 
specific exemptions of the Government is the Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C. 
552b) as the basis for closure;
    (j) In exceptional circumstances and when approved by the General 
Counsel or designee, less than 15 calendar days notice may be given, 
provided the reasons for doing so are included in the committee meeting 
notice published in the Federal Register;
    (k) Notices to be published in the Federal Register are submitted to 
the Federal Register Liaison Officer

[[Page 182]]

(CAID). At least five workdays are needed for printing of the notice;
    (l) Meetings may also be announced by press release, direct mail, 
publication in trade and professional journals, or by notice to special 
interest and community groups affected by the Committee's deliberations. 
This procedure cannot be a substitute for Federal Register publication;
    (m) The fact that a meeting may be closed to the public under the 
exemptions of the Government in the Sunshine Act does not relieve GSA of 
the requirement to publish a notice of it in the Federal Register. The 
Administrator may authorize an exception to this requirement for reasons 
of national security if the HSSO requests it at least 30 calendar days 
before the meeting, with the concurrence of the General Counsel of 
designee.
    (n) An advisory committee meeting is not open to the public, nor is 
the attendance, appearance, or filing of statements by interested 
persons permitted, if the Administrator decides that the meeting is 
exempted under the Government in the Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C. 552b (c)) 
and there is sufficient reason to invoke the exemption. If only part of 
the meeting concerns exempted matters, only that part is closed. The 
HSSO or Regional Administrator submits any decisions concerning the 
closing of meetings in writing to the Administrator for approval at 
least 30 calendar days in advance of the meeting. These decisions 
clearly set forth the reasons for doing so, citing the specific 
exemptions used from the Government in the Sunshine Act in the meeting 
notice published in the Federal Register. They are made available to the 
public on request. The Administrator may waive the 30-day requirement 
when a lesser period of time is requested and adequately justified.
    (o) If any meeting or portion of a meeting is closed to public 
attendance, the advisory committee issues a report at lease annually 
setting forth a summary of its activities and such related matters as 
would be informative to the public, consistent with the policy of 5 
U.S.C. 552(b). Notice of the availability of the report and instructions 
on how to gain access to it are published in the Federal Register no 
later than 60 days after its completion. In addition, copies of the 
report are filed with the Library of Congress.
    (p) The General Counsel reviews all requests to close meetings.
    (q) The HSSO or Regional Administrator publishes the meeting notices 
in the Federal Register, including the reasons why all or part of the 
meeting is closed, citing the specified exemptions used from the 
Government in the Sunshine Act.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.302  Committee records and reports.

    (a) Subject to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), the 
records, reports, transcripts, minutes, appendixes, working papers, 
drafts, studies, agenda, or other documents that were available to or 
prepared for or by a GSA advisory committee are available (until the 
committee ceases to exist) for public inspection and copying in the 
office of the Government Chairperson or Designated Federal Officer. 
Requests to inspect or copy these records are processed under 41 CFR 
105-60.4. Except where prohibited by a contract entered into before 
January 5, 1973, copies of transcripts, if any, of committee meetings 
are made available by the Government chairperson or Designated Federal 
Officer to any person at the cost of duplication. After the committee's 
work ends, disposition of the committee documents and the release of 
information from them are made in accordance with Federal records, 
statutes, and regulations.
    (b) Subject to 5 U.S.C. 552(b) and instructions of the Committee 
Management Secretariat, the Government chairperson or Designated Federal 
Officer files at least eight copies of each report an advisory committee 
makes, including any report on closed meetings with the Library of 
Congress at the time of its issuance. Where appropriate, the chairperson 
also files copies of background papers that consultants to the advisory 
committee prepare with the Library of Congress. The transmittal letter 
identifies the materials being furnished, with a copy of the transmittal 
provided to the GSA Committee Management Officer.

[[Page 183]]


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.303  Fiscal and administrative provisions.

    (a) Each HSSO and each Regional Administrator ensures that under 
established GSA procedures, records are kept that fully disclose the 
disposition of funds at the disposal of an advisory committee and the 
nature and extent of the committee's activities.
    (b) When GSA is assigned to provide administrative support for a 
Presidential advisory committee, the Agency Liaison Coordinator in the 
Office of the Deputy Regional Administrator, National Capital Region, as 
a part of its support, arranges with the Office of Finance, Office of 
the Comptroller, for maintaining all financial records.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided in a Presidential order, statute, or 
other authority, the GSA service or staff office sponsoring an advisory 
committee provides support services for the committee.
    (d) The guidelines in paragraph (e) through (l) of this section are 
established under section 7(d) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 86 
Stat. 773. They apply to the pay of members, staff, and consultants of 
an advisory committee, except that nothing in this paragraph will affect 
a rate of pay or a limitation on a rate of pay that is established by 
statute or a rate of pay established under the General Schedule 
classification and pay system in Chapter 51 and Subchapter III of 
Chapter 53 of Title 5, U.S.C.
    (e) The members of GSA advisory committee established pursuant to 
the Administrator's authority under section 205(g) of the Federal 
Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 
486(g)), are not compensated, since, by law, members so appointed shall 
service without compensation. A person who (without regard to his or her 
service with an advisory committee) is a full-time Federal employee will 
normally receive compensation at the rate at which he or she would 
otherwise be compensated.
    (f) When required by law, the pay of the members of GSA advisory 
committees will be fixed to the daily equivalent of a rate of the 
General Schedule in 5 U.S.C. 5332 unless the members are appointed as 
consultants and compensated as provided in paragraph (h) of this 
section. In determining an appropriate rate of pay for the members, GSA 
must give consideration to the significance, scope, and technical 
complexity of the matters with which the advisory committee is concerned 
and the qualifications required of the members of the advisory 
committee. GSA may not fix the pay of the members of an advisory 
committee at a rate higher than the daily equivalent of the maximum rate 
for a GS-15 under the General Schedule, unless a higher rate is mandated 
by statute, or the Administrator has personally determined that a higher 
rate of pay under the General Schedule is justified and necessary. Such 
a determination must be reviewed by the Administrator annually. 
Accordingly, the Administrator may not fix the pay of the members of an 
advisory committee at a rate of pay higher than the daily equivalent of 
a rate for a GSA 18, as provided in 5 U.S.C. 5332.
    (g) The pay of each staff member of an advisory committee is fixed 
at a rate of the General Schedule, General Management Schedule, or 
Senior Executive Service pay rate in which the staff member's position 
would be placed (5 U.S.C. Chapter 51). GSA cannot fix the pay of a staff 
member higher than the daily equivalent of the maximum rate for GS-15 
unless the Administrator decides that under the General Schedule, 
General Management Schedule, or Senior Executive Service classification 
system, the staff member's position should be higher than GS-15. The 
Administrator must review this decision annually.
    (1) In establishing compensation rates, GSA must comply with 
applicable statutes, regulations, Executive Orders, and administrative 
guidelines.
    (2) A staff member who is a Federal employee serves with the 
knowledge of the Designated Federal Officer and the approval of the 
employee's direct supervisor. A staff member who is a non-Federal 
employee is appointed under agency procedures, after consultation with 
the advisory committee.
    (h) The pay of a consultant to an advisory committee will be fixed 
after giving consideration to the qualifications required of the 
consultant and the significance, scope, and technical complexity of the 
work. The rate of

[[Page 184]]

pay will not exceed the maximum rate of pay which the agency may pay 
experts and consultants under 5 U.S.C. 3109 and must be in accordance 
with any applicable statutes, regulations, Executive Orders, and 
administrative guidelines.
    (i) Advisory committee and staff members, while performing their 
duties away from their homes or regular places of business, may be 
allowed travel expenses, including per diem instead of subsistence, as 
authorized by 5 U.S.C. 5703 for persons employed intermittently in the 
Government service.
    (j) Members of an advisory committee and its staff who are blind or 
deaf or who otherwise qualify as handicapped persons (under section 501 
of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794)), and who do not 
otherwise qualify for assistance under 5 U.S.C. 3102, as an employee of 
an agency (under section 3102(a)(1) of Title 5), may be provided the 
services of a personal assistant.
    (k) Under this paragraph, GSA may accept the gratuitous services of 
a member, consultant, or staff member of an advisory committee who 
agrees in advance to serve without compensation.
    (l) A person who immediately before his or her service with an 
advisory committee was a full-time Federal employee may receive 
compensation at the rate at which he or she was compensated as a Federal 
employee.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.304  Cost guidelines.

    (a) The reporting and estimating of the costs of advisory committees 
include direct obligations for the following items:
    (1) Pay compensation of committee members; consultants to the 
committee; all permanent, temporary, or part-time (GM, GS, WB, or other) 
positions which are a part of or support the committee; and all overtime 
related to committee functions (Compensation should reflect actual or 
estimated Federal person-years or parts thereof devoted to a committee's 
activities. It includes the compensation of Federal employees assigned 
to committees, on a reimbursable or nonreimbursable basis, from agencies 
or departments other than to which the committee reports.);
    (2) Personnel benefits associated with the above compensation (13 
percent of basic payroll);
    (3) Travel costs (including per diem) of committee members; 
consultants; and all permanent, temporary, or part-time positions which 
are a part of or support the committee;
    (4) Transportation of things, communications, and printing and 
reproduction;
    (5) Rent for additional space acquired for committee use;
    (6) Other services required by the committee, including data 
processing services, management studies and evaluations, contractual 
services, and reimbursable services; and
    (7) Supplies, materials, and equipment acquired for committee use.
    (b) The reporting and estimating of the cost of advisory committees 
does not include indirect or overhead costs; e.g., the costs of the 
committee management system (committee management officers, etc.).


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.305  Renewal of advisory committees.

    (a) Each advisory committee being continued is renewed for 
successive 2-year periods beginning with the date when it was 
established according to the following, except for statutory advisory 
committees: (For renewal of statutory advisory committees, see paragraph 
(b) of this section.)
    (1) Advisory committees are not renewed unless there is a compelling 
need for them, they have balanced membership, and they conduct their 
business as openly as possible under the law.
    (2) The renewal of a committee requires that the responsible HSSO 
submit to the GSA Committee Management Officer the following:
    (i) An updated charter with an explanation of the need for the 
renewal of the committee. The charter and explanation are furnished 60 
calendar days before the 2-year anniversary date of the committee.);
    (ii) A letter signed by the HSSO to the Director, Committee 
Management Secretariat, with information copies to the Administrator and 
the Deputy Administrator, setting forth:

[[Page 185]]

    (A) An explanation of why the committee is essential to the conduct 
of agency business and is in the public interest;
    (B) GSA's plan to attain balanced membership of the committee; and
    (C) An explanation of why the committee's functions cannot be 
performed by GSA, another existing GSA advisory committee, or other 
means such as a public hearing;
    (iii) A notice for publication in the Federal Register describing 
the nature and purpose of the committee and containing a certification 
by the Administrator that renewing the advisory committee is in the 
public interest.
    (3) On receiving the above documents, the GSA Committee Management 
Officer submits the renewal letter to the Committee Management 
Secretariat not more than 60 calendar days nor less than 30 days before 
the committee expires. Following receipt of the Committee Management 
Secretariat's views on the committee renewal, the Officer obtains the 
Administrator's approval of the charter and the Federal Register notice. 
The Officer publishes notice of the renewal in the Federal Register and 
files copies of the updated charter. The 15-day notice requirement does 
not apply to committee renewals, notices of which may be published 
concurrently with the filing of the charter.
    (b) Each statutory advisory committee is renewed by the filing of a 
renewal charter upon the expiration of each successive 2-year period 
following the date of enactment of the statute establishing the 
committee according to the following:
    (1) The procedures in paragraph (a)(2) of this section apply to the 
renewal of a statutory committee except that neither prior consultation 
with the Committee Management Secretariat nor a Federal Register notice 
is required. Accordingly, the letter that paragraph a(2)(ii) requires is 
sent to the Administrator rather than the Committee Mangement 
Secretariat. Due to the nature of a committee the law established, the 
explanation of the need to continue the committee's existence is less 
extensive than the explanation for the continuation of a non-statutory 
committee; and
    (2) The GSA Committee Management Officer provides the Committee 
Management Secretariat with a copy of the filed charter.
    (c) An advisory commitee required to file a new charter may not take 
any action other than preparing the charter between the date it is to be 
filed and the date it is actually filed.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.306  Amendment of advisory committee charters.

    (a) A charter is amended when GSA decides that the existing charter 
no longer accurately reflects the objectives or functions of the 
committee. Changes may be minor, such as revising the name of the 
committee or modifying the estimated number or frequency of meetings, or 
they may be major dealing with the basic objectives or composition of 
the committee. The Administrator retains final authority for amending 
the charter of an advisory committee. Amending an existing advisory 
committee charter does not constitute renewal of the committee.
    (b) To make a minor amendment, the Administrator approves the 
amended charter and has it filed according to Sec. 105-54.203-1.
    (c) To make a major amendment, the Committee Management Officer 
submits an amended charter and a letter to the Committee Management 
Secretariat, signed by the HSSO with the concurrence of the General 
Counsel or designee, requesting the Secretariat's views on the amended 
language, along with an explanation of the purpose of the changes and 
why they are necessary. The Secretariat reviews the proposed changes and 
notifies the Committee Management Officer of its views within 15 
calendar days of receiving it, if possible. The Administrator has the 
charter filed according to Sec. 105-54.203-1.
    (d) Amending an existing charter does not constitute renewal of the 
committee.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.307  Termination of advisory committees.

    (a) The sponsoring HSSO terminates an advisory commitee that has 
fulfilled the purpose stated in its charter. The official takes action 
to rescind any existing orders relating to the committee and to notify 
committee members, the

[[Page 186]]

GSA Committee Management Officer, and the Committee Management 
Secretariat of the termination.
    (b) Failing to continue an advisory committee by the 2-year 
anniversary date terminates the committee, unless its duration is 
provided for by law.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.308  Responsibilities of the Administrator.

    The Administrator must ensure:
    (a) Compliance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act and this 
chapter;
    (b) Issuance of administrative guidelines and management controls 
that apply to all advisory committees established or used by the agency;
    (c) Designation of a Committee Management Officer to carry out the

Act;
    (d) Provision of a written determination stating the reasons for 
closing any advisory committee meeting to the public;

purpose and functions of each committee;
    (f) The appointment of a Designated Federal Officer for each 
advisory committee and its subcommittee;
    (g) The opportunity for reasonable public participation in advisory 
committee activities; and
    (h) That the number of committee members is limited to the fewest 
necessary to accomplish committee objectives.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.309  Added responsibilities of service and staff office heads and regional administrators.

    (a) No later than the first meeting of an advisory committee, submit 
to committee members, committee staff, consultants, and appropriate 
agency management personnel a written statement of the purpose, 
objectives, and expected accomplishments of the committee;
    (b) Solicit in writing or in a formal meeting at least annually the 
views of committee members on the effectiveness, activities, and 
management of the committee, including recommendations for improvement. 
Review comments to determine whether improvements or corrective action 
is warranted. Retain recommendations until the committee is terminated 
or renewed.
    (c) Involve key management personnel of the agency whose interests 
are affected by the committee in committee meetings, including reviewing 
reports and establishing agendas.
    (d) Periodically, but not less than annually, review the level of 
committee staff suport to make sure that expenditures are justified by 
committee activity and benefit to the Government.
    (e) Monitor the attendance and participation of committee members 
and consider replacing any member who misses a substantial number of 
scheduled meetings.
    (f) Establish meeting dates and distribute agendas and other 
materials well in advance.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.310  Advisory committee duties of the GSA Committee Management Officer.

    In addition to implementing the provisions of section 8(b) of the 
Federal Advisory Committee Act, the GSA Committee Management Officer 
carries out all responsibilities delegated by the Administrator. The 
Officer ensures that sections 10(b), 12(a), and 13 of the Act are 
implemented by GSA to provide for appropriate record keeping. Records 
include, but are not limited to:
    (a) A set of approved charters and membership lists for each 
advisory committee;
    (b) Copies of GSA's portion of the Annual Report of Federal Advisory 
Committees.
    (c) Guidelines on committee management operations and procedures as 
maintained and updated; and
    (d) Determinations to close advisory committee meetings.


<R05>
Sec. 105-54.311  Complaint procedures.

    (a) Any person whose request for access to an advisory committee 
document is denied may seek administrative review under 41 CFR 105-60, 
which implements the Freedom of Information Act. (See GSA Order, GSA 
regulations under the ``Freedom of Information Act'' (ADM 7900.3A).)
    (b) Aggrieved individuals or organizations may file written 
complaints on

[[Page 187]]

matters not involving access to documents with the Deputy Administrator, 
General Services Administration, Washington, DC 20405. Complaints must 
be filed within 90 calendar days from the date the grievance arose. The 
Deputy Administrator promptly acts on each complaint and notifies the

<R05>
Sec. 105-55.001  Background.

    The Department of Justice and the General Accounting Office have 
jointly issued amended Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR parts 
101-105) which reflect changes to the Federal Claims Collection Act of 
1966 (31 U.S.C. 3701-3719) made by the passage of the Debt Collection 
Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1754). The preamble to the amended 
Federal Claims Collection Standards instructs individual agencies to 
adopt their own regulations as to detailed procedures in furtherance of 
the Federal Claims Collection Standards. Additionally, the Debt 
Collection Act of 1982 directs, as reflected in the Federal Claims 
Collection Standards, that each agency must prescribe regulations on 
collecting by administrative offset and that each agency may prescribe 
regulations identifying circumstances appropriate to waive collection of 
interest and charges in conformity with the Federal Claims Collection 
Standards.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.002  Purpose.

    In keeping with the suggestion in the preamble to the amended 
Federal Claims Collection Standards and the directives in the Debt 
Collection Act of 1982 and the Federal Claims Collection Standards as to 
administrative offset and the collection of interest and charges, this 
part provides procedures for the General Services Administration to 
collect, compromise, or terminate collection action on claims owed to 
the United States arising from activities under GSA jurisdiction. It 
implements the Federal Claims Collection Act as amended by the Debt 
Collection Act. It supplements the regulations published jointly by the 
General Accounting Office and the Department of Justice. It sets forth 
procedures by which GSA:
    (a) Will collect claims owed to the United States;
    (b) Will determine and collect interest and other charges on those 
claims;
    (c) Will compromise claims; and
    (d) Will refer unpaid claims for litigation.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.003  Applicability.

    (a) This part applies to all claims due the United States under the 
Federal

[[Page 188]]

Claims Collection Act, as amended by the Debt Collection Act, arising 
from activities under the jurisdiction of the General Services 
Administration, except for the collection by administrative offset of 
those claims arising out of contracts subject to the Contracts Disputes 
Act of 1982, 41 U.S.C. 601 et. seq. The word ``claims'' includes but is 
not limited to amounts due the United States from fees, overpayments, 
fines, civil penalties, damages, interest and other sources.
    (b) Claims arising from the audit of transportation accounts 
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3726 shall be determined, collected, compromised, 
terminated or settled in accordance with regulation published under the 
authority of 31 U.S.C. 3726 (see 41 CFR part 101-41, administered by the 
Director, Office of Transportation Audits) and are otherwise excepted 
from these regulations.

[50 FR 37531, Sept. 16, 1985, as amended at 52 FR 46468, Dec. 8, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.004  Demand for payment.

    (a) A total of three progressively stronger written demands at 
approximately 30-day intervals will normally be made, unless a response 
or other information indicates that additional written demands would 
either be unnecessary or futile. When necessary to protect the 
Government's interest, written demand may be preceded by other 
appropriate actions under the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 
including immediate referral for litigation and/or offset.
    (b) The initial written demand for payment shall inform the debtor 
of:
    (1) The basis for the claim;
    (2) The amount of the claim;
    (3) The date when payment is due; (30 days from date of mailing or 
hand delivery of the initial demand for payment);
    (4) The provision for interest, penalties, and administrative 
charges in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717, if payment is not received by 
the due date (See Sec. 105-55.005 for details regarding interest, 
administrative charges, and penalty charges.)
    (5) The intent of the agency to collect by administrative offset, 
including asking the assistance of other Federal agencies to help in the 
offset whenever possible, if the debtor has not made payment by the 
payment due date, has not requested a review of the claim within the 
agency as set out in paragraph (b)(8) of this section or has not made an 
arrangement for payment by the payment due date;
    (6) The right of the debtor to inspect and copy the records of the 
agency related to the claim. Any costs associated therewith shall be 
borne by the debtor. The debtor shall give reasonable notice in advance 
to the agency of the date upon which it intends to inspect and copy the 
records involved;
    (7) The right of the debtor to a review of the claim within the 
agency. If the claim is disputed in full or part, the debtor shall 
respond to the demand in writing by making a request for a review of the 
claim within the agency by the payment due date stated in the demand. 
The debtor's written response shall state the basis for the dispute. If 
only part of the claim is disputed, the undisputed portion should be 
paid by the date stated in the initial demand. The agency shall 
acknowledge receipt of the request for a review, and upon completion of 
consideration shall notify the debtor whether its determination has been 
sustained, amended, or canceled within 15 days of the receipt of the 
request for a review. If the agency either sustains or amends its 
determination, it shall notify the debtor of its intent to collect by 
administrative offset unless payment is received within 15 days of the 
mailing of the notification of its decision following a review of the 
claim.
    (8) The right of the debtor to offer to make a written agreement to 
repay the amount of the claim. The acceptance of such an agreement is 
discretionary with the agency. If the debtor requests a repayment 
arrangement because a payment of the amount due would create a financial 
hardship, the appropriate GSA Regional Finance Division will analyze the 
debtor's financial condition. Dependent upon the Regional Finance 
Division's evaluation of the financial strength of the debtor, the 
Comptroller or the appropriate designee and the debtor may agree to a 
written installment repayment schedule. The debtor shall execute a 
confess-judgment note which specifies all of

[[Page 189]]

the terms of the arrangement. The size and frequency of installment 
payments should bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and 
the debtor's ability to pay. Interest, administrative charges, and 
penalty charges shall be provided for in the note. The debtor shall be 
provided with a written explanation of the consequences of signing a 
confess-judgment note. The debtor shall sign a statement acknowledging 
receipt of the written explanation which shall recite that the statement 
was read and understood before execution of the notice and that the note 
is being signed knowingly and voluntarily. Some form of objective 
evidence of these facts should be maintained in the agency's file on the 
debtor.
    (c) If no response to the demand is received by the date stated in 
the demand, GSA will take further action under this subpart or under the 
Federal Claims Collection Standards. These actions may include reports 
to credit bureaus, referrals to collection agencies, termination of 
contract, debarment, offset of Federal salary, and other administrative 
offset, as authorized in 31 U.S.C. 3701-3719.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.005  Interest, administrative charges, and penalty charges.

    (a) GSA shall assess interest on unpaid claims at the rate of the 
current value of funds to the Treasury as prescribed by the Secretary of 
the Treasury on the date interest begins to run. GSA shall assess 
administrative charges to cover the costs of processing and handling 
overdue claims. GSA shall assess penalty charges of six percent a year 
on any part of a debt more than 90 days past due. The imposition of 
interest, administrative charges, and penalty charges are made in 
accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717.
    (b) Interest will be computed from the date of mailing or hand 
delivery of the initial demand if the amount of the claim is not paid 
within 30 days. The 30-day period may be extended in individual cases if 
there is good cause to do so and it is in the public interest. Interest 
will only be computed on the principal of the claim and the interest 
rate will remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness, except 
where a debtor has defaulted on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter 
into a new agreement. A new rate which reflects the current value of 
funds to the Treasury at the time the new agreement is executed may be 
set if applicable and interest on interest and related charges may be 
charged where the debtor has defaulted on a previous repayment 
agreement. Charges which accrued but were not collected under the 
defaulted agreement shall be added to the principal to be paid under the 
new repayment schedule.
    (c) GSA may waive interest, administrative charges, or penalty 
charges if it finds that:
    (1) The debtor is unable to pay any significant sum toward the claim 
within a reasonable period of time;
    (2) Collection of interest, administrative charges, or penalty 
charges will jeopardize collection of the principal of the claim; or
    (3) It is otherwise in the best interests of the United States, 
including the situation where an offset or installment payment agreement 
is in effect.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.006  Responsibility for collection.

    (a) Heads of Central Office Services and Staff Offices and Regional 
Administrators must initiate actions on claims arising from their 
program operations and immediately notify the appropriate Regional 
Finance Division. A claim will be recorded and controlled by the 
Regional Finance Division upon receipt of documentation from a competent 
authority establishing the amount due.
    (b) The collection of claims under the control of Regional Finance 
Divisions will be aggressively pursued in accordance with the provisions 
of part 102 of the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR part 102). 
Whenever feasible, debts owed to the United States, together with 
interest, administrative charges and penalty charges, should be 
collected in full in one lump sum. If the debtor requests installment 
payments, the Regional Finance Divisions shall be responsible for 
determining the financial hardship of debtors and when appropriate shall 
arrange installment payment schedules. Claims which cannot be collected 
either directly or by administrative offset shall either be

[[Page 190]]

written off as administratively uncollectible in accordance with 
authority delegated to the Director, Office of Finance and the 
Directors, Regional Finance Divisions, or referred to the appropriate 
Assistant General Counsel or Regional Counsel for further consideration.
    (c) The General Counsel, delegated officials in the Office of 
General Counsel, and each Regional Counsel may compromise or suspend or 
terminate the collection of, referred claims under $20,000, exclusive of 
interest, penalties and administrative charges under the Act and the 
Federal Claims Collection Standards 4 CFR parts 103 and 104.
    (d) The Office of General Counsel officials listed in paragraph (c) 
of this section have the responsibility for referring to the Department 
of Justice all claims over $20,000 exclusive of interest, penalties and 
administrative charges which cannot be compromised, suspended or 
terminated in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Act and the 
Federal Claims Collections Standards. Referrals to the Department of 
Justice shall be made in accordance with 4 CFR part 105 of the Federal 
Claims Collections Standards.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.007  Collection by offset.

    (a) Whenever feasible, after a debtor fails to pay the claim, 
request a review of the claim, or make an arrangement for payment. The 
Comptroller or his appropriate regional designee will collect claims 
under this part by means of administrative offset against obligations of 
the United States to the debtor, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716, except 
offset of Federal salaries and claims arising out of contracts subject 
to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, 41 U.S.C. 601 et. seq.
    (b) Salary offsets and offsets against military retired pay are 
governed by 5 U.S.C. 5514.
    (c) Collection by administrative offset of amounts payable from 
Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund will be made pursuant to 5 
U.S.C. 5514 and 5 U.S.C. 5705 and regulations thereunder.
    (d) The offset of claims arising out of contracts subject to the 
Contract Disputes Act of 1978, 41 U.S.C. 601 et. seq. will be made 
pursuant to the Government common law right of offset.
    (e) GSA will promptly make requests for offset to other agencies 
holding funds payable to a debtor and provide instructions for the 
transfer of these funds. Requests for offset received from other 
agencies shall be processed promptly and the funds transferred to the 
requesting agency.
    (f) If administrative offset cannot be effected through GSA or other 
known agency accounts receivable, then GSA will place a complete stop 
order against amounts otherwise payable to the debtor by placing the 
name of that debtor on the Department of the Army ``List of Contractors 
Indebted to the United States.'' If any amounts are discovered under 
this procedure, they will be offset against the debt owed to GSA.
    (g) GSA should not attempt to effect collection by administrative 
offset when:
    (1) The debtor has ceased to do business and there are no known or 
potential obligations payable by any agency of the United States 
Government to the debtor.
    (2) The debt in question is over ten years old.
    (3) The debtor has either gone into receivership and has liquidated 
all of its assets or has filed a petition in bankruptcy as a no asset 
debtor, and there is no likelihood of the debtor resuming operations; 
and there are no known or potential obligations payable by any agency of 
the United States Government to the debtor. In the case of a bankruptcy 
petition, the automatic stay against setoff must be honored pending 
release from the stay.
    (4) The debtor is deceased, and there are no attachable assets in 
the estate.
    (5) Any other circumstances which would indicate that the likelihood 
of collection by administrative offset is less than probable.

<R05>
Sec. 105-55.008  Settlement of claims.

    (a) In accordance with the provisions of 4 CFR part 103, GSA 
officials listed in Sec. 105-55.006(c) may settle claims not exceeding 
$20,000 exclusive of interest, penalties and administrative charges

[[Page 191]]

by compromise at less than the principal of the claim if:
    (1) The debtor shows an inability to pay the full amount within a 
reasonable time;
    (2) The Government would be unable to enforce complete collection by 
any means within a reasonable time;
    (3) The amount of the claim does not justify the actual foreseable 
collection cost of the claim; or
    (4) A combination of the above reasons.
    (b) GSA may suspend or terminate collection action in accordance 
with the terms and procedures contained in 4 CFR part 104.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.009  Referral for litigation.

    Claims which cannot be settled under Sec. 105-55.008 or for which 
collection action cannot be suspended or terminated under 4 CFR parts 
103 and 104, will be referred to the General Accounting Office or the 
Department of Justice, whichever is appropriate, in accordance with the 
procedures in 4 CFR part 105.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.010  Disclosure to credit reporting agencies and referrals to collection agencies.

    The Comptroller and his designees may disclose debtor information to 
credit reporting agencies and may refer delinquent debts to debt 
collection agencies under the Federal Claims Collection Act, as amended, 
and other applicable authorities, provided, however, that no claim 
arising from the dishonor of any check or other negotiable instrument 
shall be disclosed to a credit reporting agency or referred to a 
collection agency without the concurrence of the appropriate Regional 
Inspector General for Investigations. Information will be disclosed to 
reporting agencies and referred to debt collection agencies in 
accordance with the terms and conditions of agreements entered into 
between GSA and the reporting and collection agencies. The terms and 
conditions of such agreements shall specify that all of the rights and 
protections afforded to the debtor under 31 U.S.C. 3711(f) have been 
fulfilled.


<R05>
Sec. 105-55.011  Credit report.

    In order to aid the agency in making appropriate determinations as 
to the collection and compromise of claims; the collection of interest, 
administrative charges, and penalty charges; the use of administrative 
offset; the use of other collection methods; and the likelihood of 
collecting the claim, the Comptroller or his designees may institute a 
credit investigation of the debtor immediately following receipt of 
knowledge of the claim.

signed the demand letter within 15 days of receipt of the written 
notice. The petition must state why the employee believes the agency's 
determination concerning the existence or amount of the debt is in 
error, and set forth objections to the involuntary repayment schedule. 
The timely filing of a petition will suspend the commencement of 
collection proceedings.
    (b) The employee's petition or statement must be signed by the 
employee.
    (c) Petitions for hearing made after the expiration of the 15 day 
period may be accepted if the employee can show that the delay was 
because of circumstances beyond his or her control or because of failure 
to receive notice of the time limit.
    (d) If the employee timely requests a pre-offset hearing or the 
timeliness is waived, the program official must:
    (1) Notify the employee whether the employee may elect an oral 
hearing or whether he or she may have only a ``paper hearing,'' i.e., a 
review on the written record (see 4 CFR 102.3(c)). In either case, the 
program official will arrange for a hearing official; and
    (2) The program official will provide the hearing official with a 
copy of all records on which the determination of the debt and any 
involuntary repayment schedule are based.
    (e) An employee who elects an oral hearing must notify the hearing 
official and the program official in writing within 5 days of receipt of 
the notice under paragraph (d)(1) of this section and within 20 days of 
receipt of the notice under (d)(1) the employee shall fully identify and 
explain with reasonable specificity all the facts, evidence and 
witnesses which the employee believes support his or her position.
    (f) The hearing official shall notify the program official and the 
employee of the date, time and location of the hearing.
    (g) If the employee later elects to have the hearing based only on 
the written submissions, notification must be given to the hearing 
official and the program official at least 3 calendar days before the 
date of the oral hearing. The hearing official may waive the 3-day 
requirement for good cause.
    (h) Failure of the employee to appear at the oral hearing can result 
in dismissal of the petition and affirmation of the agency's decision.


<R05>
Sec. 105-56.007  Pre-offset oral hearing.

    (a) Oral hearings are informal in nature. The agency, represented by 
a program official or a representative of the Office of General Counsel, 
and the employee, or his or her representative, shall explain their case 
in the form of an oral presentation with reference to the documentation 
submitted. The employee may testify on his or her own behalf, subject to 
cross examination. Other witnesses may be called to testify where the 
hearing official determines the testimony to be relevant and not 
redundant.
    (b) The hearing official shall--
    (1) Conduct a fair and impartial hearing; and
    (2) Preside over the course of the hearing, maintain decorum, and 
avoid delay in the disposition of the hearing.
    (c) The employee may represent himself or herself or may be 
represented by another person at the hearing. The employee may not be 
represented by a person who creates an actual or apparent conflict of 
interest.
    (d) Oral hearings are open to the public. However, the hearing 
official may close all or any portion of the hearing when doing so is in 
the best interests of the employee or the public.
    (e) Oral hearings may be conducted by conference call at the request 
of the employee or at the discretion of the hearing official.


<R05>
Sec. 105-56.008  Pre-offset ``paper hearing.''

    If a hearing is to be held only upon written submissions, the 
hearing official shall issue a decision based upon the record and 
responses submitted by both the agency and the employee.


<R05>
Sec. 105-56.009  Written decision.

    Within 60 days of filing of the employee's petition for a pre-offset 
hearing, the hearing official will issue a written decision setting 
forth: The facts supporting the nature and origin of the debt; the 
hearing official's analysis, findings and conclusions as to the 
employee's or agency's grounds, the amount and validity of the debt and 
the repayment schedule.

[[Page 195]]


<R05>
Sec. 105-56.010  Deductions.

    (a) When deductions may begin. If the employee filed a petition for 
hearing with the program official before the expiration of the period 
provided for in Sec. 105-56.006, then deductions will begin after the 
hearing official has provided the employee with a hearing, and the final 
written decision is in favor of the agency. It is the responsibility of 
the employee's program official to issue the pre-offset notice to the 
employee and to instruct the National Payroll Center to begin offset in 
accordance with the final written decision.
    (b) Retired or separated employees. If the employee retires, 
resigns, or is terminated before collection of the amount of the 
indebtedness is completed, the remaining indebtedness will be offset 
from any subsequent payments of any nature. If the debt cannot be 
satisfied from subsequent payments, then the debt must be collected 
according to the procedures for administrative offset pursuant to 31 
U.S.C. 3716.
    (c) Types of collection. A debt may be collected in one lump sum or 
in installments. Collection will be by lump-sum unless the employee is 
able to demonstrate to the program official who signed the demand letter 
that he or she is financially unable to pay in one lump-sum. In these 
cases, collection will be by installment deductions.
    (d) Methods of collection. If the debt cannot be collected in one 
lump sum, the debt will be collected by deductions at officially 
established pay intervals from an employee's current pay account, unless 
the employee and the program official agree to an alternative repayment 
schedule. The alternative arrangement must be in writing and signed by 
both the employee and the program official.
    (1) Installment deductions. Installment deductions will be made over 
the shortest period possible. The size and frequency of installment 
deductions will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and 
the employee's ability to pay. However, the amount deducted for any 
period will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the 
deduction is made, unless the employee has agreed in writing to the 
deduction of a greater amount. The installment payment will be 
sufficient in size and frequency to pay the debt over the shortest 
period possible and never to exceed three years. Installment payments of 
less than $100 per pay period will be accepted only in the most unusual 
circumstances.
    (2) Sources of deductions. GSA will make deductions only from basic 
pay, special pay, incentive pay, retired pay, retainer pay, or in the 
case of an employee not entitled to basic pay, other authorized pay.
    (e) Interest, penalties and administrative costs on debts under this 
part will be assessed according to the provisions of 4 CFR 102.13.


<R05>
Sec. 105-56.011  Non-waiver of rights.

    An employee's involuntary payment of all or any portion of a debt 
being collected under 5 U.S.C. 5514 shall not be construed as a waiver 
of any rights which the employee may have under 5 U.S.C. 5514 or any 
other provision of contract or law unless there are statutory or 
contractual provisions to the contrary.


<R05>
Sec. 105-56.012  Refunds.

    GSA will refund promptly to the appropriate individual amounts 
offset under these regulations when:
    (a) A debt is waived or otherwise found not owing the United States 
(unless expressly prohibited by statute or regulation); or
    (b) GSA is directed by an administrative or judicial order to refund 
amounts deducted from the employee's current pay.


<R05>
Sec. 105-56.013  Coordinating offset with another Federal agency.

    (a) When GSA is owed the debt. When GSA is owed a debt by an 
employee of another agency, the other agency shall not initiate the 
requested offset until GSA provides the agency with a written 
certification that the debtor owes GSA a debt and that GSA has complied 
with these regulations. This certification shall include the amount and 
basis of the debt and the due date of the payment.
    (b) When another agency is owed the debt. GSA may use salary offset 
against one of its employees who is indebted to another agency if 
requested to do so by that agency. Any such request must be

[[Page 196]]

accompanied by a certification from the requesting agency that the 
person owes the debt, the amount of the debt and that the employee has 
been given the procedural rights required by 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR 
part 550, subpart K.

<R05>
Sec. 105-57.001  Purpose.

    This part establishes procedures for the General Services 
Administration (GSA) to refer past due debts to the Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS) for offset against income tax refunds of taxpayers owing 
debts to GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 105-57.002  Applicability and scope.

    (a) This part implements 31 U.S.C. 3720A which authorizes the IRS to 
reduce a tax refund by the amount of a past due legally enforceable debt 
owed to the United States.
    (b) For purposes of this section, a past due legally enforceable 
debt referable to the IRS is a debt which is owed to the United States 
and:
    (1) Has been delinquent for at least three months but, except in the 
case of a judgment debt, has not been delinquent more than ten years at 
the time the offset is made;
    (2) With respect to which, GSA has given the taxpayer at least 60 
days, from the date of notification, to present evidence that all or 
part of the debt is not past due or legally enforceable, has considered 
such evidence, and has determined that the debt is past due and legally 
enforceable;
    (3) Cannot be currently collected pursuant to the salary offset 
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1);
    (4) Cannot be currently collected pursuant to the administrative 
offset provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3716;
    (5) Has been disclosed by GSA to a credit reporting agency, 
including a consumer reporting agency as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 
3711(f);
    (6) With respect to which, GSA has notified, or has made a 
reasonable attempt to notify, the taxpayer that the debt is past due 
and, unless repaid within 60 days thereafter, will be referred to the 
IRS for offset against any income tax refunds due the taxpayer;
    (7) Is at least $25.00;
    (8) All other requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3720A and the Department of 
the Treasury regulations relating to eligibility of a debt for tax 
refund offset, at 26 CFR 301.6402-6T, have been satisfied.


<R05>
Sec. 105-57.003  Administrative charges.

    All administrative charges incurred in connection with the referral 
of debts to the IRS will be added to the debt, thus increasing the 
amount of the offset.


<R05>
Sec. 105-57.004  Reasonable attempt to notify.

    In order to constitute a reasonable attempt to notify the debtor, 
GSA must have used a mailing address for the debtor obtained from the 
IRS pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 6103 (m)(2) or 
(m)(4), within one year preceding the attempt to notify the debtor.


<R05>
Sec. 105-57.005  Notice requirement before offset.

    The notification provided by GSA to the debtor will inform the 
debtor how to go about presenting evidence to GSA that all or part of 
the debt is either not past due or is not legally enforceable.


<R05>
Sec. 105-57.006  Consideration of evidence.

    Evidence submitted by the debtor will be considered by officials or 
employees of GSA. Any determination that an amount of such debt is past 
due and legally enforceable will be made by such officials or employees. 
Evidence that the debt is affected by a bankruptcy proceeding involving 
the debtor shall bar referral of the debt.

[[Page 197]]


<R05>
Sec. 105-57.007  Change in conditions after submission to IRS.

    If the amount of a debt is reduced after submission by GSA and 
offset by IRS, GSA will refund to the debtor any excess amount and will 
promptly notify IRS of the refund. GSA will also promptly notify the IRS 
if, after submission of a debt to the IRS for offset, GSA:
    (a) Determines that an error has been made with respect to the 
information submitted;
    (b) Receives a payment or credits a payment to an account submitted; 
or
    (c) Receives notification that the debtor has filed for bankruptcy 
under title 11 of the United States Code or has been adjudicated 
bankrupt and the debt has been discharged.

<R05>
Sec. 105-60.000  Scope of part.

    (a) This part sets forth policies and procedures of the General 
Services Administration (GSA) regarding public access to records 
documenting:
    (1) Agency organization, functions, decisionmaking channels, and 
rules and regulations of general applicability;

[[Page 198]]

    (2) Agency final opinions and orders, including policy statements 
and staff manuals;
    (3) Operational and other appropriate agency records; and
    (4) Agency proceedings.
    (b) This part also covers exemptions from disclosure of these 
records; procedures for the public to inspect or obtain copies of GSA 
records; and instructions to current and former GSA employees on the 
response to a subpoena or other legal demand for material or information 
received or generated in the performance of official duty or because of 
the person's official status.
    (c) Any policies and procedures in any GSA internal or external 
directive inconsistent with the policies and procedures set forth in 
this part are superseded to the extent of that inconsistency.


<R04>
                  Subpart 105-60.1--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.101  Purpose.

    This part 105-60 implements the provisions of the Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA), as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552. The regulations in 
this part also implement Executive Order 12600, Predisclosure 
Notification Procedures for Confidential Commercial Information, of June 
23, 1987 (3 CFR, 1987 Comp., p. 235). This part prescribes procedures by 
which the public may inspect and obtain copies of GSA records under the 
FOIA, including administrative procedures which must be exhausted before 
a requester invokes the jurisdiction of an appropriate United States 
District Court for GSA's failure to respond to a proper request within 
the statutory time limits, for a denial of agency records or challenge 
to the adequacy of a search, or for a denial of a fee waiver.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.102  Application.

    This part applies to all records and informational materials 
generated, maintained, and controlled by GSA that come within the scope 
of 5 U.S.C. 552.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.103  Policy.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.103-1  Availability of records.

    The policies of GSA with regard to the availability of records to 
the public are:
    (a) GSA records are available to the greatest extent possible in 
keeping with the spirit and intent of the FOIA. GSA will disclose 
information in any existing GSA record, with noted exceptions, 
regardless of the form or format of the record. GSA will provide the 
record in the form or format requested if the record is reproducible by 
the agency in that form or format without significant expenditure of 
resources. GSA will make reasonable efforts to maintain its records in 
forms or formats that are reproducible for purposes of this section.
    (b) The person making the request does not need to demonstrate an 
interest in the records or justify the request.
    (c) The FOIA does not give the public the right to demand that GSA 
compile a record that does not already exist. For example, FOIA does not 
require GSA to collect and compile information from multiple sources to 
create a new record. GSA may compile records or perform minor 
reprogramming to extract records from a database or system when doing so 
will not significantly interfere with the operation of the automated 
system in question or involve a significant expenditure of resources.
    (d) Similarly, FOIA does not require GSA to reconstruct records that 
have been destroyed in compliance with disposition schedules approved by 
the Archivist of the United States. However, GSA will not destroy 
records after a member of the public has requested access to them and 
will process the request even if destruction would otherwise be 
authorized.
    (e) If the record requested is not complete at the time of the 
request, GSA may, at its discretion, inform the requester that the 
complete record will be provided when it is available, with no 
additional request required, if the record is not exempt from 
disclosure.
    (f) Requests must be addressed to the office identified in Sec. 105-
60.402-1.

[[Page 199]]

    (g) Fees for locating and duplicating records are listed in 
Sec. 105-60,305-10.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.103-2  Applying exemptions.

    GSA may deny a request for a GSA record if it falls within an 
exemption under the FOIA outlined in subpart 105-60.5 of this part. 
Except when a record is classified or when disclosure would violate any 
Federal statute, the authority to withhold a record from disclosure is 
permissive rather than mandatory. GSA will not withhold a record unless 
there is a compelling reason to do so; i.e., disclosure will likely 
cause harm to a Governmental or private interest. In the absence of a 
compelling reason, GSA will disclose a record even if it otherwise is 
subject to exemption. GSA will cite the compelling reason(s) to 
requesters when any record is denied under FOIA.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.104  Records of other agencies.

    If GSA receives a request for access to records that are known to be 
the primary responsibility of another agency, GSA will refer the request 
to the agency concerned for appropriate action. For example, GSA will 
refer requests to the appropriate agency in cases in which GSA does not 
have sufficient knowledge of the action or matter that is the subject of 
the requested records to determine whether the records must be released 
or may be withheld under one of the exemptions listed in Subpart 105-
60.5 of this part. If GSA does not have the requested records, the 
agency will attempt to determine whether the requested records exist at 
another agency and, if possible, will forward the request to that 
agency. GSA will inform the requester that GSA has forwarded the request 
to another agency.


<R04>
Subpart 105-60.2--Publication of General Agency Information and Rules in 
                          the Federal Register


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.201  Published information and rules.

    In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1), GSA publishes in the Federal

regional offices and the established places at which, the employees from 
whom, and the methods whereby, the public may obtain information, make 
submittals or requests, or obtain decisions;
    (b) Statements of the general course and method by which its 
functions are channeled and determined, including the nature and 
requirements of all formal and informal procedures available;
    (c) Rules of procedure, descriptions of forms available or the 
places where forms may be obtained, and instructions on the scope and 
contents of all papers, reports, or examinations;
    (d) Substantive rules of general applicability adopted as authorized 
by law, and statements of general policy or interpretations of general 
applicability formulated and adopted by GSA; and
    (e) Each amendment, revision, or repeal of the materials described 
in this section.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.202  Published materials available for sale to the public.

    (a) Substantive rules of general applicability adopted by GSA as 
authorized by law that this agency publishes in the Federal Register and 
which are available for sale to the public by the Superintendent of 
Documents at pre-established prices are: The General Services 
Administration Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR Ch. 5), the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR Ch. 1), the Federal Property Management 
Regulations (41 CFR Ch. 101), and the Federal Travel Regulation (41 CFR 
Ch. 301-304).
    (b) GSA provides technical information, including manuals and 
handbooks, to other Federal entities, e.g., the National Technical 
Information Service, with separate statutory authority to make 
information available to the public at pre-established fees.
    (c) Requests for information available through the sources in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will be referred to those 
sources.

<R05>
Sec. 105-60.304   Public information handbook and index.

    GSA publishes a handbook for the public that identifies information 
regarding any matter described in Sec. 105-60.302. This handbook also 
lists published information available from GSA and describes the 
procedures the public may use to obtain information using the Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA). This handbook may be obtained without charge 
from any of the GSA FOIA offices listed in Sec. 105-60.303(a), or at the 
GSA Internet Homepage 
(http://www.gsa.gov/staff/c/ca/cai/links.htm).


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305  Fees.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-1  Definitions.

    For the purpose of this part:
    (a) A statute specifically providing for setting the level of fees 
for particular types of records (5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(vii)) means any 
statute that specifically requires a Government agency to set the level 
of fees for particular types of records, as opposed to a statute that 
generally discusses such fees. Fees are required by statute to:
    (1) Make Government information conveniently available to the public 
and to private sector organizations;
    (2) Ensure that groups and individuals pay the cost of publications 
and other services which are for their special use so that these costs 
are not borne by the general taxpaying public;
    (3) Operate an information dissemination activity on self-sustaining 
basis to the maximum extent possible; or
    (4) Return revenue to the Treasury for defraying, wholly or in part, 
appropriated funds used to pay the cost of disseminating Government 
information.
    (b) The term direct costs means those expenditures which GSA 
actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and in the case of 
commercial requesters, reviewing and redacting) documents to respond to 
a FOIA request. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the 
employee performing the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee 
plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits), and the cost of 
operating duplicating machinery. Overhead expenses such as costs of 
space, and heating or lighting the facility where the records are stored 
are not included in direct costs.
    (c) The term search includes all time spent looking for material 
that is responsive to a request, including line-by-line identification 
of material within documents. Searches will be performed in the most 
efficient and least expensive manner so as to minimize costs for both 
the agency and the requester. Line-by-line searches will not be 
undertaken when it would be more efficient to duplicate the entire 
document. Search for responsive material is not the same as review of a 
record to

[[Page 202]]

determine whether it is exempt from disclosure in whole or in part (see 
paragraph (e) of this section. Searches may be done manually or by 
computer using existing programming or new programming when this would 
not significantly interfere with the operation of the automated system 
in question.
    (d) The term duplication means the process of making a copy of a 
document in response to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of 
paper, microform audiovisual materials, or magnetic types or disks. To 
the extent practicable, GSA will provide a copy of the material in the 
form specified by the requester.
    (e) The term review means the process of examining documents located 
in response to a request to determine if any portion of that document is 
permitted to be withheld and processing any documents for disclosure. 
See Sec. 105-60.305-6.
    (f) The term commercial-use request means a request from or on 
behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers 
the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or person on 
whose behalf the request is made. GSA will determine whether a requester 
properly belongs in this category by determining how the requester will 
use the documents.
    (g) The term educational institution means a preschool, a public or 
private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate 
higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an 
institution of professional education, or an institution of vocational 
education which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.
    (h) The term noncommercial scientific institution means an 
institution that is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis as that term 
is used in paragraph (f) of this section and which is operated solely 
for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which 
are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.
    (i) The term representative of the news media means any person 
actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to 
publish or broadcast news to the public. The term news means information 
that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the 
public. Examples of news media include television or radio stations 
broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but 
only in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of 
``news'') who make their products available for purchase or subscription 
by the general public. ``Freelance'' journalists will be regarded as 
working for a news organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis 
for expecting publication through that organization even though they are 
not actually employed by it.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-2  Scope of this subpart.

    This subpart sets forth policies and procedures to be followed in 
the assessment and collection of fees from a requester for the search, 
review, and reproduction of GSA records.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-3  GSA records available without charge.

    GSA records available to the public are displayed in the Business 
Service Center for each GSA region. The address and phone number of the 
Business Service Centers are listed in Sec. 105-60.303. Certain material 
related to bids (excluding construction plans and specifications) and 
any material displayed are available without charge upon request.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-4  GSA records available at a fee.

    (a) GSA will make a record not subject to exemption available at a 
time and place mutually agreed upon by GSA and the requester at fees 
shown in Sec. 105-60.305-10. Waivers of these fees are available under 
the conditions described in Sec. 105-60.305-13. GSA will agree to:
    (1) Show the originals to the requester;
    (2) Make one copy available at a fee; or
    (3) A combination of these alternatives.
    (b) GSA will make copies of voluminous records as quickly as 
possible. GSA may, in its discretion, make a reasonable number of 
additional copies for a fee when commercial reproduction services are 
not available to the requester.

[[Page 203]]


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-5  Searches.

    (a) GSA may charge for the time spent in the following activities in 
determining ``search time'' subject to applicable fees as provided in 
Sec. 105-60.305-10:
    (1) Time spent in trying to locate GSA records which come within the 
scope of the request;
    (2) Time spent in either transporting a necessary agency searcher to 
a place of record storage, or in transporting records to the locations 
of a necessary agency searcher; and
    (3) Direct costs of the use of computer time to locate and extract 
requested records.
    (b) GSA will not charge for the time spent in monitoring a 
requester's inspection of disclosed agency records.
    (c) GSA may assess fees for search time even if the search proves 
unsuccessful or if the records located are exempt from disclosure.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-6  Reviews.

    (a) GSA will charge only commercial-use requesters for review time.
    (b) GSA will charge for the time spent in the following activities 
in determining ``review time'' subject to applicable fees as provided in 
Sec. 105-60.305-10:
    (1) Time spent in examining a requested record to determine whether 
any or all of the record is exempt from disclosure, including time spent 
consulting with submitters of requested information; and
    (2) Time spent in deleting exempt matter being withheld from records 
otherwise made available.
    (c) GSA will not charge for:
    (1) Time spent in resolving issues of law or policy regarding the 
application of exemptions; or
    (2) Review at the administrative appeal level of an exemption 
already applied. However, records or portions of records withheld in 
full under an exemption which is subsequently determined not to apply 
may be reviewed again to determine the applicability of other exemptions 
not previously considered. GSA will charge for such subsequent review.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-7  Assurance of payment.

    If fees for search, review, and reproduction will exceed $25 but 
will be less than $250, the requester must provide written assurance of 
payment before GSA will process the request. If this assurance is not 
included in the initial request, GSA will notify the requester that 
assurance of payment is required before the request is processed. GSA 
will offer requesters an opportunity to modify the request to reduce the 
fee.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-8  Prepayment of fees.

    (a) Fees over $250. GSA will require prepayment of fees for search, 
review, and reproduction which are likely to exceed $250. When the 
anticipated total fee exceeds $250, the requester will receive notice to 
prepay and at the same time will be given an opportunity to modify his 
or her request to reduce the fee. When fees will exceed $250, GSA will 
notify the requester that it will not start processing a request until 
payment is received.
    (b) Delinquent payments. As noted in Sec. 105-6.305-12(d), 
requesters who are delinquent in paying for previous requests will be 
required to repay the old debt and to prepay for any subsequent request. 
GSA will inform the requester that it will process no additional 
requests until all fees are paid.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-9  Form of payment.

    Requesters should pay fees by check or money order made out to the 
General Services Administration and addressed to the official named by 
GSA in its correspondence. Payment may also be made by means of 
Mastercard or Visa. For information concerning payment by credit cards, 
call 816-926-7551.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-10  Fee schedule.

    (a) When GSA is aware that documents responsive to a request are 
maintained for distribution by an agency operating a statutory fee based 
program, GSA will inform the requester of the procedures for obtaining 
records from those sources.
    (b) GSA will consider only the following costs in fees charged to 
requesters of GSA records:
    (1) Review and search fees.


[[Page 204]]


    Manual searches by clerical staff: $13 per hour or fraction of an 
hour.
    Manual searches and reviews by professional staff in cases in which 
clerical staff would be unable to locate the requested records: $29 per 
hour or fraction of an hour.
    Computer searches: Direct cost to GSA.
    Transportation or special handling of records: Direct cost to GSA.

    (2) Reproduction fees.

    Pages no larger than 8\1/2\ by 14 inches, when reproduced by routine 
electrostatic copying: 10 cents per page.
    Pages over 8\1/2\ by 14 inches: Direct cost of reproduction to GSA.
    Pages requiring reduction, enlargement, or other special services: 
Direct cost of reproduction to GSA.
    Reproduction by other than routine electrostatic copying: Direct 
cost of reproduction to GSA.

    (c) Any fees not provided for under paragraph (b) of this section, 
shall be calculated as direct costs, in accordance with Sec. 105-60.305-
1(b).
    (d) GSA will assess fees based on the category of the requester as 
defined in Sec. 105-60.305-1(f)-(1); i.e., commercial-use, educational 
and noncommercial scientific institutions, news media, and all other. 
The fees listed in paragraph (b) of this section apply with the 
following exceptions:
    (1) GSA will not charge the requester if the fee is $25 or less as 
the cost of collection is greater than the fee.
    (2) Educational and noncommercial scientific institutions and the 
news media will be charged for the cost of reproduction alone. These 
requesters are entitled to the first 100 pages (paper copies) of 
duplication at no cost. The following are examples of how these fees are 
calculated:
    (i) A request that results in 150 pages of material. No fee would be 
assessed for duplication of 150 pages. The reason is that these 
requesters are entitled to the first 100 pages at no charge. The charge 
for the remaining 50 pages would be $5.00. This amount would not be 
billed under the preceding section.
    (ii) A request that results in 450 pages of material. The requester 
in this case would be charged $35.00. The reason is that the requester 
is entitled to the first 100 pages at no charge. The charge for the 
remaining 350 pages would be $35.
    (3) Noncommercial requesters who are not included under paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section will be entitled to the first 100 pages (page 
copies) of duplication at not cost and two hours of search without 
charge. The term search time generally refers to manual search. To apply 
this term to searches made by computer, GSA will determine the hourly 
cost of operating the central processing unit and the operator's hourly 
salary plus 16 percent. When the cost of search (including the operator 
time and the cost of operating the computer to process a request) 
reaches the equivalent dollar amount of two hours of the salary of the 
person performing a manual search, i.e., the operator, GSA will begin 
assessing charges for computer search.
    (4) GSA will charge commercial-use requesters fees which recover the 
full direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release, and 
duplicating the records sought. Commercial-use requesters are not 
entitled to two hours of free search time.
    (e) Determining category of requester. GSA may ask any requester to 
provide additional information at any time to determine what fee 
category he or she falls under.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-11  Fees for authenticated and attested copies.

    The fees set forth in Sec. 105-60.305-10 apply to requests for 
authenticated and attested copies of GSA records.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-12  Administrative actions to improve assessment and collection of fees.

    (a) Charging interest. GSA may charge requesters who fail to pay 
fees interest on the amount billed starting on the 31st day following 
the day on which the billing was sent. Interest will be at the rate 
prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717.
    (b) Effect of the Debt Collection Act of 1982. GSA will take any 
action authorized by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 
Stat. 1749), including disclosure to consumer reporting agencies, use of 
collection agencies, and assessment of penalties and administrative 
costs, where appropriate, to encourage payment.
    (c) Aggregating requests. When GSA reasonably believes that a 
requester, or

[[Page 205]]

group of requesters acting in concert, is attempting to break down a 
request into a series of requests related to the same subject for the 
purpose of evading the assessment of fees, GSA will combine any such 
requests and charge accordingly, including fees for previous requests 
where charges were not assessed. GSA will presume that multiple requests 
of this type within a 30-day period are made to avoid fees.
    (d) Advanced payments. Whenever a requester is delinquent in paying 
the fee for a previous request (i.e., within 30 days of the date of the 
billing), GSA will require the requester to pay the full amount owed 
plus any applicable interest penalties and administrative costs as 
provided in paragraph (a) of this section or to demonstrate that he or 
she has, in fact, paid the fee. In such cases, GSA will also require 
advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the 
agency begins to process a new request or a pending request from that 
requester. When advance payment is required under this selection, the 
administrative time limits in subsection (a)(6) of the FOIA (i.e., 10 
working days from receipt of appeals from initial denial plus 
permissible time extensions) will begin only after GSA has received the 
fee payments described in Sec. 105-60.305-8.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.305-13  Waiver of fee.

    (a) Any request for a waiver or the reduction of a fee should be 
included in the initial letter requesting access to GSA records under 
Sec. 105-60.402-1. The waiver request should explain how disclosure of 
the information would contribute significantly to public's understanding 
of the operations or activities of the Government and would not be 
primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. In responding to 
a requester, GSA will consider the following factors:
    (1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns ``the 
operations or activities of the Government.'' The subject matter of the 
requested records must specifically concern identifiable operations or 
activities of the Federal Government. The connection between the records 
and the operations or activities must be direct and clear, not remote or 
attenuated.
    (2) Whether the disclosure is ``likely to contribute'' to an 
understanding of Government operations or activities. In this 
connection, GSA will consider whether the requested information is 
already in the public domain. If it is, then disclosure of the 
information would not be likely to contribute to an understanding of 
Government operations or activities, as nothing new would be added to 
the public record.
    (3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute 
to ``public's understanding.'' The focus here must be on the 
contribution to public's understanding rather than personal benefit to 
be derived by the requester. For purposes of this analysis, the identity 
and qualifications of the requester should be considered to determine 
whether the requester is in a position to contribute to public's 
understanding through the requested disclosure.
    (4) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be 
furthered by the requested disclosure; and if so: whether the magnitude 
of the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently 
large, in comparison with the public's interest in disclosure, that 
disclosure is ``primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.''
    (b) GSA will ask the requester to furnish additional information if 
the initial request is insufficient to evaluate the merits of the 
request. GSA will not start processing a request until the fee waiver 
issue has been resolved unless the requester has provided written 
assurance of payment in full if the fee waiver is denied by the agency.


<R04>
                   Subpart 105-60.4--Described Records


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.401  General.

    (a) Except for records made available in accordance with subparts 
105-60.2 and 105-60.3 of this part, GSA will make records available to a 
requester promptly when the request reasonably describes the records 
unless GSA invokes an exemption in accordance with subpart 105-60.5 of 
this part. Although the burden of reasonable description of the records 
rests with the requester,

[[Page 206]]

whenever practical GSA will assist requesters to describe records more 
specifically.
    (b) Whenever a request does not reasonably describe the records 
requested, GSA may contact the requester to seek a more specific 
description. The 20-workday time limit set forth in Sec. 105-60.402-2 
will not start until the official identified in Sec. 105-60.402-1 or 
other responding official receives a request reasonably describing the 
records.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.402  Procedures for making records available.

    This subpart sets forth initial procedures for making records 
available when they are requested, including administrative procedures 
to be exhausted prior to seeking judicial review by an appropriate 
United States District Court.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.402-1  Submission of requests.

    For records located in the GSA Central Office, the requester must 
submit a request in writing to the GSA FOIA Officer, General Services 
Administration (CAI), Washington, DC 20405. Requesters may FAX requests 
to (202) 501-2727, or submit a request by electronic mail to 
gsa.foi@gsa.gov. For records located in the Office of Inspector General, 
the requester must submit a request to the FOIA Officer, Office of 
Inspector General, General Services Administration, 1800 F Street NW., 
Room 5324, Washington, DC 20405. For records located in the GSA regional 
offices, the requester must submit a request to the FOIA Officer for the 
relevant region, at the address listed in Sec. 105-60.303(a). Requests 
should include the words ``Freedom of Information Act Request'' 
prominently marked on both the face of the request letter and the 
envelope. The 20-workday time limit for agency decisions set forth in 
Sec. 105-60.402-2 begins with receipt of a request in the office of the 
official identified in this section, unless the provisions under 
Secs. 105-60.305-8 and 105-60.305-12(d) apply. Failure to include the 
words ``Freedom of Information Act Request'' or to submit a request to 
the official identified in this section will result in processing 
delays. A requester with questions concerning a FOIA request should 
contact the GSA FOIA Office, General Services Administration (CAI), 18th 
and F Streets, NW., Washington, DC 20405, (202) 501-2262.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.402-2  Response to initial requests.

    (a) GSA will respond to an initial FOIA request that reasonably 
describes requested records, including a fee waiver request, within 20 
workdays (that is, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) 
after receipt of a request by the office of the appropriate official 
specified in Sec. 105-60.402-1. This letter will provide the agency's 
decision with respect to disclosure or nondisclosure of the requested 
records, or, if appropriate, a decision on a request for a fee waiver. 
If the records to be disclosed are not provided with the initial letter, 
the records will be sent as soon as possible thereafter.
    (b) In unusual circumstances, as described in Sec. 105-60.404, GSA 
will inform the requester of the agency's need to take an extension of 
time, not to exceed an additional 10 workdays. This notice will afford 
requesters an opportunity to limit the scope of the request so that it 
may be processed within prescribed time limits or an opportunity to 
arrange an alternative time frame for processing the request or a 
modified request. Such mutually agreed time frames will supersede the 10 
day limit for extensions.
    (c) GSA will consider requests for expedited processing from 
requesters who submit a statement describing a compelling need and 
certifying that this need is true and correct to the best of such 
person's knowledge and belief. A compelling need means:
    (1) Failure to obtain the records on an expedited basis could 
reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or 
physical safety of an individual; or
    (2) The information is urgently needed by an individual primarily 
engaged in disseminating information in order to inform the public 
concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity. An individual 
primarily engaged in dissmeninating information means a person whose 
primary activity involves publishing or otherwise disseminating 
information to the public. ``Urgently needed'' information has a 
particular

[[Page 207]]

value that will be lost if not disseminated quickly, such as a breaking 
news story or general public interest. Information of historical 
interest only, or information sought for litigation or commercial 
activities would not qualify, nor would a news media publication or 
broadcast deadline unrelated to the newsbreaking nature of the 
information.
    (d) GSA will decide whether to grant expedited processing within 
five working days of receipt of the request. If the request is granted, 
GSA will process the request ahead of non-expedited requests, as soon as 
practicable. If the request is not granted, GSA will give expeditious 
consideration to administrative appeals of this denial.
    (e) GSA may, at its discretion, establish three processing queues 
based on whether any requests have been granted expedited status and on 
the difficulty and complexity of preparing a response. Within each 
queue, responses will be prepared on a ``first in, first out'' basis. 
One queue will be made up of expedited requests; the second, of simple 
responses that clearly can be prepared without requesting an extension 
of time; the third, of responses that will require an extension of time.

Sec. 105-60.403  Appeal within GSA.

    (a) A requester who receives a denial of a request, in whole or in 
part, a denial of a request for expedited processing or of a fee waiver 
request may appeal that decision within GSA. A requester may also appeal 
the adequacy of the search if GSA determines that it has searched for 
but has not requested records. The requester must send the appeal to the 
GSA FOIA Officer, General Services Administration (CAI), Washington, DC 
20405, regardless of whether the denial being appealed was made in the 
Central Office or in a regional office. For denials which originate in 
the Office of Inspector General, the requester must send the appeal to 
the Inspector General, General Services Administration, 1800 F Street 
NW., Washington, DC 20405.
    (b) The GSA FOIA Officer must receive an appeal no later than 120 
calendar days after receipt by the requester of the initial denial of 
access or fee waiver.
    (c) An appeal must be in writing and include a brief statement of 
the reasons he or she thinks GSA should release the records or provide 
expedited processing and enclose copies of the initial request and 
denial. The appeal letter must include the words ``Freedom of 
Information Act Appeal'' on both the face of the appeal letter and on 
the envelope. Failure to follow these procedures will delay processing 
of the appeal. GSA has 20 workdays after receipt of a proper appeal of 
denial of records to issue a determination with respect to the appeal. 
The 20-workday time limit shall not begin until the GSA FOIA Officer 
receives the appeal. As noted in Sec. 105-60.404, the GSA FOIA Officer 
may extend this time limit in unusual circumstances. GSA will process 
appeals of denials of expedited processing as soon as possible after 
receiving them.
    (d) A requester who receives a denial of an appeal, or who has not 
received a response to an appeal or initial request within the statutory 
time frame may seek judicial review in the United States District Court 
in the district in which the requester resides or has a principal place 
of business, or where the records are situated, or in the United States 
District Court for the District of Columbia.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.404  Extension of time limits.

    (a) In unusual circumstances, the GSA FOIA Officer or the regional 
FOIA Officer may extend the time limits prescribed in Secs. 105-60.402 
and 105-60.403. For purposes of this section, the term unusual 
circumstances means:
    (1) The need to search for an collect the requested records from 
field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the 
office processing the request;
    (2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a 
voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are described 
in a single request;
    (3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all 
practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in 
the determination of the request or among two or

[[Page 208]]

more components of GSA having substantial subject-matter interest 
therein; or
    (4) The need to consult with the submitter of the requested 
information.
    (b) If necessary, GSA may take more than one extension of time. 
However, the total extension of time to respond to any single request 
shall not exceed 10 workdays. The extension may be divided between the 
initial and appeal stages or within a single stage. GSA will provide 
written notice to the requester of any extension of time limits.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.405  Processing requests for confidential commercial information.

    (a) General. The following additional procedures apply when 
processing requests for confidential commercial information.
    (b) Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following 
definitions apply:
    (1) Confidential commercial information means records provided to 
the Government by a submitter that contain material arguably exempt from 
release under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), because disclosure could reasonably be 
expected to cause substantial competitive harm.
    (2) Submitter means a person or entity which provides to the 
Government information which may constitute confidential commercial 
information. The term submitter includes, but is not limited to, 
individuals, partnerships, corporations, State governments, and foreign 
governments.
    (c) Designating confidential commercial information. Since January 
1, 1988, submitters have been required to designate confidential 
commercial information as such when it is submitted to GSA or at a 
reasonable time thereafter. For information submitted in connection with 
negotiated procurements, the requirements of Federal Acquisition 
Regulation 48 CFR 15.407(c)(8) and 52.215-12 also apply.
    (d) Procedural requirements--consultation with the submitter.(1) If 
GSA receives a FOIA request for potentially confidential commercial 
information, it will notify the submitter immediately by telephone and 
invite an opinion whether disclosure will or will not cause substantial 
competitive harm.
    (2) GSA will follow up the telephonic notice promptly in writing 
before releasing any records unless paragraph (f) of this section 
applies.
    (3) If the submitter indicates an objection to disclosure GSA will 
give the submitter seven workdays from receipt of the letter to provide 
GSA with a detailed written explanation of how disclosure of any 
specified portion of the records would be competitively harmful.
    (4) If the submitter verbally states that there is no objection to 
disclosure, GSA will confirm this fact in writing before disclosing any 
records.
    (5) At the same time GSA notifies the submitter, it will also advise 
the requester that there will be a delay in responding to the request 
due to the need to consult with the submitter.
    (6) GSA will review the reasons for nondisclosure before 
independently deciding whether the information must be released or 
should be withheld. If GSA decides to release the requested information, 
it will provide the submitter with a written statement explaining why 
his or her objections are not sustained. The letter to the submitter 
will contain a copy of the material to be disclosed or will offer the 
submitter an opportunity to review the material in none of GSA's 
offices. If GSA decides not to release the material, it will notify the 
submitter orally or in writing.
    (7) If GSA determines to disclose information over a submitter's 
objections, it will inform the submitter the GSA will delay disclosure 
for 5 workdays from the estimated date the submitter receives GSA's 
decision before it releases the information. The decision letter to the 
requester shall state that GSA will delay disclosure of material it has 
determined to disclose to allow for the notification of the submitter.
    (e) When notice is required. (1) For confidential commercial 
information submitted prior to January 1, 1988, GSA will notify a 
submitter whenever it receives a FOIA request for such information:
    (i) If the records are less than 10 years old and the information 
has been

[[Page 209]]

designated by the submitter as confidential commercial information; or
    (ii) If GSA has reason to believe that disclosure of the information 
could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.
    (2) For confidential commercial information submitted on or after 
January 1, 1988, GSA will notify a submitter whenever it determines that 
the agency may be required to disclose records:
    (i) That the submitter has previously designated as privileged or 
confidential; or
    (ii) That GSA believes could reasonably be expected to cause 
substantial competitive harm if disclosed.
    (3) GSA will provide notice to a submitter for a period of up to 10 
years after the date of submission.
    (f) When notice is not required. The notice requirements of this 
section will not apply if:
    (1) GSA determines that the information should not be disclosed;
    (2) The information has been published or has been officially made 
available to the public;
    (3) Disclosure of the information is required by law other than the 
FOIA;
    (4) Disclosure is required by an agency rule that
    (i) Was adopted pursuant to notice and public comment;
    (ii) specifies narrow classes of records submitted to the agency 
that are to be released under FOIA; and
    (iii) provides in exceptional circumstances for notice when the 
submitter provides written justification, at the time the information is 
submitted for a reasonable time thereafter, that disclosure of the 
information could reasonably be expected to cause substantial 
competitive harm;
    (5) The information is not designated by the submitter as exempt 
from disclosure under paragraph (c) of this section, unless GSA has 
substantial reason to believe that disclosure of the information would 
be competitively harmful; or
    (6) The designation made by the submitter in accordance with 
paragraph (c) of this section appears obviously frivolous; except that, 
in such cases, the agency must provide the submitter with written notice 
of any final administrative decision five workdays prior to disclosing 
the information.
    (g) Lawsuits. If a FOIA requester sues the agency to compel 
disclosure of confidential commercial information, GSA will notify the 
submitter as soon as possible. If the submitter sues GSA to enjoin 
disclosure of the records, GSA will notify the requester.


<R04>
                      Subpart 105-60.5--Exemptions


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.501  Categories of records exempt from disclosure under the FOIA.

    (a) 5 U.S.C. 552(b) provides that the requirements of the FOIA do 
not apply to matters that are:
    (1) Specifically authorized under the criteria established by an 
executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or 
foreign policy and are in fact properly classified pursuant to such 
executive order;
    (2) Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of 
an agency;
    (3) Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than 
section 552b of this title), provided that such statute
    (i) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a 
manner as to leave no discretion on the issue; or
    (ii) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to 
particular types of matters to be withheld;
    (4) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained 
from a person and privileged or confidential;
    (5) Interagency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would 
not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation 
with the agency;
    (6) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of 
which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy;
    (7) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, 
but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement 
records or information
    (i) could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement 
proceedings;

[[Page 210]]

    (ii) would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an 
impartial adjudication;
    (iii) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted 
invasion of personal privacy;
    (iv) could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a 
confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or 
authority or any private institution which furnished information on a 
confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled 
by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal 
investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national security 
intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential 
source;
    (v) would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement 
investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law 
enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could 
reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or
    (vi) could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical 
safety of any individual;
    (8) Contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition 
reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency 
responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; 
or
    (9) Geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, 
concerning wells.
    (b) GSA will provide any reasonably segregable portion of a record 
to a requester after deletion of the portions that are exempt under this 
section. If GSA must delete information from a record before disclosing 
it, this information, and the reasons for withholding it, will be 
clearly described in the cover letter to the requester or in an 
attachment. Unless indicating the extent of the deletion would harm an 
interest protected by an exemption, the amount of deleted information 
shall be indicated on the released portion of paper records by use of 
brackets or darkened areas indicating removal of information. In the 
case of electronic deletion, the amount of redacted information shall be 
indicated at the place in the record where such deletion was made, 
unless including the indication would harm an interest protected by the 
exemption under which the exemption was made.
    (c) GSA will invoke no exemption under this section to deny access 
to records that would be available pursuant to a request made under the 
Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) and implementing regulations, 41 CFR 
part 105-64, or if disclosure would cause no demonstrable harm to any 
governmental or private interest.
    (d) Pursuant to National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 
1997, Pub. L. No. 104-201, section 821, 110 Stat. 2422, GSA will invoke 
Exemption 3 to deny access to any proposal submitted by a vendor in 
response to the requirements of a solicitation for a competitive 
proposal unless the proposal is set forth or incorporated by reference 
in a contract entered into between the agency and the contractor that 
submitted the proposal.
    (e) Whenever a request is made which involves access to records 
described in Sec. 105-60.501(a)(7)(i) and the investigation or 
proceeding involves a possible violation of criminal law, and there is 
reason to believe that the subject of the investigation or proceeding is 
not aware of it, and disclosure of the existence of the records could 
reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings, the 
agency may, during only such time as that circumstance continues, treat 
the records as not subject to the requirements of this section.
    (f) Whenever informant records maintained by a criminal law 
enforcement agency under an informant's name or personal identifier are 
requested by a third party according to the informant's name or personal 
identifier, the agency may treat the records as not subject to the 
requirements of this section unless the informant's status as an 
informant has been officially confirmed.
    (g) Whenever a request is made that involves access to records 
maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation pertaining to foreign 
intelligence or counterintelligence, or international terrorism, and the 
existence of the

[[Page 211]]

records is classified information as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section, the Bureau may, as long as the existence of the records 
remains classified information, treat the records are not subject to the 
requirements of this section.

GSA employee shall be limited to the scope of the demand as summarized 
in such statement or affidavit.
    (2) Production of material. When information other than oral 
testimony is sought by a demand, the Appropriate Authority shall require 
the party seeking production or the party's attorney to provide a 
detailed summary, by affidavit or other statement, of the information

employees the length of time away from duty anticipated, and 
identification of documents to be used in each deposition or other 
testimony, where appropriate.
    (d) The Appropriate Authority will notify the current or former 
employee, the appropriate supervisor, and such other persons as 
circumstances may warrant, whether disclosure or production is 
authorized, and of any conditions or limitations to disclosure or 
production.
    (e) Factors to be considered by the Appropriate Authority in 
responding to demands:

[[Page 213]]

    (1) Whether disclosure or production is appropriate under rules of 
procedure governing the proceeding out of which the demand arose;
    (2) The relevance of the testimony or documents to the proceedings;
    (3) The impact of the relevant substantive law concerning applicable 
privileges recognized by statute, common law, judicial interpretation or 
similar authority;
    (4) The information provided by the issuer of the demand in response 
to requests by the Appropriate Authority pursuant to paragraphs (b) and

personal appearance by GSA employees;
    (6) The impact on pending or potential litigation involving GSA or 
the United States as a party;
    (7) In consultation with the head of the GSA organizational 
component affected, the burden on GSA which disclosure or production 
would entail; and
    (8) Any additional factors unique to a particular demand or 
proceeding.
    (f) The Appropriate Authority shall not approve a disclosure or 
production which would:
    (1) Violate a statute or a specific regulation;
    (2) Reveal classified information, unless appropriately declassified 
by the originating agency;
    (3) Reveal a confidential source or informant, unless the 
investigative agency and the source or informant consent;
    (4) Reveal records or information compiled for law enforcement 
purposes which would interfere with enforcement proceedings or disclose 
investigative techniques and procedures the effectiveness of which would 
be impaired;
    (5) Reveal trade secrets or commercial or financial information 
which is privileged or confidential without prior consultation with the 
person from whom it was obtained; or
    (6) Be contrary to a recognized privilege.
    (g) The Appropriate Authority's determination, including any reasons 
for denial or limitations on disclosure or production, shall be made as 
expeditiously as possible and shall be communicated in writing to the 
issuer of the demand and appropriate current or former GSA employee(s). 
In proceedings in which GSA, its current or former employees, or the 
United States are represented by DOJ, the determination shall be 
coordinated with DOJ which may respond to the issuer of the subpoenas or 
demand in lieu of the Appropriate Authority.


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.606  Procedure where response to demand is required prior to receiving instructions.

    (a) If a response to a demand is required before the Appropriate 
Authority's decision is issued, a GSA attorney designated by the 
Appropriate Authority for the purpose shall appear with the employee or 
former employee upon whom the demand has been made, and shall furnish 
the judicial or other authority with a copy of the instructions 
contained in this subpart. The attorney shall inform the court or other 
authority that the demand has been or is being referred for the prompt 
consideration by the Appropriate Authority. The attorney shall 
respectfully request the judicial or administrative authority to stay 
the demand pending receipt of the requested instructions.
    (b) The designated GSA attorney shall coordinate GSA's response with 
DOJ's Civil Division or the relevant Office of the United States 
Attorney and may request that a DOJ or Assistant United States Attorney 
appear with the employee in addition to or in lieu of a designated GSA 
attorney.
    (c) If an immediate demand for production or disclosure is made in 
circumstances which preclude the appearance of a GSA or DOJ attorney on 
the behalf of the employee or the former employee, the employee or 
former employee shall respectfully make a request to the demanding 
authority for sufficient time to obtain advice of counsel.

Sec. 105-60.607  Procedure in the event of an adverse ruling.

    If the court or other authority declines to stay the effect of the 
demand

[[Page 214]]

in response to a request made in accordance with Sec. 105-60.606 pending 
receipt of instructions, or if the court or other authority rules that 
the demand must be complied with irrespective of instructions by the 
Appropriate Authority not to produce the material or disclose the 
information sought, the employee or former employee upon whom the demand 
has been made shall respectfully decline to comply, citing these 
instructions and the decision of the United States Supreme Court in 
United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951).


<R05>
Sec. 105-60.608  Fees, expenses, and costs.

    (a) In consultation with the Appropriate Authority, a current 
employee who appears as a witness pursuant to a demand shall ensure that 
he or she receives all fees and expenses, including travel expenses, to 
which witnesses are entitled pursuant to rules applicable to the 
judicial or administrative proceedings out of which the demand arose.
    (b) Witness fees and reimbursement for expenses received by a GSA 
employee shall be disposed of in accordance with rules applicable to 
Federal employees in effect at the time.
    (c) Reimbursement to the GSA for costs associated with producing 
material pursuant to a demand shall be determined in accordance with 
rules applicable to the proceedings out of which the demand arose.

                 Subpart 105-62.1--Classified Materials


<R05>
Sec. 105-62.101  Security classification categories.

    As set forth in Executive Order 12065, official information or 
material which requires protection against unauthorized disclosure in 
the interests of the national defense or foreign relations of the United 
States (hereinafter collectively termed ``national security'') shall be 
classified in one of three categories: Namely, Top Secret, Secret, or 
Confidential, depending on its degree of significance to the national 
security. No other categories shall be used to identify official 
information or material as requiring protection in the interests of 
national security except as otherwise expressly provided by statute. The 
three classification categories are defined as follows:
    (a) Top Secret. Top Secret refers to that national security 
information which requires the highest degree of protection, and shall 
be applied only to such information as the unauthorized disclosure of 
which could reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage 
to the national security. Examples of exceptionally grave damage include 
armed hostilities against the United States or its allies, disruption of 
foreign relations vitally affecting the national security, intelligence 
sources and methods, and the compromise of vital national defense plans 
or complex cryptologic and communications systems. This classification

[[Page 215]]

shall be used with the utmost restraint.
    (b) Secret. Secret refers to that national security information or 
material which requires a substantial degree of protection, and shall be 
applied only to such information as the unauthorized disclosure of which 
could reasonably be expected to cause serious damage to the national 
security. Examples of serious damage include disruption of foreign 
relations significantly affecting the national security, significant 
impairment of a program or policy directly related to the national 
security, and revelation of significant military plans or intelligence 
operations. This classification shall be used sparingly.
    (c) Confidential. Confidential refers to other national security 
information which requires protection, and shall be applied only to such 
information as the unauthorized disclosure of which could reasonably be 
expected to cause identifiable damage to the national security.


<R05>
Sec. 105-62.102  Authority to originally classify.

    (a) Top secret, secret, and confidential. The authority to 
originally classify information as Top Secret, Secret, or Confidential 
may be exercised only by the Administrator and is delegable only to the 
Director, Information Security Oversight Office.
    (b) Limitations on delegation of classification authority. 
Delegations of original classification authority are limited to the 
minimum number absolutely required for efficient administration. 
Delegated original classification authority may not be redelegated.

<R05>
Sec. 105-62.103  Access to GSA-originated materials.

    Classified information shall not be disseminated outside the 
executive branch of the Government without the express permission of the 
GSA Security Officer except as otherwise provided in this Sec. 105-
62.103.
    (a) Access by historical researchers. Persons outside the executive 
branch who are engaged in historical research projects, may be 
authorized access to classified information or material, provided that:
    (1) A written determination is made by the Administrator of General 
Services that such access is clearly consistent with the interests of 
national security.
    (2) Access is limited to that information over which GSA has 
classification jurisdiction.
    (3) The material requested is reasonably accessible and can be 
located with a reasonable amount of effort.
    (4) The person agrees to safeguard the information and to authorize 
a review of his or her notes and manuscript for determination that no 
classified information is contained therein by signing a statement 
entitled ``Conditions Governing Access to Official Records for 
Historical Research Purposes.''
    (5) An authorization for access shall be valid for a period of 2 
years from the date of issuance and may be renewed under the provisions 
of this Sec. 105-62.103(a).
    (b) Access by former Presidential appointees. Persons who previously 
occupied policymaking positions to which they were appointed by the 
President may not remove classified information or material upon 
departure from office as all such material must remain under the 
security control of the U.S. Government. Such persons may be authorized 
access to classified information or material which they originated, 
received, reviewed, signed, or which was addressed to them while in 
public office, provided that the GSA element having classification 
jurisdiction for such information or material makes a written 
determination that access is consistent with the interests of national 
security, approval is granted by the GSA Security Officer, and the 
individual seeking access agrees:
    (1) To safeguard the information,
    (2) To authorize a review of his or her notes for determination that 
no classified information is contained therein, and
    (3) To ensure that no classified information will be further 
disseminated or published.
    (c) Access during judicial proceedings. Classified information will 
not normally be released in the course of any civilian judicial 
proceeding. In special circumstances however, and upon the receipt of an 
order or subpoena issued

[[Page 216]]

by a Federal court, the Administrator may authorize the limited release 
of classified information if he or she determines that the interests of 
justice cannot otherwise be served. Appropriate safeguards will be 
established to protect such classified material released for use in 
judicial proceedings.
    (d) Access to material in NARS custody. The Archivist of the United 
States prepares procedures governing access to materials transferred to 
NARS custody. These procedures are issued by the Administrator of 
General Services in 41 CFR part 105-61.
    (e) Access by the General Accounting Office and congressional 
committees. Classified information may be released to the General 
Accounting Office (GAO) and congressional committees when specifically 
authorized by the GSA Security Officer except as otherwise provided by 
law.


<R04>
           Subpart 105-62.2--Declassification and Downgrading


<R05>
Sec. 105-62.201  Declassification and downgrading.

    (a) Authority to downgrade and declassify. The authority to 
downgrade and declassify national security information or material shall 
be exercised as follows:
    (1) Information or material may be downgraded or declassified by the 
GSA official authorizing the original classification, by a successor in 
capacity, by a supervisory official of either, or by the Information 
Security Oversight Committee on appeal.
    (2) Downgrading and declassification authority may also be exercised 
by an official specifically authorized by the Administrator.
    (3) In the case of classified information or material officially 
transferred to GSA by or under statute or Executive order in conjunction 
with a transfer of functions and not merely for storage purposes, GSA 
shall be deemed the originating agency for all purposes under these 
procedures including downgrading and declassification.
    (4) In the case of classified information or material held in GSA 
not officially transferred under paragraph (a)(3) of this section but 
originated in an agency which has since ceased to exist, GSA is deemed 
the originating agency. Such information or material may be downgraded 
and declassified 30 calendar days after consulting with any other 
agencies having an interest in the subject matter.
    (5) Classified information or material under the final 
declassification jurisdiction of GSA which has been transferred to NARS 
for accession into the Archives of the United States may be downgraded 
and declassified by the Archivist of the United States in accordance 
with Executive Order 12065, directives of the Information Security 
Oversight Office, and the systematic review guidelines issued by the 
Administrator of General Services.
    (6) It is presumed that information which continues to meet 
classification requirements requires continued protection. In some 
cases, however, the need to protect such information may be outweighed 
by the public interest in disclosure of the information, and in these 
cases the information should be declassified. When such questions arise 
they shall be referred to the Administrator, the Director of the 
Information Security Oversight Office, or in accordance with the 
procedures for mandatory review described in Sec. 105-62.202(b).
    (b) Declassification. Declassification of information shall be given 
emphasis comparable to that acccorded classification. Information 
classified under Executive Order 12065 and prior orders shall be 
declassified as early as national security considerations permit. 
Decisions concerning declassification shall be based on the loss of 
sensitivity of the information with the passage of time or on the 
occurrence of an event which permits declassification. When information 
is reviewed for declassification it shall be declassified unless the 
declassification authority established in Sec. 105-62.202 determines 
that the information continues to meet the classification requirements 
prescribed despite the passage of time.
    (c) Downgrading. Classified information that is marked for automatic 
downgrading is downgraded accordingly without notification to holders. 
Classified information that is not marked for automatic downgrading may 
be assigned a lower classification designation by the originator or by 
an

[[Page 217]]

official authorized to declassify the same information. Notice of 
downgrading shall be provided to known holders of the information.


<R05>
Sec. 105-62.202  Review of classified materials for declassification purposes.

    (a) Systematic review for declassification. Except for foreign 
government information, classified information constituting permanently 
valuable records of GSA as defined by 44 U.S.C. 2103, and information in 
the possession and under control of NARA, under 44 U.S.C. 2107 or 2107 
note, shall be reviewed for declassification as it becomes 20 years old. 
Transition to systematic review at 20 years shall be implemented as 
rapidly as practicable and shall be completed by December 1, 1988. 
Foreign government information shall be reviewed for declassification as 
it becomes 30 years old.
    (b) Mandatory review for declassification. All classified 
information upon request by a member of the public or a Government 
employee or agency to declassify and release such information under the 
provisions of Executive Order 12065 shall be reviewed by the responsible 
GSA element for possible declassification in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section.
    (c) Submission of requests for review. Requests for mandatory review 
of classified information shall be submitted in accordance with the 
following:
    (1) Requests originating within GSA shall in all cases be submitted 
directly to the service or staff office that originated the information.
    (2) For expeditious action, requests from other governmental 
agencies or from members of the public should be submitted directly to 
the service or staff office that originated the material, or, if the 
originating element is not known, or no longer exists, the requester 
shall submit the request to the GSA Security Officer who shall cause 
such request to be reviewed.
    (d) Requirements for processing. Requests for declassification 
review and release of information shall be processed in accordance with 
the provisions set forth in paragraphs (e) through (h) of this section 
subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The request is in writing and reasonably describes the 
information sought with sufficient particularity to enable the element 
to identify it.
    (2) The requester shall be asked to correct a request that does not 
comply with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to provide additional 
information.
    (3) If within 30 days the requester does not correct the request, 
describe the information sought with sufficient particularity or narrow 
the scope of the request, the element that received the request shall 
notify the requester and state the reason why no action will be taken on 
the request.
    (e) Processing of requests. Requests that meet the foregoing 
requirements for processing will be acted upon as follows:
    (1) GSA action upon the initial request shall be completed within 60 
days.
    (2) Receipt of the request shall be acknowledged within 7 days.
    (3) The designated service or staff office shall determine if the 
requested information may be declassified and shall make such 
information available to the requester, unless withholding it is 
otherwise warranted under applicable law. If the information may not be 
released in whole or in part, the requester shall be given a brief 
statement as to the reasons for denial, a notice of the right to appeal 
the determination to the Deputy Administrator (the notice shall include 
the Deputy Administrator's name, title, and address), and a notice that 
such an appeal must be filed with the Deputy Administrator within 60 
days in order to be considered.
    (f) Foreign government information. Except as provided hereinafter, 
requests for mandatory review for the declassification of classified 
documents that contain foreign government information shall be processed 
and acted upon in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (c) 
through (e) of this section. If the request involves information that 
was initially received or classified by GSA, then the corresponding 
service or staff office shall be designated by the GSA Security Officer 
to determine whether the foreign government information in the document

[[Page 218]]

may be declassified and released in accordance with GSA policy or 
guidelines, after consulting with other agencies that have subject 
matter interest as necessary. If GSA is not the agency that received or 
classified the foreign government information, it shall refer the 
request to the appropriate agency. In those cases where agency policy or 
guidelines do not apply, consultation with the foreign originator, 
through the GSA Security Officer, may be made prior to final action on 
the request.
    (g) Information classified outside the service or staff office. When 
a service or staff office receives a request for declassification of 
information in a document which is in the custody of the service or 
staff office but was classified by another service or staff office or by 
another Government agency, the service or staff office shall refer the 
request to the classifying service or staff office or Government agency, 
together with a copy of the document containing the information 
requested when practicable, and shall notify the requester of the 
referral, unless the agency that classified the information objects on 
the grounds that its association with the information requires 
protection. When a GSA service or staff office receives such a referral, 
it shall process the request in accordance with the requirements of this 
paragraph and, if so requested, shall notify the referring service, 
staff office, or agency of the determination made on the request.
    (h) Action on appeal. The following procedures shall be followed 
when denials of requests for declassification are appealed:
    (1) The Deputy Administrator shall, within 15 days of the date of 
the appeal, convene a meeting of the GSA Information Security Oversight 
Committee (ISOC) that shall include the GSA Security Officer, or his or 
her representative, and the GSA official who denied the original request 
(and, at the option of that official, any subordinates or personnel from 
other agencies that participated in the decision for denial).
    (2) The ISOC shall learn from the official the reasons for denying 
the request, concentrating in particular upon which requirement 
continued classification is based and the identifiable damage that would 
result if the information were declassified. The ISOC shall also learn 
from the official the part or parts of the information that is 
classified and if by deleting minor segments of the information it might 
not then be declassified.
    (3) The ISOC's decision to uphold or deny the appeal, in whole or in 
part, shall be based upon the unanimous opinion of its membership. In 
the event that unanimity cannot be attained, the matter shall be 
referred to the Administrator, whose decision shall be final.
    (4) Based upon the outcome of the appeal, a reply shall be made to 
the person making the appeal that either encloses the requested 
information or part of the information, or explains why the continued 
classification of the information is required. A copy of the reply shall 
be sent to the GSA official who originally denied the request for 
declassification, to the GSA Security Officer, and to any other agency 
expressing an interest in the decision.
    (5) Final action on appeals shall be completed within 30 days of the 
date of the appeal.
    (i) Prohibition. No service of staff office in possession of a 
classified document may refuse to confirm the existence of the document 
in response to a request for the document under the provisions for 
mandatory review, unless the fact of its existence would itself be 
classifiable.
    (j) Presidential papers. Information less than 10 years old which 
was originated by the President, by the White House staff, or by 
committees or commissions appointed by the President, or by others 
acting on behalf of the President, is exempted from mandatory review for 
declassification. Such information 10 years old or older is subject to 
mandatory review for declassification in accordance with procedures 
developed by the Archivist of the United States which provide for 
consultation with GSA on matters of primary subject interest to this 
agency.

<R05>
Sec. 105-64.101-1  Collection and use.

    (a) General. The system manager (also called the manager) should 
collect information used for determining an individual's rights, 
benefits, or privileges under GSA programs directly from the subject 
individual if practical. The system manager should ensure that 
information collected is used only as intended by the Act and these 
regulations.
    (b) Soliciting information. Manager must ensure that when 
information is solicited, the person is informed of the authority for 
collecting it; whether providing it is mandatory or voluntary; the 
purpose for which it will be used; routine uses of the information; and 
the effect on the individual, if any, of not providing the information. 
Heads of Services and Staff Offices and Regional Administrators must 
ensure that forms used to solicit information comply with the Act and

individual.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.101-3  Rules of conduct.

protecting personal information.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.101-4  Safeguarding systems of records.

    Managers must ensure that administrative, technical, and physical 
safeguards are established to ensure the security and confidentiality of 
records and to protect against possible threats or hazards which could 
be harmful, embarrassing, inconvenient, or unfair to any individual. 
They must protect personnel information contained in manual and 
automated systems of records by using the following safeguards:
    (a) Storing official personnel folders and work folders in a 
lockable filing cabinet when not in use. The system manager may use an 
alternative storage system if it provides the same security as a locked 
cabinet.
    (b) Designating other sensitive records that need safeguards similar 
to those described in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Permitting access to and use of automated or manual personnel 
records only to persons whose official duties require it, or to a 
subject individual or to his or her representative.

    This part 105-64 applies or takes precedence when any GSA directive 
disagrees with it.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.102  Records of other agencies.

    If a GSA employee receives a request to review records that are the 
primary responsibility of another agency, but are maintained by or in 
the temporary possession of GSA, the employee should consult with the 
other agency before releasing the records. Records in the custody of GSA 
that are the responsibility of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) 
are governed by rules issued by OPM under the Privacy Act.

<R05>
Sec. 105-64.301-1  Form of requests.

    (a) A person who wants to see a record or any information concerning 
him or her that is contained in a system or records maintained in the 
GSA Central Office should send a written request to the GSA Privacy Act 
Officer, General Services Administration (ATRAI), Washington, DC 20405.

    (b) Requests must be made in writing and must be labeled Privacy Act 
Request both on the letter and on the envelope. The letter should 
contain the full name and identifying number of the system as published 
in the Federal Register; the full name and address of the subject 
individual; a brief description of the nature, time, place, and 
circumstances of the person's association with GSA; and any other 
information that would indicate whether the information is in the system 
of records. The 10-workday time limit for the agency to reply under 
Sec. 105-64.301-3, begins when a request is received in the office of 
the official identified in this section.
    (c) Managers may accept oral requests for access, if the requester 
is properly identified.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.301-2  Special requirements for medical records.

    (a) A manager who receives a request for access to official medical 
records belonging to the Office of Personnel Management and described in 
Chapter 339, Federal Personnel Manual (records about entrance 
qualification, fitness for duty, or records filed in the official 
personnel folder), should refer the matter to a Federal medical officer 
for a decision under this section. If no medical officer is available, 
the manager should send the request and the medical reports to the 
Office of Personnel Management for a decision.

[[Page 223]]

    (b) If the Federal medical officer believes the medical records 
requested by the subject individual discuss a condition that a physician 
would hesitate to reveal to the person, the manager may release the 
information only to a physician designated in writing by the subject 
individual, his or her guardian, or conservator. If the records contain 
information the physician would likely disclose to the person, the 
information may be released to anyone the person authorizes in writing 
to receive it.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.301-3  Granting access.

    (a) Upon receiving a request for access to nonexempt records, the 
manager must make them available to the subject individual or 
acknowledge the request within 10 workdays after it is received, stating 
when the records will be available.
    (b) If the manager expects a delay of more than the 10 days allowed, 
he or she should state the reason why in the acknowledgement.
    (c) If a request for access does not contain enough information to 
find the records, the manager should request additional information from 
the individual and is allowed 10 more workdays after receiving it to 
make the records available or acknowledge receiving the request.
    (d) Records are available during normal business hours at the 
offices where the records are maintained. Requesters should be prepared 
to identify themselves by signature and to show other identification 
verifying their signature.
    (e) Managers may permit an individual to examine the original of a 
nonexempt record and, if asked, provide the person with a copy of the 
record. Fees are charged only for copies given to the person, not for 
copies made for the agency's convenience.
    (f) A requester may pick up a record in person or receive it by 
mail, directed to an address provided in the request. The manager should 
not give a record to a third party to deliver to the subject individual, 
except medical records as outlined in Sec. 105-64.301-2 or as described 
in paragraph (g) of this section.
    (g) If a person wants to have someone else accompany him or her 
while reviewing a record or when obtaining a copy of it, he or she must 
first sign a statement authorizing the disclosure of the record. The 
system manager shall maintain this statement with the record.
    (h) The procedure to review the account of disclosures is the same 
as the procedures for reviewing a record.


<R05>
Sec. 105-64.301-4  Denials of access.

    (a) A manager may deny access to a record only if the information is 
being compiled in reasonable acticipation of a civil action or 
proceeding as provided under 5 U.S.C. 552(d)(5) or if rules published in 
the Federal Register state that it is in a system of records that may 
not be disclosed. These systems are described in Subpart 105-64.6.
    (b) If a manager receives a request for access to a record in an 
exempt system of record, he or she should forward it to the Head of the 
Service or Staff Office or Regional Administrator, attaching an 
explanation and recommending the request be denied or granted.
    (c) If the manager is the Head of a Service or Staff Office or a 
Regional Administrator, he or she retains the responsibility for 
granting or denying the request.
    (d) The head of the Service or Staff Office or Regional 
Administrator, in consultation with legal counsel and other officials 
concerned, should decide whether the requested record is exempt from 
disclosure and,
    (1) If the record is not exempt, notify the system manager to grant 
the request under Sec. 105-64.301-3; or
    (2) If the record is part of an exempt system he or she should:
    (i) Notify the requester that the request is denied, explain why it 
is denied, and inform the requester of his or her right to have GSA 
review the decision; or
    (ii) Notify the manager to make the record available under Sec. 105-
64.301-3, even though it is in an exempted system.

<R05>
Sec. 105-64.301-5  Appeal of denial of access within GSA.

    (a) A requester who is denied access, in whole or in part, to 
records pertaining to him or her may file an administrative appeal. 
Appeals should be addressed to the GSA Privacy Act Officer, General 
Services Administration (ATRAI), Washington, DC 20405, regardless 
whether the denial was made by a Central Office or a regional official.
    (b) Each appeal to the Privacy Act Officer must be in writing. The 
appeal should be marked Privacy Act-Access Appeal, on the face of the 
letter and on the envelope.
    (c) On receiving an appeal, the Privacy Act Officer consults with 
the manager, the official who made the denial, legal counsel, and other 
officials concerned. If the Privacy Act Officer, after consultation, 
decides to grant the request, he or she notifies the manager in writing 
to grant access to the record under Sec. 105-64.301-3, or grants access 
himself or herself and notifies the requester of that action.
    (d) If the Privacy Act Officer decides the appeal should be 
rejected, he or she sends the request file and any appeal, with a 
recommendation, to the Deputy Administrator for a final administrative 
decision.
    (e) If the Deputy Administrator decides to grant a request, he or 
she promptly instructs the system manager in writing to grant access to 
the record under Sec. 105-64.301-3. The Deputy Administrator sends a 
copy of the instructions to the Privacy Act Officer, who notifies the 
requester.
    (f) If the Deputy Administrator rejects an appeal, he or she should 
promptly notify the requester in writing. This action constitutes the 
final administrative decision on the request and should state:
    (1) The reason for rejecting the appeal; and
    (2) That the requester has the right to have a court review the 
final decision under Sec. 105-64.408.
    (g) The final decision must be made within 30 workdays from the date

Administrator may extend the time limit by notifying the requester in 
writing before the 30 days are up. The Deputy Administrator's letter 
should explain why the time was extended.

    On receiving a final decision not to amend a record, the requester 
may file a Statement of Disagreement with the manager. The statement 
should explain why the requester believes the record to be inaccurate, 
irrelevant, untimely, or incomplete. The manager must file the statement 
with the records and include a copy of it in any disclosure of the 
record. The manager must also provide a copy of the Statement of

<R05>
Sec. 105-68.100  Purpose.

    (a) Executive Order (E.O.) 12549 provides that, to the extent 
permitted by law, Executive departments and agencies shall participate 
in a governmentwide system for nonprocurement debarment and suspension. 
A person who is debarred or suspended shall be excluded from Federal 
financial and nonfinancial assistance and benefits under Federal 
programs and activities. Debarment or suspension of a participant in a 
program by one agency shall have governmentwide effect.
    (b) These regulations implement section 3 of E.O. 12549 and the 
guidelines promulgated by the Office of Management and Budget under 
section 6 of the E.O. by:
    (1) Prescribing the programs and activities that are covered by the 
governmentwide system;
    (2) Prescribing the governmentwide criteria and governmentwide 
minimum due process procedures that each agency shall use;
    (3) Providing for the listing of debarred and suspended 
participants, participants declared ineligible (see definition of 
``ineligible'' in Sec. 105-68.105), and participants who have 
voluntarily excluded themselves from participation in covered 
transactions;
    (4) Setting forth the consequences of a debarment, suspension, 
determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion; and
    (5) Offering such other guidance as necessary for the effective 
implementation and administration of the governmentwide system.
    (c) These regulations also implement Executive Order 12689 (3 CFR, 
1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Public Law 103-355, sec. 
2455, 108 Stat. 3327) by--
    (1) Providing for the inclusion in the List of Parties Excluded from 
Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs all persons proposed for 
debarment, debarred or suspended under the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation, 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4; persons against which 
governmentwide exclusions have been entered under this part; and persons 
determined to be ineligible; and
    (2) Setting forth the consequences of a debarment, suspension, 
determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion.
    (d) Although these regulations cover the listing of ineligible 
participants and the effect of such listing, they do not prescribe 
policies and procedures governing declarations of ineligibility.

<R05>
Sec. 105-68.110  Coverage.

    (a) These regulations apply to all persons who have participated, 
are currently participating or may reasonably be expected to participate 
in transactions under Federal nonprocurement programs. For purposes of 
these regulations such transactions will be referred to as ``covered 
transactions.''
    (1) Covered transaction. For purposes of these regulations, a 
covered transaction is a primary covered transaction or a lower tier 
covered transaction. Covered transactions at any tier need not involve 
the transfer of Federal funds.
    (i) Primary covered transaction. Except as noted in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section, a primary covered transaction is any nonprocurement 
transaction between an agency and a person, regardless of type, 
including: grants, cooperative agreements, scholarships, fellowships, 
contracts of assistance, loans, loan guarantees, subsidies, insurance, 
payments for specified use, donation agreements and any other 
nonprocurement transactions between a Federal agency and a person. 
Primary covered transactions also include those transactions specially 
designated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in 
such agency's regulations governing debarment and suspension.
    (ii) Lower tier covered transaction. A lower tier covered 
transaction is:
    (A) Any transaction between a participant and a person other than a 
procurement contract for goods or services, regardless of type, under a 
primary covered transaction.
    (B) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a 
participant and a person, regardless of type, expected to equal or 
exceed the Federal procurement small purchase threshold fixed at 10 
U.S.C. 2304(g) and 41 U.S.C. 253(g) (currently $25,000) under a primary 
covered transaction.
    (C) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a 
participant and a person under a covered transaction, regardless of 
amount, under which that person will have a critical influence on or 
substantive control over that covered transaction. Such persons are:
    (1) Principal investigators.
    (2) Providers of federally-required audit services.
    (2) Exceptions. The following transactions are not covered:
    (i) Statutory entitlements or mandatory awards (but not subtier 
awards thereunder which are not themselves mandatory), including 
deposited funds insured by the Federal Government;
    (ii) Direct awards to foreign governments or public international 
organizations, or transactions with foreign governments or foreign 
governmental entities, public international organizations, foreign 
government owned (in whole or in part) or controlled entities, entities 
consisting wholly or partially of foreign governments or foreign 
governmental entities;
    (iii) Benefits to an individual as a personal entitlement without 
regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received 
in an individual's business capacity are not excepted);

[[Page 233]]

    (iv) Federal employment;
    (v) Transactions pursuant to national or agency-recognized 
emergencies or disasters;
    (vi) Incidental benefits derived from ordinary governmental 
operations; and
    (vii) Other transactions where the application of these regulations 
would be prohibited by law.
    (b) Relationship to other sections. This section describes the types 
of transactions to which a debarment or suspension under the regulations 
will apply. Subpart 105-68.2, ``Effect of Action,'' Sec. 105-68.200, 
``Debarment or suspension,'' sets forth the consequences of a debarment 
or suspension. Those consequences would obtain only with respect to 
participants and principals in the covered transactions and activities 
described in Sec. 105-68.110(a). Sections 105-68.325, ``Scope of 
debarment,'' and 105-68.420, ``Scope of suspension,'' govern the extent 
to which a specific participant or organizational elements of a 
participant would be automatically included within a debarment or 
suspension action, and the conditions under which affiliates or persons 
associated with a participant may also be brought within the scope of 
the action.
    (c) Relationship to Federal procurement activities. In accordance 
with E.O. 12689 and section 2455 of Public Law 103-355, any debarment, 
suspension, proposed debarment or other governmentwide exclusion 
initiated under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) on or after 
August 25, 1995, shall be recognized by and effective for Executive 
Branch agencies and participants as an exclusion under this regulation. 
Similarly, any debarment, suspension or other governmentwide exclusion 
initiated under this regulation on or after August 25, 1995, shall be 
recognized by and effective for those agencies as a debarment or 
suspension under the FAR.

[53 FR 19198, 19204, May 26, 1988, as amended at 54 FR 4962, Jan. 31, 
1989; 60 FR 33041, 33059, June 26, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.115  Policy.

    (a) In order to protect the public interest, it is the policy of the 
Federal Government to conduct business only with responsible persons. 
Debarment and suspension are discretionary actions that, taken in 
accordance with Executive Order 12549 and these regulations, are 
appropriate means to implement this policy.
    (b) Debarment and suspension are serious actions which shall be used 
only in the public interest and for the Federal Government's protection 
and not for purposes of punishment. Agencies may impose debarment or 
suspension for the causes and in accordance with the procedures set 
forth in these regulations.
    (c) When more than one agency has an interest in the proposed 
debarment or suspension of a person, consideration shall be given to 
designating one agency as the lead agency for making the decision. 
Agencies are encouraged to establish methods and procedures for 
coordinating their debarment or suspension actions.

law, persons who are debarred or suspended shall be excluded from 
primary covered transactions as either participants or principals 
throughout the Executive Branch of the Federal Government for the period 
of their debarment, suspension, or the period they are proposed for 
debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4. Accordingly, no agency shall 
enter into primary covered transactions with such excluded persons 
during such period, except as permitted pursuant to Sec. 105-68.215.
    (b) Lower tier covered transactions. Except to the extent prohibited 
by law, persons who have been proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 
9, subpart 9.4, debarred or suspended shall be excluded from 
participating as either participants or principals in all lower tier 
covered transactions (see Sec. 105-68.110(a)(1)(ii)) for the period of 
their exclusion.
    (c) Exceptions. Debarment or suspension does not affect a person's 
eligibility for--
    (1) Statutory entitlements or mandatory awards (but not subtier 
awards thereunder which are not themselves mandatory), including 
deposited funds insured by the Federal Government;

[[Page 234]]

    (2) Direct awards to foreign governments or public international 
organizations, or transactions with foreign governments or foreign 
governmental entities, public international organizations, foreign 
government owned (in whole or in part) or controlled entities, and 
entities consisting wholly or partially of foreign governments or 
foreign governmental entities;
    (3) Benefits to an individual as a personal entitlement without 
regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received 
in an individual's business capacity are not excepted);
    (4) Federal employment;
    (5) Transactions pursuant to national or agency-recognized 
emergencies or disasters;
    (6) Incidental benefits derived from ordinary governmental 
operations; and
    (7) Other transactions where the application of these regulations 
would be prohibited by law.

Sec. 105-68.205  Ineligible persons.

    Persons who are ineligible, as defined in Sec. 105-68.105(i), are 
excluded in accordance with the applicable statutory, executive order, 
or regulatory authority.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.210  Voluntary exclusion.

    Persons who accept voluntary exclusions under Sec. 105-68.315 are 
excluded in accordance with the terms of their settlements. GSA shall, 
and participants may, contact the original action agency to ascertain 
the extent of the exclusion.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.215  Exception provision.

    GSA may grant an exception permitting a debarred, suspended, or 
voluntarily excluded person, or a person proposed for debarment under 48 
CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, to participate in a particular covered 
transaction upon a written determination by the agency head or an 
authorized designee stating the reason(s) for deviating from the 
Presidential policy established by Executive Order 12549 and Sec. 105-
68.200. However, in accordance with the President's stated intention in 
the Executive Order, exceptions shall be granted only infrequently. 
Exceptions shall be reported in accordance with Sec. 105-68.505(a).

[60 FR 33041 and 33059, June 26, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.220  Continuation of covered transactions.

    (a) Notwithstanding the debarment, suspension, proposed debarment 
under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, determination of ineligibility, or 
voluntary exclusion of any person by an agency, agencies and 
participants may continue covered transactions in existence at the time 
the person was debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 CFR 
part 9, subpart 9.4, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded. A 
decision as to the type of termination action, if any, to be taken 
should be made only after thorough review to ensure the propriety of the 
proposed action.
    (b) Agencies and participants shall not renew or extend covered 
transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) with any person who is 
debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 
9.4, ineligible or voluntary excluded, except as provided in Sec. 105-
68.215.

[60 FR 33041 and 33059, June 26, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.225  Failure to adhere to restrictions.

    (a) Except as permitted under Sec. 105-68.215 or Sec. 105-68.220, a 
participant shall not knowingly do business under a covered transaction 
with a person who is--
    (1) Debarred or suspended;
    (2) Proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4; or
    (3) Ineligible for or voluntarily excluded from the covered 
transaction.
    (b) Violation of the restriction under paragraph (a) of this section 
may result in disallowance of costs, annulment or termination of award, 
issuance of a stop work order, debarment or suspension, or other 
remedies as appropriate.
    (c) A participant may rely upon the certification of a prospective 
participant in a lower tier covered transaction that it and its 
principals are not debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 
CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded

[[Page 235]]

from the covered transaction (See appendix B of these regulations), 
unless it knows that the certification is erroneous. An agency has the 
burden of proof that a participant did knowingly do business with a 
person that filed an erroneous certification.

                       Subpart 105-68.3--Debarment


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.300  General.

    The debarring official may debar a person for any of the causes in 
Sec. 105-68.305, using procedures established in Secs. 105-68.310 
through 105-68.314. The existence of a cause for debarment, however, 
does not necessarily require that the person be debarred; the 
seriousness of the person's acts or omissions and any mitigating factors 
shall be considered in making any debarment decision.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.305  Causes for debarment.

    Debarment may be imposed in accordance with the provisions of 
Secs. 105-68.300 through 105-68.314 for:

    (1) Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with 
obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public or private 
agreement or transaction;
    (2) Violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes, including

falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, 
receiving stolen property, making false claims, or obstruction of 
justice; or
    (4) Commission of any other offense indicating a lack of business 
integrity or business honesty that seriously and directly affects the 
present responsibility of a person.
    (b) Violation of the terms of a public agreement or transaction so 
serious as to affect the integrity of an agency program, such as:
    (1) A willful failure to perform in accordance with the terms of one 
or more public agreements or transactions;
    (2) A history of failure to perform or of unsatisfactory performance 
of one or more public agreements or transactions; or
    (3) A willful violation of a statutory or regulatory provision or 
requirement applicable to a public agreement or transaction.
    (c) Any of the following causes:
    (1) A nonprocurement debarment by any Federal agency taken before 
October 1, 1988, the effective date of these regulations, or a 
procurement debarment by any Federal agency taken pursuant to 48 CFR 
subpart 9.4;
    (2) Knowingly doing business with a debarred, suspended, ineligible, 
or voluntarily excluded person, in connection with a covered

<R05>
Sec. 105-68.311  Investigation and referral.

    Information concerning the existence of a cause for debarment from 
any source shall be promptly reported, investigated, and referred, when 
appropriate, to the debarring official for consideration. After 
consideration, the debarring official may issue a notice of proposed 
debarment.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.312  Notice of proposed debarment.

    A debarment proceeding shall be initiated by notice to the 
respondent advising:
    (a) That debarment is being considered;
    (b) Of the reasons for the proposed debarment in terms sufficient to 
put the respondent on notice of the conduct or transaction(s) upon which 
it is based;
    (c) Of the cause(s) relied upon under Sec. 105-68.305 for proposing 
debarment;
    (d) Of the provisions of Sec. 105-68.311 through Sec. 105-68.314, 
and any other GSA procedures, if applicable, governing debarment 
decisionmaking; and
    (e) Of the potential effect of a debarment.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.313  Opportunity to contest proposed debarment.

    (a) Submission in opposition. Within 30 days after receipt of the 
notice of proposed debarment, the respondent may submit, in person, in 
writing, or through a representative, information and argument in 
opposition to the proposed debarment.
    (b) Additional proceedings as to disputed material facts. (1) In 
actions not based upon a conviction or civil judgment, if the debarring 
official finds that the respondent's submission in opposition raises a 
genuine dispute over facts material to the proposed debarment, 
respondent(s) shall be afforded an opportunity to appear with a 
representative, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and 
confront any witness the agency presents.
    (2) A transcribed record of any additional proceedings shall be made 
available at cost to the respondent, upon request, unless the respondent 
and the agency, by mutual agreement, waive the requirement for a 
transcript.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.314  Debarring official's decision.

    (a) No additional proceedings necessary. In actions based upon a 
conviction or civil judgment, or in which there is no genuine dispute 
over material facts, the debarring official shall make a decision on the 
basis of all the information in the administrative record, including any 
submission made by the respondent. The decision shall be made within 45 
days after receipt of any information and argument submitted by the 
respondent, unless the debarring official extends this period for good 
cause.
    (b) Additional proceedings necessary. (1) In actions in which 
additional proceedings are necessary to determine disputed material 
facts, written findings of fact shall be prepared. The debarring 
official shall base the decision on the facts as found, together with 
any information and argument submitted by the respondent and any other 
information in the administrative record.
    (2) The debarring official may refer disputed material facts to 
another official for findings of fact. The debarring official may reject 
any such findings, in whole or in part, only after specifically 
determining them to be arbitrary and capricious or clearly erroneous.
    (3) The debarring official's decision shall be made after the 
conclusion of the proceedings with respect to disputed facts.
    (c)(1) Standard of proof. In any debarment action, the cause for 
debarment must be established by a preponderance of the evidence. Where 
the proposed debarment is based upon a conviction or civil judgment, the 
standard shall be deemed to have been met.
    (2) Burden of proof. The burden of proof is on the agency proposing 
debarment.
    (d) Notice of debarring official's decision. (1) If the debarring 
official decides to impose debarment, the respondent shall be given 
prompt notice:
    (i) Referring to the notice of proposed debarment;
    (ii) Specifying the reasons for debarment;
    (iii) Stating the period of debarment, including effective dates; 
and

[[Page 237]]

    (iv) Advising that the debarment is effective for covered 
transactions throughout the executive branch of the Federal Government 
unless an agency head or an authorized designee makes the determination 
referred to in Sec. 105-68.215.
    (2) If the debarring official decides not to impose debarment, the 
respondent shall be given prompt notice of that decision. A decision not 
to impose debarment shall be without prejudice to a subsequent 
imposition of debarment by any other agency.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.315  Settlement and voluntary exclusion.

    (a) When in the best interest of the Government, GSA may, at any 
time, settle a debarment or suspension action.
    (b) If a participant and the agency agree to a voluntary exclusion 
of the participant, such voluntary exclusion shall be entered on the 
Nonprocurement List (see subpart 105-68.5).

1989]


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.320  Period of debarment.

    (a) Debarment shall be for a period commensurate with the 
seriousness of the cause(s). If a suspension precedes a debarment, the 
suspension period shall be considered in determining the debarment 
period.
    (1) Debarment for causes other than those related to a violation of 
the requirements of subpart 105-68.6 of this part generally should not 
exceed three years. Where circumstances warrant, a longer period of 
debarment may be imposed.
    (2) In the case of a debarment for a violation of the requirements 
of subpart 105-68.6 of this part (see 105-68.305(c)(5)), the period of 
debarment shall not exceed five years.
    (b) The debarring official may extend an existing debarment for an 
additional period, if that official determines that an extension is 
necessary to protect the public interest. However, a debarment may not 
be extended solely on the basis of the facts and circumstances upon 
which the initial debarment action was based. If debarment for an 
additional period is determined to be necessary, the procedures of 
Secs. 105-68.311 through 105-68.314 shall be followed to extend the 
debarment.
    (c) The respondent may request the debarring official to reverse the 
debarment decision or to reduce the period or scope of debarment. Such a 
request shall be in writing and supported by documentation. The 
debarring official may grant such a request for reasons including, but 
not limited to:
    (1) Newly discovered material evidence;
    (2) Reversal of the conviction or civil judgment upon which the 
debarment was based;
    (3) Bona fide change in ownership or management;
    (4) Elimination of other causes for which the debarment was imposed; 
or
    (5) Other reasons the debarring official deems appropriate.

<R05>
Sec. 105-68.325  Scope of debarment.

    (a) Scope in general. (1) Debarment of a person under these 
regulations constitutes debarment of all its divisions and other 
organizational elements from all covered transactions, unless the 
debarment decision is limited by its terms to one or more specifically 
identified individuals, divisions or other organizational elements or to 
specific types of transactions.
    (2) The debarment action may include any affiliate of the 
participant that is specifically named and given notice of the proposed 
debarment and an opportunity to respond (see Secs. 105-68.311 through 
105-68.314).
    (b) Imputing conduct. For purposes of determining the scope of 
debarment, conduct may be imputed as follows:
    (1) Conduct imputed to participant. The fraudulent, criminal or 
other seriously improper conduct of any officer, director, shareholder, 
partner, employee, or other individual associated with a participant may 
be imputed to the participant when the conduct occurred in connection 
with the individual's performance of duties for or on behalf of the 
participant, or with the participant's knowledge, approval, or 
acquiescence. The participant's acceptance of the benefits derived from 
the conduct shall

[[Page 238]]

be evidence of such knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.
    (2) Conduct imputed to individuals associated with participant. The 
fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper conduct of a 
participant may be imputed to any officer, director, shareholder, 
partner, employee, or other individual associated with the participant 
who participated in, knew of, or had reason to know of the participant's 
conduct.
    (3) Conduct of one participant imputed to other participants in a 
joint venture. The fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper 
conduct of one participant in a joint venture, grant pursuant to a joint 
application, or similar arrangement may be imputed to other participants 
if the conduct occurred for or on behalf of the joint venture, grant 
pursuant to a joint application, or similar arrangement or with the 
knowledge, approval, or acquiescence of these participants. Acceptance 
of the benefits derived from the conduct shall be evidence of such 
knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.

<R05>
Sec. 105-68.400  General.

    (a) The suspending official may suspend a person for any of the

    (b) Suspension is a serious action to be imposed only when:
    (1) There exists adequate evidence of one or more of the causes set 
out in Sec. 105-68.405, and
    (2) Immediate action is necessary to protect the public interest.
    (c) In assessing the adequacy of the evidence, the agency should 
consider how much information is available, how credible it is given the 
circumstances, whether or not important allegations are corroborated, 
and what inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result. This assessment 
should include an examination of basic documents such as grants, 
cooperative agreements, loan authorizations, and contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.405  Causes for suspension.

    (a) Suspension may be imposed in accordance with the provisions of 
Secs. 105-68.400 through 105-68.413 upon adequate evidence:

[53 FR 19198, 19204, May 26, 1988, as amended at 56 FR 29438, June 27, 
1991]


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.411  Notice of suspension.

    When a respondent is suspended, notice shall immediately be given:
    (a) That suspension has been imposed;
    (b) That the suspension is based on an indictment, conviction, or 
other adequate evidence that the respondent has committed irregularities 
seriously reflecting on the propriety of further Federal Government 
dealings with the respondent;
    (c) Describing any such irregularities in terms sufficient to put 
the respondent on notice without disclosing the Federal Government's

or through a representative, information and argument in opposition to 
the suspension.
    (b) Additional proceedings as to disputed material facts. (1) If the 
suspending official finds that the respondent's submission in opposition 
raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the suspension, 
respondent(s) shall be afforded an opportunity to appear with a 
representative, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and 
confront any witness the agency presents, unless:
    (i) The action is based on an indictment, conviction or civil 
judgment, or
    (ii) A determination is made, on the basis of Department of Justice 
advice, that the substantial interests of the Federal Government in 
pending or contemplated legal proceedings based on the same facts as the 
suspension would be prejudiced.
    (2) A transcribed record of any additional proceedings shall be 
prepared and made available at cost to the respondent, upon request, 
unless the respondent and the agency, by mutual agreement, waive the 
requirement for a transcript.


<R05>

    The suspending official may modify or terminate the suspension (for 
example, see Sec. 105-68.320(c) for reasons for reducing the period or 
scope of debarment) or may leave it in force. However, a decision to 
modify or terminate the suspension shall be without prejudice to the 
subsequent imposition of suspension by any other agency or debarment by 
any agency. The decision shall be rendered in accordance with the 
following provisions:
    (a) No additional proceedings necessary. In actions: based on an 
indictment, conviction, or civil judgment; in which there is no genuine 
dispute over material facts; or in which additional proceedings to 
determine disputed material facts have been denied on the basis of 
Department of Justice advice, the suspending official shall make a 
decision on the basis of all the information in the administrative 
record, including any submission made by the respondent. The decision 
shall be made within 45 days after receipt of any information and 
argument submitted by the respondent, unless the suspending official 
extends this period for good cause.
    (b) Additional proceedings necessary. (1) In actions in which 
additional proceedings are necessary to determine disputed material 
facts, written findings of fact shall be prepared. The suspending 
official shall base the decision on the facts as found, together with 
any information and argument submitted by the respondent and any other 
information in the administrative record.
    (2) The suspending official may refer matters involving disputed 
material facts to another official for findings of fact. The suspending 
official may reject any such findings, in whole or in part, only after 
specifically determining them to be arbitrary or capricious or clearly 
erroneous.
    (c) Notice of suspending official's decision. Prompt written notice 
of the suspending official's decision shall be sent to the respondent.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.415  Period of suspension.

    (a) Suspension shall be for a temporary period pending the 
completion of an investigation or ensuing legal, debarment, or Program 
Fraud Civil Remedies Act proceedings, unless terminated sooner by the 
suspending official or as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) If legal or administrative proceedings are not initiated within 
12 months after the date of the suspension notice, the suspension shall 
be terminated unless an Assistant Attorney General or United States 
Attorney requests its extension in writing, in which case it may be 
extended for an additional six months. In no event may a suspension 
extend beyond 18 months, unless such proceedings have been initiated 
within that period.
    (c) The suspending official shall notify the Department of Justice 
of an

impending termination of a suspension, at least 30 days before the 12-
month period expires, to give that Department an opportunity to request 
an extension.

    The scope of a suspension is the same as the scope of a debarment 
(see Sec. 105-68.325), except that the procedures of Secs. 105-68.410 
through 105-68.413 shall be used in imposing a suspension.

<R05>
Sec. 105-68.505  GSA responsibilities.

    (a) The agency shall provide GSA with current information concerning 
debarments, suspension, determinations of ineligibility, and voluntary

participation by debarred, suspended, or voluntarily excluded persons.
    (b) Unless an alternative schedule is agreed to by GSA, the agency 
shall advise GSA of the information set forth in Sec. 105-68.500(b) and 
of the exceptions granted under Sec. 105-68.215 within five working days 
after taking such actions.
    (c) The agency shall direct inquiries concerning listed persons to 
the agency that took the action.
    (d) Agency officials shall check the Nonprocurement List before 
entering covered transactions to determine whether a participant in a 
primary transaction is debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily 
excluded (202) 501-0688.
    (e) Agency officials shall check the Nonprocurement List before 
approving principals or lower tier participants where agency approval of 
the principal or lower tier participant is required under the terms of 
the transaction, to determine whether such principals or participants 
are debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded.

<R05>
Sec. 105-68.510  Participants' responsibilities.

    (a) Certification by participants in primary covered transactions. 
Each participant shall submit the certification in appendix A to this 
part for it and its principals at the time the participant submits its 
proposal in connection with a primary covered transaction, except that 
States need only complete such certification as to their principals. 
Participants may decide the method and frequency by which they determine 
the eligibility of their principals. In addition, each participant may, 
but is not required to, check the Nonprocurement List for its principals 
(202) 501-0688. Adverse information on the certification will not 
necessarily result in denial of participation. However, the 
certification, and any additional information pertaining to the 
certification submitted by the participant, shall be considered in the 
administration of covered transactions.
    (b) Certification by participants in lower tier covered 
transactions. (1) Each participant shall require participants in lower 
tier covered transactions to include the certification in appendix B

[[Page 241]]

to this part for it and its principals in any proposal submitted in 
connection with such lower tier covered transactions.
    (2) A participant may rely upon the certification of a prospective 
participant in a lower tier covered transaction that it and its 
principals are not debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily 
excluded from the covered transaction by any Federal agency, unless it 
knows that the certification is erroneous. Participants may decide the 
method and frequency by which they determine the eligiblity of their 
principals. In addition, a participant may, but is not required to, 
check the Nonprocurement List for its principals and for participants 
(202) 501-0688.
    (c) Changed circumstances regarding certification. A participant 
shall provide immediate written notice to GSA if at any time the 
participant learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted 
or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. Participants 
in lower tier covered transactions shall provide the same updated notice 
to the participant to which it submitted its proposals.

    (c) The provisions of subparts 105-68.1, 105-68.2, 105-68.3, 105-
68.4 and 105-68.5 of this part apply to matters covered by this subpart, 
except where specifically modified by this subpart. In the event of any 
conflict between provisions of this subpart and other provisions of this 
part, the provisions of this subpart are deemed to control with respect 
to the implementation of drug-free workplace requirements concerning 
grants.

1991]


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.615  Grounds for suspension of payments, suspension or termination of grants, or suspension or debarment.

    A grantee shall be deemed in violation of the requirements of this 
subpart if the agency head or his or her official designee determines, 
in writing, that--
    (a) The grantee has made a false certification under Sec. 105-
68.630;
    (b) With respect to a grantee other than an individual--
    (1) The grantee has violated the certification by failing to carry 
out the requirements of paragraphs (A)(a) through (g) and/or (B) of the 
certification (Alternate I to Appendix C) or
    (2) Such a number of employees of the grantee have been convicted of 
violations of criminal drug statutes for violations occurring in the 
workplace as to indicate that the grantee has failed to make a good 
faith effort to provide a drug-free workplace.
    (c) With respect to a grantee who is an individual--
    (1) The grantee has violated the certification by failing to carry 
out its requirements (Alternate II to Appendix C); or
    (2) The grantee is convicted of a criminal drug offense resulting 
from a violation occurring during the conduct of any grant activity.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.620  Effect of violation.

    (a) In the event of a violation of this subpart as provided in 
Sec. 105-68.615, and in accordance with applicable law, the

[[Page 243]]

grantee shall be subject to one or more of the following actions:
    (1) Suspension of payments under the grant;
    (2) Suspension or termination of the grant; and
    (3) Suspension or debarment of the grantee under the provisions of 
this part.
    (b) Upon issuance of any final decision under this part requiring 
debarment of a grantee, the debarred grantee shall be ineligible for 
award of any grant from any Federal agency for a period specified in the 
decision, not to exceed five years (see Sec. 105-68.320(a)(2) of this 
part).


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.625  Exception provision.

    The agency head may waive with respect to a particular grant, in 
writing, a suspension of payments under a grant, suspension or 
termination of a grant, or suspension or debarment of a grantee if the 
agency head determines that such a waiver would be in the public 
interest. This exception authority cannot be delegated to any other 
official.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.630  Certification requirements and procedures.

    (a)(1) As a prior condition of being awarded a grant, each grantee 
shall make the appropriate certification to the Federal agency providing 
the grant, as provided in appendix C to this part.
    (2) Grantees are not required to make a certification in order to 
continue receiving funds under a grant awarded before March 18, 1989, or 
under a no-cost time extension of such a grant. However, the grantee 
shall make a one-time drug-free workplace certification for a non-
automatic continuation of such a grant made on or after March 18, 1989.
    (b) Except as provided in this section, all grantees shall make the 
required certification for each grant. For mandatory formula grants and 
entitlements that have no application process, grantees shall submit a 
one-time certification in order to continue receiving awards.
    (c) A grantee that is a State may elect to make one certification in 
each Federal fiscal year. States that previously submitted an annual 
certification are not required to make a certification for Fiscal Year 
1990 until June 30, 1990. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, this certification shall cover all grants to all State agencies 
from any Federal agency. The State shall retain the original of this 
statewide certification in its Governor's office and, prior to grant 
award, shall ensure that a copy is submitted individually with respect 
to each grant, unless the Federal agency has designated a central 
location for submission.
    (d)(1) The Governor of a State may exclude certain State agencies 
from the statewide certification and authorize these agencies to submit 
their own certifications to Federal agencies. The statewide 
certification shall name any State agencies so excluded.
    (2) A State agency to which the statewide certification does not 
apply, or a State agency in a State that does not have a statewide 
certification, may elect to make one certification in each Federal 
fiscal year. State agencies that previously submitted a State agency 
certification are not required to make a certification for Fiscal Year 
1990 until June 30, 1990. The State agency shall retain the original of 
this State agency-wide certification in its central office and, prior to 
grant award, shall ensure that a copy is submitted individually with 
respect to each grant, unless the Federal agency designates a central 
location for submission.
    (3) When the work of a grant is done by more than one State agency, 
the certification of the State agency directly receiving the grant shall 
be deemed to certify compliance for all workplaces, including those 
located in other State agencies.
    (e)(1) For a grant of less than 30 days performance duration, 
grantees shall have this policy statement and program in place as soon 
as possible, but in any case by a date prior to the date on which 
performance is expected to be completed.
    (2) For a grant of 30 days or more performance duration, grantees 
shall have this policy statement and program in place within 30 days 
after award.
    (3) Where extraordinary circumstances warrant for a specific

[[Page 244]]

grant, the grant officer may determine a different date on which the 
policy statement and program shall be in place.


<R05>
Sec. 105-68.635  Reporting of and employee sanctions for convictions of criminal drug offenses.

    (a) When a grantee other than an individual is notified that an 
employee has been convicted for a violation of a criminal drug statute 
occurring in the workplace, it shall take the following actions:
    (1) Within 10 calendar days of receiving notice of the conviction, 
the grantee shall provide written notice, including the convicted 
employee's position title, to every grant officer, or other designee on 
whose grant activity the convicted employee was working, unless a 
Federal agency has designated a central point for the receipt of such 
notifications. Notification shall include the identification number(s) 
for each of the Federal agency's affected grants.
    (2) Within 30 calendar days of receiving notice of the conviction, 
the grantee shall do the following with respect to the employee who was 
convicted.
    (i) Take appropriate personnel action against the employee, up to 
and including termination, consistent with requirements of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended; or
    (ii) Require the employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug 
abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for such purposes by 
a Federal, State, or local health, law enforcement, or other appropriate 
agency.
    (b) A grantee who is an individual who is convicted for a violation 
of a criminal drug statute occurring during the conduct of any grant 
activity shall report the conviction, in writing, within 10 calendar 
days, to his or her Federal agency grant officer, or other designee, 
unless the Federal agency has designated a central point for the receipt 
of such notices. Notification shall include the identification number(s) 
for each of the Federal agency's affected grants.

     Appendix A to Part 105-68--Certification Regarding Debarment, 
     Suspension, and Other Responsibility Matters--Primary Covered 
                              Transactions

                     Instructions for Certification

    1. By signing and submitting this proposal, the prospective primary 
participant is providing the certification set out below.
    2. The inability of a person to provide the certification required 
below will not necessarily result in denial of participation in this 
covered transaction. The prospective participant shall submit an 
explanation of why it cannot provide the certification set out below. 
The certification or explanation will be considered in connection with 
the department or agency's determination whether to enter into this 
transaction. However, failure of the prospective primary participant to 
furnish a certification or an explanation shall disqualify such person 
from participation in this transaction.
    3. The certification in this clause is a material representation of 
fact upon which reliance was placed when the department or agency 
determined to enter into this transaction. If it is later determined 
that the prospective primary participant knowingly rendered an erroneous 
certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal 
Government, the department or agency may terminate this transaction for 
cause or default.
    4. The prospective primary participant shall provide immediate 
written notice to the department or agency to which this proposal is 
submitted if at any time the prospective primary participant learns that 
its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous 
by reason of changed circumstances.
    5. The terms covered transaction, debarred, suspended, ineligible, 
lower tier covered transaction, participant, person, primary covered 
transaction, principal, proposal, and voluntarily excluded, as used in 
this clause, have the meanings set out in the Definitions and Coverage 
sections of the rules implementing Executive Order 12549. You may 
contact the department or agency to which this proposal is being 
submitted for assistance in obtaining a copy of those regulations.
    6. The prospective primary participant agrees by submitting this 
proposal that, should the proposed covered transaction be entered into, 
it shall not knowingly enter into any lower tier covered transaction 
with a person who is proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 
9.4, debarred, suspended, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded 
from participation in this covered transaction, unless authorized by the 
department or agency entering into this transaction.

[[Page 245]]

    7. The prospective primary participant further agrees by submitting 
this proposal that it will include the clause titled ``Certification 
Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and Voluntary Exclusion-
Lower Tier Covered Transaction,'' provided by the department or agency 
entering into this covered transaction, without modification, in all 
lower tier covered transactions and in all solicitations for lower tier 
covered transactions.
    8. A participant in a covered transaction may rely upon a 
certification of a prospective participant in a lower tier covered 
transaction that it is not proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, 
subpart 9.4, debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded 
from the covered transaction, unless it knows that the certification is 
erroneous. A participant may decide the method and frequency by which it 
determines the eligibility of its principals. Each participant may, but 
is not required to, check the List of Parties Excluded from Federal 
Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs.
    9. Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require 
establishment of a system of records in order to render in good faith 
the certification required by this clause. The knowledge and information 
of a participant is not required to exceed that which is normally 
possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business 
dealings.
    10. Except for transactions authorized under paragraph 6 of these 
instructions, if a participant in a covered transaction knowingly enters 
into a lower tier covered transaction with a person who is proposed for 
debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, suspended, debarred, 
ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in this 
transaction, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal 
Government, the department or agency may terminate this transaction for 
cause or default.

 Appendix C to Part 105-68--Certification Regarding Drug-Free Workplace 
                              Requirements

                     Instructions for Certification

    1. By signing and/or submitting this application or grant agreement, 
the grantee is providing the certification set out below.
    2. The certification set out below is a material representation of 
fact upon which reliance is placed when the agency awards the grant. If 
it is later determined that the grantee knowingly rendered a false 
certification, or otherwise violates the requirements of the Drug-Free 
Workplace Act, the agency, in addition to any other remedies available 
to the Federal Government, may take action authorized under the Drug-
Free Workplace Act.
    3. For grantees other than individuals, Alternate I applies.
    4. For grantees who are individuals, Alternate II applies.
    5. Workplaces under grants, for grantees other than individuals, 
need not be identified on the certification. If known, they may be 
identified in the grant application. If the grantee does not identify 
the workplaces at the time of application, or upon award, if there is no 
application, the grantee must keep the identity of the workplace(s) on 
file in its office and make the information available for Federal 
inspection. Failure to identify all known workplaces constitutes a 
violation of the grantee's drug-free workplace requirements.
    6. Workplace identifications must include the actual address of 
buildings (or parts of buildings) or other sites where work under the 
grant takes place. Categorical descriptions may be used (e.g., all 
vehicles of a mass transit authority or State highway department while 
in operation, State employees in each local unemployment office, 
performers in concert halls or radio studios).
    7. If the workplace identified to the agency changes during the 
performance of the grant, the grantee shall inform the agency of the 
change(s), if it previously identified the workplaces in question (see 
paragraph five).
    8. Definitions of terms in the Nonprocurement Suspension and 
Debarment common rule and Drug-Free Workplace common rule apply to this 
certification. Grantees' attention is called, in particular, to the 
following definitions from these rules:
    Controlled substance means a controlled substance in Schedules I 
through V of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 812) and as 
further defined by regulation (21 CFR 1308.11 through 1308.15);

[[Page 247]]

    Conviction means a finding of guilt (including a plea of nolo 
contendere) or imposition of sentence, or both, by any judicial body 
charged with the responsibility to determine violations of the Federal 
or State criminal drug statutes;
    Criminal drug statute means a Federal or non-Federal criminal 
statute involving the manufacture, distribution, dispensing, use, or 
possession of any controlled substance;
    Employee means the employee of a grantee directly engaged in the 
performance of work under a grant, including: (i) All direct charge 
employees; (ii) All indirect charge employees unless their impact or 
involvement is insignificant to the performance of the grant; and, (iii) 
Temporary personnel and consultants who are directly engaged in the 
performance of work under the grant and who are on the grantee's 
payroll. This definition does not include workers not on the payroll of 
the grantee (e.g., volunteers, even if used to meet a matching 
requirement; consultants or independent contractors not on the grantee's 
payroll; or employees of subrecipients or subcontractors in covered 
workplaces).

        Certification Regarding Drug-Free Workplace Requirements

             Alternate I. (Grantees Other Than Individuals)

    A. The grantee certifies that it will or will continue to provide a 
drug-free workplace by:
    (a) Publishing a statement notifying employees that the unlawful 
manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of a 
controlled substance is prohibited in the grantee's workplace and 
specifying the actions that will be taken against employees for 
violation of such prohibition;
    (b) Establishing an ongoing drug-free awareness program to inform 
employees about--
    (1) The dangers of drug abuse in the workplace;
    (2) The grantee's policy of maintaining a drug-free workplace;
    (3) Any available drug counseling, rehabilitation, and employee 
assistance programs; and
    (4) The penalties that may be imposed upon employees for drug abuse 
violations occurring in the workplace;
    (c) Making it a requirement that each employee to be engaged in the 
performance of the grant be given a copy of the statement required by 
paragraph (a);
    (d) Notifying the employee in the statement required by paragraph 
(a) that, as a condition of employment under the grant, the employee 
will--
    (1) Abide by the terms of the statement; and
    (2) Notify the employer in writing of his or her conviction for a 
violation of a criminal drug statute occurring in the workplace no later 
than five calendar days after such conviction;
    (e) Notifying the agency in writing, within ten calendar days after 
receiving notice under paragraph (d)(2) from an employee or otherwise 
receiving actual notice of such conviction. Employers of convicted 
employees must provide notice, including position title, to every grant 
officer or other designee on whose grant activity the convicted employee 
was working, unless the Federal agency has designated a central point 
for the receipt of such notices. Notice shall include the identification 
number(s) of each affected grant;
    (f) Taking one of the following actions, within 30 calendar days of 
receiving notice under paragraph (d)(2), with respect to any employee 
who is so convicted--
    (1) Taking appropriate personnel action against such an employee, up

Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended; or
    (2) Requiring such employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug

a Federal, State, or local health, law enforcement, or other appropriate 
agency;
    (g) Making a good faith effort to continue to maintain a drug-free 
workplace through implementation of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) 
and (f).
    B. The grantee may insert in the space provided below the site(s) 
for the performance of work done in connection with the specific grant:

Place of Performance (Street address, city, county, state, zip code)

_______________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________________

Check {time}  if there are workplaces on file that are not identified 
here.

              Alternate II. (Grantees Who Are Individuals)

    (a) The grantee certifies that, as a condition of the grant, he or 
she will not engage in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, 
dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance in conducting 
any activity with the grant;
    (b) If convicted of a criminal drug offense resulting from a 
violation occurring during the conduct of any grant activity, he or she 
will report the conviction, in writing, within 10 calendar days of the 
conviction, to every grant officer or other designee, unless the Federal 
agency designates a central point for the receipt of such notices. When 
notice is made to such a central point, it shall include

[[Page 248]]

the identification number(s) of each affected grant.

calendar quarter in which there occurs any event that requires 
disclosure or that materially affects the accuracy of the information

<R04>
                 Subpart B--Activities by Own Employees


<R05>
Sec. 105-69.200  Agency and legislative liaison.

    (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in Sec. 105-
69.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable 
compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or 
receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if 
the payment is for agency and legislative liaison activities not 
directly related to a covered Federal action.
    (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, providing any 
information specifically requested by an agency or Congress is allowable 
at any time.
    (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following 
agency and legislative liaison activities are allowable at any time only 
where they are not related to a specific solicitation for any covered 
Federal action:
    (1) Discussing with an agency (including individual demonstrations) 
the qualities and characteristics of the person's products or services, 
conditions or terms of sale, and service capabilities; and,
    (2) Technical discussions and other activities regarding the 
application or adaptation of the person's products or services for an 
agency's use.
    (d) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following 
agencies and legislative liaison activities are allowable only where 
they are prior to formal solicitation of any covered Federal action:
    (1) Providing any information not specifically requested but 
necessary for an agency to make an informed decision about initiation of 
a covered Federal action;
    (2) Technical discussions regarding the preparation of an 
unsolicited proposal prior to its official submission; and,
    (3) Capability presentations by persons seeking awards from an 
agency pursuant to the provisions of the Small Business Act, as amended 
by Public Law 95-507 and other subsequent amendments.
    (e) Only those activities expressly authorized by this section are

<R05>
Sec. 105-69.205  Professional and technical services.

    (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in Sec. 105-
69.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable 
compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or 
receiving a Federal contract,

[[Page 252]]

grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, 
renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, 
or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical 
services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or 
negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal 
contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting 
requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving 
that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.
    (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, ``professional 
and technical services'' shall be limited to advice and analysis 
directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, 
drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer 
is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the 
performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered 
directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, 
communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such 
as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed 
accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide 
advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical 
expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and 
solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered 
Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to 
influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis 
directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's 
proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not 
allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing 
professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent 
to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior 
to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable 
under this section since the engineer is providing technical services 
but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a 
covered Federal action.
    (c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for 
receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or 
regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, 
and any other requirements in the actual award documents.
    (d) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are 
allowable under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 105-69.210  Reporting.

    No reporting is required with respect to payments of reasonable 
compensation made to regularly employed officers or employees of a 
person.


<R04>
            Subpart C--Activities by Other Than Own Employees


<R05>
Sec. 105-69.300  Professional and technical services.

    (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in Sec. 105-
69.100 (a), does not apply in the case of any reasonable payment to a 
person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or 
receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional 
or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, 
or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal 
contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting 
requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving 
that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.
    (b) The reporting requirements in Sec. 105-69.110 (a) and (b) 
regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall 
not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered 
directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any 
commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a 
loan.
    (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, ``professional 
and technical services'' shall be limited to advice and analysis 
directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, 
drafting or a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer 
is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the 
performance or operational

[[Page 253]]

capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation 
of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to 
influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a 
technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under 
this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying 
their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or 
analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission 
or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, 
communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not 
provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the 
legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate 
one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because 
the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, 
communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer 
providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission 
of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the 
engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the 
preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.
    (d) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for 
receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or 
regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, 
and any other requirements in the actual award documents.
    (e) Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting 
or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade 
associations.
    (f) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are 
allowable under this section.


<R04>
                  Subpart D--Penalties and Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 105-69.400  Penalties.

    (a) Any person who makes an expenditure prohibited herein shall be 
subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than 
$100,000 for each such expenditure.
    (b) Any person who fails to file or amend the disclosure form (see 
appendix B) to be filed or amended if required herein, shall be subject 
to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 
for each such failure.
    (c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an 
administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced 
does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure 
occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with 
respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in 
writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.
    (d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount 
of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency 
shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the 
violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in 
business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability 
of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such 
other matters as may be appropriate.
    (e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section 
shall be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating 
circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be 
subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as 
determined by the agency head or his or her designee.
    (f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not 
prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply 
to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil 
penalty.


<R05>
Sec. 105-69.405  Penalty procedures.

    Agencies shall impose and collect civil penalties pursuant to the 
provisions of the Program Fraud and Civil Remedies Act, 31 U.S.C. 
sections 3803 (except subsection (c)), 3804, 3805, 3806, 3807, 3808, and 
3812, insofar as these provisions are not inconsistent with the 
requirements herein.

[[Page 254]]


<R05>
Sec. 105-69.410  Enforcement.

    The head of each agency shall take such actions as are necessary to 
ensure that the provisions herein are vigorously implemented and 
enforced in that agency.

<R05>
Sec. 105-69.500  Secretary of Defense.

    (a) The Secretary of Defense may exempt, on a case-by-case basis, a 
covered Federal action from the prohibition whenever the Secretary 
determines, in writing, that such an exemption is in the national 
interest. The Secretary shall transmit a copy of each such written 
exemption to Congress immediately after making such a determination.
    (b) The Department of Defense may issue supplemental regulations to

any successor order shall be reported only to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the

Representatives in accordance with procedures agreed to by such 
committees. Such information shall not be available for public 
inspection.
    (e) The first semi-annual compilation shall be submitted on May 31,

improve the requirements.
    (b) In the case of an agency that does not have an Inspector

opportunity to answer the complaint.

Head shall remand the case to the ALJ with instructions to grant the 
defendant an opportunity to answer.

file a timely answer is not excused, the Authority Head shall reinstate 
the initial decision of the ALJ, which shall become final and binding 
upon the parties 30 days after the Authority Head issues such decision.

<R05>
Sec. 105-71.102  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    Accrued expenditures mean the charges incurred by the grantee during 
a given period requiring the provision of funds for: (1) Goods and other 
tangible property received; (2) services performed by employees, 
contractors, subgrantees, subcontractors, and other payees; and (3) 
other amounts becoming owed under programs for which no current services 
or performance is required, such as annuities, insurance claims, and 
other benefit payments.
    Accrued income means the sum of: (1) Earnings during a given period 
from services performed by the grantee and goods and other tangible 
property delivered to purchasers, and (2) amounts becoming owed to the 
grantee for which no current services or performance is required by the 
grantee.

[[Page 275]]

    Acquisition cost of an item of purchased equipment means the net 
invoice unit price of the property including the cost of modifications, 
attachments, accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessary to make the 
property usable for the purpose for which it was acquired. Other charges 
such as the cost of installation, transportation, taxes, duty or 
protective in-transit insurance, shall be included or excluded from the 
unit acquisition cost in accordance with the grantee's regular 
accounting practices.
    Administrative requirements mean those matters common to grants in 
general, such as financial management, kinds and frequency of reports, 
and retention of records. These are distinguished from programmatic 
requirements, which concern matters that can be treated only on a 
program-by-program or grant-by-grant basis, such as kinds of activities 
that can be supported by grants under a particular program.
    Awarding agency means (1) with respect to a grant, the Federal 
agency, and (2) with respect to a subgrant, the party that awarded the 
subgrant.
    Cash contributions means the grantee's cash outlay, including the 
outlay of money contributed to the grantee or subgrantee by other public 
agencies and institutions, and private organizations and individuals. 
When authorized by Federal legislation, Federal funds received from 
other assistance agreements may be considered as grantee or subgrantee 
cash constributions.
    Contract means (except as used in the definitions for grant and 
subgrant in this section and except where qualified by Federal) a 
procurement contract under a grant or subgrant, and means a procurement 
subcontract under a contract.
    Cost sharing or matching means the value of the third party in-kind 
contributions and the portion of the costs of a federally assisted 
project or program not borne by the Federal Government.
    Cost-type contract means a contract or subcontract under a grant in 
which the contractor or subcontractor is paid on the basis of the costs 
it incurs, with or without a fee.
    Equipment means tangible, nonexpendable, personal property having a 
useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or 
more per unit. A grantee may use its own definition of equipment 
provided that such definition would at least include all equipment 
defined above.
    Expenditure report means: (1) For non-construction grants, the SF-
269 ``Financial Status Report'' (or other equivalent report); (2) for 
construction grants, the SF-271 ``Outlay Report and Request for 
Reimbursement'' (or other equivalent report).
    Federally recognized Indian tribal government means the governing 
body or a governmental agency of any Indian tribe, band, nation, or 
other organized group or community (including any Native village as 
defined in section 3 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, 85 
Stat. 688) certified by the Secretary of the Interior as eligible for 
the special programs and services provided by him through the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs.
    Government means a State or local government or a federally 
recognized Indian tribal government.
    Grant means an award of financial assistance, including cooperative 
agreements, in the form of money, or property in lieu of money, by the 
Federal Government to an eligible grantee. The term does not include 
technical assistance which provides services instead of money, or other 
assistance in the form of revenue sharing, loans, loan guarantees, 
interest subsidies, insurance, or direct appropriations. Also, the term 
does not include assistance, such as a fellowship or other lump sum 
award, which the grantee is not required to account for.
    Grantee means the government to which a grant is awarded and which 
is accountable for the use of the funds provided. The grantee is the 
entire legal entity even if only a particular component of the entity is 
designated in the grant award document.
    Local government means a county, municipality, city, town, township, 
local public authority (including any public and Indian housing agency 
under the United States Housing Act of 1937) school district, special 
district,

[[Page 276]]

intrastate district, council of governments (whether or not incorporated 
as a nonprofit corporation under State law), any other regional or 
interstate government entity, or any agency or instrumentality of a 
local government.
    Obligations means the amounts of orders placed, contracts and 
subgrants awarded, goods and services received, and similar transactions 
during a given period that will require payment by the grantee during 
the same or a future period.
    OMB means the United States Office of Management and Budget.
    Outlays (expenditures) mean charges made to the project or program. 
They may be reported on a cash or accrual basis. For reports prepared on 
a cash basis, outlays are the sum of actual cash disbursement for direct 
charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect expense incurred, 
the value of in-kind contributions applied, and the amount of cash 
advances and payments made to contractors and subgrantees. For reports 
prepared on an accrued expenditure basis, outlays are the sum of actual 
cash disbursements, the amount of indirect expense incurred, the value 
of in-kind contributions applied, and the new increase (or decrease) in 
the amounts owed by the grantee for goods and other property received, 
for services performed by employees, contractors, subgrantees, 
subcontractors, and other payees, and other amounts becoming owed under 
programs for which no current services or performance are required, such 
as annuities, insurance claims, and other benefit payments.
    Percentage of completion method refers to a system under which 
payments are made for construction work according to the percentage of 
completion of work, rather than to the grantee's cost incurred.
    Prior approval means documentation evidencing consent prior to 
incurring specific cost.
    Real property means land, including land improvements, structures 
and appurtenances thereto, excluding movable machinery and equipment.
    Share, when referring to the awarding agency's portion of real 
property, equipment or supplies, means the same percentage as the 
awarding agency's portion of the acquiring party's total costs under the 
grant to which the acquisition costs under the grant to which the 
acquisition cost of the property was charged. Only costs are to be 
counted--not the value of the third-party in-kind contributions.
    State means any of the several States of the United States, the 
District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or 
possession of the United States, or any agency or instrumentality of a 
State exclusive of local governments. The term does not include any 
public and Indian housing under United States Housing Act of 1937.
    Subgrant means an award of financial assistance in the form of 
money, or property in lieu of money, made under a grant by a grantee to 
an eligible subgrantee. The term includes financial assistance when 
provided by contractual legal agreement, but does not include 
procurement purchases, nor does it include any form of assistance which 
is excluded from the definition of grant in this part.
    Subgrantee means the government or other legal entity to which a 
subgrant is awarded and which is accountable to the grantee for the use 
of the funds provided.
    Supplies means all tangible personal property other than equipment 
as defined in this part.
    Suspension means depending on the context, either (1) temporary 
withdrawal of the authority to obligate grant funds pending corrective 
action by the grantee or subgrantee or a decision to terminate the 
grant, or (2) an action taken by a suspending official in accordance 
with agency regulations implementing E.O. 12549 to immediately exclude a 
person from participating in grant transactions for a period, pending 
completion of an investigation and such legal or debarment proceedings 
as may ensue.
    Termination means permanent withdrawal of the authority to obligate 
previously-awarded grant funds before that authority would otherwise 
expire. It also means the voluntary relinquishment of that authority by 
the grantee or subgrantee.
    Termination does not include: (1) Withdrawal of funds awarded on the 
basis of the grantee's underestimate of

[[Page 277]]

the unobligated balance in a prior period; (2) Withdrawal of the 
unobligated balance as of the expiration of a grant; (3) Refusal to 
extend a grant or award additional funds, to make a competing or 
noncompeting continuation, renewal, extension, or supplemental award; or 
(4) voiding of a grant upon determination that the award was obtained 
fraudulently, or was otherwise illegal or invalid from inception.
    Terms of a grant or subgrant mean all requirements of the grant or 
subgrant whether in statute, regulations, or the award document.
    Third party in-kind contributions mean property or services which 
benefit a federally assisted project or program and which are 
contributed by non-Federal third parties without charge to the grantee, 
or a cost-type contractor under the grant agreement.
    Unliquidated obligations for reports prepared on a cash basis mean 
the amount of obligations incurred by the grantee that has not been 
paid. For reports prepared on an accrued expenditure basis, they 
represent the amount of obligations incurred by the grantee for which an 
outlay has not been recorded.
    Unobligated balance means the portion of the funds authorized by the 
Federal agency that has not been obligated by the grantee and is 
determined by deducting the cumulative obligations from the cumulative 
funds authorized.

<R04>
                Subpart 105-71.11--Pre-Award Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.110  Forms for applying for grants.

    (a) Scope. (1) This section prescribes forms and instructions to be 
used by governmental organizations (except hospitals and institutions of 
higher education operated by a government) in applying for grants. This 
section is not applicable, however, to formula grant programs which do 
not require applicants to apply for funds on a project basis.
    (2) This section applies only to applications to Federal agencies 
for grants, and is not required to be applied by grantees in dealing 
with applicants for subgrants. However, grantees are encouraged to avoid 
more detailed or burdensome application requirements for subgrants.
    (b) Authorized forms and instructions for governmental 
organizations. (1) In applying for grants, applicants shall only use 
standard application forms or those prescribed by the granting agency 
with the approval of OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.
    (2) Applicants are not required to submit more than the original and 
two copies of preapplications or applications.

and evaluate the work under a grant. Other supplementary instructions 
may be issued only with the approval of OMB to the extent required under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. For any standard form, except the

applicant to disregard any line item that is not needed.
    (4) When a grantee applies for additional funding (such as a 
continuation or supplemental award) or amends a previously submitted 
application, only the affected pages need be submitted.

[[Page 279]]

Previously submitted pages with information that is still current need 
not be resubmitted.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.111  State plans.

    (a) Scope. The statutes for some programs require States to submit 
plans before receiving grants. Under regulations implementing Executive 
Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,'' States 
are allowed to simplify, consolidate and substitute plans. This section 
contains additional provisions for plans that are subject to regulations 
implementing the Executive order.
    (b) Requirements. A State need meet only Federal administrative or 
programmatic requirements for a plan that are in statutes or codified 
regulations.
    (c) Assurances. In each plan the State will include an assurance 
that the State shall comply with all applicable Federal statutes and 
regulations in effect with respect to the periods for which it receives 
grant funding. For this assurance and other assurances required in the 
plan, the State may:
    (1) Cite by number the statutory or regulatory provisions requiring 
the assurances and affirm that it gives the assurances required by those 
provisions,
    (2) Repeat the assurance language in the statutes or regulations, or
    (3) Develop its own language to the extent permitted by law.
    (d) Amendments. A State will amend a plan whenever necessary to 
reflect:
    (1) New or revised Federal statutes or regulations or
    (2) A material change in any State law, organization, policy, or 
State agency operation.

The State will obtain approval for the amendment and its effective date 
but need submit for approval only the amended portions of the plan.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.112  Special grant or subgrant conditions for ``high-risk'' grantees.

    (a) A grantee or subgrantee may be considered ``high risk'' if an 
awarding agency determines that a grantee or subgrantee:
    (1) Has a history of unsatisfactory performance, or
    (2) Is not financially stable, or
    (3) Has a management system which does not meet the management 
standards set forth in this part, or
    (4) Has not conformed to terms and conditions of previous awards, or
    (5) Is otherwise not responsible, and if the awarding agency 
determines that an award will be made, special conditions and/or 
restrictions shall correspond to the high risk condition and shall be 
included in the award.
    (b) Special conditions or restrictions may include:
    (1) Payment on a reimbursement basis;
    (2) Withholding authority to proceed to the next phase until receipt 
of evidence of acceptable performance within a given funding period;
    (3) Requiring additional, more detailed financial reports;

    (5) Requiring the grantee or subgrantee to obtain technical or 
management assistance; or
    (6) Establishing additional prior approvals.
    (c) If an awarding agency decides to impose such conditions, the 
awarding official will notify the grantee or subgrantee as early as 
possible, in writing, of:
    (1) The nature of the special conditions/restrictions;
    (2) The reason(s) for imposing them;
    (3) The corrective actions which must be taken before they will be 
removed and the time allowed for completing the corrective actions and
    (4) The method of requesting reconsideration of the conditions/
restrictions imposed.


<R04>
   Subpart 105-71.12--Post-Award Requirements/Financial Administration


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.120  Standards for financial management systems.

    (a) A State must expand and account for grant funds in accordance 
with State laws and procedures for expending and accounting for its own 
funds. Fiscal control and accounting procedures of the State, as well as 
its subgrantees and cost-type contractors, must be sufficient to--

[[Page 280]]

    (1) Permit preparation of reports required by this part and the 
statutes authorizing the grant, and
    (2) Permit the tracing of funds to a level of expenditures adequate 
to establish that such funds have not been used in violation of the 
restrictions and prohibitions of applicable statutes.
    (b) The financial management systems of other grantees and 
subgrantees must meet the following standards:
    (1) Financial reporting. Accurate, current, and complete disclosure 
of the financial result of financially assisted activities must be made 
in accordance with the financial reporting requirements of the grant or 
subgrant.
    (2) Accounting records. Grantees and subgrantees must maintain 
records which adequately identify the source and application of funds 
provided for financially-assisted activities. These records must contain 
information pertaining to grant or subgrant awards and authorizations, 
obligations, unobligated balances, assets, liabilities, outlays or 
expenditures, and income.
    (3) Internal control. Effective control and accountability must be 
maintained for all grant and subgrant cash, real and personal property, 
and other assets. Grantees and subgrantees must adequately safeguard all 
such property and must assure that it is used solely for authorized 
purposes.
    (4) Budget control. Actual expenditures or outlays must be compared 
with budgeted amounts for each grant or subgrant. Financial information 
must be related to performance or productivity data, including the 
development of unit cost information whenever appropriate or 
specifically required in the grant or subgrant agreement. If unit cost 
data are required, estimates based on available documentation will be 
accepted whenever possible.
    (5) Allowable cost. Applicable OMB cost principles, agency program 
regulations, and the terms of grant and subgrant agreements will be 
followed in determining the reasonableness, allowability and 
allocability of costs.
    (6) Source documentation. Accounting records must be supported by 
such source documentation as cancelled checks, paid bills, payrolls, 
time and attendance records, contract and subgrant award documents, etc.
    (7) Cash management. Procedures for minimizing the time elapsing 
between the transfer of funds from the U.S. Treasury and disbursement by 
grantees and subgrantees must be followed whenever advance payment 
procedures are used. Grantees must establish reasonable procedures to 
ensure the receipt of reports on subgrantees' cash balances and cash 
disbursements in sufficient time to enable them to prepare complete and 
accurate cash transactions reports to the awarding agency. When advances 
are made by letter-of-credit or electronic transfer of funds methods, 
the grantee must make drawdowns as close as possible to the time of 
making disbursements. Grantees must monitor cash drawdowns by their 
subgrantees to assure that they conform substantially to the same 
standards of timing and amount as apply to advances to the grantees.
    (c) An awarding agency may review the adequacy of the financial 
management system of any applicant for financial assistance as part of a 
preaward review or at any time subsequent to award.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.121  Payment.

    (a) Scope. This section prescribes the basic standard and the 
methods under which a Federal agency will make payments to grantees, and 
grantees will make payments to subgrantees and contractors.
    (b) Basic standard. Methods and procedures for payment shall 
minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and 
disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee, in accordance with Treasury 
regulations at 31 CFR part 205.
    (c) Advances. Grantees and subgrantees shall be paid in advance, 
provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness and ability to 
maintain procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer 
of the funds and their disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee.
    (d) Reimbursement. Reimbursement shall be the preferred method when 
the requirements in paragraph (c) of this

[[Page 281]]

section are not met. Grantees and subgrantees may also be paid by 
reimbursement for any construction grant. Except as otherwise specified 
in regulation, Federal agencies shall not use the percentage of 
completion method to pay construction grants. The grantee or subgrantee 
may use that method to pay its construction contractor, and if it does, 
awarding agency's payments to the grantee or subgrantee will be based on 
the grantee's or subgrantee's actual rate of disbursement.
    (e) Working capital advances. If a grantee cannot meet the criteria 
for advance payments described in paragraph (c) of this section, and the 
Federal agency has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because 
the grantee lacks sufficient working capital the awarding agency may 
provide cash or a working capital, advance basis. Under this procedure 
the awarding agency shall advance cash to the grantee to cover its 
estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to 
the grantee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the awarding agency shall 
reimburse the grantee for its actual cash disbursements. The working 
capital advance method of payment shall not be used by grantees or 
subgrantees if the reason for using such method is the unwillingness or 
inability of the grantee to provide timely advances to the subgrantee to 
meet the subgrantee's actual cash disbursements.
    (f) Effect of program income, refunds and audit recoveries on 
payment. (1) Grantees and subgrantees shall disburse repayments to and 
interest earned on a revolving fund before requesting additional cash 
payments for the same activity.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, grantees 
and subgrantees shall disburse program income, rebates, refunds, 
contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned on such funds 
before requesting additional cash payments.
    (g) Withholding payments. (1) Unless otherwise required by Federal 
statute, awarding agencies shall not withhold payments for proper 
charges incurred by grantees or subgrantees unless--
    (i) The grantee or subgrantee has failed to comply with grant award 
conditions or
    (ii) The grantee or subgrantee is indebted to the United States.
    (2) Cash withheld for failure to comply with grant award conditions, 
but without suspension of the grant, shall be released to the grantee 
upon subsequent compliance. When a grant is suspended, payment 
adjustments will be made in accordance with Sec. 105-71.143(c).
    (3) A Federal agency shall not make payment to grantees for amounts 
that are withheld by grantees or subgrantees from payment to contractors 
to assure satisfactory completion of work. Payments shall be made by the 
Federal agency when the grantees or subgrantees actually disburse the 
withheld funds to the contractors or to escrow accounts established to 
assure satisfactory completion of work.
    (h) Cash depositories. (1) Consistent with the national goal of 
expanding the opportunities for minority business enterprises, grantees 
and subgrantees are encouraged to use minority banks (a bank which is 
owned at least 50 percent by minority group members). A list of minority 
owned banks can be obtained from the Minority Business Development 
Agency, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230.
    (2) A grantee or subgrantee shall maintain a separate bank account 
only when required by Federal-State agreement.
    (i) Interest earned on advances. Except for interest earned on 
advances of funds exempt under the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (31 
U.S.C. 6501 et seq.) and the Indian Self-Determination Act (23 U.S.C. 
450), grantees and subgrantees shall promptly, but at least quarterly, 
remit interest earned on advances to the Federal agency. The grantee or 
subgrantee may keep interest amounts up to $100 per year for 
administrative expenses.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.122  Allowable costs.

    (a) Limitation on use of funds. Grant funds may be used only for:
    (1) The allowable costs of the grantees, subgrantees and cost-type 
contractors, including allowable costs in the form of payments to fixed-
price contractors; and

[[Page 282]]

    (2) Reasonable fees or profit to cost-type contractors but not any 
fee or profit (or other increment above allowable costs) to the grantee 
or subgrantee.
    (b) Applicable cost principles. For each kind of organization, there 
is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. 
Allowable costs will be determined in accordance with the cost 
principles applicable to the organization incurring the costs. The 
following chart lists the kinds of organizations and the applicable cost 
principles:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
           For the costs of a--                Use the principles in--

 circular.                                   accounting standards that
                                             comply with cost principles
                                             acceptable to the Federal
                                             agency.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.123  Period of availability of funds.

    (a) General. Where a funding period is specified, a grantee may 
charge to the award only costs resulting from obligations of the funding 
period unless carryover or unobligated balances are permitted, in which 
case the carryover balances may be charged for costs resulting from 
obligations of the subsequent funding period.
    (b) Liquidation of obligations. A grantee must liquidate all 
obligations incurred under the award not later than 90 days after the 
end of the funding period (or as specified in a program regulation) to 
coincide with the submission of the annual Financial Status Report (SF-
269). The Federal agency may extend this deadline at the request of the 
grantee.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.124  Matching or cost sharing.

    (a) Basic rule: Costs and contributions acceptable. With the 
qualifications and exceptions listed in paragraph (b) of this section, a 
matching or cost sharing requirement may be satisfied by either or both 
of the following:
    (1) Allowable costs incurred by the grantee, subgrantee or cost-type 
contractor under the assistance agreement. This includes allowable costs 
borne by non-Federal grants or by other cash donations from non-Federal 
third parties.
    (2) The value of third party in-kind contributions applicable to the 
period to which the cost sharing or matching requirements apply.
    (b) Qualifications and exceptions--(1) Costs borne by other Federal 
grant agreements. Except as provided by Federal statute, a cost sharing 
or matching requirement may not be met by costs borne by another Federal 
grant. This prohibition does not apply to income earned by a grantee or 
subgrantee from a contract awarded under another Federal grant.
    (2) General revenue sharing. For the purpose of this section, 
general revenue sharing funds distributed under 31 U.S.C. 6702 are not 
considered Federal grant funds.
    (3) Cost or contributions counted towards other Federal costs-
sharing requirements. Neither costs nor the values of third party in-
kind contributions may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or 
matching requirement of a grant agreement if they have been or will be 
counted towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement of 
another Federal grant agreement, a Federal procurement contract or any 
other award of Federal funds.
    (4) Costs financed by program income. Costs financed by program 
income, as defined in Sec. 105-71.125, shall not count towards 
satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement unless they are 
expressly permitted in the terms of the assistance agreement. (This use 
of general program income is described in Sec. 105-71.125(g).)
    (5) Services or property financed by income earned by contractors. 
Contractors under a grant may earn income from the activities carried 
out under the contract in addition to the amounts earned from the party 
awarding the contract. No costs of services or property supported by 
this income may count toward satisfying a cost sharing or matching 
requirement unless other

[[Page 283]]

provisions of the grant agreement expressly permit this kind of income 
to be used to meet the requirement.
    (6) Records. Costs and third party in-kind contributions counting 
towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement must be 
verifiable from the records of grantees and subgrantee or cost-type 
contractors. These records must show how the value placed on third party 
in-kind contributions was derived. To the extent feasible, volunteer 
services will be supported by the same methods that the organization 
uses to support the allocability of regular personnel costs.
    (7) Special standards for third party in-kind contributions. (i) 
Third party in-kind contributions count towards satisfying a cost 
sharing or matching requirement only where, if the party receiving the 
contributions were to pay for them, the payments would be allowable 
costs.
    (ii) Some third party in-kind contributions are goods and services 
that, if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor receiving the 
contribution had to pay for them, the payments would have been an 
indirect cost. Costs sharing or matching credit for such contributions 
shall be given only if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor has 
established, along with its regular indirect cost rate, a special rate 
for allocating to individual projects or programs the value of 
contributions.
    (iii) A third party in-kind contribution to a fixed price contract 
may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement only 
if it results in:
    (A) An increase in the services or property provided under the 
contract (without additional cost to the grantee or subgrantee) or
    (B) A cost savings to the grantee or subgrantee.
    (iv) The values placed on third party in-kind contributions for cost 
sharing or matching purposes will conform to the rules in the succeeding 
sections of this part. If a third party in-kind contribution is a type 
not treated in those sections, the value placed upon it shall be fair 
and reasonable.
    (c) Valuation of donated services--(1) Volunteer services. Unpaid 
services provided to a grantee or subgrantee by individuals will be 
valued at rates consistent with those ordinarily paid for similar work 
in the grantee's or subgrantee's organization. If the grantee or 
subgrantee does not have employees performing similar work, the rates 
will be consistent with those ordinarily paid by other employers for 
similar work in the same labor market. In either case, a reasonable 
amount for fringe benefits may be included in the valuation.
    (2) Employees of other organizations. When an employer other than a 
grantee, subgrantee, or cost-type contractor furnishes free of charge 
the services of an employee in the employee's normal line of work, the 
services will be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay exclusive 
of the employee's fringe benefits and overhead costs. If the services 
are in a different line of work, paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
applies.
    (d) Valuation of third party donated supplies and loaned equipment 
or space. (1) If a third party donates supplies, the contribution will 
be valued at the market value of the supplies at the time of donation.
    (2) If a third party donates the use of equipment or space in a 
building but retains title, the contribution will be valued at the fair 
rental rate of the equipment or space.
    (e) Valuation of third party donated equipment, buildings, and land. 
If a third party donates equipment, buildings, or land, and the title 
passes to a grantee or subgrantee, the treatment of the donated property 
will depend upon the purpose of the grant or subgrant as follows:
    (1) Awards for capital expenditures. If the purpose of the grant or 
subgrant is to assist the grantee or subgrantee in the acquisition of 
property, the market value of that property at the time of donation may 
be counted as cost sharing or matching.
    (2) Other awards. If assisting in the acquisition of property is not 
the purpose of the grant or subgrant, paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (ii) of 
this section apply.
    (i) If approval is obtained from the awarding agency, the market 
value at the time of donation of the donated equipment or buildings and 
the fair rental rate of the donated land may be

[[Page 284]]

counted as cost sharing or matching. In the case of a subgrant, the 
terms of the grant agreement may require that the approval be obtained 
from the Federal agency as well as the grantee. In all cases, the 
approval may be given only if a purchase of the equipment or rental of 
the land would be approved as an allowable direct cost. If any part of 
the donated property was acquired with Federal funds, only the non-
Federal share of the property may be counted as cost sharing or 
matching.
    (ii) If approval is not obtained under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this 
section, no amount may be counted for donated land, and only 
depreciation or use allowances may be counted for donated equipment and 
buildings. The depreciation or use allowances for this property are not 
treated as third party in-kind contributions. Instead, they are treated 
as costs incurred by the grantee or subgrantee. They are computed and 
allocated (usually as indirect costs) in accordance with the cost 
principles specified in Sec. 105-71.122, in the same way as depreciation 
or use allowances for purchased equipment and buildings. The amount of 
depreciation or use allowances for donated equipment and buildings is 
based on the property's market value at the time it was donated.
    (f) Valuation of grantee or subgrantee donated real property for 
construction/acquisition. If a grantee or subgrantee donates real 
property for a construction or facilities acquisition project, the 
current market value of that property may be counted as cost sharing or 
matching. If any part of the donated property was acquired with Federal 
funds, only the non-Federal share of the property may be counted as cost 
sharing or matching.
    (g) Appraisal of real property. In some cases under paragraphs (d), 
(e) and (f) of this section, it will be necessary to establish the 
market value of land or a building or the fair rental rate of land or of 
space in the building. In these cases, the Federal agency may require 
the market value or fair rental value be set by an independent 
appraiser, and that the value or rate be certified by the grantee. This 
requirement will also be imposed by the grantee on subgrantees.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.125  Program income.

    (a) General. Grantees are encouraged to earn income to defray 
program costs. Program income includes income from fees for services 
performed, from the use or rental of real or personal property acquired 
with grant funds, from the sale of commodities or items fabricated under 
a grant agreement, and from payments of principal and interest on loans 
made with grant funds. Except as otherwise provided in regulations of 
the Federal agency, program income does not include interest on grant 
funds, rebates, credits, discounts, refunds, etc. and interest earned on 
any of them.
    (b) Definition of program income. Program income means gross income 
received by the grantee or subgrantee directly generated by a grant 
supported activity, or earned only as a result of the grant agreement 
during the grant period. ``During the grant period'' is the time between 
the effective date of the award and the ending date of the award 
reflected in the final financial report.
    (c) Cost of generating program income. If authorized by Federal 
regulations or the grant agreement, costs incident to the generation of 
program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program 
income.
    (d) Government revenues. Taxes, special assessments, levies, fines, 
and other such revenues raised by a grantee or subgrantee are not 
program income unless the revenues are specifically identified in the 
grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as program income.
    (e) Royalties. Income from royalties and license fees for 
copyrighted material, patents, and inventions developed by a grantee or 
subgrantee is program income only if the revenues are specifically 
identified in the grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as 
program income. (See Sec. 105-71.134.)
    (f) Property. Proceeds from the sale of real property or equipment 
will be handled in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 105-71.131 
and Sec. 105-71.132.
    (g) Use of program income. Program income shall be deducted from 
outlays which may be both Federal and non-Federal as described below, 
unless the Federal agency regulations or the

[[Page 285]]

grant agreement specify another alternative (or a combination of the 
alternatives). In specifying alternatives, the Federal agency may 
distinguish between income earned by the grantee and income earned by 
subgrantees and between the sources, kinds, or amounts of income. When 
Federal agencies authorize the alternatives in paragraphs (g) (2) and 
(3) of this section, program income in excess of any limits stipulated 
shall also be deducted from outlays.
    (1) Deduction. Ordinarily program income shall be deducted from 
total allowable costs to determine the net allowable costs. Program 
income shall be used for current costs unless the Federal agency 
authorizes otherwise. Program income which the grantee did not 
anticipate at the time of the award shall be used to reduce the Federal 
agency and grantee contributions rather than to increase the funds 
committed to the project.
    (2) Addition. When authorized, program income may be added to the 
funds committed to the grant agreement by the Federal agency and the 
grantee. The program income shall be used for the purposes and under the 
conditions of the grant agreement.
    (3) Cost sharing or matching. When authorized, program income may be 
used to meet the cost sharing or matching requirement of the grant 
agreement. The amount of the Federal grant award remains the same.
    (h) Income after the award period. There are no Federal requirements 
governing the disposition of program income earned after the end of the 
award period (i.e., until the ending date of the final financial report, 
see paragraph (a) of this section), unless the terms of the agreement or 
the Federal agency regulations provide otherwise.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.126  Non-Federal audit.

    (a) Basic rule. Grantees and subgrantees are responsible for 
obtaining audits in accordance with the Single Audit Act Amendments of 
1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507) and revised OMB Circular A-133, ``Audits of 
States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.'' The audits 
shall be made by an independent auditor in accordance with generally 
accepted government auditing standards covering financial audits.
    (b) Subgrantees. State or local governments, as those terms are 
defined for purposes of the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, that 
provide Federal awards to a subgrantee, which expends $300,000 or more 
(or other amount as specified by OMB) in Federal awards in a fiscal 
year, shall:
    (1) Determine whether State or local subgrantees have met the audit 
requirements of the Act and whether subgrantees covered by OMB Circular 
A-110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements 
with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit 
Organizations,'' have met the audit requirements of the Act. Commercial 
contractors (private for-profit and private and governmental 
organizations) providing goods and services to State and local 
governments are not required to have a single audit performed. State and 
local governments should use their own procedures to ensure that the 
contractor has complied with laws and regulations affecting the 
expenditure of Federal funds;
    (2) Determine whether the subgrantee spent Federal assistance funds 
provided in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. This may be 
accomplished by reviewing an audit of the subgrantee made in accordance 
with the Act, Circular A-110, or through other means (e.g., program 
reviews) if the subgrantee has not had such an audit;
    (3) Ensure the appropriate corrective action is taken within six 
months after receipt of the audit report in instance of noncompliance 
with Federal laws and regulations;
    (4) Consider whether subgrantee audits necessitate adjustment of the 
grantee's own records; and
    (5) Require each subgrantee to permit independent auditors to have 
access to the records and financial statements.
    (c) Auditor selection. In arranging for audit services, Sec. 105-
71.136 shall be followed.

   Subpart 105-71.13--Post-Award Requirements/Changes, Property, and 
                                Subawards


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.130  Changes.

    (a) General. Grantees and subgrantees are permitted to rebudget 
within the approved direct cost budget to meet unanticipated 
requirements and may make limited program changes to the approved 
project. However, unless waived by the awarding agency, certain types of 
post-award changes in budgets and projects shall require the prior 
written approval of the awarding agency.
    (b) Relation to cost principles. The applicable cost principles (see 
Sec. 105-71.122) contain requirements for prior approval of certain 
types of costs. Except where waived, those requirements apply to all 
grants and subgrants even if paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section 
do not.
    (c) Budget changes-- (1) Non-construction projects. Except as stated 
in other regulations or an award document, grantees or subgrantees shall 
obtain the prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the 
following changes is anticipated under a non-construction award:
    (i) Any revision which would result in the need for additional 
funding.
    (ii) Unless waived by the awarding agency, cumulative transfers 
among direct cost categories, or, if applicable, among separately 
budgeted programs, projects, functions, or activities which exceed or 
are expected to exceed ten percent of the current total approved budget, 
whenever the awarding agency's share exceeds $100,000.
    (iii) Transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (i.e., from 
direct payments to trainees to other expense categories).
    (2) Construction projects. Grantees and subgrantees shall obtain 
prior written approval for any budget revision which would result in the 
need for additional funds.
    (3) Combined construction and non-construction projects. When a 
grant or subgrant provides funding for both construction and non-
construction activities, the grantee or subgrantee must obtain prior 
written approval from the awarding agency before making any fund or 
budget transfer from non-construction to construction or vice versa.
    (d) Programmatic changes. Grantees or subgrantees must obtain the 
prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the following 
actions is anticipated:
    (1) Any revision of the scope or objectives of the project 
(regardless of whether there is an associated budget revision requiring 
prior approval).
    (2) Need to extend the period of availability of funds.
    (3) Changes in key persons in cases where specified in an 
application or a grant award. In research projects, a change in the 
project director or principal investigator shall always require approval 
unless waived by the awarding agency.
    (4) Under non-construction projects, contracting out, subgranting 
(if authorized by law) or otherwise obtaining the services of a third 
party to perform activities which are central to the purposes of the 
award. This approval requirement is in addition to the approval 
requirements of Sec. 105-71.136 but does not apply to the procurement of 
equipment, supplies, and general support services.
    (e) Additional prior approval requirements. The awarding agency may 
not require prior approval for any budget revision which is not 
described in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (f) Requesting prior approval. (1) A request for prior approval of 
any budget revision will be in the same budget format the grantee used 
in its application and shall be accomplished by a narrative 
justification for the proposed revision.
    (2) A request for a prior approval under the applicable Federal cost 
principles (see Sec. 105-71.122) may be made by letter.
    (3) A request by a subgrantee for prior approval will be addressed 
in writing to the grantee. The grantee will promptly review such request 
and shall approve or disapprove the request in writing. A grantee will 
not approve any budget or project revision which is inconsistent with 
the purpose or terms and conditions of the Federal grant to the grantee. 
If the revision, requested by the subgrantee would result in a change to 
the grantee's approved

[[Page 287]]

project which requires Federal prior approval, the grantee will obtain 
the Federal agency's approval before approving the subgrantee's request.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.131  Real property.

    (a) Title. Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in 
this section, title to real property acquired under a grant or subgrant 
will vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) Use. Except as otherwise provided by Federal statutes, real 
property will be used for the originally authorized purposes as long as 
needed for that purpose, and the grantee or subgrantee shall not dispose 
of or encumber its title or other interests.
    (c) Disposition. When real property is no longer needed for the 
originally authorized purpose, the grantee or subgrantee will request 
disposition instructions from the awarding agency. The instructions will 
provide for one of the following alternatives.
    (1) Retention of title. Retain title after compensating the awarding 
agency. The amount paid to the awarding agency will be computed by 
applying the awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost 
of the original purchase to the fair market value of the property. 
However, in those situations where a grantee or subgrantee is disposing 
of real property acquired with grant funds and acquiring replacement 
real property under the same program, the net proceeds from the 
disposition may be used as an offset to the cost of the replacement 
property.
    (2) Sale of property. Sell the property and compensate the awarding 
agency. The amount due to the awarding agency will be calculated by 
applying the awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost 
of the original purchase to the proceeds of the sale after deduction of 
any actual and reasonable selling and fixing-up expenses. If the grant 
is still active, the net proceeds from the sale may be offset against 
the original cost of the property. When a grantee or subgrantee is 
directed to sell property, sales procedures shall be followed that 
provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the 
highest possible return.
    (3) Transfer of title. Transfer title to the awarding agency or to a 
third-party designated/approved by the awarding agency. The grantee or 
subgrantee shall be paid an amount calculated by applying the grantee or 
subgrantee's percentage of participation in the purchase of the real 
property to the current fair market value of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.132  Equipment.

    (a) Title. Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in 
this section, title to equipment acquired under a grant or subgrant will 
vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) States. A State will use, manage, and dispose of equipment 
acquired under a grant by the State in accordance with State laws and 
procedures. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow paragraphs (c) 
through (e) of this section.
    (c) Use. (1) Equipment shall be used by the grantee or subgrantee in 
the program or project for which it was acquired as long as needed, 
whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by 
Federal funds. When no longer needed for the original program or 
project, the equipment may be used in other activities currently or 
previously supported by a Federal agency.
    (2) The grantee or subgrantee shall also make equipment available 
for use on other projects or programs currently or previously supported 
by the Federal Government, providing such use will not interfere with 
the work on the projects or program for which it was originally 
acquired. First preference for other use shall be given to other 
programs or projects supported by the awarding agency. User fees should 
be considered if appropriate.
    (3) Notwithstanding the encouragement in Sec. 105-71.125(a) to earn 
program income, the grantee or subgrantee must not use equipment 
acquired with grant funds to provide services for a fee to compete 
unfairly with private companies that provide equivalent services, unless 
specifically permitted or contemplated by Federal statute.
    (4) When acquiring replacement equipment, the grantee or subgrantee

[[Page 288]]

may use the equipment to be replaced as a trade-in or sell the property 
and use the proceeds to offset the cost of the replacement property, 
subject to the approval of the awarding agency.
    (d) Management requirements. Procedures for managing equipment 
(including replacement equipment), whether acquired in whole or in part 
with grant funds, until disposition takes place will, as a minimum, meet 
the following requirements:
    (1) Property records must be maintained that include a description 
of the property, a serial number or other identification number, the 
source of property, who holds the title, the acquisition date, and cost 
of the property, percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the 
property, the location, use and condition of the property, and any 
ultimate disposition data including the data of disposal and sale price 
of the property.
    (2) A physical inventory of the property must be taken and the 
results reconciled with the property records at least once every two 
years.
    (3) A control system must be developed to ensure adequate safeguards 
to prevent loss, damage or theft of the property. Any loss, damage or 
theft shall be investigated.
    (4) Adequate maintenance procedures must be developed to keep the 
property in good condition.
    (5) If the grantee or subgrantee is authorized or required to sell 
the property, proper sales procedures must be established to ensure the 
highest possible return.
    (e) Disposition. When original or replacement equipment acquired 
under a grant or subgrant is no longer needed for the original project 
or program or for other activities currently or previously supported by 
a Federal agency, disposition of the equipment will be made as follows:
    (1) Items of equipment with a current per-unit fair market value of 
less than $5,000 may be retained, sold or otherwise disposed of with no 
further obligation to the awarding agency.
    (2) Items of equipment with a current per unit fair market value in 
excess of $5,000 may be retained or sold and the awarding agency shall 
have a right to an amount calculated by multiplying the current market 
value or proceeds from sale by the awarding agency's share of the 
equipment.
    (3) In cases where a grantee or subgrantee fails to take appropriate 
disposition actions, the awarding agency may direct the grantee or 
subgrantee to take excess and disposition actions.
    (f) Federal equipment. In the event grantee or subgrantee is 
provided federally-owned equipment:
    (1) Title will remain vested in the Federal Government.
    (2) Grantees or subgrantees will manage the equipment in accordance 
with Federal agency rules and procedures, and submit an annual inventory 
listing.
    (3) When the equipment is no longer needed, the grantee or 
subgrantee will request disposition instructions from the Federal 
agency.
    (g) Right to transfer title. The Federal awarding agency may reserve 
the right to transfer title to the Federal Government or a third party 
named by the awarding agency when such a third party is otherwise 
eligible under existing statutes. Such transfers shall be subject to the 
following standards:
    (1) The property shall be identified in the grant or otherwise made 
known to the grantee in writing.
    (2) The Federal awarding agency shall issue disposition instruction 
within 120 calendar days after the end of the Federal support of the 
project for which it was acquired. If the Federal awarding agency fails 
to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar-day period the 
grantee shall follow Sec. 105-71.132(e).
    (3) When title to equipment is transferred, the grantee shall be 
paid an amount calculated by applying the percentage of participation in 
the purchase to the current fair market value of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.133  Supplies.

    (a) Title. Title to supplies acquired under a grant or subgrant will 
vest, upon acquisition, in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
    (b) Disposition. If there is a residual inventory of unused supplies 
exceeding $5,000 in total aggregate fair market value upon termination 
or completion of the award, and if the supplies are

[[Page 289]]

not needed for any other federally sponsored programs or projects, the 
grantee or subgrantee shall compensate the awarding agency for its 
share.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.134  Copyrights.

    The Federal awarding agency reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive, 
and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish or otherwise use, and to 
authorize others to use, for Federal Government purposes:
    (a) The copyright in any work developed under a grant, subgrant, or 
contract under a grant or subgrant; and
    (b) Any rights of copyright to which a grantee, subgrantee or a 
contractor purchases ownership with grant support.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.135  Subawards to debarred and suspended parties.

    Grantees and subgrantees must not make any award or permit any award 
(subgrant or contract) at any tier to any party which is debarred or 
suspended or is otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation 
in Federal assistance programs under Executive Order 12549, ``Debarment 
and Suspension''.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.136  Procurement.

    (a) States. When procuring property and services under a grant, a 
State will allow the same policies and procedures it uses for 
procurements from its non-Federal funds. The State will ensure that 
every purchase order or other contract includes any clauses required by 
Federal statutes and executive orders and their implementing 
regulations. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow paragraphs (b) 
through (i) in this section.
    (b) Procurement standards. (1) Grantees and subgrantees will use 
their own procurement procedures which reflect applicable State and 
local laws and regulations, provided that the procurements conform to 
applicable Federal law and the standards identified in this section.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a contract administration 
system which ensures that contractors perform in accordance with the 
terms, conditions and specifications of their contracts or purchase 
orders.
    (3) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a written code of 
standards of conduct governing the performance of their employees 
engaged in the award and administration of contracts. No employee, 
officer or agent of the grantee or subgrantee shall participate in 
selection, or in the award or administration of a contract supported by 
Federal funds if a conflict of interest, real or apparent, would be 
involved. Such a conflict would arise when:
    (i) The employee, officer or agent,
    (ii) Any member of his immediate family,
    (iii) His or her partner, or
    (iv) An organization which employs, or is about to employ, any of 
the above, has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for 
award. The grantee's or subgrantee's officers, employees or agent will 
neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors or anything of monetary 
value from contractors, potential contractors, or parties to 
subagreements. Grantees and subgrantees may set minimum rules where the 
financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item 
of nominal intrinsic value. To the extent permitted by State or local 
law or regulations, such standards of conduct will provide for 
penalties, sanctions, or other disciplinary actions for violations of 
such standards by the grantee's officers, employees, or agents, or by 
contractors or their agents. The awarding agency may in regulation 
provide additional prohibitions relative to real, apparent, or potential 
conflicts of interest.
    (4) Grantee and subgrantee procedures will provide for a review of 
proposed procurements to avoid purchase of unnecessary or duplicative 
items. Consideration should be given to consolidating or breaking out 
procurements to obtain a more economical purchase. Where appropriate, an 
analysis will be made of lease versus purchase alternatives, and any 
other appropriate analysis to determine the most economical approach.
    (5) To foster greater economy and efficiency, grantees and 
subgrantees are encouraged to enter into State and local 
intergovernmental agreements

[[Page 290]]

for procurement or use of common goods and services.
    (6) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use Federal excess 
and surplus property in lieu of purchasing new equipment and property 
whenever such use is feasible and reduces project costs.
    (7) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use value engineering 
clauses in contracts for construction projects of sufficient size to 
offer reasonable opportunities for cost reductions. Value engineering is 
a systematic and creative analysis of each contract item or task to 
ensure that its essential function is provided at the overall lower 
cost.
    (8) Grantees and subgrantees will make awards only to responsible 
contractors possessing the ability to perform successfully under the 
terms and conditions of a proposed procurement. Consideration will be 
given to such matters as contractor integrity, compliance with public 
policy, record of past performance, and financial and technical 
resources.
    (9) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain records sufficient to 
detail the significant history of a procurement. These records will 
include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: Rationale for 
the method of procurement, selection of contract type, contractor 
selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price.
    (10) Grantees and subgrantees will use time and material type 
contracts only--
    (i) After a determination that no other contract is suitable, and
    (ii) If the contract includes a ceiling price that the contractor 
exceeds at its own risk.
    (11) Grantees and subgrantees alone will be responsible, in 
accordance with good administrative practice and sound business 
judgment, for the settlement of all contractual and administrative 
issues arising out of procurements. These issues include, but are not 
limited to source evaluation, protests, disputes and claims. These 
standards do not relieve the grantee or subgrantee of any contractual 
responsibilities under its contracts. Federal agencies will not 
substitute their judgment for that of the grantee or subgrantee unless 
the matter is primarily a Federal concern. Violations of law will be 
referred to the local, State or Federal authority having proper 
jurisdiction.
    (12) Grantees and subgrantees will have protest procedures to handle 
and resolve disputes relating to their procurements and shall in all 
instances disclose information regarding the protests to the awarding 
agency. A protestor must exhaust all administrative remedies with the 
grantee and subgrantee before pursuing a protest with the Federal 
agency. Reviews of protests by the Federal agency will be limited to:
    (i) Violations of Federal law or regulations and the standards of 
this section (violations of State or local law will be under the 
jurisdiction of State or local authorities) and
    (ii) Violations of grantee's or subgrantee's protest procedures for 
failure to review a complaint or protest. Protests received by the 
Federal agency other than those specified above will be referred to the 
grantee or subgrantee.
    (c) Competition. (1) All procurement transactions will be conducted 
in a manner providing full and open competition consistent with the 
standards of Sec. 105-71.136. Some of the situations considered to be 
restrictive of competition include but are not limited to:
    (i) Placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to 
qualify to do business,
    (ii) Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive bonding,
    (iii) Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between 
affiliated companies,
    (iv) Noncompetitive awards to consultants that are on retainer 
contracts,
    (v) Organizational conflicts of interest,
    (vi) Specifying only a ``brand name'' product instead of allowing 
``an equal'' product to be offered and describing the performance of 
other relevant requirements of the procurement, and
    (vii) Any arbitrary action in the procurement process.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will conduct procurements in a manner 
that prohibits the use of statutorily or administratively imposed in-
State or local geographical preferences in the evaluation of bids or 
proposals, except

[[Page 291]]

in those cases where applicable Federal statutes expressly mandate or 
encourage geographic preference. Nothing in this section preempts State 
licensing laws. When contracting for architectural and engineering (A/E) 
services, geographic location may be a selection criteria provided its 
application leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the 
nature and size of the project, to compete for the contract.
    (3) Grantees will have written selection procedures for procurement 
transactions. These procedures will ensure that all solicitations:
    (i) Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical 
requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured. Such 
description shall not, in competitive procurements, contain features 
which unduly restrict competition. The description may include a 
statement of the qualitative nature of the material, product or service 
to be procured, and when necessary, shall set forth those minimum 
essential characteristics and standards to which it must conform if it 
is to satisfy its intended use. Detailed product specifications should 
be avoided if at all possible. When it is impractical or uneconomical to 
make a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements, a 
``brand name or equal'' description may be used as a means to define the 
performance or other salient requirements of a procurement. The specific 
features of the named brand which must be met by offerors shall be 
clearly stated; and
    (ii) Identify all requirements which the offerors must fulfill and 
all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.
    (4) Grantees and subgrantees will ensure that all prequalified lists 
of persons, firms, or products which are used in acquiring goods and 
services are current and include enough qualified sources to ensure 
maximum open and free competition. Also, grantees and subgrantees will 
not preclude potential bidders from qualifying during the solicitation 
period.
    (d) Methods of procurement to be followed--(1) Procurement by small 
purchase procedures. Small purchase procedures are those relatively 
simple and informal procurement methods for securing services, supplies, 
or other property that do not cost more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) (currently set at $100,000). If 
small purchase procedures are used, price or rate quotations shall be 
obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources.
    (2) Procurement by sealed bids (formal advertising). Bids are 
publicly solicited and a firm-fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit 
price) is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with 
all the material terms and conditions of the invitation for bids, is the 
lowest in price. The sealed bid method is the preferred method for 
procuring construction, if the conditions in Sec. 105-71.136(d)(2)(i) 
apply.
    (i) In order for sealed bidding to be feasible, the following 
conditions should be present:
    (A) A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase 
description is available;
    (B) Two or more responsible bidders are willing and able to compete 
effectively and for the business; and
    (C) The procurement lends itself to a firm fixed price contract and 
the selection of the successful bidder can be made principally on the 
basis of price.
    (ii) If sealed bids are used, the following requirements apply:
    (A) The invitation for bids will be publicly advertised and bids 
shall be solicited from an adequate number of known suppliers, providing 
them sufficient time prior to the date set for opening the bids;
    (B) The invitation for bids, which will include any specifications 
and pertinent attachments, shall define the items or services in order 
for the bidder to properly respond;
    (C) All bids will be publicly opened at the time and place 
prescribed in the invitation for bids;
    (D) A firm fixed-price contract award will be made in writing to the 
lowest responsive and responsible bidder. Where specified in bidding 
documents, factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and life 
cycle costs shall be considered in determining which bid is lowest. 
Payment discounts will only be used to determine the low bid when prior 
experience indicates that such

[[Page 292]]

discounts are usually taken advantage of; and
    (E) Any or all bids may be rejected if there is a sound documented 
reason.
    (3) Procurement by competitive proposals. The technique of 
competitive proposals is normally conducted with more than one source 
submitting an offer, and either a fixed-price or cost-reimbursement type 
contract is awarded. It is generally used when conditions are not 
appropriate for the use of sealed bids. If this method is used, the 
following requirements apply:
    (i) Requests for proposals will be publicized and identify all 
evaluation factors and their relative importance. Any response to 
publicized requests for proposals shall be honored to the maximum extent 
practical;
    (ii) Proposals will be solicited from an adequate number of 
qualified sources;
    (iii) Grantees and subgrantees will have a method for conducting 
technical evaluations of the proposals received and for selecting 
awardees;
    (iv) Awards will be made to the responsible firm whose proposal is 
most advantageous to the program, with price and other factors 
considered; and
    (v) Grantees and subgrantees may use competitive proposal procedures 
for qualifications-based procurement of architectural/engineering (A/E) 
professional services whereby competitors' qualifications are evaluated 
and the most qualified competitor is selected, subject to negotiation of 
fair and reasonable compensation. The method, where price is not used as 
a selection factor, can only be used in procurement of A/E professional 
services. It cannot be used to purchase other types of services though 
A/E firms are a potential source to perform the proposed effort.
    (4) Procurement by noncompetitive proposals is procurement through 
solicitation of a proposal from only one source, or after solicitation 
of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate.
    (i) Procurement by noncompetitive proposals may be used only when 
the award of a contract is infeasible under small purchase procedures, 
sealed bids or competitive proposals and one of the following 
circumstances applies:
    (A) The item is available only from a single source;
    (B) The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not 
permit a delay resulting from competitive solicitation;
    (C) The awarding agency authorizes noncompetitive proposals; or
    (D) After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is 
determined inadequate.
    (ii) Cost analysis, i.e., verifying the proposed cost data, the 
projections of the data, and the evaluation of the specific elements of 
costs and profits, is required.
    (iii) Grantees and subgrantees may be required to submit the 
proposed procurement to the awarding agency for pre-award review in 
accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
    (e) Contracting with small and minority firms, women's business 
enterprise and labor surplus area firms. (1) The grantee and subgrantee 
will take all necessary affirmative steps to assure that minority firms, 
women's business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms are used when 
possible.
    (2) Affirmative steps shall include:
    (i) Placing qualified small and minority businesses and women's 
business enterprises on solicitation lists;
    (ii) Assuring that small and minority businesses, and women's 
business enterprises are solicited whenever they are potential sources;
    (iii) Dividing total requirements, when economically feasible, into 
smaller tasks or quantities to permit maximum participation by small and 
minority business, and women's business enterprises;
    (iv) Establishing delivery schedules, where the requirement permits, 
which encourage participation by small and minority business, and 
women's business enterprises;
    (v) Using the services and assistance of the Small Business 
Administration, and the Minority Business Development Agency of the 
Department of Commerce; and
    (vi) Requiring the prime contractor, if subcontracts are to be let, 
to take the affirmative steps listed in paragraphs (e)(2) (i) through 
(v) of this section.

[[Page 293]]

    (f) Contract cost and price. (1) Grantees and subgrantees must 
perform a cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement 
action including contract modifications. The method and degree of 
analysis is dependent on the facts surrounding the particular 
procurement situation, but as a starting point, grantees must make 
independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals. A cost 
analysis must be performed when the offeror is required to submit the 
elements of his estimated cost, e.g., under professional, consulting, 
and architectural engineering services contracts. A cost analysis will 
be necessary when adequate price competition is lacking, and for sole 
source procurements, including contract modifications or change orders, 
unless price reasonableness can be established on the basis of a catalog 
or market price of a commercial product sold in substantial quantities 
to the general public or based on prices set by law or regulation. A 
price analysis will be used in all other instances to determine the 
reasonableness of the proposed contract price.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees will negotiate profit as a separate 
element of the price for each contract in which there is no price 
competition and in all cases where cost analysis is performed. To 
establish a fair and reasonable profit, consideration will be given to 
the complexity of the work to be performed, the risk borne by the 
contractor, the contractor's investment, the amount of subcontracting, 
the quality of its record of past performance, and industry profit rates 
in the surrounding geographical area for similar work.
    (3) Costs or prices based on estimated costs for contracts under 
grants will be allowable only to the extent that costs incurred or cost 
estimates included in negotiated prices are consistent with Federal cost 
principles (see Sec. 105-71.122). Grantees may reference their own cost 
principles that comply with the applicable Federal cost principles.
    (4) The cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of 
construction cost methods of contracting shall not be used.
    (g) Awarding agency review. (1) Grantees and subgrantees must make 
available, upon request of the awarding agency, technical specifications 
on proposed procurements where the awarding agency believes such review 
is needed to ensure that the item and/or service specified is the one 
being proposed for purchase. This review generally will take place prior 
to the time the specification is incorporated into a solicitation 
document. However, if the grantee or subgrantee desires to have the 
review accomplished after a solicitation has been developed, the 
awarding agency may still review the specifications, with such review 
usually limited to the technical aspects of the proposed purchase.
    (2) Grantees and subgrantees must on request make available for 
awarding agency pre-award review procurement documents, such as requests 
for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc. 
when:
    (i) A grantee's or subgrantee's procurement procedures or operation 
fails to comply with the procurement standards in this section; or
    (ii) The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified 
acquisition threshold and is to be awarded without competition or only 
one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation; or
    (iii) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the simplified 
acquisition threshold, specifies a ``brand name'' product; or
    (iv) The proposed award is more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold and is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder 
under a sealed bid procurement; or
    (v) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract 
or increases the contract amount by more than the simplified acquisition 
threshold.
    (3) A grantee or subgrantee will be exempt from the pre-award review 
in paragraph (g)(2) of this section if the awarding agency determines 
that its procurement systems comply with the standards of this section.
    (i) A grantee or subgrantee may request that its procurement system 
be reviewed by the awarding agency to determine whether its system meets 
these standards in order for its system

[[Page 294]]

to be certified. Generally, these reviews shall occur where there is a 
continuous high-dollar funding, and third-party contracts are awarded on 
a regular basis.
    (ii) A grantee or subgrantee may self-certify its procurement 
system. Such self-certification shall not limit the awarding agency's 
right to survey the system. Under a self-certification procedure, 
awarding agencies may wish to rely on written assurances from the 
grantee or subgrantee that it is complying with these standards. A 
grantee or subgrantee will cite specific procedures, regulations, 
standards, etc., as being in compliance with these requirements and have 
its system available for review.
    (h) Bonding requirements. For construction or facility improvement 
contracts or subcontracts exceeding the simplified acquisition 
threshold, the awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and 
requirements of the grantee or subgrantee provided the awarding agency 
has made a determination that the awarding agency's interest is 
adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the 
minimum requirements shall be as follows:
    (1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of 
the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist of a firm commitment 
such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument 
accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder will, upon acceptance of 
his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within 
the time specified.
    (2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent 
of the contract price. A ``performance bond'' is one executed in 
connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's 
obligations under such contract.
    (3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of 
the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed in connection 
with a contract to assure payment as required by law of all persons 
supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for 
in the contract.
    (i) Contract provisions. A grantee's and subgrantee's contracts must 
contain provisions in paragraph (i) of this section. Federal agencies 
are permitted to require changes, remedies, changed conditions, access 
and records retention, suspension of work, and other clauses approved by 
the Office of Federal Procurement Policy.
    (1) Administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances 
where contractors violate or breach contract terms, and provide for such 
sanctions and penalties as may be appropriate. (Contracts more than the 
simplified acquisition threshold)
    (2) Termination for cause and for convenience by the grantee or 
subgrantee including the manner by which it will be effected and the 
basis for settlement. (All contracts in excess of $10,000)
    (3) Compliance with Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, 
entitled ``Equal Employment Opportunity,'' as amended by Executive Order 
11375 of October 13, 1967, and as supplemented in Department of Labor 
regulations (41 CFR chapter 60). (All construction contracts awarded in 
excess of $10,000 by grantees and their contractors or subgrantees)
    (4) Compliance with the Copeland ``Anti-Kickback'' Act (18 U.S.C. 
874) as supplemented in Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 3). 
(All contracts and subgrants for construction or repair)
    (5) Compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a to 276a-7) 
as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 5). 
(Construction contracts in excess of $2000 awarded by grantees and 
subgrantees when required by Federal grant program legislation)
    (6) Compliance with sections 103 and 107 of the Contract Work Hours 
and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-330) as supplemented by 
Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 5). (Construction contracts 
awarded by grantees and subgrantees in excess of $2000, and in excess of 
$2500 for other contracts which involve the employment of mechanics or 
laborers)
    (7) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations 
pertaining to reporting.
    (8) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations 
pertaining

[[Page 295]]

to patent rights with respect to any discovery or invention which arises 
or is developed in the course of or under such contract.
    (9) Awarding agency requirements and regulations pertaining to 
copyrights and rights in data.
    (10) Access by the grantee, the subgrantee, the Federal grantor 
agency, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their 
duly authorized representatives to any books, documents, papers, and 
records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to that specific 
contract for the purpose of making audit, examination, excerpts, and 
transcriptions.
    (11) Retention of all required records for three years after 
grantees or subgrantees make final payments and all other pending 
matters are closed.
    (12) Compliance with all applicable standards, orders, or 
requirements issued under section 306 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 
1857(h)), section 508 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1368), Executive 
Order 11738, and Environmental Protection Agency regulations (40 CFR 
part 15). (Contracts, subcontracts, and subgrants of amounts in excess 
of $100,000)
    (13) Mandatory standards and policies relating to energy efficiency 
which are contained in the state energy conservation plan issued in 
compliance with the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (Pub. L. 94-163, 
89 Stat. 871).

<R05>
Sec. 105-71.137  Subgrants.

    (a) States. States shall follow State law and procedures when 
awarding and administering subgrants (whether on a cost reimbursement or 
fixed amount basis) of financial assistance to local and Indian tribal 
governments. States shall:
    (1) Ensure that every subgrant includes any clauses required by 
Federal statute and executive orders and their implementing regulations;
    (2) Ensure that subgrantees are aware of requirements imposed upon 
them by Federal statute and regulation;
    (3) Ensure that a provision for compliance with Sec. 105-71.142 is 
placed in every cost reimbursement subgrant; and
    (4) Conform any advances of grant funds to subgrantees substantially 
to the same standards of timing and amount that apply to cash advances 
by Federal agencies.
    (b) All other grantees. All other grantees shall follow the 
provisions of this part which are applicable to awarding agencies when 
awarding and administering subgrants (whether on a cost reimbursement or 
fixed amount basis) of financial assistance to local and Indian tribal 
governments. Grantees shall:

                             and Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.140  Monitoring and reporting program performance.

    (a) Monitoring by grantees. Grantees are responsible for managing 
the day-to-day operations of grant and subgrant supported activities. 
Grantees must monitor grant and subgrant supported activities to assure 
compliance with applicable Federal requirements and that performance 
goals are being achieved. Grantee monitoring must cover each program, 
function or activity.
    (b) Non-construction performance reports. The Federal agency may, if 
it decides that performance information

[[Page 296]]

available from subsequent applications contains sufficient information 
to meet its programmatic needs, require the grantee to submit a 
performance report only upon expiration or termination of grant support. 
Unless waived by the Federal agency this report will be due on the same 
date as the final Financial Status Report.
    (1) Grantees shall submit annual performance reports unless the 
awarding agency requires quarterly or semiannual reports. However, 
performance reports will not be required more frequently than quarterly. 
Annual reports shall be due 90 days after the grant year, quarterly or 
semiannual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. The 
final performance report will be due 90 days after the expiration or 
termination of grant support. If a justified request is submitted by a 
grantee, the Federal agency may extend the due date for any performance 
report. Additionally, requirements for unnecessary performance reports 
may be waived by the Federal agency.
    (2) Performance reports will contain, for each grant, brief 
information on the following:
    (i) A comparison of actual accomplishments to the objectives 
established for the period. Where the output of the project can be 
quantified, a computation of the cost per unit of output may be required 
if that information will be useful.
    (ii) The reasons for slippage if established objectives were not 
met.
    (iii) Additional pertinent information including, when appropriate, 
analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.
    (3) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original 
and two copies of performance reports.
    (4) Grantees will adhere to the standards in this section in 
prescribing performance reporting requirements for subgrantees.
    (c) Construction performance reports. For the most part, on-site 
technical inspections and certified percentage-of-completion data are 
relied on heavily by Federal agencies to monitor progress under 
construction grants and subgrants. The Federal agency will require 
additional formal performance reports only when considered necessary, 
and never more frequently than quarterly.
    (d) Significant developments. Events may occur between the scheduled 
performance reporting dates which have significant impact upon the grant 
or subgrant supported activity. In such cases, the grantee must inform 
the Federal agency as soon as the following types of conditions become 
known:
    (1) Problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will materially 
impair the ability to meet the objective of the award. This disclosure 
must include a statement of the action taken, or contemplated, and any 
assistance needed to resolve the situation.
    (2) Favorable developments which enable meeting time schedules and 
objectives sooner or at less cost than anticipated or producing more 
beneficial results than originally planned.
    (e) Federal agencies may make site visits as warranted by program 
needs.
    (f) Waivers, extensions. (1) Federal agencies may waive any 
performance report required by this part if not needed.
    (2) The grantee may waive any performance report from a subgrantee 
when not needed. The grantee may exend the due date for any performance 
report from a subgrantee if the grantee will still be able to meet its 
performance reporting obligations to the Federal agency.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.141  Financial reporting.

    (a) General. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a) (2) and (5) of 
this section, grantees will use only the forms specified in paragraphs 
(a) through (e) of this section, and such supplementary or other forms 
as may from time to time be authorized by OMB, for:
    (i) Submitting financial reports to Federal agencies, or
    (ii) Requesting advances or reimbursements when letters of credit 
are not used.
    (2) Grantees need not apply the forms prescribed in this section in 
dealing with their subgrantees. However, grantees shall not impose more 
burdensome requirements on subgrantees.
    (3) Grantees shall follow all applicable standard and supplemental 
Federal agency instructions approved by OMB

[[Page 297]]

to the extent required under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 for use 
in connection with forms specified in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this 
section. Federal agencies may issue substantive supplementary 
instructions only with the approval of OMB. Federal agencies may shade 
out or instruct the grantee to disregard any line item that the Federal 
agency finds unnecessary for its decision making purposes.
    (4) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original 
and two copies of forms required under this part.
    (5) Federal agencies may provide computer outputs to grantees to 
expedite or contribute to the accuracy of reporting. Federal agencies 
may accept the required information from grantees in machine usable 
format or computer printouts instead of prescribed forms.
    (6) Federal agencies may waive any report required by this section 
if not needed.
    (7) Federal agencies may extend the due date on any financial report 
upon receiving a justified request from a grantee.
    (b) Financial Status Report--(1) Form. Grantees will use Standard 
Form 269 or 269A, Financial Status Report, to report the status of funds 
for all non-construction grants and for construction grants when 
required in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section.
    (2) Accounting basis. Each grantee will report program outlays and 
program income on a cash or accrual basis as prescribed by the awarding 
agency. If the Federal agency requires accrual information and the 
grantee's accounting records are not normally kept on the accrual basis, 
the grantee shall not be required to convert its accounting system but 
shall develop such accrual information through an analysis of the 
documentation on hand.
    (3) Frequency. The Federal agency may prescribe the frequency of the 
report for each project or program. However, the report will not be 
required more frequently than quarterly. If the Federal agency does not 
specify the frequency of the report, it will be submitted annually. A 
final report will be required upon expiration or termination of grant 
support.
    (4) Due date. When reports are required on a quarterly or semiannual 
basis, they will be due 30 days after the reporting period. When 
required on an annual basis, they will be due 90 days after the grant 
year. Final reports will be due 90 days after the expiration or 
termination of grant support.
    (c) Federal Cash Transactions Report--(1) Form. (i) For grants paid 
by letter of credit, Treasury check advances or electronic transfer of 
funds, the grantee will submit the Standard Form 272, Federal Cash 
Transactions Report, and when necessary, its continuation sheet, 
Standard Form 272A, unless the terms of the award exempt the grantee 
from this requirement.
    (ii) These reports will be used by the Federal agency to monitor 
cash advanced to grantees and to obtain disbursement or outlay 
information for each grant from grantees. The format of the report may 
be adapted as appropriated when reporting is to be accomplished with the 
assistance of automatic data processing equipment provided that the 
information to be submitted is not changed in substance.
    (2) Forecasts of Federal cash requirements. Forecasts of Federal 
cash requirements may be required in the ``Remarks'' section of the 
report.
    (3) Cash in hands of subgrantees. When considered necessary and 
feasible by the Federal agency, grantees may be required to report the 
amount of cash advances in excess of three days' needs in the hands of 
their subgrantees or contractors and to provide short narrative 
explanations of actions taken by the grantee to reduce the excess 
balances.
    (4) Frequency and due date. Grantees must submit the report no later 
than 15 working days following the end of each quarter. However, where 
an advance either by letter of credit or electronic transfer of funds is 
authorized at an annualized rate of one million dollars or more, the 
Federal agency may require the report to be submitted within 15 working 
days following the end of each month.
    (d) Request for advance or reimbursement--(1) Advance payments. 
Requests for Treasury check advance payments will be submitted on 
Standard Form

[[Page 298]]

270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. (This form will not be used 
for drawdowns under a letter of credit, electronic funds transfer or 
when Treasury check advance payments are made to the grantee 
automatically on a predetermined basis.)
    (2) Reimbursements. Requests for reimbursement under non-
construction grants will also be submitted on Standard Form 270. (For 
reimbursement requests under construction grants, see paragraph (e)(1) 
of this section.)
    (3) The frequency for submitting payment requests is treated in 
Sec. 105-71.141(b)(3).
    (e) Outlay report and request for reimbursement for construction 
programs. (1) Grants that support construction activities paid by 
reimbursement method.
    (i) Requests for reimbursement under construction grants will be 
submitted on Standard Form 271, Outlay Report and Request for 
Reimbursement for Construction Programs. Federal agencies may, however, 
prescribe the Request for Advance or Reimbursement form, specified in 
Sec. 105-71.141(d), instead of this form.
    (ii) The frequency for submitting reimbursement requests is treated 
in Sec. 105-71.141(b)(3).
    (2) Grants that support construction activities paid by letter of 
credit, electronic funds transfer or Treasury check advance.
    (i) When a construction grant is paid by letter of credit, 
electronic funds transfer or Treasury check advances, the grantee will 
report its outlays to the Federal agency using Standard Form 271, Outlay 
Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. The 
Federal agency will provide any necessary special instruction. However, 
frequency and due date shall be governed by Sec. 105-71.141(b) (3) and 
(4).
    (ii) When a construction grant is paid by Treasury check advances 
based on periodic requests from the grantee, the advances will be 
requested on the form specified in Sec. 105-71.141(d).
    (iii) The Federal agency may substitute the Financial Status Report 
specified in Sec. 105-71.141(b) for the Outlay Report and Request for 
Reimbursement for Construction Programs.
    (3) Accounting basis. The accounting basis for the Outlay Report and 
Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs shall be governed by 
Sec. 105-71.141(b)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.142  Retention and access requirements for records.

    (a) Applicability. (1) This section applies to all financial and 
programmatic records, supporting documents, statistical records, and 
other records of grantees of subgrantees or subgrantees which are:
    (i) Required to be maintained by the terms of this part, program 
regulations or the grant agreement, or
    (ii) Otherwise reasonably considered as pertinent to program 
regulations or the grant agreement.
    (2) This section does not apply to records maintained by contractors 
or subcontractors. For a requirement to place a provision concerning 
records in certain kinds of contracts, see Sec. 105-71.136(i)(10).
    (b) Length of retention period. (1) Except as otherwise provided, 
records must be retained for three years from the starting date 
specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or other action 
involving the records has been started before the expiration of the 3-
year period, the records must be retained until completion of the action 
and resolution of all issues which arise from it, or until the end of 
the regular 3-year period, whichever is later.
    (3) To avoid duplicate recordkeeping, awarding agencies may make 
special arrangements with grantees and subgrantees to retain any records 
which are continuously needed for joint use. The awarding agency will 
request transfer of records to its custody when it determines that the 
records possess long-term retention value. When the records are 
transferred to or maintained by the Federal agency, the 3-year retention 
requirement is not applicable to the grantee or subgrantee.
    (c) Starting date of retention period--(1) General. When grant 
support is continued or renewed at annual or other intervals, the 
retention period for the records of each funding period starts on

[[Page 299]]

the day the grantee or subgrantee submits to the awarding agency its 
single or last expenditure report for that period. However, if grant 
support is continued or renewed quarterly, the retention period for each 
year's records starts on the day the grantee submits its expenditure 
report for the last quarter of the Federal fiscal year. In all other 
cases, the retention period starts on the day the grantee submits its 
final expenditure report. If an expenditure report has been waived, the 
retention period starts on the day the report would have been due.
    (2) Real property and equipment records. The retention period for 
real property and equipment records starts from the date of the 
disposition or replacement or transfer at the direction of the awarding 
agency.
    (3) Records for income transactions after grant or subgrant support. 
In some cases grantees must report income after the period of grant 
support. Where there is such a requirement, the retention period for the 
records pertaining to the earning of the income starts from the end of 
the grantee's fiscal year in which the income is earned.
    (4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. This 
paragraph applies to the following types of documents, and their 
supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost 
allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rates 
at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer 
usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).
    (i) If submitted for negotiation. If the proposal, plan, or other 
computation is required to be submitted to the Federal Government (or to 
the grantee) to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-
year retention period for its supporting records starts from the date of 
such submission.
    (ii) If not submitted for negotiation. If the proposal, plan, or 
other computations are not required to be submitted to the Federal 
Government (or to the grantee) for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year 
retention period for the proposal plan, or computation and its 
supporting records starts from end of the fiscal year (or other 
accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.
    (d) Substitution of microfilm. Copies made by microfilming, 
photocopying, or similar methods may be substituted for the original 
records.
    (e) Access to records--(1) Records of grantees and subgrantees. The 
awarding agency and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any 
of their authorized representatives, shall have the right of access to 
any pertinent books, documents, papers, or other records of grantees and 
subgrantees which are pertinent to the grant, in order to make audits, 
examinations, excerpts, and transcripts.
    (2) Expiration of right of access. The rights of access in this 
section must not be limited to the required retention period but shall 
last as long as the records are retained.
    (f) Restrictions on public access. The Federal Freedom of 
Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) does not apply to records. Unless 
required by Federal, State, or local law, grantees and subgrantees are 
not required to permit public access to their records.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.143  Enforcement.

    (a) Remedies for noncompliance. If a grantee or subgrantee 
materially fails to comply with any term of an award, whether stated in 
a Federal statute or regulation, an assurance, in a State plan or 
application, a notice of award, or elsewhere, the awarding agency may 
take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the 
circumstances:
    (1) Temporary withhold cash payments pending correction of the 
deficiency by the grantee or subgrantee or more severe enforcement 
action by the awarding agency,
    (2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and matching credit 
for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in 
compliance,
    (3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award for the 
grantee's or subgrantee's program,
    (4) Without further awards for the program, or
    (5) Take other remedies that may be legally available,
    (b) Hearings, appeals. In taking an enforcement action, the awarding 
agency

[[Page 300]]

will provide the grantee or subgrantee an opportunity for such hearing, 
appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the grantee or 
subgrantee is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the 
action involved.
    (c) Effects of suspension and termination. Costs of grantee or 
subgrantee resulting from obligations incurred by the grantee or 
subgrantee during a suspension or after termination of an award are not 
allowable unless the awarding agency expressly authorizes them in the 
notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. Other grantee or 
subgrantee costs during suspension or after termination which are 
necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if:
    (1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred 
by the grantee or subgrantee before the effective date of suspension or 
termination, are not in anticipation of it, and, in case of a 
termination, are noncancellable, and,
    (2) The cost would be allowable if the award were not suspended or 
expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the 
termination takes effect.
    (d) Relationship to debarment and suspension. The enforcement 
remedies identified in this section, including suspension and 
termination, do not preclude grantee or subgrantee from being subject to 
``Debarment and Suspension'' under E.O. 12549 (see Sec. 105-71.135).


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.144  Termination for convenience.

    Except as provided in Sec. 105-71.143 awards may be terminated in 
whole or in part only as follows:
    (a) By the awarding agency with the consent of the grantee or 
subgrantee in which case the two parties shall agree upon the 
termination conditions, including the effective date and in the case of 
partial termination, the portion to be terminated, or
    (b) By the grantee or subgrantee upon written notification to the 
awarding agency, setting forth the reasons for such termination, the 
effective date, and in the case of partial termination, the portion to 
be terminated. However, if, in the case of a partial termination, the 
awarding agency determines that the remaining portion of the award will 
not accomplish the purposes for which the award was made, the awarding 
agency may terminate the award in its entirety under either Sec. 105-
71.143 or paragraph (a) of this section.


<R04>
             Subpart 105-71.15--After-the-Grant Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.150  Closeout.

    (a) General. The Federal agency will close out the award when it 
determines that all applicable administrative actions and all required 
work of the grant has been completed.
    (b) Reports. Within 90 days after the expiration or termination of 
the grant, the grantee must submit all financial, performance, and other 
reports required as a condition of the grant. Upon request by the 
grantee, Federal agencies may extend this timeframe. These may include 
but are not limited to:
    (1) Final performance or progress report.
    (2) Financial Status Report (SF 269) or Outlay Report and Request 
for Reimbursement for Construction Programs (SF-271) (as applicable).
    (3) Final request for payment (SF-270) (if applicable).
    (4) Invention disclosure (if applicable).
    (5) Federally-owned property report: In accordance with Sec. 105-
71.132(f), a grantee must submit an inventory of all federally owned 
property (as distinct from property acquired with grant funds) for which 
it is accountable and request disposition instructions from the Federal 
agency of property no longer needed.
    (c) Cost adjustment. The Federal agency will, within 90 days after 
receipt of reports in paragraph (b) of this section, make upward or 
downward adjustments to the allowable costs.
    (d) Cash adjustments. (1) The Federal agency will make prompt 
payment to the grantee for allowable reimbursable costs.
    (2) The grantee must immediately refund to the Federal agency any 
balance of unobligated (unencumbered) cash

[[Page 301]]

advanced that is not authorized to be retained for use on other grants.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.151  Later disallowances and adjustments.

    The closeout of a grant does not affect:
    (a) The Federal agency's right to disallow costs and recover funds 
on the basis of a later audit or other review;
    (b) The grantee's obligation to return any funds due as a result of 
later refunds, corrections, or other transactions;
    (c) Records retention as required in Sec. 105-71.142;
    (d) Property management requirements in Sec. 105-71.131 and 
Sec. 105-71.132; and
    (e) Audit requirements in Sec. 105-71.126.


<R05>
Sec. 105-71.152  Collection of amounts due.

    (a) Any funds paid to a grantee in excess of the amount to which the 
grantee is finally determined to be entitled under the terms of the 
award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. If not paid within a 
reasonable period after demand, the Federal agency may reduce the debt 
by:
    (1) Making an administrative offset against other requests for 
reimbursement,
    (2) Withholding advance payments otherwise due to the grantee, or
    (3) Other action permitted by law.
    (b) Except where otherwise provided by statutes or regulations, the 
Federal agency will charge interest on an overdue debt in accordance 
with the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR Ch.II). The date 
from which interest is computed is not extended by litigation or the 
filing of any form of appeal.

                        Subpart 105-72.1--General


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.100  Purpose.

    This part establishes uniform administrative requirements for 
Federal grants and agreements awarded to institutions of higher 
education, hospitals, and other non-profit organizations. Federal 
awarding agencies shall not impose additional or inconsistent 
requirements, except as provided in Sec. 105-72.103, and Sec. 105-72.204 
or unless specifically required by Federal statute or executive order. 
Non-profit organizations that implement Federal programs for the States 
are also subject to State requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.101  Definitions.

    (a) Accrued expenditures means the charges incurred by the recipient 
during a given period requiring the provision of funds for:
    (1) Goods and other tangible property received;
    (2) Services performed by employees, contractors, subrecipients, and 
other payees; and
    (3) Other amounts becoming owed under programs for which no current 
services or performance is required.
    (b) Accrued income means the sum of:
    (1) Earnings during a given period from
    (i) Services performed by the recipient, and
    (ii) Goods and other tangible property delivered to purchasers, and
    (2) Amounts becoming owed to the recipient for which no current 
services or performance is required by the recipient.
    (c) Acquisition cost of equipment means the net invoice price of the 
equipment, including the cost of modifications, attachments, 
accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessary to make the property

    (n) Exempt property means tangible personal property acquired in 
whole or in part with Federal funds, where the Federal awarding agency 
has statutory authority to vest title in the recipient without further 
obligation to the Federal Government. An example of exempt property 
authority is contained in the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement 
Act (31 U.S.C. 6306), for property acquired under an award to conduct

future period.
    (u) Outlays or expenditures means charges made to the project or 
program. They may be reported on a cash or accrual basis. For reports 
prepared on a cash basis, outlays are the sum of cash disbursements for 
direct charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect expense 
charged, the value of third party in-kind contributions applied and the 
amount of cash advances and payments made to subrecipients. For reports

of Federal funds is not program income. Except as otherwise provided in 
Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the 
award, program income does not include the receipt of principal on 
loans, rebates, credits, discounts, etc., or interest earned on any of 
them.
    (y) Project costs means all allowable costs, as set forth in the 
applicable Federal cost principles, incurred by a recipient and the

program. The term includes public and private institutions of higher 
education, public and private hospitals, and other quasi-public and 
private non-profit organizations such as, but not limited to, community 
action agencies, research institutes, educational associations, and

    (dd) Research and development means all research activities, both 
basic and applied, and all development activities that are supported at 
universities, colleges, and other non-profit institutions. ``Research'' 
is defined as a systematic study directed toward fuller scientific 
knowledge or understanding of the subject studied. ``Development'' is 
the systematic use of knowledge and understanding gained from research 
directed toward the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or 
methods, including design and development of prototypes and processes. 
The term research also includes activities involving the training of 
individuals in research techniques where such activities utilize the 
same facilities as other research and development activities and where 
such activities are not included in the instruction function.
    (ee) Small awards means a grant or cooperative agreement not 
exceeding the small purchase threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) 
(currently $25,000).
    (ff) Subaward means an award of financial assistance in the form of 
money, or property in lieu of money, made under an award by a recipient

Federal awarding agency.
    (hh) Supplies means all personal property excluding equipment, 
intangible property, and debt instruments as defined in this section,

practice in the performance of work under a funding agreement (``subject 
inventions''), as defined in 37 CFR part 401, ``Rights to Inventions 
Made by Nonprofit Organizations and Small Business Firms Under 
Government Grants, Contracts, and Cooperative Agreements.''
    (ii) Suspension means an action by a Federal awarding agency that 
temporarily withdraws Federal sponsorship under an award, pending 
corrective action by the recipient or pending a decision to terminate 
the award by the Federal awarding agency. Suspension of an award is a 
separate action from suspension under Federal agency regulations 
implementing E.O.s 12549 and 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension.''
    (jj) Termination means the cancellation of Federal sponsorship, in 
whole or in part, under an agreement at any time prior to the date of 
completion.
    (kk) Third party in-kind contributions means the value of noncash 
contributions provided by non-Federal third parties. Third party in-kind 
contributions may be in the form of real property, equipment, supplies 
and other expendable property, and the value of goods and services 
directly benefiting and specifically identifiable to the project or 
program.
    (ll) Unliquidated obligations, for financial reports prepared on a 
cash basis, means the amount of obligations incurred by the recipient

basis, they represent the amount of obligations incurred by the 
recipient for which an outlay has not been recorded.

by the Federal awarding agency that has not been obligated by the 
recipient and is determined by deducting the cumulative obligations from

a given initial period.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.102  Effect on other issuances.

    For awards subject to this regulation, all administrative 
requirements of codified program regulations, program manuals, handbooks 
and other nonregulatory materials which are inconsistent with the 
requirements of this regulation shall be superseded, except to the 
extent they are required by statute, or authorized in accordance with 
the deviations provision in Sec. 105-72.103.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.103  Deviations.

    The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) may grant exceptions for 
classes of grants or recipients subject to the requirements of this 
regulation when exceptions are not prohibited by statute. However, in 
the interest of maximum uniformity, exceptions from the requirements of 
this regulation shall be permitted only in unusual circumstances. 
Federal awarding agencies may apply more restrictive requirements to a 
class of recipients when approved by OMB. Federal awarding agencies may 
apply less restrictive requirements when awarding small awards, except 
for those requirements which are statutory. Exceptions on a case-by-case 
basis may also be made by Federal awarding agencies.

[[Page 306]]


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.104  Subawards.

    Unless sections of this regulation specifically exclude 
subrecipients from coverage, the provisions of this regulation shall be 
applied to subrecipients performing work under awards if such 
subrecipients are institutions of higher education, hospitals or other 
non-profit organizations. State and local government subrecipients are 
subject to the provisions of regulations implementing the grants 
management common rule, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants 
and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments,'' 41 CFR 105-
71.


<R04>
                Subpart 105-72.2--Pre-Award Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.200  Purpose.

    Sections 105-72.201 through 105-72.207 prescribes forms and 
instructions and other pre-award matters to be used in applying for 
Federal awards.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.201  Pre-award policies.

    (a) Use of grants and cooperative agreements, and contracts. In each 
instance, the Federal awarding agency shall decide on the appropriate 
award instrument (i.e., grant, cooperative agreement, or contract). The 
Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. 6301-08) governs 
the use of grants, cooperative agreements and contracts. A grant or 
cooperative agreement shall be used only when the principal purpose of a 
transaction is to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation 
authorized by Federal statute. The statutory criterion for choosing 
between grants and cooperative agreements is that for the latter, 
``substantial involvement is expected between the executive agency and 
the State, local government, or other recipient when carrying out the 
activity contemplated in the agreement.'' Contracts shall be used when 
the principal purpose is acquisition of property or services for the 
direct benefit or use of the Federal Government.
    (b) Public notice and priority setting. Federal awarding agencies 
shall notify the public of its intended funding priorities for 
discretionary grant programs, unless funding priorities are established 
by Federal statute.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.202  Forms for applying for Federal assistance.

    (a) Federal awarding agencies shall comply with the applicable 
report clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320, ``Controlling 
Paperwork Burdens on the Public,'' with regard to all forms used by the 
Federal awarding agency in place of or as a supplement to the Standard 
Form 424 (SF-424) series.
    (b) Applicants shall use the SF-424 series or those forms and 
instructions prescribed by the Federal awarding agency.
    (c) For Federal programs covered by E.O. 12372, ``Intergovernmental 
Review of Federal Programs,'' the applicant shall complete the 
appropriate sections of the SF-424 (Application for Federal Assistance) 
indicating whether the application was subject to review by the State 
Single Point of Contact (SPOC). The name and address of the SPOC for a 
particular State can be obtained from the Federal awarding agency or the 
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance. The SPOC shall advise the 
applicant whether the program for which application is made has been 
selected by that State for review.
    (d) Federal awarding agencies that do not use the SF-424 form should 
indicate whether the application is subject to review by the State under 
E.O. 12372.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.203  Debarment and suspension.

    Federal awarding agencies and recipients shall comply with the 
nonprocurement debarment and suspension common rule implementing E.O.s 
12549 and 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension.'' This common rule 
restricts subawards and contracts with certain parties that are 
debarred, suspended or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for 
participation in Federal assistance programs or activities.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.204  Special award conditions.

    If an applicant or recipient:
    (a) Has a history of poor performance,
    (b) Is not financially stable,

[[Page 307]]

    (c) Has a management system that does not meet the standards 
prescribed in this regulation,
    (d) Has not conformed to the terms and conditions of a previous 
award, or
    (e) Is not otherwise responsible;

Federal awarding agencies may impose additional requirements as needed, 
provided that such applicant or recipient is notified in writing as to: 
the nature of the additional requirements, the reason why the additional 
requirements are being imposed, the nature of the corrective action 
needed, the time allowed for completing the corrective actions, and the 
method for requesting reconsideration of the additional requirements 
imposed. Any special conditions shall be promptly removed once the 
conditions that prompted them have been corrected.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.205  Metric system of measurement.

    The Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and 
Competitiveness Act (15 U.S.C. 205) declares that the metric system is 
the preferred measurement system for U.S. trade and commerce. The Act 
requires each Federal agency to establish a date or dates in 
consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, when the metric system of 
measurement will be used in the agency's procurements, grants, and other 
business-related activities. Metric implementation may take longer where 
the use of the system is initially impractical or likely to cause 
significant inefficiencies in the accomplishment of federally-funded 
activities. Federal awarding agencies shall follow the provisions of 
E.O. 12770, ``Metric Usage in Federal Government Programs.''


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.206  Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

    Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (Pub. L. 94-
580 codified at 42 U.S.C. 6962), any State agency or agency of a 
political subdivision of a State which is using appropriated Federal 
funds must comply with section 6002. Section 6002 requires that 
preference be given in procurement programs to the purchase of specific 
products containing recycled materials identified in guidelines 
developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (40 CFR parts 247 
through 254). Accordingly, State and local institutions of higher 
education, hospitals, and non-profit organizations that receive direct 
Federal awards or other Federal funds shall give preference in their 
procurement programs funded with Federal funds to the purchase of 
recycled products pursuant to the EPA guidelines.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.207  Certifications and representations.

    Unless prohibited by statute or codified regulation, each Federal 
awarding agency is authorized and encouraged to allow recipients to 
submit certifications and representations required by statute, executive 
order, or regulation on an annual basis, if the recipients have ongoing 
and continuing relationships with the agency. Annual certifications and 
representations shall be signed by responsible officials with the 
authority to ensure recipients' compliance with the pertinent 
requirements.


<R04>
    Subpart 105-72.30--Post-Award Requirements/Financial and Program 
                               Management


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.300  Purpose of financial and program management.

    Sections 105-72.301 through 105-72.308 prescribe standards for 
financial management systems, methods for making payments and rules for: 
satisfying cost sharing and matching requirements, accounting for 
program income, budget revision approvals, making audits, determining 
allowability of cost, and establishing fund availability.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.301  Standards for financial management systems.

    (a) Federal awarding agencies shall require recipients to relate 
financial data to performance data and develop unit cost information 
whenever practical.
    (b) Recipients' financial management systems shall provide for the 
following.
    (1) Accurate, current and complete disclosure of the financial 
results of each federally-sponsored project or program in accordance 
with the reporting requirements set forth in Sec. 105-

[[Page 308]]

72.602. If a Federal awarding agency requires reporting on an accrual 
basis from a recipient that maintains its records on other than an 
accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required to establish an 
accrual accounting system. These recipients may develop such accrual 
data for its reports on the basis of an analysis of the documentation on 
hand.
    (2) Records that identify adequately the source and application of 
funds for federally-sponsored activities. These records shall contain 
information pertaining to Federal awards, authorizations, obligations, 
unobligated balances, assets, outlays, income and interest.
    (3) Effective control over and accountability for all funds, 
property and other assets. Recipients shall adequately safeguard all 
such assets and assure they are used solely for authorized purposes.
    (4) Comparison of outlays with budget amounts for each award. 
Whenever appropriate, financial information should be related to 
performance and unit cost data.
    (5) Written procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the 
transfer of funds to the recipient from the U.S. Treasury and the 
issuance or redemption of checks, warrants or payments by other means 
for program purposes by the recipient. To the extent that the provisions 
of the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) (Pub. L. 101-453) govern, 
payment methods of State agencies, instrumentalities, and fiscal agents 
shall be consistent with CMIA Treasury-State Agreements or the CMIA 
default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205, ``Withdrawal of Cash 
from the Treasury for Advances under Federal Grant and Other Programs.''
    (6) Written procedures for determining the reasonableness, 
allocability and allowability of costs in accordance with the provisions 
of the applicable Federal cost principles and the terms and conditions 
of the award.
    (7) Accounting records including cost accounting records that are 
supported by source documentation.
    (c) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment 
of money borrowed by the recipient, the Federal awarding agency, at its 
discretion, may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding 
and insurance requirements of the recipient are not deemed adequate to 
protect the interest of the Federal Government.
    (d) The Federal awarding agency may require adequate fidelity bond 
coverage where the recipient lacks sufficient coverage to protect the 
Federal Government's interest.
    (e) Where bonds are required in the situations described above, the 
bonds shall be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority 
as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety 
Companies Doing Business with the United States.''


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.302  Payment.

    (a) Payment methods shall minimize the time elapsing between the 
transfer of funds from the United States Treasury and the issuance or 
redemption of checks, warrants, or payment by other means by the 
recipients. Payment methods of State agencies or instrumentalities shall 
be consistent with Treasury-State CMIA agreements or default procedures 
codified at 31 CFR part 205.
    (b)(1) Recipients are to be paid in advance, provided they maintain 
or demonstrate the willingness to maintain:
    (i) Written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the 
transfer of funds and disbursement by the recipient, and
    (ii) Financial management systems that meet the standards for fund 
control and accountability as established in Sec. 105-72.301.
    (2) Cash advances to a recipient organization shall be limited to 
the minimum amounts needed and be timed to be in accordance with the 
actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient organization in 
carrying out the purpose of the approved program or project. The timing 
and amount of cash advances shall be as close as is administratively 
feasible to the actual disbursements by the recipient organization for 
direct program or project costs and the proportionate share of any 
allowable indirect costs.
    (c) Whenever possible, advances shall be consolidated to cover 
anticipated cash needs for all awards made by the

[[Page 309]]

Federal awarding agency to the recipient.
    (1) Advance payment mechanisms include, but are not limited to, 
Treasury check and electronic funds transfer.
    (2) Advance payment mechanisms are subject to 31 CFR part 205.
    (3) Recipients shall be authorized to submit requests for advances 
and reimbursements at least monthly when electronic fund transfers are 
not used.
    (d) Requests for Treasury check advance payment shall be submitted 
on SF-270, ``Request for Advance or Reimbursement,'' or other forms as 
may be authorized by OMB. This form is not to be used when Treasury 
check advance payments are made to the recipient automatically through 
the use of a predetermined payment schedule or if precluded by special 
Federal awarding agency instructions for electronic funds transfer.
    (e) Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in 
paragraph (b) cannot be met. Federal awarding agencies may also use this 
method on any construction agreement, or if the major portion of the 
construction project is accomplished through private market financing or 
Federal loans, and the Federal assistance constitutes a minor portion of 
the project.
    (1) When the reimbursement method is used, the Federal awarding 
agency shall make payment within 30 days after receipt of the billing, 
unless the billing is improper.
    (2) Recipients shall be authorized to submit request for 
reimbursement at least monthly when electronic funds transfers are not 
used.
    (f) If a recipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and 
the Federal awarding agency has determined that reimbursement is not 
feasible because the recipient lacks sufficient working capital, the 
Federal awarding agency may provide cash on a working capital advance 
basis. Under this procedure, the Federal awarding agency shall advance 
cash to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an 
initial period generally geared to the awardee's disbursing cycle. 
Thereafter, the Federal awarding agency shall reimburse the recipient 
for its actual cash disbursements. The working capital advance method of 
payment shall not be used for recipients unwilling or unable to provide 
timely advances to their subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual 
cash disbursements.
    (g) To the extent available, recipients shall disburse funds 
available from repayments to and interest earned on a revolving fund, 
program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries 
and interest earned on such funds before requesting additional cash 
payments.
    (h) Unless otherwise required by statute, Federal awarding agencies 
shall not withhold payments for proper charges made by recipients at any 
time during the project period unless paragraphs (h)(1) or (2) of this 
section apply.
    (1) A recipient has failed to comply with the project objectives, 
the terms and conditions of the award, or Federal reporting 
requirements.
    (2) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the 
United States as defined in OMB Circular A-129, ``Managing Federal 
Credit Programs.'' Under such conditions, the Federal awarding agency 
may, upon reasonable notice, inform the recipient that payments shall 
not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date until the 
conditions are corrected or the indebtedness to the Federal Government 
is liquidated.
    (i) Standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as 
depositories of funds advanced under awards are as follows:
    (1) Except for situations described in paragraph (i)(2), Federal 
awarding agencies shall not require separate depository accounts for 
funds provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility requirements 
for depositories for funds provided to a recipient. However, recipients 
must be able to account for the receipt, obligation and expenditure of 
funds.
    (2) Advances of Federal funds shall be deposited and maintained in 
insured accounts whenever possible.
    (j) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities 
for women-owned and minority-owned business enterprises, recipients 
shall be encouraged to use womenowned and

[[Page 310]]

minority-owned banks (a bank which is owned at least 50 percent by women 
or minority group members).
    (k) Recipients shall maintain advances of Federal funds in interest 
bearing accounts, unless paragraph (k)(1), (2) or (3) of this section 
apply.
    (1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per 
year.
    (2) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not 
be expected to earn interest in excess of $250 per year on Federal cash 
balances.
    (3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so 
high that it would not be feasible within the expected Federal and non-
Federal cash resources.
    (l) For those entities where CMIA and its implementing regulations 
do not apply, interest earned on Federal advances deposited in interest 
bearing accounts shall be remitted annually to Department of Health and 
Human Services, Payment Management System, P.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD 
20852. Interest amounts up to $250 per year may be retained by the 
recipient for administrative expense. State universities and hospitals 
shall comply with CMIA, as it pertains to interest. If an entity subject 
to CMIA uses its own funds to pay pre-award costs for discretionary 
awards without prior written approval from the Federal awarding agency, 
it waives its right to recover the interest under CMIA.
    (m) Except as noted elsewhere in this regulation, only the following 
forms shall be authorized for the recipients in requesting advances and 
reimbursements. Federal agencies shall not require more than an original 
and two copies of these forms.
    (1) SF-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. Each Federal 
awarding agency shall adopt the SF-270 as a standard form for all 
nonconstruction programs when electronic funds transfer or predetermined 
advance methods are not used. Federal awarding agencies, however, have 
the option of using this form for construction programs in lieu of the 
SF-271, ``Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction 
Programs.''
    (2) SF-271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for 
Construction Programs. Each Federal awarding agency shall adopt the SF-
271 as the standard form to be used for requesting reimbursement for 
construction programs. However, a Federal awarding agency may substitute 
the SF-270 when the Federal awarding agency determines that it provides 
adequate information to meet Federal needs.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.303  Cost sharing or matching.

    (a) All contributions, including cash and third party in-kind, shall 
be accepted as part of the recipient's cost sharing or matching when 
such contributions meet all of the following criteria.
    (1) Are verifiable from the recipient's records.
    (2) Are not included as contributions for any other federally-
assisted project or program.
    (3) Are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient 
accomplishment of project or program objectives.
    (4) Are allowable under the applicable cost principles.
    (5) Are not paid by the Federal Government under another award, 
except where authorized by Federal statute to be used for cost sharing 
or matching.
    (6) Are provided for in the approved budget when required by the 
Federal awarding agency.
    (7) Conform to other provisions of this regulation, as applicable.
    (b) Unrecovered indirect costs may be included as part of cost 
sharing or matching only with the prior approval of the Federal awarding 
agency.
    (c) Values for recipient contributions of services and property 
shall be established in accordance with the applicable cost principles. 
If a Federal awarding agency authorizes recipients to donate buildings 
or land for construction/facilities acquisition projects or long-term 
use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing or matching 
shall be the lesser of paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
    (1) The certified value of the remaining life of the property 
recorded in the recipient's accounting records at the time of donation.
    (2) The current fair market value. However, when there is sufficient 
justification, the Federal awarding agency may approve the use of the 
current

[[Page 311]]

fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds the 
certified value at the time of donation to the project.
    (d) Volunteer services furnished by professional and technical 
personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor may be 
counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an integral and 
necessary part of an approved project or program. Rates for volunteer 
services shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the 
recipient's organization. In those instances in which the required 
skills are not found in the recipient organization, rates shall be 
consistent with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which 
the recipient competes for the kind of services involved. In either 
case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable 
may be included in the valuation.
    (e) When an employer other than the recipient furnishes the services 
of an employee, these services shall be valued at the employee's regular 
rate of pay (plus an amount of fringe benefits that are reasonable, 
allowable, and allocable, but exclusive of overhead costs), provided 
these services are in the same skill for which the employee is normally 
paid.
    (f) Donated supplies may include such items as expendable equipment, 
office supplies, laboratory supplies or workshop and classroom supplies. 
Value assessed to donated supplies included in the cost sharing or 
matching share shall be reasonable and shall not exceed the fair market 
value of the property at the time of the donation.
    (g) The method used for determining cost sharing or matching for 
donated equipment, buildings and land for which title passes to the 
recipient may differ according to the purpose of the award, if paragraph 
(g)(1) or (2) of this section apply.
    (1) If the purpose of the award is to assist the recipient in the 
acquisition of equipment, buildings or land, the total value of the 
donated property may be claimed as cost sharing or matching.
    (2) If the purpose of the award is to support activities that 
require the use of equipment, buildings or land, normally only 
depreciation or use charges for equipment and buildings may be made. 
However, the full value of equipment or other capital assets and fair 
rental charges for land may be allowed, provided that the Federal 
awarding agency has approved the charges.
    (h) The value of donated property shall be determined in accordance 
with the usual accounting policies of the recipient, with the following 
qualifications.
    (1) The value of donated land and buildings shall not exceed its 
fair market value at the time of donation to the recipient as 
established by an independent appraiser (e.g., certified real property 
appraiser or General Services Administration representative) and 
certified by a responsible official of the recipient.
    (2) The value of donated equipment shall not exceed the fair market 
value of equipment of the same age and condition at the time of 
donation.
    (3) The value of donated space shall not exceed the fair rental 
value of comparable space as established by an independent appraisal of 
comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the 
same locality.
    (4) The value of loaned equipment shall not exceed its fair rental 
value.
    (5) The following requirements pertain to the recipient's supporting 
records for in-kind contributions from third parties.
    (i) Volunteer services shall be documented and, to the extent 
feasible, supported by the same methods used by the recipient for its 
own employees.
    (ii) The basis for determining the valuation for personal service, 
material, equipment, buildings and land shall be documented.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.304  Program income.

    (a) Federal awarding agencies shall apply the standards set forth in 
this section in requiring recipient organizations to account for program 
income related to projects financed in whole or in part with Federal 
funds.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, program 
income earned during the project period shall be retained by the 
recipient and, in accordance with Federal awarding agency regulations or 
the terms and conditions of the award, shall be used in one

[[Page 312]]

or more of the ways listed in the following.
    (1) Added to funds committed to the project by the Federal awarding 
agency and recipient and used to further eligible project or program 
objectives.
    (2) Used to finance the non-Federal share of the project or program.
    (3) Deducted from the total project or program allowable cost in 
determining the net allowable costs on which the Federal share of costs 
is based.
    (c) When an agency authorizes the disposition of program income as 
described in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2), program income in excess of 
any limits stipulated shall be used in accordance with paragraph (b)(3).
    (d) In the event that the Federal awarding agency does not specify 
in its regulations or the terms and conditions of the award how program 
income is to be used, paragraph (b)(3) shall apply automatically to all 
projects or programs except research. For awards that support research, 
paragraph (b)(1) shall apply automatically unless the awarding agency 
indicates in the terms and conditions another alternative on the award 
or the recipient is subject to special award conditions, as indicated in 
Sec. 105-72.204.
    (e) Unless Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and 
conditions of the award provide otherwise, recipients shall have no 
obligation to the Federal Government regarding program income earned 
after the end of the project period.
    (f) If authorized by Federal awarding agency regulations or the 
terms and conditions of the award, costs incident to the generation of 
program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program 
income, provided these costs have not been charged to the award.
    (g) Proceeds from the sale of property shall be handled in 
accordance with the requirements of the Property Standards (See 
Sec. 105-72.400 through Sec. 105-72.407).
    (h) Unless Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and 
condition of the award provide otherwise, recipients shall have no 
obligation to the Federal Government with respect to program income 
earned from license fees and royalties for copyrighted material, 
patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions produced under 
an award. However, Patent and Trademark Amendments (35 U.S.C. 18) apply 
to inventions made under an experimental, developmental, or research 
award.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.305  Revision of budget and program plans.

    (a) The budget plan is the financial expression of the project or 
program as approved during the award process. It may include either the 
Federal and non-Federal share, or only the Federal share, depending upon 
Federal awarding agency requirements. It shall be related to performance 
for program evaluation purposes whenever appropriate.
    (b) Recipients are required to report deviations from budget and 
program plans, and request prior approvals for budget and program plan 
revisions, in accordance with this section.
    (c) For nonconstruction awards, recipients shall request prior 
approvals from Federal awarding agencies for one or more of the 
following program or budget related reasons.
    (1) Change in the scope or the objective of the project or program 
(even if there is no associated budget revision requiring prior written 
approval).
    (2) Change in a key person specified in the application or award 
document.
    (3) The absence for more than three months, or a 25 percent 
reduction in time devoted to the project, by the approved project 
director or principal investigator.
    (4) The need for additional Federal funding.
    (5) The transfer of amounts budgeted for indirect costs to absorb 
increases in direct costs, or vice versa, if approval is required by the 
Federal awarding agency.
    (6) The inclusion, unless waived by the Federal awarding agency, of 
costs that require prior approval in accordance with OMB Circular A-21, 
``Cost Principles for Institutions of Higher Education,'' OMB Circular 
A-122, ``Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations,'' or 45 CFR part 
74 appendix E, ``Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research 
and Development under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals,'' or 48 CFR 
part 31, ``Contract

[[Page 313]]

Cost Principles and Procedures,'' as applicable.
    (7) The transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (direct 
payment to trainees) to other categories of expense.
    (8) Unless described in the application and funded in the approved 
awards, the subaward, transfer or contracting out of any work under an 
award. This provision does not apply to the purchase of supplies, 
material, equipment or general support services.
    (d) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be 
imposed unless a deviation has been approved by OMB.
    (e) Except for requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(4) 
of this section, Federal awarding agencies are authorized, at their 
option, to waive cost-related and administrative prior written approvals 
required by this regulation and OMB Circulars A-21 and A-122. Such 
waivers may include authorizing recipients to do any one or more of the 
following.
    (1) Incur pre-award costs 90 calendar days prior to award or more 
than 90 calendar days with the prior approval of the Federal awarding 
agency. All pre-award costs are incurred at the recipient's risk (i.e., 
the Federal awarding agency is under no obligation to reimburse such 
costs if for any reason the recipient does not receive an award or if 
the award is less than anticipated and inadequate to cover such costs).
    (2) Initiate a one-time extension of the expiration date of the 
award of up to 12 months unless one or more of the following conditions 
apply. For one-time extensions, the recipient must notify the Federal 
awarding agency in writing with the supporting reasons and revised 
expiration date at least 10 days before the expiration date specified in 
the award. This one-time extension may not be exercised merely for the 
purpose of using unobligated balances.
    (i) The terms and conditions of award prohibit the extension.
    (ii) The extension requires additional Federal funds.
    (iii) The extension involves any change in the approved objectives 
or scope of the project.
    (3) Carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent funding 
periods.
    (4) For awards that support research, unless the Federal awarding 
agency provides otherwise in the award or in the agency's regulations, 
the prior approval requirements described in paragraph (e) are 
automatically waived (i.e., recipients need not obtain such prior 
approvals) unless one of the conditions included in paragraph (e)(2) 
applies.
    (f) The Federal awarding agency may, at its option, restrict the 
transfer of funds among direct cost categories or programs, functions 
and activities for awards in which the Federal share of the project 
exceeds $100,000 and the cumulative amount of such transfers exceeds or 
is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget as last approved by 
the Federal awarding agency. No Federal awarding agency shall permit a 
transfer that would cause any Federal appropriation or part thereof to 
be used for purposes other than those consistent with the original 
intent of the appropriation.
    (g) All other changes to nonconstruction budgets, except for the 
changes described in paragraph (j), do not require prior approval.
    (h) For construction awards, recipients shall request prior written 
approval promptly from Federal awarding agencies for budget revisions 
whenever paragraphs (h)(1), (2) or (3) of this section apply.
    (1) The revision results from changes in the scope or the objective 
of the project or program.
    (2) The need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the 
project.
    (3) A revision is desired which involves specific costs for which 
prior written approval requirements may be imposed consistent with 
applicable OMB cost principles listed in Sec. 105-72.307.
    (i) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be 
imposed unless a deviation has been approved by OMB.
    (j) When a Federal awarding agency makes an award that provides 
support for both construction and nonconstruction work, the Federal 
awarding agency may require the recipient to request

[[Page 314]]

prior approval from the Federal awarding agency before making any fund 
or budget transfers between the two types of work supported.
    (k) For both construction and nonconstruction awards, Federal 
awarding agencies shall require recipients to notify the Federal 
awarding agency in writing promptly whenever the amount of Federal 
authorized funds is expected to exceed the needs of the recipient for 
the project period by more than $5000 or five percent of the Federal 
award, whichever is greater. This notification shall not be required if 
an application for additional funding is submitted for a continuation 
award.
    (l) When requesting approval for budget revisions, recipients shall 
use the budget forms that were used in the application unless the 
Federal awarding agency indicates a letter of request suffices.
    (m) Within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request 
for budget revisions, Federal awarding agencies shall review the request 
and notify the recipient whether the budget revisions have been 
approved. If the revision is still under consideration at the end of 30 
calendar days, the Federal awarding agency shall inform the recipient in 
writing of the date when the recipient may expect the decision.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.306  Non-Federal audits.

    (a) Recipients and subrecipients that are institutions of higher 
education or other non-profit organizations (including hospitals) shall 
be subject to the audit requirements contained in the Single Audit Act 
Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507) and revised OMB Circular A-133, 
``Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.''
    (b) State and local governments shall be subject to the audit 
requirements contained in the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 
U.S.C. 7501-7507) and revised OMB Circular A-133, ``Audits of States, 
Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.''
    (c) For-profit hospitals not covered by the audit provisions of 
revised OMB Circular A-133 shall be subject to the audit requirements of 
the Federal awarding agencies.
    (d) Commercial organizations shall be subject to the audit 
requirements of the Federal awarding agency or the prime recipient as 
incorporated into the award document.

1997]


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.307  Allowable costs.

    For each kind of recipient, there is a set of Federal principles for 
determining allowable costs. Allowability of costs shall be determined 
in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity 
incurring the costs. Thus, allowability of costs incurred by State, 
local or federally-recognized Indian tribal governments is determined in 
accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-87, ``Cost Principles 
for State and Local Governments.'' The allowability of costs incurred by 
non-profit organizations is determined in accordance with the provisions 
of OMB Circular A-122, ``Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations.'' 
The allowability of costs incurred by institutions of higher education 
is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21, 
``Cost Principles for Educational Institutions.'' The allowability of 
costs incurred by hospitals is determined in accordance with the 
provisions of appendix E of 45 CFR part 74, ``Principles for Determining 
Costs Applicable to Research and Development Under Grants and Contracts 
with Hospitals.'' The allowability of costs incurred by commercial 
organizations and those non-profit organizations listed in Attachment C 
to Circular A-122 is determined in accordance with the provisions of the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR part 31.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.308  Period of availability of funds.

    Where a funding period is specified, a recipient may charge to the 
grant only allowable costs resulting from obligations incurred during 
the funding period and any pre-award costs authorized by the Federal 
awarding agency.

<R04>
      Subpart 105-72.40--Post-Award Requirements/Property Standards


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.400  Purpose of property standards.

    Sections 105-72.401 through 105-72.407 set forth uniform standards 
governing management and disposition of property furnished by the 
Federal Government whose cost was charged to a project supported by a 
Federal award. Federal awarding agencies shall require recipients to 
observe these standards under awards and shall not impose additional 
requirements, unless specifically required by Federal statute. The 
recipient may use its own property management standards and procedures 
provided it observes the provisions of Sec. 105-72.401 through Sec. 105-
72.407.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.401  Insurance coverage.

    Recipients shall, at a minimum, provide the equivalent insurance 
coverage for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds as 
provided to property owned by the recipient. Federally-owned property 
need not be insured unless required by the terms and conditions of the 
award.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.402  Real property.

    Each Federal awarding agency shall prescribe requirements for 
recipients concerning the use and disposition of real property acquired 
in whole or in part under awards. Unless otherwise provided by statute, 
such requirements, at a minimum, shall contain the following.
    (a) Title to real property shall vest in the recipient subject to 
the condition that the recipient shall use the real property for the 
authorized purpose of the project as long as it is needed and shall not 
encumber the property without approval of the Federal awarding agency.
    (b) The recipient shall obtain written approval by the Federal 
awarding agency for the use of real property in other federally-
sponsored projects when the recipient determines that the property is no 
longer needed for the purpose of the original project. Use in other 
projects shall be limited to those under federally-sponsored projects 
(i.e., awards) or programs that have purposes consistent with those 
authorized for support by the Federal awarding agency.
    (c) When the real property is no longer needed as provided in 
paragraphs (a) and (b), the recipient shall request disposition 
instructions from the Federal awarding agency or its successor Federal 
awarding agency. The Federal awarding agency shall observe one or more 
of the following disposition instructions.
    (1) The recipient may be permitted to retain title without further 
obligation to the Federal Government after it compensates the Federal 
Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the 
property attributable to the Federal participation in the project.
    (2) The recipient may be directed to sell the property under 
guidelines provided by the Federal awarding agency and pay the Federal 
Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the 
property attributable to the Federal participation in the project (after 
deducting actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any, 
from the sales proceeds). When the recipient is authorized or required 
to sell the property, proper sales procedures shall be established that 
provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the 
highest possible return.
    (3) The recipient may be directed to transfer title to the property 
to the Federal Government or to an eligible third party provided that, 
in such cases, the recipient shall be entitled to compensation for its 
attributable percentage of the current fair market value of the 
property.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.403  Federally-owned and exempt property.

    (a) Federally-owned property. (1) Title to federally-owned property 
remains vested in the Federal Government. Recipients shall submit 
annually an inventory listing of federally-owned property in their 
custody to the Federal awarding agency. Upon completion of the award or 
when the property is no longer needed, the recipient shall report the 
property to the Federal awarding agency for further Federal agency 
utilization.

[[Page 316]]

    (2) If the Federal awarding agency has no further need for the 
property, it shall be declared excess and reported to the General 
Services Administration, unless the Federal awarding agency has 
statutory authority to dispose of the property by alternative methods 
(e.g., the authority provided by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 
U.S.C. 3710 (I)) to donate research equipment to educational and non-
profit organizations in accordance with E.O. 12821, ``Improving 
Mathematics and Science Education in Support of the National Education 
Goals.'') Appropriate instructions shall be issued to the recipient by 
the Federal awarding agency.
    (b) Exempt property. When statutory authority exists, the Federal 
awarding agency has the option to vest title to property acquired with 
Federal funds in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal 
Government and under conditions the Federal awarding agency considers 
appropriate. Such property is ``exempt property.'' Should a Federal 
awarding agency not establish conditions, title to exempt property upon 
acquisition shall vest in the recipient without further obligation to 
the Federal Government.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.404  Equipment.

    (a) Title to equipment acquired by a recipient with Federal funds 
shall vest in the recipient, subject to conditions of this section.
    (b) The recipient shall not use equipment acquired with Federal 
funds to provide services to non-Federal outside organizations for a fee 
that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, 
unless specifically authorized by Federal statute, for as long as the 
Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment.
    (c) The recipient shall use the equipment in the project or program 
for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project 
or program continues to be supported by Federal funds and shall not 
encumber the property without approval of the Federal awarding agency. 
When no longer needed for the original project or program, the recipient 
shall use the equipment in connection with its other federally-sponsored 
activities, in the following order of priority:
    (1) Activities sponsored by the Federal awarding agency which funded 
the original project, then
    (2) Activities sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies.
    (d) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program 
for which it was acquired, the recipient shall make it available for use 
on other projects or programs if such other use will not interfere with 
the work on the project or program for which the equipment was 
originally acquired. First preference for such other use shall be given 
to other projects or programs sponsored by the Federal awarding agency 
that financed the equipment; second preference shall be given to 
projects or programs sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. If 
the equipment is owned by the Federal Government, use on other 
activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible 
if authorized by the Federal awarding agency. User charges shall be 
treated as program income.
    (e) When acquiring replacement equipment, the recipient may use the 
equipment to be replaced as trade-in or sell the equipment and use the 
proceeds to offset the costs of the replacement equipment subject to the 
approval of the Federal awarding agency.
    (f) The recipient's property management standards for equipment 
acquired with Federal funds and federally-owned equipment shall include 
all of the following.
    (1) Equipment records shall be maintained accurately and shall 
include the following information.
    (i) A description of the equipment.
    (ii) Manufacturer's serial number, model number, Federal stock 
number, national stock number, or other identification number.
    (iii) Source of the equipment, including the award number.
    (iv) Whether title vests in the recipient or the Federal Government.
    (v) Acquisition date (or date received, if the equipment was 
furnished by the Federal Government) and cost.
    (vi) Information from which one can calculate the percentage of 
Federal

[[Page 317]]

participation in the cost of the equipment (not applicable to equipment 
furnished by the Federal Government).
    (vii) Location and condition of the equipment and the date the 
information was reported.
    (viii) Unit acquisition cost.
    (ix) Ultimate disposition data, including date of disposal and sales 
price or the method used to determine current fair market value where a 
recipient compensates the Federal awarding agency for its share.
    (2) Equipment owned by the Federal Government shall be identified to 
indicate Federal ownership.
    (3) A physical inventory of equipment shall be taken and the results 
reconciled with the equipment records at least once every two years. Any 
differences between quantities determined by the physical inspection and 
those shown in the accounting records shall be investigated to determine 
the causes of the difference. The recipient shall, in connection with 
the inventory, verify the existence, current utilization, and continued 
need for the equipment.
    (4) A control system shall be in effect to insure adequate 
safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the equipment. Any loss, 
damage, or theft of equipment shall be investigated and fully 
documented; if the equipment was owned by the Federal Government, the 
recipient shall promptly notify the Federal awarding agency.
    (5) Adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented to keep the 
equipment in good condition.
    (6) Where the recipient is authorized or required to sell the 
equipment, proper sales procedures shall be established which provide 
for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest 
possible return.
    (g) When the recipient no longer needs the equipment, the equipment 
may be used for other activities in accordance with the following 
standards. For equipment with a current per unit fair market value of 
$5000 or more, the recipient may retain the equipment for other uses 
provided that compensation is made to the original Federal awarding 
agency or its successor. The amount of compensation shall be computed by 
applying the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the 
original project or program to the current fair market value of the 
equipment. If the recipient has no need for the equipment, the recipient 
shall request disposition instructions from the Federal awarding agency. 
The Federal awarding agency shall determine whether the equipment can be 
used to meet the agency's requirements. If no requirement exists within 
that agency, the availability of the equipment shall be reported to the 
General Services Administration by the Federal awarding agency to 
determine whether a requirement for the equipment exists in other 
Federal agencies. The Federal awarding agency shall issue instructions 
to the recipient no later than 120 calendar days after the recipient's 
request and the following procedures shall govern.
    (1) If so instructed or if disposition instructions are not issued 
within 120 calendar days after the recipient's request, the recipient 
shall sell the equipment and reimburse the Federal awarding agency an 
amount computed by applying to the sales proceeds the percentage of 
Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program. 
However, the recipient shall be permitted to deduct and retain from the 
Federal share $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less, 
for the recipient's selling and handling expenses.
    (2) If the recipient is instructed to ship the equipment elsewhere, 
the recipient shall be reimbursed by the Federal Government by an amount 
which is computed by applying the percentage of the recipient's 
participation in the cost of the original project or program to the 
current fair market value of the equipment, plus any reasonable shipping 
or interim storage costs incurred.
    (3) If the recipient is instructed to otherwise dispose of the 
equipment, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the Federal awarding 
agency for such costs incurred in its disposition.
    (4) The Federal awarding agency may reserve the right to transfer 
the title to the Federal Government or to a third party named by the 
Federal Government when such third party is otherwise eligible under 
existing statutes.

[[Page 318]]

Such transfer shall be subject to the following standards.
    (i) The equipment shall be appropriately identified in the award or 
otherwise made known to the recipient in writing.
    (ii) The Federal awarding agency shall issue disposition 
instructions within 120 calendar days after receipt of a final 
inventory. The final inventory shall list all equipment acquired with 
grant funds and federally-owned equipment. If the Federal awarding 
agency fails to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar 
day period, the recipient shall apply the standards of this section, as 
appropriate.
    (iii) When the Federal awarding agency exercises its right to take 
title, the equipment shall be subject to the provisions for federally-
owned equipment.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.405  Supplies and other expendable property.

    (a) Title to supplies and other expendable property shall vest in 
the recipient upon acquisition. If there is a residual inventory of 
unused supplies exceeding $5000 in total aggregate value upon 
termination or completion of the project or program and the supplies are 
not needed for any other federally-sponsored project or program, the 
recipient shall retain the supplies for use on non-Federal sponsored 
activities or sell them, but shall, in either case, compensate the 
Federal Government for its share. The amount of compensation shall be 
computed in the same manner as for equipment.
    (b) The recipient shall not use supplies acquired with Federal funds 
to provide services to non-Federal outside organizations for a fee that 
is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless 
specifically authorized by Federal statute as long as the Federal 
Government retains an interest in the supplies.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.406  Intangible property.

    (a) The recipient may copyright any work that is subject to 
copyright and was developed, or for which ownership was purchased, under 
an award. The Federal awarding agency(ies) reserve a royalty-free, 
nonexclusive and irrevocable right to reproduce, publish, or otherwise 
use the work for Federal purposes, and to authorize others to do so.
    (b) Recipients are subject to applicable regulations governing 
patents and inventions, including governmentwide regulations issued by 
the Department of Commerce at 37 CFR part 401, ``Rights to Inventions 
Made by Nonprofit Organizations and Small Business Firms Under 
Government Grants, Contracts and Cooperative Agreements.''
    (c) Unless waived by the Federal awarding agency, the Federal 
Government has the right to paragraph (c)(1) and (2) of this section.
    (1) Obtain, reproduce, publish or otherwise use the data first 
produced under an award.
    (2) Authorize others to receive, reproduce, publish, or otherwise 
use such data for Federal purposes.
    (d) Title to intangible property and debt instruments acquired under 
an award or subaward vests upon acquisition in the recipient. The 
recipient shall use that property for the originally-authorized purpose, 
and the recipient shall not encumber the property without approval of 
the Federal awarding agency. When no longer needed for the originally 
authorized purpose, disposition of the intangible property shall occur 
in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 105-72.404(g).


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.407  Property trust relationship.

    Real property, equipment, intangible property and debt instruments 
that are acquired or improved with Federal funds shall be held in trust 
by the recipient as trustee for the beneficiaries of the project or 
program under which the property was acquired or improved. Agencies may 
require recipients to record liens or other appropriate notices of 
record to indicate that personal or real property has been acquired or 
improved with Federal funds and that use and disposition conditions 
apply to the property.

<R04>
    Subpart 105-72.50--Post-Award Requirements/Procurement Standards


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.500  Purpose of procurement standards.

    Sections 105-72.501 through 105-72.508 set forth standards for use 
by recipients in establishing procedures for the procurement of supplies 
and other expendable property, equipment, real property and other 
services with Federal funds. These standards are furnished to ensure 
that such materials and services are obtained in an effective manner and 
in compliance with the provisions of applicable Federal statutes and 
executive orders. No additional procurement standards or requirements 
shall be imposed by the Federal awarding agencies upon recipients, 
unless specifically required by Federal statute or executive order or 
approved by OMB.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.501  Recipient responsibilities.

    The standards contained in this section do not relieve the recipient 
of the contractual responsibilities arising under its contract(s). The 
recipient is the responsible authority, without recourse to the Federal 
awarding agency, regarding the settlement and satisfaction of all 
contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements 
entered into in support of an award or other agreement. This includes 
disputes, claims, protests of award, source evaluation or other matters 
of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of statute are to 
be referred to such Federal, State or local authority as may have proper 
jurisdiction.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.502  Codes of conduct.

    The recipient shall maintain written standards of conduct governing 
the performance of its employees engaged in the award and administration 
of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent shall participate in the 
selection, award, or administration of a contract supported by Federal 
funds if a real or apparent conflict of interest would be involved. Such 
a conflict would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member 
of his or her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization 
which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, 
has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for an award. The 
officers, employees, and agents of the recipient shall neither solicit 
nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from 
contractors, or parties to subagreements. However, recipients may set 
standards for situations in which the financial interest is not 
substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The 
standards of conduct shall provide for disciplinary actions to be 
applied for violations of such standards by officers, employees, or 
agents of the recipient.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.503  Competition.

    All procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner to 
provide, to the maximum extent practical, open and free competition. The 
recipient shall be alert to organizational conflicts of interest as well 
as noncompetitive practices among contractors that may restrict or 
eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. In order to ensure 
objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive 
advantage, contractors that develop or draft specifications, 
requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids and/or requests 
for proposals shall be excluded from competing for such procurements. 
Awards shall be made to the bidder or offeror whose bid or offer is 
responsive to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the 
recipient, price, quality and other factors considered. Solicitations 
shall clearly set forth all requirements that the bidder or offeror 
shall fulfill in order for the bid or offer to be evaluated by the 
recipient. Any and all bids or offers may be rejected when it is in the 
recipient's interest to do so.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.504  Procurement procedures.

    (a) All recipients shall establish written procurement procedures. 
These procedures shall provide for, at a minimum, that paragraphs 
(a)(1), (2) and (3) of this section apply.
    (1) Recipients avoid purchasing unnecessary items.
    (2) Where appropriate, an analysis is made of lease and purchase 
alternatives to determine which would be

[[Page 320]]

the most economical and practical procurement for the Federal 
Government.
    (3) Solicitations for goods and services provide for all of the 
following.
    (i) A clear and accurate description of the technical requirements 
for the material, product or service to be procured. In competitive 
procurements, such a description shall not contain features which unduly 
restrict competition.
    (ii) Requirements which the bidder/offeror must fulfill and all 
other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.
    (iii) A description, whenever practicable, of technical requirements 
in terms of functions to be performed or performance required, including 
the range of acceptable characteristics or minimum acceptable standards.
    (iv) The specific features of ``brand name or equal'' descriptions 
that bidders are required to meet when such items are included in the 
solicitation.
    (v) The acceptance, to the extent practicable and economically 
feasible, of products and services dimensioned in the metric system of 
measurement.
    (vi) Preference, to the extent practicable and economically 
feasible, for products and services that conserve natural resources and 
protect the environment and are energy efficient.
    (b) Positive efforts shall be made by recipients to utilize small 
businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises, 
whenever possible. Recipients of Federal awards shall take all of the 
following steps to further this goal.
    (1) Ensure that small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's 
business enterprises are used to the fullest extent practicable.
    (2) Make information on forthcoming opportunities available and 
arrange timeframes for purchases and contracts to encourage and 
facilitate participation by small businesses, minority-owned firms, and 
women's business enterprises.
    (3) Consider in the contract process whether firms competing for 
larger contracts intend to subcontract with small businesses, minority-
owned firms, and women's business enterprises.
    (4) Encourage contracting with consortiums of small businesses, 
minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises when a contract is 
too large for one of these firms to handle individually.
    (5) Use the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such 
organizations as the Small Business Administration and the Department of 
Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency in the solicitation and 
utilization of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's 
business enterprises.
    (c) The type of procuring instruments used (e.g., fixed price 
contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, purchase orders, and incentive 
contracts) shall be determined by the recipient but shall be appropriate 
for the particular procurement and for promoting the best interest of 
the program or project involved. The ``cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost'' 
or ``percentage of construction cost'' methods of contracting shall not 
be used.
    (d) Contracts shall be made only with responsible contractors who 
possess the potential ability to perform successfully under the terms 
and conditions of the proposed procurement. Consideration shall be given 
to such matters as contractor integrity, record of past performance, 
financial and technical resources or accessibility to other necessary 
resources. In certain circumstances, contracts with certain parties are 
restricted by agencies' implementation of E.O.s 12549 and 12689, 
``Debarment and Suspension.''
    (e) Recipients shall, on request, make available for the Federal 
awarding agency, pre-award review and procurement documents, such as 
request for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost 
estimates, etc., when any of the following conditions apply.
    (1) A recipient's procurement procedures or operation fails to 
comply with the procurement standards in the Federal awarding agency's 
implementation of this regulation.
    (2) The procurement is expected to exceed the small purchase 
threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403 (11) (currently $25,000) and is to be 
awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in 
response to a solicitation.

[[Page 321]]

    (3) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the small purchase 
threshold, specifies a ``brand name'' product.
    (4) The proposed award over the small purchase threshold is to be 
awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under a sealed bid 
procurement.
    (5) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract 
or increases the contract amount by more than the amount of the small 
purchase threshold.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.505  Cost and price analysis.

    Some form of cost or price analysis shall be made and documented in 
the procurement files in connection with every procurement action. Price 
analysis may be accomplished in various ways, including the comparison 
of price quotations submitted, market prices and similar indicia, 
together with discounts. Cost analysis is the review and evaluation of 
each element of cost to determine reasonableness, allocability and 
allowability.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.506  Procurement records.

    Procurement records and files for purchases in excess of the small 
purchase threshold shall include the following at a minimum:
    (a) Basis for contractor selection,
    (b) Justification for lack of competition when competitive bids or 
offers are not obtained, and
    (c) Basis for award cost or price.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.507  Contract administration.

    A system for contract administration shall be maintained to ensure 
contractor conformance with the terms, conditions and specifications of 
the contract and to ensure adequate and timely follow up of all 
purchases. Recipients shall evaluate contractor performance and 
document, as appropriate, whether contractors have met the terms, 
conditions and specifications of the contract.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.508  Contract provisions.

    The recipient shall include, in addition to provisions to define a 
sound and complete agreement, the following provisions in all contracts. 
The following provisions shall also be applied to subcontracts.
    (a) Contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall 
contain contractual provisions or conditions that allow for 
administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances in which a 
contractor violates or breaches the contract terms, and provide for such 
remedial actions as may be appropriate.
    (b) All contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall 
contain suitable provisions for termination by the recipient, including 
the manner by which termination shall be effected and the basis for 
settlement. In addition, such contracts shall describe conditions under 
which the contract may be terminated for default as well as conditions 
where the contract may be terminated because of circumstances beyond the 
control of the contractor.
    (c) Except as otherwise required by statute, an award that requires 
the contracting (or subcontracting) for construction or facility 
improvements shall provide for the recipient to follow its own 
requirements relating to bid guarantees, performance bonds, and payment 
bonds unless the construction contract or subcontract exceeds $100,000. 
For those contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000, the Federal 
awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the 
recipient, provided the Federal awarding agency has made a determination 
that the Federal Government's interest is adequately protected. If such 
a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements shall be as 
follows.
    (1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of 
the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist of a firm commitment 
such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument 
accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder shall, upon acceptance 
of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within 
the time specified.
    (2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent 
of the contract price. A ``performance bond'' is one executed in 
connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the

[[Page 322]]

contractor's obligations under such contract.
    (3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of 
the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed in connection 
with a contract to assure payment as required by statute of all persons 
supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for 
in the contract.
    (4) Where bonds are required in the situations described herein, the 
bonds shall be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority 
as acceptable sureties pursuant to 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety Companies 
Doing Business with the United States.''
    (d) All negotiated contracts (except those for less than the small 
purchase threshold) awarded by recipients shall include a provision to 
the effect that the recipient, the Federal awarding agency, the 
Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly 
authorized representatives, shall have access to any books, documents, 
papers and records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to a 
specific program for the purpose of making audits, examinations, 
excerpts and transcriptions.
    (e) All contracts, including small purchases, awarded by recipients 
and their contractors shall contain the procurement provisions of 
appendix A to this part, as applicable.


<R04>
     Subpart 105-72.60--Post-Award Requirements/Reports and Records


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.600  Purpose of reports and records.

    Sections 105-72.601 through 105-72.603 set forth the procedures for 
monitoring and reporting on the recipient's financial and program 
performance and the necessary standard reporting forms. They also set 
forth record retention requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.601  Monitoring and reporting program performance.

    (a) Recipients are responsible for managing and monitoring each 
project, program, subaward, function or activity supported by the award. 
Recipients shall monitor subawards to ensure subrecipients have met the 
audit requirements as delineated in Sec. 105-72.306.
    (b) The Federal awarding agency shall prescribe the frequency with 
which the performance reports shall be submitted. Except as provided in 
paragraph (f) of this section, performance reports shall not be required 
more frequently than quarterly or, less frequently than annually. Annual 
reports shall be due 90 calendar days after the grant year; quarterly or 
semiannual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. The 
Federal awarding agency may require annual reports before the 
anniversary dates of multiple year awards in lieu of these requirements. 
The final performance reports are due 90 calendar days after the 
expiration or termination of the award.
    (c) If inappropriate, a final technical or performance report shall 
not be required after completion of the project.
    (d) When required, performance reports shall generally contain, for 
each award, brief information on each of the following.
    (1) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals and 
objectives established for the period, the findings of the investigator, 
or both. Whenever appropriate and the output of programs or projects can 
be readily quantified, such quantitative data should be related to cost 
data for computation of unit costs.
    (2) Reasons why established goals were not met, if appropriate.
    (3) Other pertinent information including, when appropriate, 
analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.
    (e) Recipients shall not be required to submit more than the 
original and two copies of performance reports.
    (f) Recipients shall immediately notify the Federal awarding agency 
of developments that have a significant impact on the award-supported 
activities. Also, notification shall be given in the case of problems, 
delays, or adverse conditions which materially impair the ability to 
meet the objectives of the award. This notification shall include a 
statement of the action taken or contemplated, and any assistance needed 
to resolve the situation.
    (g) Federal awarding agencies may make site visits, as needed.

[[Page 323]]

    (h) Federal awarding agencies shall comply with clearance 
requirements of 5 CFR part 1320 when requesting performance data from 
recipients.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.602  Financial reporting.

    (a) The following forms or such other forms as may be approved by 
OMB are authorized for obtaining financial information from recipients.
    (1) SF-269 or SF-269A, Financial Status Report. (i) Each Federal 
awarding agency shall require recipients to use the SF-269 or SF-269A to 
report the status of funds for all nonconstruction projects or programs. 
A Federal awarding agency may, however, have the option of not requiring 
the SF-269 or SF-269A when the SF-270, Request for Advance or 
Reimbursement, or SF-272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions, is 
determined to provide adequate information to meet its needs, except 
that a final SF-269 or SF-269A shall be required at the completion of 
the project when the SF-270 is used only for advances.
    (ii) The Federal awarding agency shall prescribe whether the report 
shall be on a cash or accrual basis. If the Federal awarding agency 
requires accrual information and the recipient's accounting records are 
not normally kept on the accrual basis, the recipient shall not be 
required to convert its accounting system, but shall develop such 
accrual information through best estimates based on an analysis of the 
documentation on hand.
    (iii) The Federal awarding agency shall determine the frequency of 
the Financial Status Report for each project or program, considering the 
size and complexity of the particular project or program. However, the 
report shall not be required more frequently than quarterly or less 
frequently than annually. A final report shall be required at the 
completion of the agreement.
    (iv) The Federal awarding agency shall require recipients to submit 
the SF-269 or SF-269A (an original and no more than two copies) no later 
than 30 days after the end of each specified reporting period for 
quarterly and semiannual reports, and 90 calendar days for annual and 
final reports. Extensions of reporting due dates may be approved by the 
Federal awarding agency upon request of the recipient.
    (2) SF-272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions. (i) When funds are 
advanced to recipients the Federal awarding agency shall require each 
recipient to submit the SF-272 and, when necessary, its continuation 
sheet, SF-272a. The Federal awarding agency shall use this report to 
monitor cash advanced to recipients and to obtain disbursement 
information for each agreement with the recipients.
    (ii) Federal awarding agencies may require forecasts of Federal cash 
requirements in the ``Remarks'' section of the report.
    (iii) When practical and deemed necessary, Federal awarding agencies 
may require recipients to report in the ``Remarks'' section the amount 
of cash advances received in excess of three days. Recipients shall 
provide short narrative explanations of actions taken to reduce the 
excess balances.
    (iv) Recipients shall be required to submit not more than the 
original and two copies of the SF-272, 15 calendar days following the 
end of each quarter. The Federal awarding agencies may require a monthly 
report from those recipients receiving advances totaling $1 million or 
more per year.
    (v) Federal awarding agencies may waive the requirement for 
submission of the SF-272 for any one of the following reasons:
    (A) When monthly advances do not exceed $25,000 per recipient, 
provided that such advances are monitored through other forms contained 
in this section;
    (B) If, in the Federal awarding agency's opinion, the recipient's 
accounting controls are adequate to minimize excessive Federal advances; 
or,
    (C) When the electronic payment mechanisms provide adequate data.
    (b) When the Federal awarding agency needs additional information or 
more frequent reports, the following shall be observed.
    (1) When additional information is needed to comply with legislative 
requirements, Federal awarding agencies shall issue instructions to 
require recipients to submit such information under the ``Remarks'' 
section of the reports.

[[Page 324]]

    (2) When a Federal awarding agency determines that a recipient's 
accounting system does not meet the standards in Sec. 105-72.301, 
additional pertinent information to further monitor awards may be 
obtained upon written notice to the recipient until such time as the 
system is brought up to standard. The Federal awarding agency, in 
obtaining this information, shall comply with report clearance 
requirements of 5 CFR part 1320.
    (3) Federal awarding agencies are encouraged to shade out any line 
item on any report if not necessary.
    (4) Federal awarding agencies may accept the identical information 
from the recipients in machine readable format or computer printouts or 
electronic outputs in lieu of prescribed formats.
    (5) Federal awarding agencies may provide computer or electronic 
outputs to recipients when such expedites or contributes to the accuracy 
of reporting.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.603  Retention and access requirements for records.

    (a) This section sets forth requirements for record retention and 
access to records for awards to recipients. Federal awarding agencies 
shall not impose any other record retention or access requirements upon 
recipients.
    (b) Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, 
and all other records pertinent to an award shall be retained for a 
period of three years from the date of submission of the final 
expenditure report or, for awards that are renewed quarterly or 
annually, from the date of the submission of the quarterly or annual 
financial report, as authorized by the Federal awarding agency. The only 
exceptions are the following.
    (1) If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the 
expiration of the 3-year period, the records shall be retained until all 
litigation, claims or audit findings involving the records have been 
resolved and final action taken.
    (2) Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal 
funds shall be retained for 3 years after final disposition.
    (3) When records are transferred to or maintained by the Federal 
awarding agency, the 3-year retention requirement is not applicable to 
the recipient.
    (4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc., as 
specified in paragraph (g) of this section.
    (c) Copies of original records may be substituted for the original 
records if authorized by the Federal awarding agency.
    (d) The Federal awarding agency shall request transfer of certain 
records to its custody from recipients when it determines that the 
records possess long term retention value. However, in order to avoid 
duplicate recordkeeping, a Federal awarding agency may make arrangements 
for recipients to retain any records that are continuously needed for 
joint use.
    (e) The Federal awarding agency, the Inspector General, Comptroller 
General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized 
representatives, have the right of timely and unrestricted access to any 
books, documents, papers, or other records of recipients that are 
pertinent to the awards, in order to make audits, examinations, 
excerpts, transcripts and copies of such documents. This right also 
includes timely and reasonable access to a recipient's personnel for the 
purpose of interview and discussion related to such documents. The 
rights of access in this paragraph are not limited to the required 
retention period, but shall last as long as records are retained.
    (f) Unless required by statute, no Federal awarding agency shall 
place restrictions on recipients that limit public access to the records 
of recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when the Federal 
awarding agency can demonstrate that such records shall be kept 
confidential and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to 
the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if the records had 
belonged to the Federal awarding agency.
    (g) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. 
Paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) apply to the following types of documents, 
and their supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or 
proposals, cost allocation

[[Page 325]]

plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate at which a 
particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage 
chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).
    (1) If submitted for negotiation. If the recipient submits to the 
Federal awarding agency or the subrecipient submits to the recipient the 
proposal, plan, or other computation to form the basis for negotiation 
of the rate, then the 3-year retention period for its supporting records 
starts on the date of such submission.
    (2) If not submitted for negotiation. If the recipient is not 
required to submit to the Federal awarding agency or the subrecipient is 
not required to submit to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other 
computation for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year retention period 
for the proposal, plan, or other computation and its supporting records 
starts at the end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) 
covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.


<R04>
 Subpart 105-72.70--Post-Award Requirements/Termination and Enforcement


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.700  Purpose of termination and enforcement.

    Section 105-72.701 and Sec. 105-72.702 set forth uniform suspension, 
termination and enforcement procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.701  Termination.

    (a) Awards may be terminated in whole or in part only if paragraph 
(a)(1), (2) or (3) of this section apply.
    (1) By the Federal awarding agency, if a recipient materially fails 
to comply with the terms and conditions of an award.
    (2) By the Federal awarding agency with the consent of the 
recipient, in which case the two parties shall agree upon the 
termination conditions, including the effective date and, in the case of 
partial termination, the portion to be terminated.
    (3) By the recipient upon sending to the Federal awarding agency 
written notification setting forth the reasons for such termination, the 
effective date, and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to 
be terminated. However, if the Federal awarding agency determines in the 
case of partial termination that the reduced or modified portion of the 
grant will not accomplish the purposes for which the grant was made, it 
may terminate the grant in its entirety under either paragraphs (a) (1) 
or (2).
    (b) If costs are allowed under an award, the responsibilities of the 
recipient referred to in Sec. 105-72.801(a), including those for 
property management as applicable, shall be considered in the 
termination of the award, and provision shall be made for continuing 
responsibilities of the recipient after termination, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.702  Enforcement.

    (a) Remedies for noncompliance. If a recipient materially fails to 
comply with the terms and conditions of an award, whether stated in a 
Federal statute, regulation, assurance, application, or notice of award, 
the Federal awarding agency may, in addition to imposing any of the 
special conditions outlined in Sec. 105-72.204, take one or more of the 
following actions, as appropriate in the circumstances.
    (1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the 
deficiency by the recipient or more severe enforcement action by the 
Federal awarding agency.
    (2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable 
matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action 
not in compliance.
    (3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award.
    (4) Withhold further awards for the project or program.
    (5) Take other remedies that may be legally available.
    (b) Hearings and appeals. In taking an enforcement action, the 
awarding agency shall provide the recipient an opportunity for hearing, 
appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the recipient is 
entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the action 
involved.
    (c) Effects of suspension and termination. Costs of a recipient 
resulting from obligations incurred by the recipient during a suspension 
or after

[[Page 326]]

termination of an award are not allowable unless the awarding agency 
expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or termination or 
subsequently. Other recipient costs during suspension or after 
termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are 
allowable if paragraph (c) (1) and (2) of this section apply.
    (1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred 
by the recipient before the effective date of suspension or termination, 
are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are 
noncancellable.
    (2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or 
expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the 
termination takes effect.
    (d) Relationship to debarment and suspension. The enforcement 
remedies identified in this section, including suspension and 
termination, do not preclude a recipient from being subject to debarment 
and suspension under E.O.s 12549 and 12689 and the Federal awarding 
agency implementing regulations (see Sec. 105-72.203).

    Sections 105-72.801 through 105-72.803 contain closeout procedures 
and other procedures for subsequent disallowances and adjustments.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.801  Closeout procedures.

    (a) Recipients shall submit, within 90 calendar days after the date 
of completion of the award, all financial, performance, and other 
reports as required by the terms and conditions of the award. The 
Federal awarding agency may approve extensions when requested by the 
recipient.
    (b) Unless the Federal awarding agency authorizes an extension, a 
recipient shall liquidate all obligations incurred under the award not 
later than 90 calendar days after the funding period or the date of 
completion as specified in the terms and conditions of the award or in 
agency implementing instructions.
    (c) The Federal awarding agency shall make prompt payments to a 
recipient for allowable reimbursable costs under the award being closed 
out.
    (d) The recipient shall promptly refund any balances of unobligated 
cash that the Federal awarding agency has advanced or paid and that is 
not authorized to be retained by the recipient for use in other 
projects. OMB Circular A-129 governs unreturned amounts that become 
delinquent debts.
    (e) When authorized by the terms and conditions of the award, the 
Federal awarding agency shall make a settlement for any upward or 
downward adjustments to the Federal share of costs after closeout 
reports are received.
    (f) The recipient shall account for any real and personal property 
acquired with Federal funds or received from the Federal Government in 
accordance with Sec. 105-72.401 through Sec. 105-72.407.
    (g) In the event a final audit has not been performed prior to the 
closeout of an award, the Federal awarding agency shall retain the right 
to recover an appropriate amount after fully considering the 
recommendations on disallowed costs resulting from the final audit.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.802  Subsequent adjustments and continuing responsibilities.

    (a) The closeout of an award does not affect any of the following.
    (1) The right of the Federal awarding agency to disallow costs and 
recover funds on the basis of a later audit or other review.
    (2) The obligation of the recipient to return any funds due as a 
result of later refunds, corrections, or other transactions.
    (3) Audit requirements in Sec. 105-72.306.
    (4) Property management requirements in Sec. 105-72.401 through 
Sec. 105-72.407.
    (5) Records retention as required in Sec. 105-72.603.
    (b) After closeout of an award, a relationship created under an 
award may be modified or ended in whole or in part with the consent of 
the Federal awarding agency and the recipient, provided the 
responsibilities of the recipient referred to in Sec. 105-72.803(a), 
including those for property management

[[Page 327]]

as applicable, are considered and provisions made for continuing 
responsibilities of the recipient, as appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 105-72.803  Collection of amounts due.

    (a) Any funds paid to a recipient in excess of the amount to which 
the recipient is finally determined to be entitled under the terms and 
conditions of the award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. If 
not paid within a reasonable period after the demand for payment, the 
Federal awarding agency may reduce the debt by paragraph (a) (1), (2) or 
(3) of this section.
    (1) Making an administrative offset against other requests for 
reimbursements.
    (2) Withholding advance payments otherwise due to the recipient.
    (3) Taking other action permitted by statute.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided by law, the Federal awarding agency 
shall charge interest on an overdue debt in accordance with 4 CFR 
Chapter II, Federal Claims Collection Standards.

             Appendix A to Part 105-72--Contract Provisions

    All contracts, awarded by a recipient including small purchases, 
shall contain the following provisions as applicable:
    1. Equal Employment Opportunity--All contracts shall contain a 
provision requiring compliance with E.O. 11246, ``Equal Employment 
Opportunity,'' as amended by E.O. 11375, ``Amending Executive Order 
11246 Relating to Equal Employment Opportunity,'' and as supplemented by 
regulations at 41 CFR part 60, ``Office of Federal Contract Compliance 
Programs, Equal Employment Opportunity, Department of Labor.''
    2. Copeland ``Anti-Kickback'' Act (18 U.S.C. 874 and 40 U.S.C. 
276c)--All contracts and subgrants in excess of $2000 for construction 
or repair awarded by recipients and subrecipients shall include a 
provision for compliance with the Copeland ``Anti-Kickback'' Act (18 
U.S.C. 874), as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR 
part 3, ``Contractors and Subcontractors on Public Building or Public 
Work Financed in Whole or in Part by Loans or Grants from the United 
States''). The Act provides that each contractor or subrecipient shall 
be prohibited from inducing, by any means, any person employed in the 
construction, completion, or repair of public work, to give up any part 
of the compensation to which he is otherwise entitled. The recipient 
shall report all suspected or reported violations to the Federal 
awarding agency.
    3. Davis-Bacon Act, as amended (40 U.S.C. 276a to a-7)--When 
required by Federal program legislation, all construction contracts 
awarded by the recipients and subrecipients of more than $2000 shall 
include a provision for compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 
276a to a-7) and as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 
CFR part 5, ``Labor Standards Provisions Applicable to Contracts 
Governing Federally Financed and Assisted Construction''). Under this 
Act, contractors shall be required to pay wages to laborers and 
mechanics at a rate not less than the minimum wages specified in a wage 
determination made by the Secretary of Labor. In addition, contractors 
shall be required to pay wages not less than once a week. The recipient 
shall place a copy of the current prevailing wage determination issued 
by the Department of Labor in each solicitation and the award of a 
contract shall be conditioned upon the acceptance of the wage 
determination. The recipient shall report all suspected or reported 
violations to the Federal awarding agency.
    4. Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-
333)--Where applicable, all contracts awarded by recipients in excess of 
$2000 for construction contracts and in excess of $2500 for other 
contracts that involve the employment of mechanics or laborers shall 
include a provision for compliance with Sections 102 and 107 of the 
Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-333), as 
supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 5). Under 
Section 102 of the Act, each contractor shall be required to compute the 
wages of every mechanic and laborer on the basis of a standard work week 
of 40 hours. Work in excess of the standard work week is permissible 
provided that the worker is compensated at a rate of not less than 1\1/
2\ times the basic rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 40 
hours in the work week. Section 107 of the Act is applicable to 
construction work and provides that no laborer or mechanic shall be 
required to work in surroundings or under working conditions which are 
unsanitary, hazardous or dangerous. These requirements do not apply to 
the purchases of supplies or materials or articles ordinarily available 
on the open market, or contracts for transportation or transmission of 
intelligence.
    5. Rights to Inventions Made Under a Contract or Agreement--
Contracts or agreements for the performance of experimental, 
developmental, or research work shall provide for the rights of the 
Federal Government and the recipient in any resulting invention in 
accordance with 37 CFR part 401, ``Rights to Inventions Made by 
Nonprofit Organizations and Small Business Firms Under Government 
Grants, Contracts and Cooperative

[[Page 328]]

Agreements,'' and any implementing regulations issued by the awarding 
agency.
    6. Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) and the Federal Water 
Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), as amended--Contracts 
and subgrants of amounts in excess of $100,000 shall contain a provision 
that requires the recipient to agree to comply with all applicable 
standards, orders or regulations issued pursuant to the Clean Air Act 
(42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as 
amended (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.). Violations shall be reported to the 
Federal awarding agency and the Regional Office of the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA).
    7. Byrd Anti-Lobbying Amendment (31 U.S.C. 1352)--Contractors who 
apply or bid for an award of $100,000 or more shall file the required 
certification. Each tier certifies to the tier above that it will not 
and has not used Federal appropriated funds to pay any person or 
organization for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or 
employee of any agency, a member of Congress, officer or employee of 
Congress, or an employee of a member of Congress in connection with 
obtaining any Federal contract, grant or any other award covered by 31 
U.S.C. 1352. Each tier shall also disclose any lobbying with non-Federal 
funds that takes place in connection with obtaining any Federal award. 
Such disclosures are forwarded from tier to tier up to the recipient.
    8. Debarment and Suspension (E.O.s 12549 and 12689)--No contract 
shall be made to parties listed on the General Services Administration's

management statutory authorities that are unique to the Department 
(e.g., section 161g of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2201(g)) 
and section 3155 of

[[Page 332]]

the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (42 U.S.C. 
72741)) are not addressed in these regulations.


<R05>

kinds of operations.


<R04>
 Subpart 109-1.51--Personal Property Management Standards and Practices


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5100  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart provides guidance on DOE standards and practices to be 
applied in the management of personal property. The standards and 
practices that apply to equipment shall be based on the unit acquisition 
cost threshold specified in the definition of equipment contained in 
section Sec. 109-1.100-51 of this part. No other acquisition cost 
threshold shall apply.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5101  Official use of personal property.

    Personal property shall be used only in the performance of official 
work of the United States Government, except:
    (a) In emergencies threatening loss of life or property as 
authorized by law;
    (b) As otherwise authorized by law and approved by the Director, 
Office of Administrative Services; heads of field organizations for

<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5103  Loan of personal property.

    (a) Personal property which is not excess and would otherwise be out 
of service for temporary periods may be loaned to other DOE offices and 
contractors, other Federal agencies, and to others for official 
purposes. The loan request shall be in writing, stating the purpose of 
the loan and period of time required. The loan shall be executed on DOE 
Form 4420.2, Personal Property Loan Agreement or computer generated 
equivalent when approved in writing by the OPMO or on-site DOE property 
administrator. When approved, a memorandum transmitting the loan 
agreement shall be prepared identifying the loan period, delivery time, 
method of payment and transportation, and point of delivery and return, 
to ensure proper control and protect DOE's interest. The loan period 
shall not exceed one year, but may be renewed in one year increments. 
Second renewals of loan agreements shall be reviewed and justified at a 
level of management at least two levels above that of the individual 
making the determination to loan the property. Third renewals shall be 
approved by the head of the field organization or designee.
    (b) Requests for loans to foreign Governments and other foreign 
organizations shall be submitted to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for

classified as Equipment Held For Future Projects (EHFFP) or as In 
Standby should be reviewed by those receiving availability inquiries for 
short-term use (one year or less). Borrowing of Government personal 
property from other Federal agencies is also encouraged when required 
for short periods of time. Such transactions shall be covered by written 
agreements which include all terms of the transaction.
    (b) In determining whether it is practical and economical to borrow 
personal property, consideration shall be given to suitability, 
condition, value, extent and nature of use, extent of availability, 
portability, cost of transportation, and other similar factors.
    (c) Adequate records and controls shall be established and 
maintained for borrowed property to ensure its proper control and prompt 
return to the lender.

[[Page 337]]


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5105  Identification marking of personal property.

    (a) Personal property shall be marked ``U.S. Government property'' 
(if marking space is limited, property may be marked ``U.S. DOE'') 
subject to the criteria below. The markings shall be securely affixed to 
the property, legible, and conspicuous. Examples of appropriate marking 
media are bar code labels, decals, and stamping.
    (1) Equipment and sensitive items shall be marked ``U.S. Government 
property'' and numbered for control purposes.
    (2) Administratively controlled property and other personal property 
susceptible to unauthorized personal use should be marked ``U.S. 
Government property'' and numbered for control purposes.
    (b) Personal property which by its nature cannot be marked, such as 
stores items, metal stock, etc., is exempted from this requirement.
    (c) To the extent practicable and economical, markings shall be 
removed prior to disposal outside of DOE, or, if removal is impractical, 
additional permanent markings must be added to indicate such disposal.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5106  Segregation of personal property.

    Ordinarily, contractor-owned personal property shall be segregated 
from Government personal property. Commingling of Government and 
contractor-owned personal property may be allowed only when:
    (a) The segregation of the property would materially hinder the 
progress of the work (i.e., segregation is not feasible for reasons such 
as small quantities, lack of space, or increased costs); and
    (b) Control procedures are adequate (i.e., the Government property 
is specifically marked or otherwise identified as Government property).


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5107  Physical protection of personal property.

    Controls such as property pass systems, memorandum records, regular 
or intermittent gate checks, and/or perimeter fencing shall be 
established as appropriate to prevent loss, theft, or unauthorized 
removal of property from the premises on which such personal property is 
located.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5108  Personal property records requirements.

    The contractor's property control records shall provide the 
following basic information for every accountable item of Government 
personal property in the contractor's possession and any other data 
elements required by specific contract provisions:
    (a) Contract number or equivalent code designation.
    (b) Asset type.
    (c) Description of item (name, serial number, national stock number 
(if available)).
    (d) Property control number (Government ownership identity).

<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5108-2  Sensitive items.

    Individual item records will be maintained for each sensitive item. 
Minimum dollar value thresholds for controlling sensitive items, if 
used, will be determined by the OPMO for each DOE organization in 
consultation with appropriate management officials. This threshold may 
be applied organization-wide or by individual contractors or location. 
Identification of types of property meeting the DOE-PMR definition of 
sensitive property should be the primary determinant of sensitive 
category, with dollar thresholds, if any,

[[Page 338]]

considered as a guideline only. Sensitive items which are also equipment 
will be controlled as both sensitive items and equipment.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5108-3  Stores inventories.

    Perpetual inventory records are to be maintained for stores 
inventory items.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5108-4  Precious metals.

    Perpetual inventory records are to be maintained for precious 
metals.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5108-5  Administratively controlled items.

    No formal property management records are required to be maintained 
for this category of personal property, which includes such items as 
those controlled for calibration or maintenance purposes, contaminated 
property, tool crib items, and equipment pool items. Various control 
records can be employed to help safeguard this property against waste 
and abuse, including purchase vs. use information, tool crib check-outs, 
loss and theft reports, calibration records, disposal records, and other 
similar records. Control techniques would include physical security, 
custodial responsibility, identification/marking, or other locally 
established control techniques.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5109  Control of sensitive items.

    (a) A list of types of personal property considered to be sensitive 
shall be developed and maintained by each DOE activity/site, taking into 
consideration value, costs of administration, need for control, and 
other factors that management determines should apply.
    (b) Items of equipment which are also designated as sensitive items 
will be controlled as sensitive items and as equipment.
    (c) Written procedures shall be established for control of sensitive 
items and shall address:
    (1) Approval of purchase requisitions or issue documents at an 
appropriate supervisory level;
    (2) Establishment of controls in the central receiving and 
warehousing department, such as extraordinary physical protection, 
handling, and maintenance of a current listing of sensitive items;
    (3) Establishment and maintenance of appropriate records;
    (4) Requirement for tagging and identification;
    (5) Use of memorandum receipts or custody documents at time of 
assignment or change in custody;
    (6) Establishment of custodial responsibilities describing:
    (i) Need for extraordinary physical protection;
    (ii) Requirement for efficient physical and administrative control 
of sensitive items assigned for general use within an organizational 
unit as appropriate to the type of property and the circumstances;
    (iii) Requirement for prompt reporting and investigation of loss, 
damage or destruction; and
    (iv) Requirement for promptly reporting changes in custody.
    (7) Requirement for periodic physical inventories (see Sec. 109-
1.5110 of this part).
    (8) Requirement for an employee transfer or termination check-out 
procedure and examination and adjustment of records;
    (9) Reminder of prohibition of use for other than official purposes 
and penalties for misuse;
    (10) A clear statement of the extent of responsibility for financial 
accountability depending upon contractor policy; and
    (11) Other procedures which have demonstrated efficient physical and 
administrative control over sensitive items.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5110  Physical inventories of personal property.

    (a) Physical inventories of those categories of personal property as 
specified in paragraph (f) of this section shall be conducted at all DOE 
and designated contractor locations.
    (b) Physical inventories shall be performed by the use of personnel 
other than custodians of the property. Where staffing restraints or 
other considerations apply, the inventory may be performed by the 
custodian with verification by a second party.

[[Page 339]]

    (c) Detailed procedures for the taking of physical inventories shall 
be developed for each DOE office and designated contractor. The OPMO 
shall review and approve the DOE office and contractor procedures.
    (d) The conduct of a physical inventory will be observed, or follow-
on audits made, by independent representatives, e.g., finance, audit, or 
property personnel, to the extent deemed necessary to assure that 
approved procedures are being followed and results are accurate. These 
observations or audits shall be documented and the documentation 
retained in the inventory record file.
    (e) Procedures that are limited to a check-off of a listing of 
recorded property without actual verification of the location and 
existence of such property do not meet the requirements of a physical 
inventory.
    (f) The frequency of physical inventories of personal property shall 
be as follows:
    (1) Equipment--biennial.
    (2) Sensitive items--annual (see paragraph 109-1.5110(l) of this 
section).
    (3) Stores inventories--annual.
    (4) Precious metals--annual.
    (5) Administratively controlled items--There is no formal Department 
requirement for the performance of physical inventories of this 
property. However, OPMOs should determine such requirements based on 
management needs.
    (g) Physical inventories shall be performed at intervals more 
frequently than required when experience at any given location or with 
any given item or items indicates that this action is necessary for 
effective property accounting, utilization, or control.
    (h) Physical inventories of equipment may be conducted by the 
``inventory by exception'' method. The system and procedures for taking 
physical inventories by this method must be fully documented and 
approved in writing by the OPMO.
    (i) The results of physical inventories shall be reconciled with the 
property records, and with applicable financial control accounts.
    (j) The results of physical inventories shall be reported to the 
OPMO within 30 days after the reconciliation required above.
    (k) Physical inventories of equipment and stores inventories may be 
conducted using statistical sampling methods in lieu of the normal wall-
to-wall method. The sampling methods employed must be statistically 
valid and approved in writing by the OPMO. If use of the statistical 
methods of physical inventory does not produce acceptable results, the 
wall-to-wall method shall be used to complete the inventories.
    (l) Physical inventories of sensitive items (excluding arms, 
ammunition, and military property) having an acquisition cost of $2,000 
or less may also be conducted using statistical sampling methods. 
However if statistical sampling methods are used, a wall-to-wall 
inventory is required no less frequently than every three years and at 
contract completion (unless there is a follow-on contract with the same 
contractor).


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5111  Retirement of property.

    When Government property is worn out, lost, stolen, destroyed, 
abandoned, or damaged beyond economical repair, it shall be listed on a 
retirement work order. A full explanation shall be supported by an 
investigation, if necessary, as to the date and circumstances 
surrounding the wear, loss, theft, destruction, abandonment, or damage. 
The retirement work order shall be signed by the responsible official 
initiating the report and reviewed and approved by an official at least 
one supervisory level above the official initiating the report.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5112  Loss, damage, or destruction of personal property in possession of DOE direct operations.

    DOE offices shall establish procedures to provide for the reporting, 
documentation, and investigation of instances of loss, damage, or 
destruction of personal property including:
    (a) Notification to appropriate DOE organizations and law 
enforcement offices;
    (b) Determination of cause or origin;
    (c) Liability and responsibility for repair or replacement; and

[[Page 340]]

    (d) Actions taken to prevent further loss, damage, or destruction, 
and to prevent repetition of similar incidents.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5113  Loss, damage, or destruction of personal property in possession of designated contractors.

    (a) Designated contractors shall report any loss, damage, or 
destruction of personal property in its possession or control, including 
property in the possession or control of subcontractors, to the property 
administrator as soon as it becomes known.
    (b) When physical inventories, consumption analyses, or other 
actions disclose consumption of property considered unreasonable by the 
property administrator; or loss, damage, or destruction of personal 
property not previously reported by the contractor, the property 
administrator shall require the contractor to investigate the incidents 
and submit written reports.
    (c) Reports of physical inventory results and identified 
discrepancies shall be submitted to the property administrator within 90 
days of completion of physical inventories. An acceptable percentage of 
shrinkage for stores inventories shall be determined by the property 
administrator on a location-by-location basis, based on type and cost of 
materials, historical data, and other site-specific factors. This 
determination shall be in writing and be supported by appropriate 
documentation.
    (d) The contractor's report referenced above shall contain factual 
data as to the circumstances surrounding the loss, damage, destruction 
or excessive consumption, including:
    (1) The contractor's name and contract number;
    (2) A description of the property;
    (3) Cost of the property, and cost of repairs in instances of damage 
(in event actual cost is not known, use reasonable estimate);
    (4) The date, time (if pertinent), and cause or origin; and
    (5) Actions taken by the contractor to prevent further loss, damage, 
destruction, or unreasonable consumption, and to prevent repetition of 
similar incidents.
    (e) The property administrator shall ensure that the corrective 
actions taken by the contractor under paragraph (d)(5) of this section 
satisfactorily address system weaknesses.
    (f) The contracting officer shall make a determination of contractor 
liability with a copy of the determination furnished to the contractor 
and the property administrator. Costs may be assessed against a 
contractor for physical inventory discrepancies or other instances of 
loss of Government property within the terms of the contract. Credit 
should only be applied if specific items reported as lost can be 
uniquely identified. General physical inventory write-ons are not to be 
used as a credit.
    (g) If part of a designated contractor's personal property 
management system is found to be unsatisfactory, the property 
administrator shall increase surveillance of that part to prevent, to 
the extent possible, any loss, damage, destruction or unreasonable 
consumption of personal property. The property administrator shall give 
special attention to reasonably assuring that any loss, damage, 
destruction or unreasonable consumption occurring during a period when a 
contractor's personal property management system is not approved is 
identified before approval or reinstatement of approval.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5114  Use of non-Government-owned property.

    Non-Government-owned personal property shall not be installed in, 
affixed to, or otherwise made a part of any Government-owned personal 
property when such action will adversely affect the operation or 
condition of the Government property.

<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5204  Review and approval of a designated contractor's personal property management system.

    (a) An initial review of a designated contractor's personal property 
management system shall be performed by the property administrator 
within one year after the execution date of the contract, except for 
contract extensions or renewals or when an existing contractor has been 
awarded a follow-on contract. The purpose of the review is to determine 
whether the contractor's system provides adequate protection, 
maintenance, utilization, and disposition of personal property, and 
reasonable assurance that the Department's personal property is 
safeguarded against waste, loss, unauthorized use, or misappropriation, 
in accordance with applicable statutes, regulations, contract terms and 
conditions, programmatic needs, and good business practices. If 
circumstances preclude completion of the initial review within the 
``within one year'' initial review requirement, the property 
administrator shall request a deviation from the requirement in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 109-1.110-50 of this part.
    (b) If a designated contractor is the successor to a previous 
designated contractor and the contract award was based in part on the 
contractor's proposal to overhaul the existing personal property 
management system(s), the ``within one year'' initial review requirement 
may be extended based on:
    (1) The scope of the overhaul; and
    (2) An analysis of the cost to implement the overhaul within a year 
versus a proposed extended period.
    (c) When an existing contract has been extended or renewed, or the 
designated contractor has been awarded a follow-on contract, an initial 
review of the contractor's personal property management system is not 
required. In such cases, the established appraisal schedule will 
continue to be followed as prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) At a minimum of every three years after the date of approval of 
a designated contractor's property management system, the OPMO shall 
make an appraisal of the personal property management operation of the 
contractor. The purpose of the appraisal is to determine if the 
contractor is managing personal property in accordance with its 
previously approved system and procedures, and to establish whether such 
procedures are efficient. The appraisal may be based on a formal 
comprehensive appraisal or a series of formal appraisals of the 
functional segments of the contractor's operation.
    (e) A designated contractor's property management system shall be 
approved, conditionally approved, or disapproved in writing by the head 
of the field organization with advice of the contracting officer, 
property administrator, OPMO, legal counsel, DPMO, and appropriate 
program officials. Approval authority may be redelegated to the 
contracting officer or contracting officer's designee. Conditional 
approval and disapproval authority cannot be redelegated. When a system 
is conditionally approved or disapproved, the property administrator or 
contracting officer shall advise the contractor, in writing, of 
deficiencies that need to be corrected, and a time schedule established 
for completion of corrective actions.
    (f) Appropriate follow-up will be made by the property administrator 
to ensure that corrective actions have been initiated and completed.
    (g) When a determination has been made by the property administrator

[[Page 343]]

that all major system deficiencies identified in the review or appraisal 
have been corrected, the head of the field organization shall withdraw 
the conditional approval or disapproval, and approve the system with the 
concurrence of the OPMO. The approval shall be in writing and addressed 
to appropriate contractor management.
    (h) The property administrator shall maintain a copy of all 
designated contractor personal property management system appraisals and 
approvals in such manner as to be readily available to investigative and 
external review teams.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5205  Personal property management system changes.

    Any proposed significant change to a designated contractor's 
approved personal property management system shall be reviewed by the 
property administrator at the earliest possible time. Such changes 
should then be approved in writing on an interim basis, or disapproved 
in writing, by the property administrator as appropriate.


<R04>
       Subpart 109-1.53--Management of High Risk Personal Property


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5300  Scope of subpart.

    (a) This subpart provides identification, accounting, control, and 
disposal policy guidance for the following categories of high risk 
personal property: especially designed or prepared property, export 
controlled property, nuclear weapon components or weapon-like 
components, and proliferation sensitive property. The guidance is 
intended to ensure that the disposition of these categories of high risk 
personal property does not adversely affect the national security or 
nuclear nonproliferation objectives of the United States.
    (b) The other categories of high risk personal property are 
controlled by other life cycle management programs and procedures 
monitored by other Departmental elements.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5301  Applicability.

    This subpart is applicable to all DOE organizations which purchase, 
manage or dispose of Government personal property, or contract for the 
management of Government facilities, programs, or related services, 
which may directly or indirectly require the purchase, management, or 
disposal of Government-owned personal property. Using the high risk 
personal property control requirements in this subpart as guidance, 
heads of field organizations or OPMOs shall assure that designated 
contractors and financial assistance recipients are responsible for 
developing a cost effective high risk property management system, 
covering all operational responsibilities enumerated in this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5302  Policies.

    (a) It is the responsibility of DOE organizations and designated 
contractors to manage and control Government-owned high risk personal 
property in an efficient manner. High risk personal property will be 
managed throughout its life cycle so as to protect public and DOE 
personnel safety and to advance the national security and the nuclear 
nonproliferation objectives of the U.S. Government.
    (b) The disposition of high risk property is subject to special 
considerations. Items of high risk property may present significant 
risks to the national security and nuclear nonproliferation objectives 
of the Government which must be evaluated. Organizations will identify 
high risk property and control its disposition to eliminate or mitigate 
such risks. In no case shall property be transferred or disposed unless 
it receives a high risk assessment and is handled accordingly.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5303  Procedures.

    (a) Identification, marking and control. To ensure the appropriate 
treatment of property at its disposal and to prevent inadvertent, 
uncontrolled release of high risk property, property should be assessed 
and evaluated as high risk property as early in its life cycle as 
practical.
    (1) Newly acquired high risk personal property shall be identified 
and tracked during the acquisition process and marked upon receipt.
    (2) All personal property shall be reviewed for high risk 
identification, marking, and database entry during

[[Page 344]]

regularly scheduled physical inventories, unless access to the property 
is difficult or impractical because the property is a component of a 
larger assembly, a complex operating system, or an older facility. The 
review of this property will be completed, prior to disposition, when 
replacing components or when operating systems and facilities are 
decommissioned and dismantling.
    (3) High risk personal property which by its nature cannot be 
marked, such as stores items and metal stock, is exempt from this 
requirement. However, personal property management programs should 
contain documentation on the characterization of this property as high 
risk.
    (b) Disposition of high risk property. (1) Prior to disposition, all 
personal property, materials or data will be assessed to determine:
    (i) Whether it should be characterized as high risk and
    (ii) What actions are necessary to ensure compliance with applicable 
national security or nonproliferation controls.
    (2) The DOE or designated contractor property management 
organization may not process high risk personal property into a 
reutilization/disposal program without performing the reviews prescribed 
by the local high risk property management system. The reviews must be 
properly documented, and all appropriate certifications and clearances 
received, in accordance with the approved site or facility personal 
property management program.
    (3) The disposition (including demilitarization of items on the 
Munitions List) and handling of high risk personal property are subject 
to applicable provisions of Subchapter H of the FPMR, subchapter H of 
this chapter, and the DOE Guidelines on Export Control and 
Nonproliferation.
    (4) Documentation. All applicable documentation, including records 
concerning the property's categorization as high risk, shall be included 
as part of the property transfer. The documentation shall be included 
with all transfers within, or external to, DOE.
    (5) Unless an alternative disposition option appears to be in the 
best interest of the Government, surplus Trigger List components, 
equipment, and materials and nuclear weapon components shall either be 
sold for scrap after being rendered useless for their originally 
intended purpose or destroyed, with the destruction verified and 
documented. Requests for approval of an alternative disposition may be 
made through the cognizant Assistant Secretary to the Director of the 
Office of Nonproliferation and National Security.
    (6) Export Restriction Notice. The following Export Restriction 
Notice, or approved equivalent notice, shall be included in all 
transfers, sales, or other offerings:

                        Export Restriction Notice

    The use, disposition, export and reexport of this property are 
subject to all applicable U.S. laws and regulations, including the 
Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended; the Arms Export Control Act (22 
U.S.C. 2751 et seq.); the Export Administration Act of 1979 (560 U.S.C. 
Append 2401 et seq.); Assistance to Foreign Atomic Energy Activities (10 
CFR part 810); Export and Import of Nuclear Equipment and Material (10 
CFR part 110); International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR parts 
120 et seq.); Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR part 730 et 
seq.); Foreign Assets Control Regulations (31 CFR parts 500 et seq.); 
and the Espionage Act (37 U.S.C. 791 et seq.) which among other things, 
prohibit:
    a. The making of false statements and concealment of any material 
information regarding the use or disposition, export or reexport of the 
property; and
    b. Any use or disposition, export or reexport of the property which 
is not authorized in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 109-1.5304  Deviations.

    (a) Life cycle control determinations. When the HFO approves a 
contractor program containing controls, other than life cycle control 
consistent with this subpart, the decision shall be justified in writing 
and a copy sent to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Procurement and 
Assistance Management. A HFO's decision not to provide life-cycle 
control should take into account:
    (1) The nature and extent of high risk property typically purchased 
or otherwise brought to a DOE or designated contractor facility or site;

[[Page 345]]

    (2) The projected stability of DOE and designated contractor 
operations; and
    (3) The degree of confidence in the property control measures 
available at disposition.
    (b) Certain transfers, sales, or other offerings of high risk 
personal property may require special conditions or specific 
restrictions as determined necessary by the property custodian or 
cognizant program office.
    (c) Requests for deviations from the requirements of this subpart 
may be made through the cognizant HFO to the Deputy Assistant Secretary 
for Procurement and Assistance Management.

<R05>
Sec. 109-6.402  Policy.

    (a) It is DOE policy that Government motor vehicles operated by DOE 
employees are to be used only for official Government purposes or for 
incidental

[[Page 346]]

purposes as prescribed in this section. Official use does not include 
use of vehicles between residence and place of employment unless 
provided for in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. The 
Director, Office of Administrative Services and heads of field 
organizations for their respective organizations shall establish 
appropriate controls to ensure that the use of a Government motor 
vehicle for transportation between an employee's residence and place of 
employment is in accordance with the provisions of 41 CFR 101-6.4 and 
this subpart.
    (b) The use of Government motor vehicles between an employee's 
residence and place of employment (home-to-work) is limited to:

6.402(f).
    (d) A Departmental official who is authorized home-to-work 
transportation is permitted to use Government-owned or leased motor 
vehicles for non-official purposes incidental to the official use of the 
vehicle, provided that the incremental cost (e.g., driver time and 
mileage) of such use is de minimis or such costs are outweighed by other 
considerations, such as the efficient use of the official's time.


<R05>
Sec. 109-6.450  Statutory provisions.

    (a) In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 1349(b), any officer or employee of

Sec. 109-26.501  Purchase of new motor vehicles.


<R05>
Sec. 109-26.501-1  General.

    (a) [Reserved]
    (b) Motor vehicles may be purchased directly rather than through GSA 
when a waiver has been granted by GSA. The waiver request should be 
submitted directly to GSA and a copy forwarded to the DPMO. However, 
where GSA refuses to grant a waiver and it is believed that procurement 
through GSA would adversely affect or otherwise impair a program, the 
DPMO may, upon written request of the head of the DOE field 
organization, grant the authority for direct purchase of general purpose 
motor vehicles. Upon receipt of written authorization from the DPMO, the 
head of the field organization may authorize direct purchase of special 
purpose vehicles. The purchase price for passenger motor vehicles shall 
not exceed any statutory limitation in effect at the time the purchase 
is made.


<R05>
Sec. 109-26.501-4  Submission of orders.

    An original and two copies of requisitions for passenger motor 
vehicles and law enforcement motor vehicles shall be forwarded with 
justification for purchase to the DPMO, for approval and submission to 
GSA. Requisitions for all other types of motor vehicles shall be 
submitted directly to GSA.


<R05>
Sec. 109-26.501-50  Authority and allocations for the acquisition of passenger motor vehicles.

    (a) Authority for the acquisition of passenger motor vehicles is 
contained in the Department's annual appropriation act.
    (b) DOE offices shall include in their budget submissions the number 
of passenger motor vehicles to be purchased during the fiscal year. The 
procurements will be identified as either additions to the motor vehicle 
fleet or replacement vehicles. A copy of the motor vehicle portion of 
the submission should be submitted to the DPMO.
    (c) To assure that DOE does not exceed the number of passenger motor 
vehicles authorized to be acquired in any fiscal year, the Deputy 
Assistant Secretary for Procurement and Assistance Management or 
designee shall allocate to and inform the field organizations in writing 
of the number of passenger motor vehicles which may be acquired under 
each appropriation. These allocations and the statutory cost limitations 
imposed on these motor vehicles shall not be exceeded.
    (d) The motor vehicle fleet manager shall provide written 
certification to the OPMO that disposition action has been taken on 
replaced passenger motor vehicles. Such certification shall be provided 
no later than 30 days after the disposition of the vehicle. Replaced 
passenger motor vehicles shall not be retained in service after receipt 
of the replacement vehicle.


<R05>
Sec. 109-26.501-51  Used vehicles.

    Normally, DOE does not purchase or authorize contractors to purchase 
used motor vehicles. However, the Director, Office of Administrative 
Services and heads of field organizations may authorize the purchase of 
used motor vehicles where justified by special circumstances, e.g., when 
new motor vehicles are in short supply; motor vehicles are to be used

<R05>
Sec. 109-27.000-50  Definitions.

    As used in this part the following definitions apply:
    Inventories mean stocks of stores, construction, supplies, and parts 
used in support of DOE programs.
    Inventory management means the efficient use of methods, procedures 
and techniques for recording, analyzing, and adjusting inventories in 
accordance with established policy. The following related functions are 
included:
    (1) Providing adequate protection against misuse, theft, and 
misappropriation.
    (2) Providing accurate analyses of quantities to determine 
requirements so that only minimal obsolescence losses will be 
encountered, while ensuring adequate inventory levels to meet program 
schedules.
    (3) Providing adequate and accessible storage facilities and 
services based upon analyses of program requirements so that a minimum 
and economical amount of time is required to service the program.
    Stock record means a device for collecting, storing, and providing 
historical data on recurring transactions for each line item of 
inventory.
    Sub-store means a geographically removed part of the main store's 
operation conducted as a subordinate element of it and subject to the 
same management policies and inventory controls.
    Systems contracting means a materials management purchasing 
technique for the purchase of general, common-use, and repetitive supply 
items in a particular product family. An example is office supplies, 
purchased from a commercial vendor, that are needed for immediate use 
instead of purchasing in bulk for future use, storing in warehouses, and 
issuing to customers by use of a requisitioning system. Systems 
contracting and just-in-time contracting are synonymous.


<R04>
                  Subpart 109-27.1--Stock Replenishment


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.102   Economic order quantity principle.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.102-1   Applicability.

    Replenishment of inventories of stock items having recurring demands 
will be by use of the economic order quantity (EOQ) principle. However, 
when considered more suitable, designated contractors may use other 
generally accepted approaches to EOQ.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.102-50   Systems contracting.

    Systems contracting may be used instead of or along with EOQ once a 
determination is made that such a system is feasible and cost effective, 
and that adequate controls are in place to ensure proper use.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.102-51   Policy.

    Systems contracting for supply operations is a proven cost-effective 
approach to meeting procurement needs and may be implemented in DOE 
offices and designated contractors wherever significant cost savings to 
the Government will result. Impacts on local suppliers and small and 
disadvantaged business concerns should be considered in the overall 
business strategy.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.102-52   Implementation.

    (a) DOE OPMOs shall establish required property management controls 
relative to the implementation of systems contracting.
    (b) DOE offices and designated contractors operating a materials 
management function who have not performed an initial feasibility study 
for the implementation of systems contracting shall perform such a study 
for selected

[[Page 352]]

commodity groups. The study may be accomplished over a period of time, 
until all commodity groups have been considered. The study should 
address functional requirements, activity levels of commodity groups and 
individual items, and potential impacts on local suppliers and small and 
disadvantaged businesses. An industrial relations analysis on existing 
labor relations and union contracts may also be necessary.
    (c) As required in the DEAR, DOE offices and designated contractors 
are required to consider the use of GSA supply sources when economically 
advantageous to the Government. These sources must be considered in the 
conduct of the feasibility study.
    (d) DOE contracting offices shall evaluate the initial cost benefit 
studies performed by contractors to verify the savings and other 
benefits of systems contracting, and shall approve its implementation. 
In those instances where a cost benefit study has previously been 
performed, the DOE contracting office shall ensure that those studies 
have been evaluated and the approval to proceed with systems contracting 
has been provided to the contractor in writing.
    (e) DOE offices shall periodically reevaluate systems contracting 
operations conducted by their office and designated contractors to 
ensure that required property management controls are being followed.


<R04>
          Subpart 109-27.2--Management of Shelf-Life Materials


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.202   Applicability.

    When considered more suitable, designated contractors may use other 
generally accepted approaches to the management of shelf-life materials.


<R04>
             Subpart 109-27.3--Maximizing Use of Inventories


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.302   Applicability.

    When considered more suitable, designated contractors may use other 
generally accepted approaches to maximizing use of inventories.


<R04>
          Subpart 109-27.4--Elimination of Items From Inventory


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.402  Applicability

    When considered more suitable, designated contractors may use other 
generally accepted approaches to determine which items should be 
eliminated from inventory.


<R04>
   Subpart 109-27.50--Inventory Management Policies, Procedures, and 
                               Guidelines


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5001  Objectives.

    Necessary inventories shall be established and maintained at 
reasonable levels, consistent with DOE requirements, applicable laws and 
regulations, and the following objectives:
    (a) The maintenance of adequate stock levels through accurate 
analyses of quantities to determine requirements and stock 
replenishments so that only minimal obsolescence losses will be 
encountered while ensuring adequate inventory levels to meet program 
schedules;
    (b) The protection of materials against misuse, theft, and 
misappropriation;
    (c) The maintenance of an efficient operation; and
    (d) The standardization of inventories to the greatest extent 
practicable.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5002  Stores inventory turnover ratio.

    Comparison of investment in stores inventories to annual issues 
shall be made to assure that minimum inventories are maintained for the 
support of programs. This comparison may be expressed either as a 
turnover ratio (dollar value of issues divided by dollar value of 
inventory) or in the average number of month's supply on hand. Turnover 
or number of month's supply is calculated only on current-use inventory. 
Performance goals, i.e., a six months investment or a turnover ratio of 
2.0, shall be established for each stores using activity. It is 
recognized, however, that extenuating operating circumstances may 
preclude the achievement of such objectives.

[[Page 353]]


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5003  Stock control.

    (a) Stock control shall be maintained on the basis of stock record 
accounts of inventories on hand, on order, received, issued, and 
disposed of, and supported by proper documents in evidence of these 
transactions. Stock record accounts shall be available for review and 
inspection.
    (b) Personal property under stock control for greater than 90 days 
shall be maintained in stock record accounts.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5004  Sub-stores.

    (a) Sub-stores shall be established when necessary to expedite 
delivery of materials and supplies to the users, serve emergencies, 
provide economy in transportation, reduce shop and site stocks, and 
enable stores personnel to provide assistance in obtaining materials and 
supplies as needed.
    (b) Items stored for issue in the sub-stores shall be treated as 
inventory items for control and reporting purposes. Stock records shall 
be integrated with central stock records so that the total amount on 
hand of any item at all locations is known.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5005  Shop, bench, cupboard or site stock.

    Shop, bench, cupboard or site stocks are an accumulation of small 
inventories of fast-moving materials at the point of use. Normally, 
these inventories are expensed at time of issue from controlled stores. 
However, when stocks of such inventories are not consumed or do not turn 
over in a reasonable period of time, which normally should not exceed 90 
days, these items should be subject to the required physical controls 
and recorded in the proper inventory account.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5006  Stores catalogs.

    A stores catalog for customer use that lists items available from 
stock shall be established for each stores operation. Exceptions to this 
requirement are authorized where establishment of a catalog is 
impracticable or uneconomical because of small total value or number of 
items involved, or temporary need for the facility.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5007  Physical inventories.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5007-1  Procedures.

    The following procedures shall be established for taking physical 
inventory of stocks subjected to quantity controls as well as those 
under financial control:
    (a) Completion of a physical inventory not less frequently than 
every twelve months.
    (b) Reconciliation of inventory quantities with the stock records.
    (c) Preparation of a report of the physical inventory results.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5007-2  Inventory adjustments.

    Discrepancies between physical inventories and stock records shall 
be adjusted and the supporting adjustment records shall be reviewed and 
approved by a responsible official at least one supervisory level above 
the supervisor in charge of the warehouse or storage facility. Items on 
an adjustment report which are not within reasonable tolerances for 
particular items shall be thoroughly investigated before report 
approval. Adjustment reports shall be retained on file for inspection 
and review.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5008  Control of drug substances and potable alcohol.

    Effective procedures and practices shall provide for the management 
and physical security of controlled substances and potable alcohol from 
receipt to the point of use. Such procedures shall, as a minimum, 
provide for safeguarding, proper use, adequate records, and compliance 
with applicable laws and regulations. Controls and records of potable 
alcohol shall be maintained on quantities of one quart and above.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5009  Control of hypodermic needles and syringes.

    Effective procedures and practices shall provide for the management 
and physical security of hypodermic needles and syringes to prevent 
illegal use. Controls shall include supervisory approval for issue, 
storage in locked repositories, and the rendering of the items useless 
prior to disposal.

Sec. 109-27.5010  Containers returnable to vendors.

    Containers furnished by vendors shall be administratively and 
physically controlled before and after issuance. Prompt action shall be 
taken to return such containers to vendors for credit after they have 
served their intended use.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5011  Identification marking of metals and metal products.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5011-1  General.

    Metals and metal products shall be identified and marked in 
accordance with applicable Federal standards. This requirement applies 
to direct charges as well as to items procured for store, shop or floor 
stock, or for use on construction projects. Additional markings not 
covered by Federal standards should be used to show special properties, 
corrosion data, or test data as required. The preferred process is for 
the marking to be done in the manufacturing process, but it may be 
applied by suppliers when circumstances warrant.


<R05>
Sec. 109-27.5011-2  Exception.

    Exceptions to the marking requirement may be made when:
    (a) It is necessary to procure small quantities from suppliers not 
equipped to do the marking;
    (b) It would delay delivery of emergency orders; or
    (c) Procurement is from DOE or other Federal agency excess.

   Subpart 109-28.50--Management of Equipment Held for Future Projects


<R05>
Sec. 109-28.5000  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart provides policies, principles, and guidelines to be 
used in the management of equipment held for future projects (EHFFP).


<R05>
Sec. 109-28.5001  Definition.

    Equipment held for future projects means items being retained, based 
on approved justifications, for a known future use, or for a potential 
use in planned projects.


<R05>
Sec. 109-28.5002  Objective.

    The objective of the EHFFP program is to enable DOE offices and 
contractors to retain equipment not in use in current programs but which 
has a known or potential use in future DOE programs, while providing 
visibility on the types and amounts of equipment so retained through 
review and reporting procedures. It is intended that equipment be 
retained where economically justifiable for retention, considering cost 
of maintenance, replacement, obsolescence, storage, deterioration, or 
future availability; made available for use by others; and promptly 
excessed when no longer needed.


<R05>
Sec. 109-28.5003  Records.

    Records of all EHFFP shall be maintained by the holding 
organization, including a listing of items with original date of 
classification as EHFFP; initial justifications for retaining EHFFP; 
rejustifications for retention; and documentation of reviews made by 
higher levels of management.


<R05>
Sec. 109-28.5004  Justification and review procedures.

    Procedures shall provide for the following:
    (a) The original decision to classify and retain equipment as EHFFP 
shall be justified in writing, providing sufficient detail to support 
the need for retention of the equipment. This justification will cite 
the project for which retained, the potential use to be made of the 
equipment, or other reasons for retention.
    (b) The validity of the initial classification EHFFP shall be 
reviewed by management at a level above that of the individual making 
the initial determination.
    (c) Retention of equipment as EHFFP must be rejustified annually to 
ensure that original justifications remain valid. The rejustifications 
will contain sufficient detail to support retention.
    (d) When equipment is retained as EHFFP for longer than one year, 
the annual rejustification shall be reviewed at a level of management at 
least two levels above that of the individual making the determination 
to retain the EHFFP. Equipment retained as EHFFP for longer than three 
years should be approved by the head of the DOE field organization.


<R05>
Sec. 109-28.5005  EHFFP program review.

    OPMOs or on-site DOE property administrators shall conduct periodic 
reviews to ensure that the EHFFP program is being conducted in 
accordance with established procedures and this subpart. Included in the 
review will be proper determinations of property as EHFFP, the validity 
of justifications for retaining EHFFP, and the inclusion of EHFFP in 
management walk-throughs as prescribed in Sec. 109-25.109-1 of this 
chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 109-28.5006  Utilization.

    It is DOE policy that, where practicable and consistent with program 
needs, EHFFP be considered as a source of supply to avoid or postpone 
acquisition.


<R04>
            Subpart 109-28.51--Management of Spare Equipment


<R05>
Sec. 109-28.5100  Scope of subpart.

in current use in DOE programs.

[[Page 359]]


<R05>
Sec. 109-28.5102  Exclusions.

    The following categories of equipment will not be considered spare 
equipment:
    (a) Equipment installed for emergency backup, e.g., an emergency 
power facility, or an electric motor or a pump, any of which is in place 
and electrically connected.
    (b) Equipment items properly classified as stores inventory.


<R05>
Sec. 109-28.5103  Management policy.

    (a) Procedures shall require the maintenance of records for spare 
equipment, cross-referenced to the location in the facility and the 
engineering drawing number. The purpose for retention shall be in the 
records.
    (b) Reviews shall be made based on technical evaluations of the 
continued need for the equipment. The reviews should be held biennially. 
In addition, individual item levels shall be reviewed when spare 
equipment is installed for use, the basic equipment is removed from 
service, or the process supported is changed.
    (c) Procedures shall be established to provide for the 
identification and reporting of unneeded spare equipment as excess 
property.

            Subpart 109-38.51--Utilization of Motor Equipment


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5100  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes policies and procedures concerning the 
utilization of motor equipment.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5101  Policy.

    It is DOE policy to keep the number of motor vehicles and other 
motor equipment at the minimum needed to satisfy programmatic 
requirements. To attain this goal, controls and practices shall be 
established which will achieve the most practical and economical 
utilization of motor equipment. These controls and practices apply to 
all DOE-owned and commercially leased motor equipment and to GSA 
Interagency Fleet Management System motor vehicles.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5102  Utilization controls and practices.

    Controls and practices to be used by DOE organizations and 
designated contractors for achieving maximum economical utilization of 
motor equipment shall include, but not be limited to:
    (a) The maximum use of motor equipment pools, taxicabs, shuttle 
buses, or other common service arrangements;
    (b) The minimum, practicable assignment of motor equipment to 
individuals, groups, or specific organizational components;
    (c) The maintenance of individual motor equipment use records, such 
as trip tickets or vehicle logs, or hours of use, as appropriate, 
showing sufficiently detailed information to evaluate appropriateness of 
assignment and adequacy of use being made. If one-time use of a motor 
vehicle is involved, such as assignments from motor pools, the 
individual's trip records must, as a minimum, identify the motor vehicle 
and show the name of the operator, dates, destination, time of departure 
and return, and mileage;
    (d) The rotation of motor vehicles between high and low mileage 
assignments where practicable to maintain the fleet in the best overall 
replacement age and mileage balance and operating economy;
    (e) The charging, if considered feasible, to the user organization 
for the cost of operating and maintaining motor vehicles assigned to 
groups or organizational components. These charge-back costs should 
include all direct and indirect costs of the motor vehicle fleet 
operation as determined by the field organization and contractor finance 
and accounting functions;
    (f) The use of dual-purpose motor vehicles capable of hauling both 
personnel and light cargo whenever appropriate to avoid the need for two 
motor vehicles when one can serve both purposes. However, truck-type or 
van vehicles shall not be acquired for passenger use merely to avoid 
statutory limitations on the number of passenger motor vehicles which 
may be acquired;
    (g) The use of motor scooters and motorcycles in place of higher 
cost motor vehicles for certain applications within plant areas, such as 
mail and messenger service and small parts and tool delivery. Their 
advantage, however, should be weighed carefully from the standpoint of 
overall economy (comparison with cost for other types of motor vehicles) 
and increased safety hazards, particularly when mingled with other motor 
vehicle traffic; and

[[Page 367]]

    (h) The use of electric vehicles for certain applications. The use 
of these vehicles is encouraged wherever it is feasible to use them to 
further the goal of fuel conservation.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5103  Motor vehicle utilization standards.

    (a) The following average utilization standards are established for 
DOE as objectives for those motor vehicles operated generally for those 
purposes for which acquired:
    (1) Sedans and station wagons, general purpose use--12,000 miles per 
year.
    (2) Light trucks (4 x 2's) and general purpose vehicles, one ton and 
under (less than 12,500 GVWR)--10,000 miles per year.
    (3) Medium trucks and general purpose vehicles, 1\1/2\ ton through 
2\1/2\ ton (12,500 to 23,999 GVWR)--7,500 miles per year.
    (4) Heavy trucks and general purpose vehicles, three ton and over 
(24,000 GVWR and over)--7,500 miles per year.
    (5) Truck tractors--10,000 miles per year.
    (6) All-wheel-drive vehicles--7,500 miles per year.
    (7) Other motor vehicles--No utilization standards are established 
for other trucks, ambulances, buses, law enforcement motor vehicles, and 
special purpose vehicles. The use of these motor vehicles shall be 
reviewed at least annually by the motor equipment fleet manager and 
action shall be taken and documented to verify that the motor vehicles 
are required to meet programmatic, health, safety, or security 
requirements.
    (b) When operating circumstances prevent the above motor vehicle 
utilization standards from being met, local use objectives must be 
established and met as prescribed in Sec. 109-38.5105 of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5104  Other motor equipment utilization standards.

    No utilization standards are established for motor equipment other 
than motor vehicles. Each DOE office should establish through an 
agreement between the fleet manager and the OPMO utilization criteria 
for other motor equipment including heavy mobile equipment and review, 
adjust, and approve such criteria annually. Utilization of various 
classifications of other motor equipment can be measured through various 
statistics including miles, hours of use, number of trips, and fuel 
consumption. A utilization review of other motor equipment shall be 
performed at least annually by the motor equipment fleet manager to 
justify retainment or disposition of excess equipment not needed to 
fulfill Departmental, programmatic, health, safety, or security 
requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5105  Motor vehicle local use objectives.

    (a) Individual motor vehicle utilization cannot always be measured 
or evaluated strictly on the basis of miles operated or against any 
Department-wide mileage standard. For example, light trucks specifically 
fitted for use by a plumber, welder, etc., in the performance of daily 
work assignments, would have uniquely tailored use objectives, different 
from those set forth for a truck used for general purposes. Accordingly, 
efficient local use objectives, which represent practical units of 
measurement for motor vehicle utilization and for planning and 
evaluating future motor vehicle requirements, must be established and 
documented by the Organizational Motor Equipment Fleet Manager. The 
objectives should take into consideration past performance, future 
requirements, geographical disbursement, and special operating 
requirements.
    (b) These objectives shall be reviewed and adjusted as appropriate, 
but not less often than annually, by the motor equipment fleet manager. 
The reviews shall be documented. The Organizational Motor Equipment 
Fleet Manager is responsible for reviewing and approving in writing all 
proposed local use objectives.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5106  Application of motor vehicle use goals.

    (a) At least annually, the motor equipment fleet manager will review 
motor vehicle utilization statistics and all motor vehicles failing to 
meet the applicable DOE utilization standard or local use objective must 
be identified.
    (b) Prompt action must be initiated to:

[[Page 368]]

    (1) Reassign the underutilized motor vehicles;
    (2) Dispose of the underutilized motor vehicles; or
    (3) Obtain a special justification from users documenting their 
continued requirement for the motor vehicle and any proposed actions to 
improve utilization. Any requirement for underutilized motor vehicles 
which the motor equipment fleet manager proposes to continue in its 
assignment, must be submitted in writing to the Organizational Motor 
Equipment Fleet Manager for approval.
    (c) Both Department-wide standards and local use objectives should 
be applied in such a manner that their application does not stimulate 
motor vehicle use for the purpose of meeting the objective. The ultimate 
standard against which motor vehicle use must be measured is that the 
minimum number of motor vehicles will be retained to satisfy program 
requirements.


<R04>
                      Subpart 109-38.52--Watercraft


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5200  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart establishes basic policies and procedures that apply to 
the management of watercraft operated by DOE organizations and 
designated contractors. The head of each Departmental organization 
operating watercraft shall issue such supplemental instructions as may 
be needed to ensure the efficient use and management of watercraft.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5201  Definition.

    As used in this subpart the following definition applies:
    Watercraft means any vessel used to transport persons or material on 
water.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5202  Watercraft operations.

    (a) No person may operate a watercraft on a waterway until skill of 
operation and basic watercraft knowledge have been demonstrated.
    (b) Operators of watercraft shall check the vessel to ensure that 
necessary equipment required by laws applicable to the area of operation 
are present, properly stowed, and in proper working order.
    (c) Operators shall comply with all applicable Federal, state, and 
local laws pertaining to the operation of watercraft.
    (d) Operators shall not use watercraft or carry passengers except in 
the performance of official Departmental assignments.


<R05>
Sec. 109-38.5203  Watercraft identification and numbers.

    Watercraft in the custody of DOE or designated contractors shall 
display identifying numbers, whether issued by the U.S. Coast Guard, 
State, or local field organization, in accordance with applicable 
requirements.

                   Subpart 109-40.1--General Provision


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.000  Scope of part.

    This part describes DOE regulations governing transportation and 
traffic management activities. It also covers arrangements for 
transportation and related services by bill of lading. These regulations 
are designed to ensure that all transportation and traffic management 
activities will be carried out in the manner most advantageous to the 
Government in terms of economy, efficiency, service, environment, safety 
and security.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.000-50  Applicability to contractors.

    DOE-PMR 109-40, Transportation and Traffic Management, should be 
applied to cost-type contractors' transportation and traffic management 
activities. Departure by cost-type contractors from the provisions of 
these regulations may be authorized by the contracting officer provided 
the practices and procedures followed are consistent with the basic 
policy objectives in these regulations and DOE Order 460.2, Departmental 
Materials Transportation and Packaging Management, except to the extent 
such departure is prohibited by statute or executive order.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.102  Representation before regulatory bodies.

    Participation in proceedings related to carrier applications to 
regulatory bodies for temporary or permanent authority to operate in 
specified geographical locations shall be confined to statements or 
testimony in support of a need for service and shall not extend to 
support of individual carriers or groups of carriers.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.103  Selection of carriers.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.103-1  Domestic transportation.

    (a) Preferential treatment, normally, shall not be accorded to any 
mode of transportation (motor, rail, air, water) or to any particular 
carrier when arranging for domestic transportation services. However 
where, for valid reasons, a particular mode of transportation or a 
particular carrier within that mode must be used to meet specific 
program requirements and/or limitations, only that mode or carrier shall 
be considered. Examples of valid reasons for considering only a 
particular mode or carrier are:
    (1) Where only a certain mode of transportation or individual 
carrier is able to provide the needed service or is able to meet the 
required delivery date; and
    (2) Where the consignee's installation and related facilities 
preclude or are not conducive to service by all modes of transportation.
    (b) The following factors are considered in determining whether a 
carrier or mode of transportation can meet DOE's transportation service 
requirements for each individual shipment:
    (1) Availability and suitability of carrier equipment;
    (2) Carrier terminal facilities at origin and destination;
    (3) Pickup and delivery service, if required;
    (4) Availability of required or accessorial and special services, if 
needed;
    (5) Estimated time in transit;
    (6) Record of past performance of the carrier; and
    (7) Availability and suitability of transit privileges.

U.S.C. 1241(b)) concerning the use of privately owned U.S.-flag vessels.
    (b) U.S.-flag certificated air carriers. Arrangements for 
international air transportation services shall be made in accordance 
with the provisions of section 5(a) of the International Air 
Transportation Fair Competition Practices Act of 1974 (49 U.S.C. 1517), 
which requires the use of U.S.-flag certificated air carriers for 
international travel of persons or property to the extent that services 
by these carriers is available.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.105  Use of Government-owned transportation equipment.

    The preferred method of transporting property for the Government is 
through use of the facilities and services of commercial carriers. 
However, Government vehicles may be used when they are available to meet 
emergencies and accomplish program objectives which cannot be attained 
through use of commercial carriers.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.109  Utilization of special contracts and agreements.

    From time to time special transportation agreements are entered into 
on a Government-wide or DOE-wide basis and are applicable, generally, to 
DOE shipments. The HQ DOE Manager, Transportation Operations and 
Traffic, will distribute information on such agreements to field offices 
as it becomes available.


<R05>

                  Subpart 109-40.3--Traffic Management


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.301   Traffic management functions administration.

    The DOE traffic management functions are accomplished by established 
field traffic offices under provisions of appropriate Departmental 
directives and Headquarters' staff traffic management supervision.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.302   Standard routing principle.

    (a) Shipments shall be routed using the mode of transportation, or 
individual carriers within the mode, that can provide the required 
service at the lowest overall delivered cost to the Government.
    (b) When more than one mode of transportation, or more than one 
carrier within a mode, can provide equally satisfactory service at the 
same overall cost the traffic shall be distributed as equitably as 
practicable among the modes and among the carriers within the modes.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.303-3   Most fuel efficient carrier/mode.

    When more than one mode, or more than one carrier within a mode, can 
satisfy the service requirements of a specific shipment at the same 
lowest aggregate delivered cost, the carrier/mode determined to be the 
most fuel efficient will be selected. In determining the most fuel 
efficient carrier/mode, consideration will be given to such factors as 
use of the carrier's equipment in ``turn around'' service, proximity of 
carrier equipment to the shipping activity, and ability of the carrier 
to provide the most direct service to the destination points.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.304   Rate tenders to the Government.

    Under the provisions of section 10721 of the Interstate Commerce Act 
(49 U.S.C. 10721), common carriers are permitted to submit to the 
Government tenders which contain rates lower than published tariff rates 
available to the general public. In addition, rates tenders may be 
applied to shipments other than those made by the Government provided 
the total benefits accrue to the Government; that is, provided the 
Government pays the charges or directly and completely reimburses the 
party that initially bears the freight charges (323 ICC 347 and 332 ICC 
161).


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.305-50   Negotiations involving national security.

    Title 49 U.S.C., section 10721(b)(2) provides that rate tenders to 
the Government must be filed by the carriers within the Interstate 
Commerce Commission unless a carrier is advised by the U.S. Government 
that disclosure of a quotation or tender of a rate established * * * for 
transportation provided to the U.S. Government would endanger the 
National security. Carriers will be informed by the negotiating official 
if any quotation or tender to the Department of Energy involves such 
information.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.306-1   Recommended rate tender format.

    Only those rate tenders which have been submitted by the carriers in 
writing shall be considered for use. Carriers should be encouraged to 
use the format ``Uniform Tender of Rates and/or Charges for 
Transportation Services'' when preparing and submitting rate tenders to 
the Government. Rate tenders that are ambiguous in meaning shall be 
resolved in favor of the Government.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.306-2   Required shipping documents and annotations.

    (a) To qualify for transportation under section 10721 rates, 
property must be shipped by or for the Government on:
    (1) Government bills of lading;
    (2) Commercial bills of lading endorsed to show that these bills of 
lading are to be converted to Government bills of lading after delivery 
to the consignee;
    (3) Commercial bills of lading showing that the Government is either 
the consignor or the consignee and endorsed with the following 
statement:

    Transportation hereunder is for the U.S. Department of Energy, and 
the actual total transportation charges paid to the carrier(s) by the 
consignor or consignee are assignable to, and are to be reimbursed by, 
the Government.


[[Page 373]]


    (b) When a rate tender is used for transportation furnished under a 
cost-reimbursable contract, the following endorsement shall be used on 
covering commercial bills of lading:

    Transportation hereunder is for the U.S. Department of Energy, and 
the actual total transportation charges paid to the carrier(s) by the 
consignor or consignee are to be reimbursed by the Government, pursuant 
to cost-reimbursable contract number (insert contract number). This may 
be confirmed by contacting the agency representative at (name and 
telephone number).
    See 332 ICC 161.

    (c) To ensure proper application of a Government rate tender on all 
shipments qualifying for their use, the issuing officer shall show on 
the bills of lading covering such shipments the applicable rate tender 
number and carrier identification, such as: ``Section 10721 tender, ABC 
Transportation Company, ICC No. 374.'' In addition, if commercial bills 
of lading are used, they shall be endorsed as specified above.


<R05>
Sec. 109-40.306-3   Distribution.

    Each agency receiving rate tenders shall promptly submit one signed 
copy to the Transportation and Public Utilities Service (WIT), General 
Services Administration, Washington, DC 20407. Also, two copies 
(including at least one signed copy) shall be promptly submitted to the 
General Services Administration (TA), Chester A. Arthur Building,

                         Categories of Property


<R05>
Sec. 109-42.1100.50   Scope of subpart.

    This subpart sets forth policies and procedures for the utilization 
and disposal outside of DOE of excess and surplus personal property 
which has been radioactively or chemically contaminated.


<R05>
Sec. 109-42.1100.51   Policy.

    When the holding organization determines it is appropriate to 
dispose of contaminated personal property, it shall be disposed of by 
DOE in accordance with appropriate Federal regulations governing 
radiation/chemical exposure and environmental contamination. In special 
cases where Federal regulations do not exist or apply, appropriate state 
and local regulations shall be followed.


<R05>
Sec. 109-42.1102-8   United States Munitions List items which require demilitarization.

    Heads of field organizations shall determine demilitarization 
requirements regarding combat material and military personal property 
using DoD 4160.21-M-1, Defense Demilitarization Manual as a guide.


<R05>
Sec. 109-42.1102-51   Suspect personal property.

    (a) Excess personal property (including scrap) having a history of 
use in an area where radioactive or chemical contamination may occur 
shall be considered suspect and shall be monitored using appropriate 
instruments and techniques by qualified personnel of the DOE office or 
contractor generating the excess.
    (b) With due consideration to the economic factors involved, every 
effort shall be made to reduce the level of contamination of excess or 
surplus personal property to the lowest practicable level. Contaminated 
personal property that exceeds applicable contamination standards shall 
not be utilized or disposed outside DOE.
    (c) If contamination is suspected and the property is of such size, 
construction, or location as to make testing for contamination 
impossible, the property shall not be utilized or disposed outside of 
DOE.


<R05>
Sec. 109-42.1102-52  Low level contaminated personal property.

    If monitoring of suspect personal property indicates that 
contamination does not exceed applicable standards, it may be utilized 
and disposed of in the same manner as uncontaminated personal property, 
provided the guidance in Sec. 109-45.5005-1(a) of this chapter has been 
considered. However, recipients shall be advised where levels of 
radioactive contamination require specific controls for shipment as 
provided in Department of Transportation Regulations (49 CFR parts 171-
179) for shipment of radioactive personal property. In addition, when 
any contaminated personal property is screened within DOE, reported to 
GSA, or otherwise disposed of, the kind and degree of contamination must 
be plainly indicated on all pertinent documents.

Sec. 109-45.304-2.50  Negotiated sales and negotiated sales at fixed prices by designated contractors.

    (a) Negotiated sales by designated contractors of surplus contractor 
inventory may be made when the DOE contracting officer determines and 
documents prior to the sale that the use of this method of sale is 
justified on the basis of the circumstances enumerated below, provided 
that the Government's interests are adequately protected. These sales 
shall be at prices which are fair and reasonable and not less than the 
proceeds which could reasonably be expected to be obtained if the 
personal property was offered for competitive sale. Specific conditions 
justifying negotiated sales include:
    (1) No acceptable bids have been received as a result of competitive 
bidding under a suitable advertised sale;
    (2) Personal property is of such small value that the proceeds to be 
derived would not warrant the expense of a formal competitive sale;
    (3) The disposal will be to a state, territory, possession, 
political subdivision thereof, or tax-supported agency therein, and the 
estimated fair market value of the personal property and other 
satisfactory terms of disposal are obtained by negotiation;
    (4) The specialized nature and limited use potential of the personal 
property would create negligible bidder interest;
    (5) Removal of the personal property would result in a significant 
reduction in value, or the accrual of disproportionate expense in 
handling; or
    (6) It can be clearly established that such action is in the best 
interests of the Government.
    (b) When determined to be in the best interests of the Government, 
heads of field organizations may authorize fixed-price sales of surplus 
contractor inventory by designated contractors provided:
    (1) The fair market value of the item to be sold does not exceed 
$15,000;
    (2) Adequate procedures for publicizing such sales have been 
established;
    (3) The sales prices are not less than could reasonably be expected 
if competitive bid sales methods were employed and the prices have been 
approved by a reviewing authority designated by the head of the field 
organization; and
    (4) The warranty prescribed in Sec. 109-45.302-50(a) of this subpart 
is obtained when sales are made to employees.

    (g) When appropriate, full and adequate justification for not 
advertising the sale when the fair market value of property sold in this 
manner in any one case exceeds $1,000.
    (h) A justification concerning any award made to other than the high

<R05>
Sec. 109-45.5100  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart sets forth policies and procedures governing the 
disposal of DOE-owned foreign excess and surplus personal property.


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.5101  Authority.

    The policies and procedures contained in this subpart are issued 
pursuant to the provisions of 40 USC 471, Federal Property and 
Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended. Title IV of the Act 
entitled ``Foreign Excess Property'' provides that, except where 
commitments exist under previous agreements, all excess personal 
property located in foreign areas shall be disposed of by the owning 
agency, and directs that the head of the agency conform to the foreign 
policy of the United States in making such disposals.


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.5102  General.

    Disposal of Government-owned personal property in the custody of DOE 
organizations or its contractors in foreign areas shall be made in an 
efficient and economical manner, and in conformance with the foreign 
policy of the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.5103  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, the following definitions apply:
    Foreign means outside the United States, Puerto Rico, American 
Samoa, Guam, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and the Virgin 
Islands.
    Foreign service post means the local diplomatic or consular post in 
the area where the excess personal property is located.


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.5104  Disposal.


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.5104-1  General.

    Foreign excess personal property which is not required for transfer 
within DOE or to other U.S. Government agencies, except for the personal 
property identified in Sec. 109-45.5005-1(a) of this part, shall be 
considered surplus and may be disposed of by transfer, sale, exchange, 
or lease, for cash, credit, or other property and upon such other terms 
and conditions as may be deemed proper. Such personal property may also 
be donated, abandoned, or destroyed under the conditions specified in 
Sec. 109-45.5105-2(c) of this subpart. Most foreign governments have 
indicated to the U.S. State Department that they wish to be consulted 
before U.S. Government property is disposed of in their countries 
(except in the case of transfers to other U.S. Government agencies). 
Matters concerning customs duties and taxes, or similar charges, may 
require prior agreement with the foreign government involved. The State 
Department shall be contacted in regard to these issues. Whenever advice 
or approval of the State Department is required by this subpart, it may 
be obtained either through the foreign service post in the foreign area 
involved or from the State Department in Washington, DC. If the issue is 
to be presented to the State Department in Washington, DC, it shall be 
referred through appropriate administrative channels to the Deputy 
Assistant Secretary for Procurement and Assistance Management for 
review, coordination, and handling.

<R05>
Sec. 109-45.5104-2  Methods of disposal.

    (a) Sales of foreign surplus personal property shall be conducted in 
accordance with the following guidelines:
    (1) Generally, all sales of foreign surplus personal property shall 
be conducted under the competitive bid process unless it is advantageous 
and more practicable to the Government not to do so. When competitive 
bids are not solicited, reasonable inquiry of prospective purchasers 
shall be made in order that sales may be made on terms most advantageous 
to the U.S. Government.
    (2) In no event shall any personal property be sold in foreign areas 
without a condition which states that its importation into the United 
States is forbidden unless the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture (in the 
case of any agricultural commodity, food, cotton, or woolen goods), or 
the U.S. Secretary of Commerce (in the case of any other property), has 
determined that the importation of such property would relieve domestic 
shortages or otherwise be beneficial to the economy of the United 
States.
    (3) Sales documents shall provide that the purchaser must pay any 
import duties or taxes levied against personal property sold in the 
country involved and further provide that the amount of this duty or tax 
shall not be included as a part of the price paid the U.S. Government 
for the personal property. In the event the levy is placed upon the 
seller by law, the buyer will be required to pay all such duties or 
taxes and furnish the seller copies of his receipts prior to the release 
of the personal property to him. However, if the foreign government 
involved will not accept payment from the buyer, the seller will collect 
the duties or taxes and turn the amounts collected over to the foreign 
government. Accounting for the amounts collected shall be coordinated 
with the disbursing officer of the nearest United States foreign service 
post. The property shall not be released to the purchaser until the 
disposal officer is satisfied that there is no responsibility for 
payment by the United States (as contrasted to collection by the United 
States) of taxes, duties, excises, etc.
    (4) Certain categories of personal property, including small arms 
and machine guns; artillery and projectiles; ammunition, bombs, 
torpedoes, rockets and guided missiles; fire control equipment and range 
finders; tanks and ordnance vehicles; chemical and biological agents, 
propellants and explosives; vessels of war and special naval equipment; 
aircraft and all components, parts and accessories for aircraft; 
military electronic equipment; aerial cameras, military photo-
interpretation, stereoscopic plotting and photogrammetry equipment; and 
all material not enumerated which is included in the United States 
Munitions List, 22 CFR 121.01, and is subject to disposal restrictions. 
Advance approval must be obtained from the State Department for the sale 
of all such articles. Therefore, prior to the sale of any of the 
articles enumerated in the U.S. Munitions List, the foreign service post 
in the area shall be consulted.
    (5) Prior to the sale of personal property which has a total 
acquisition cost of $250,000 or more, plans for such sale shall be 
reported to the DPMO with ample time to allow consideration of possible 
foreign policy issues and advice thereon from the State Department (see 
section 109-45.5106(a) of this subpart). All proposed sales, regardless 
of the total acquisition cost of the personal property involved, which 
the head of the DOE foreign office believes might have a significant 
economic or political impact in a particular area, shall be discussed 
with the foreign service post.
    (b) While there is authority for exchange or lease of foreign 
surplus personal property, such authority shall be exercised only when 
such action is clearly in the best interests of the U.S. Government. 
Disposals by exchange are subject to the same requirements as disposals 
by sale under Sec. 109-45.5105-2(a) of this subpart.
    (c)(1) Foreign excess or surplus personal property (including 
salvage and scrap) may be donated, abandoned, or destroyed provided:
    (i) The property has no commercial value or the estimated cost of 
its care and handling would exceed the estimated proceeds from its sale; 
and

[[Page 387]]

    (ii) A written finding to that effect is made and approved by the 
Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Energy Policy, Trade and 
Investment.
    (2) No personal property shall be abandoned or destroyed if donation 
is feasible. Donations under these conditions may be made to any agency 
of the U.S. Government, or to educational, public health, or charitable 
nonprofit organizations.
    (3) Foreign excess personal property may also be abandoned or 
destroyed when such action is required by military necessity, safety, or 
considerations of health or security. A written statement explaining the 
basis for disposal by these means and approval by the Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for International Energy Policy, Trade and Investment is 
required.
    (4) Property shall not be abandoned or destroyed in a manner which 
is detrimental or dangerous to public health and safety, or which will 
cause infringement on the rights of other persons.


<R05>
Sec. 109-45.5105  Reports.

    (a) Proposed sales of foreign surplus personal property having an 
acquisition cost of $250,000 or more shall be reported to the DPMO and 
should include all pertinent data, including the following:
    (1) The description of personal property to be sold, including:
    (i) Identification of personal property (description should be in 
terms understandable to persons not expert in technical nomenclature). 
Personal property covered by the U.S. Munitions List and regulations 
pertaining thereto (as published in 22 CFR 121.01) should be clearly 
identified;
    (ii) Quantity;
    (iii) Condition; and
    (iv) Acquisition cost.
    (2) The proposed method of sale (e.g., sealed bid, negotiated sale, 
etc.)
    (3) Any currency to be received and payment provisions (i.e., U.S. 
dollars, foreign currency, or credit, including terms of the proposed 
sale).
    (4) Any restrictions on use of personal property to be sold (such as 
resale of property, disposal as scrap, demilitarization, etc.).
    (5) Any special terms or conditions of sale.
    (6) The categories of prospective purchasers (e.g., host country, 
other foreign countries, special qualifications, etc.).
    (7) How taxes, excises, duties, etc., will be handled.
    (b) Instructions for reporting foreign excess utilization and 
disposal transactions are contained in Chapter III of DOE Order 534.1, 
Accounting.

<R04>
 Subpart 109-50.4--Programmatic Disposal to Contractors of DOE Property 
                           in a Mixed Facility


<R05>
Sec. 109-50.400  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart contains policy to be followed when it is proposed to 
sell or otherwise transfer DOE personal property located in a mixed 
facility to the contractor who is the operator of that facility.


<R05>
Sec. 109-50.401  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, the following definitions apply;
    Contractor means the operator of the mixed facility.
    DOE property means DOE-owned personal property located in a mixed 
facility.
    Mixed facility means a partly DOE-owned and partly contractor-owned 
facility. For purposes of this subpart, however, this definition does 
not apply to such a facility operated by an educational or other 
nonprofit institution under a basic research contract with DOE.


<R05>
Sec. 109-50.402  Submission of proposals.

    Proposals involving programmatic disposals of DOE personal property 
located in mixed facilities to contractors operating that facility shall 
be forwarded through the appropriate program organization to the DPMO, 
for review and processing for approval. Each such request shall include 
all information necessary for a proper evaluation of the proposal. The 
proposal shall include, as a minimum:
    (a) The purpose of the mixed facility;
    (b) The description, condition, acquisition cost, and present use of 
the DOE personal property involved.
    (c) The programmatic benefits which could accrue to DOE from the 
disposal to the contractor (including the considerations which become 
important if the disposal is not made);
    (d) The appraised value of the DOE personal property (preferably by 
independent appraisers); and
    (e) The proposed terms and conditions of disposal including:
    (1) Price;
    (2) Priority to be given work for DOE requiring the use of the 
transferred property, and including the basis for any proposed charge to 
DOE for amortizing the cost of plant and equipment items;
    (3) Recapture of the property if DOE foresees a possible future 
urgent need; and
    (4) Delivery of the property, whether ``as is-where is,'' etc.


<R05>
Sec. 109-50.403  Need to establish DOE program benefit.

    When approval for a proposed programmatic disposal of DOE personal 
property in a mixed facility is being sought, it must be established 
that the disposal will benefit a DOE program.

[[Page 393]]

For example, approval might be contingent on showing that:
    (a) The entry of the contractor as a private concern into the energy 
program is important and significant from a programmatic standpoint; and
    (b) The sale of property to the contractor will remove obstacles

                   Subpart 115-1.1--Regulation System


<R05>
Sec. 115-1.100  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart establishes the Environmental Protection Agency 
Property Management Regulations (EPPMR), chapter 115 of the Federal 
Property Management Regulations System (FPMR) (41 CFR chapter 101); 
states its relationship to the FPMR, and provides instructions governing 
the property management policies and procedures of the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA).


<R05>
Sec. 115-1.103  Temporary-type FPMR.


<R05>
Sec. 115-1.103-50  Temporary-type changes to EPPMR.

    Where required, temporary changes will be published as EPPMR-
Temporary Regulations. Temporary Regulations will be cross-referenced to 
related EPPMR subparts and will indicate dates for compliance with, and 
cancellation of each issuance.


<R05>
Sec. 115-1.104  Publication of FPMR.


<R05>
Sec. 115-1.104-50  Publication of EPPMR.

    (a) Material published in the EPPMR will generally not be of 
interest to nor directly affect the public. Therefore, most EPPMR 
material will not be published in the Federal Register.
    (b) Arrows printed in the margin of a page indicate material 
changed, deleted, or added by the EPPMR Transmittal Notice cited at the 
bottom of that page. (See GSA, FPMR Amendment Transmittal pages for 
illustrations.)


<R05>
Sec. 115-1.106  Applicability of FPMR.

    The FPMR apply to all EPA activities unless otherwise specified, or 
unless a deviation is approved.


<R05>
Sec. 115-1.108  Agency implementation and supplementation of FPMR.

    (a) EPPMR implements and supplements the FPMR and follows the FPMR 
in style, arrangement and numbering sequence. Except to assure 
continuity and understanding FPMR material will not be repeated or 
paraphrased in the EPPMR.
    (b) Implementing material expands upon related material in the FPMR. 
Supplementing material deals with subject material not covered in the 
FPMR.


<R05>
Sec. 115-1.109  Numbering in FPMR system.

    (a) The numbering system used in EPPMR conforms to that of the FPMR 
except for the chapter number. The first three digits represent the 
Chapter number assigned to this Agency in title 41, Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR). In FPMR the chapter number is 101 and in EPPMR the 
Chapter number is 115.
    (b) Where EPA Chapter 115 implements Chapter 101 the material will 
be numbered and captioned to correspond to the FPMR part, subpart, 
section or subsection, e.g., 115-1.106 ``Applicability of FPMR'' 
implements 101-1.106 of FPMR.
    (c) Where Chapter 115 supplements the FPMR and deals with subject 
matter not contained in the FPMR, the EPPMR material is numbered to 
follow that which is most closely related to similar material in the 
FPMR, Supplementing material is numbered ``50'' or higher.


<R05>
Sec. 115-1.110  Deviations.

    Where deemed necessary that regulations set forth in the FPMR or 
EPPMR be changed in the interest of program effectiveness, a proposed 
revision will be submitted in accordance with FPR Sec. 1-1.009, to the 
Division of Data and

[[Page 402]]

Support Systems (DSSD) for review and consideration.

<R04>
                   Subpart 128-1.1--Regulation System


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.100  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart introduces the Department of Justice Property 
Management Regulations (JPMR) as part of the Federal Property Management 
Regulations System (FPMR) (41 CFR part 101); states its relationship to 
the FPMR; and provides instructions for the issuance and use of these 
property management policies and procedures of the Department of 
Justice.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.101  Justice Property Management Regulations.

    The JPMR, established in this subpart, implement and supplement, as 
necessary, the FPMR provisions governing the acquisition, utilization, 
management, and disposal of real and personal property. The JPMR are 
issued to establish uniform property management policies, regulations, 
and, as necessary, procedures in the Department of Justice.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.105  Authority for JPMR.

    The Department of Justice Property Management Regulations are 
prescribed by the Assistant Attorney General for Administration under 
authority of 5 U.S.C. 301, 40 U.S.C. 486(c), 41 CFR 101-1.108, and 28 
CFR 0.75(j).


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.152  Citation.

    The JPMR will be cited in accordance with the Federal Register 
standards applicable to the FPMR. Accordingly, when this section is 
referred to formally in official documents, it should be cited as ``41 
CFR 128-1.152.'' When a section of the JPMR is referred to informally, 
however, it may be identified simply by ``JPMR'' followed by the 
complete paragraph reference number, e.g., ``JPMR 128-1.152.''

Administration; the Immigration and Naturalization Service; the Drug 
Enforcement Administration; the Bureau of Prisons; the Federal Prison 
Industries, Incorporated; and the Operations Support Staff (OSS) of the

<R05>
Sec. 128-1.5002-5  Personal property.

    Property of any kind or interest therein, except real and related 
property (as defined in FPMR 41 CFR 101-43.104-15), records of the 
Federal Government, and naval vessels, cruisers, aircraft-carriers, 
destroyers, and submarines (FPMR 41 CFR 101-43.104-13). For management 
and accounting control, personal property is categorized as follows:
    (a) ``Expendable personal property'' is that which, by its nature or 
function, is consumed in use; is used as repair parts or components of 
an end product considered nonexpendable; or has an expected service life 
of less than one year.
    (b) ``Non-expendable personal property'' is that which is complete 
within itself, does not lose its identity or become a component part of 
another article when put into use, and is of a durable nature with an 
expected service life one or more years.
    (c) ``Controlled personal property'' is that personal property for 
which good management practice dictates that it would be in the interest 
of the Government to assign and record accountability to assure the 
proper use, maintenance, protection and disposal of property for which 
the Government is responsible. Includes, but is not restricted to 
property which:
    (1) Is leased by, in the custody of, or is loaned to or from the 
Department.
    (2) Due to inherent attractiveness and/or portability is subject to 
a high probability of theft or misuse.
    (3) Is warranted, requires knowledge of age and/or previous repair 
data when determining whether repair or replacement is appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.5002-6  Personal property management.

    A system for controlling the acquisition, receipt, storage issue, 
utilization, maintenance, protection, accountability, and disposal of 
personal property to best satisfy the program needs of the Department.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.5002-7  Property management officer (PMO).

    An individual responsible for the overall administration, 
coordination, and control of the personal property management program of

individual's official job title.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.5002-8  Property custodian (PC).

    An individual responsible for the immediate physical custody of all 
personal property under his control and for providing documentation as 
required on all actions affecting the personal property within his 
jurisdiction. The designation as PC may or may not correspond to the 
individual's official job title.

[[Page 407]]


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.5002-9  Supply support system.

    The sum of all actions taken in providing buildings, equipment, 
supplies, and services to support program areas.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.5003  Primary authority and responsibility.

    (a) The Attorney General of the United States has the primary 
authority and responsibility for providing direction, leadership, and 
general supervision in the development and administration of an 
effective and efficient supply support system for the Department, to 
include:
    (1) The establishment of Department-wide policies, directions, 
regulations, and procedures satisfying the requirements of law, 
regulations, and sound management practice; and
    (2) The review, evaluation, and improvement of personal property 
management programs, functions, operations, and procedures throughout 
the Department.
    (b) Pursuant to 28 CFR 0.75 and subject to the general supervision 
of the Attorney General and the direction of the Deputy Attorney 
General, the functions described above are assigned to the Assistant 
Attorney General for Administration as delegations of authority.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.5004  Basis for delegations of authority and assignment of responsibilities.

    Certain personal property management functions can be performed by 
an individual only under a specific grant of authority to that 
individual. Other functions may be performed simply on the basis of 
general instructions or directions or by virtue of an individual 
occupying the position to which the responsibility for the function is 
assigned. In either situation, to eliminate excessive delay and to 
reduce unnecessary involvement of multiple management levels, it is 
considered generally desirable to place authority and responsibility for 
and to exercise property management actions at the lowest organizational 
unit practical. Accordingly, specific redelegations of the authority 
vested in the Assistant Attorney General for Administration are made to 
the heads of bureaus for the personal property management functions 
listed in Sec. 128-1.5005 below. The authority to prescribe and issue 
Department-wide policies, regulations, and procedures for personal 
property management is not redelegated and remains solely within the 
jurisdiction of the Assistant Attorney General for Administration.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.5005  Delegations of authority.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.5005-1  Primary delegations.

    The following authorities are redelegated to the heads of bureaus 
for use within their respective jurisdictions and shall be exercised in 
accordance with the policies and procedures established by the Assistant 
Attorney General for Administration.
    (a) Designating the PMO, for the bureau, within the following 
limitations:
    (1) Only one PMO is to be designated for the bureau, at the bureau 
level. Neither the title designation nor the responsibilities of the PMO 
are to be delegated below that level.
    (2) One or more PC's also may be designated for the bureau, 
depending upon the size and complexity of the organizational structure. 
Each PC is responsible solely for that property within his respective 
jurisdiction. The number and distribution of PC's designated is entirely 
at the option of the head of the bureau.
    (3) There is no restriction on designating a single individual as 
PMO and PC providing that the functions and responsibilities are 
compatible and are within the capabilities of a single person.
    (b) Authorizing exceptions to the FPMR use and replacement standards 
for office machines, furniture, furnishings and typewriters specified in 
Secs. 101-25.3 and 101-25.4.
    (c) Authorizing exceptions to FPMR replacement standards for 
materials handling equipment specified in Sec. 101-25.304.
    (d) Authorizing the procurement of passenger motor vehicles with 
additional systems or equipment or the procurement of additional systems 
or equipment for passenger motor vehicles already owned or operated by 
the Government, in conformance with Federal Standards No. 122 and 
Sec. 101-25.304.

[[Page 408]]

    (e) Authorizing the retention for official use by the bureau of 
abandoned or other unclaimed personal property and of personal property 
which is voluntarily abandoned or forfeited other than by court decree.
    (f) Determining when personal property becomes excess and reporting 
the excess property to the General Services Administration (GSA).
    (g) Assigning or transferring excess personal property within the 
bureau to other bureaus of the Department, other Federal agencies, the 
Legislative Branch to the Judicial Branch, to wholly-owned or mixed-
ownership Government corporations, to cost-reimbursable type 
contractors, or to authorized grantees.
    (h) Transferring property forfeited to the Government to other 
authorized recipients or requesting judicial transfer of such property 
from others to the bureau.
    (i) Determining fair market value of abandoned and other unclaimed 
property retained for official use by the bureau, for deposit to a 
special fund for reimbursement of owners.
    (j) Approving claims and reimbursing, less direct costs, former 
owners of abandoned or other unclaimed personal property which has been 
sold or retained for official use.
    (k) Recommending non-Federal grantee excess property screeners to 
GSA as required in FPMR 101-43.320(h).
    (l) When authorized by statutory authority, vesting title to 
Government-furnished personal property in contractors or grantees.
    (m) Acquiring excess personal property from other bureaus and from 
other Federal agencies.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.5005-2  Redelegations of authority.

    (a) The authorities delegated by the Assistant Attorney General for 
Administration to heads of bureaus may, in turn, be redelegated as 
necessary to enable personal property management functions to be 
performed at the organizational level best equipped to handle such 
functions, unless otherwise prohibited by this regulation.
    (b) Such redelegations can be made without the specific approval of 
the Assistant Attorney General for Administration to deputies, principal 
administrative officers, heads of field offices and installations and 
their respective deputies. Such redelegations shall not conflict with 
the duties or responsibilities assigned to the PMO, or PC under the 
JPMR.
    (c) Existing delegations of authority by the Assistant Attorney 
General for Administration in matters of personal property management 
which are not covered in this section shall continue in effect until 
modified or revoked.
    (d) Redelegations of authorities made in accordance with this 
section shall be in writing and shall be made available for audits, 
surveys, or as otherwise appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.5006  General responsibilities.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.5006-1  Head of bureau.

    The head of a bureau is responsible for establishing and 
administering a property management program within his respective 
operation which will provide for:
    (a) The planning and scheduling of property requirements to assure 
that supplies, equipment, and space are readily available to satisfy 
program needs while minimizing operating costs and inventory levels.
    (b) The creation and maintenance of complete, accurate inventory 
control and accountability record systems.
    (c) The maximum utilization of available property for official 
purposes.

Sec. 128-1.8001  Background.

    The Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 (Act), 42 U.S.C. 7701, 
et seq., as amended, directs the Federal government to establish and 
maintain an effective earthquake hazards reduction program to reduce the 
risks to life and property from future earthquakes. Executive Order 
12699 implements certain provisions of the Act by requiring Federal 
agencies responsible for the design and construction of new buildings to 
develop and implement a seismic safety program. The regulations in this 
subpart implement the Executive Order, and apply to buildings designed 
and constructed under the responsibility of the Department of Justice. 
These regulations do not apply to buildings used by the Department and 
obtained, through purchase or lease, by the General Services 
Administration or other Federal agencies.

<R05>
Sec. 128-1.8005  Seismic safety standards.

    (a) To meet the building and construction requirements of this 
subpart, the Department, except as noted, adopts as its seismic safety 
standards the seismic safety levels set forth in the model building 
codes that the Interagency Committee on Seismic Safety in Construction 
(ICSSC) recognizes and recommends as appropriate for implementing the 
Executive Order. The ICSSC, as of the date of this rule, recognizes and 
recommends:
    (1) The 1991 International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO) 
Uniform Building Code (UBC);
    (2) The 1992 Supplement to the Building Officials and Code 
Administrators International (BOCA) National Building Code (NBC); and
    (3) The 1992 Amendments to the Southern Building Code Congress 
(SBCC) Standard Building Code (SBC).
    (b) The seismic design and construction of a covered building shall 
conform to the model code applicable in the locality where the building 
is constructed, unless:
    (1) The building code for the locality provides a higher level of 
seismic safety than provided by the appropriate model code, in which 
case the local code shall be utilized as the standard; or
    (2) The locality does not have seismic safety building requirements, 
in which case the ICSSC model building code appropriate for that 
geographic area shall be utilized as the standard.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.8006  Seismic Safety Program requirements.

    The Department Seismic Safety Coordinator and each Component Seismic 
Safety Coordinator shall ensure that an individual familiar with seismic 
design provisions of the Seismic Safety Standards (appropriate 
standards), or a professional, licensed engineer shall conduct the 
reviews required under this section, as appropriate.
    (a) New building projects-- Construction documents initiated after 
August 12, 1993, and which apply to new construction projects, shall 
comply with the appropriate standards and shall be reviewed for 
compliance. Once the reviewer determines that the documents comply, the 
reviewer shall affix his/her signature and seal (if a licensed engineer) 
to the approved documents and provide a statement certifying compliance 
with the appropriate standards.
    (b) Existing building projects.-- For new buildings with 
construction documents that were initiated prior to August 12, 1993, the 
documents shall be reviewed to determine whether they comply with the 
appropriate standards. If the reviewer determines that the documents 
comply with the standard, the reviewer shall affix his/her signature and 
seal (if a licensed engineer) to the approved documents and provide a 
statement certifying compliance with the appropriate standards. If the 
reviewer determines that seismic deficiencies exist, the appropriate 
Component Head shall ensure completion of one of the following:
    (1) For a new building project for which a contract for construction 
has

[[Page 412]]

not been awarded, the construction documents shall be revised to 
incorporate the appropriate standards. The revised construction 
documents shall then be reviewed for compliance. Once the reviewer 
determines that the documents comply with the standard, the reviewer 
shall affix his/her signature and seal (if a licensed engineer) to the 
approved documents and provide a statement certifying compliance with 
the Department standards.
    (2) For a new building under construction, or for which construction 
has been completed, a corrective action plan shall be devised to bring 
the building into compliance with the appropriate standards. The plan 
shall then be reviewed for compliance. Once the reviewer determines that 
the plan complies with the standard, the reviewer shall affix his/her 
signature and seal (if a licensed engineer) to the approved documents 
and provide a statement certifying compliance with the Department 
standards. The Component Head shall ensure implementation of the 
approved plan.
    (3) For an addition to an existing building, the review shall 
account for, in addition to the requirements provided in paragraphs (b) 
(1) or (2) of this section, as appropriate, any effect the addition will 
have on the seismic resistance of the existing portion of the structure. 
If the reviewer determines that the addition will decrease the level of 
seismic resistance of the existing building, the appropriate Component 
Head shall develop a plan of corrective action to restore the seismic 
integrity of the existing structure. Once the plan of corrective action 
has been accomplished, the reviewer shall verify that the current level 
of seismic resistance of the existing building at least equals the 
seismic resistance level of the building before the addition.
    (c) The Department Seismic Safety Coordinator and each Component 
Seismic Safety Coordinator shall ensure that statements verifying 
compliance made under this subpart have been completed and retained by 
the appropriate contracting officer when the Department contracted for 
design or design review services, or by an individual designated by the 
Component Head where the Department has not contracted for either design 
or design review.


<R05>
Sec. 128-1.8007  Reporting.

     Subpart 128-50.1--Storage and Care of Seized Personal Property


<R05>
Sec. 128-50.100  Storage and care.

    (a) Each bureau shall be responsible for providing that its seized 
personal property storage facilities meet the safeguarding standards 
applicable to the type of property being stored.
    (b) Each bureau shall be responsible for performing care on its 
seized personal property to prevent the unnecessary deterioration of 
such property. In particular, a bureau preparing a seized vehicle for 
storage should be at a minimum;
    (1) Protect the cooling system from freezing;
    (2) Protect the battery by assuring it is properly watered;
    (3) Protect the tires by inflating to correct pressure;
    (4) Remove all articles found in the vehicle's interior (for 
example, easily removable radios, tape players, and speakers) and all 
exterior accessories (for example, wheel covers) that are subject to 
pilferage and properly store them; and
    (5) Shut all windows and lock all doors and compartments that have 
locks.


<R05>
Sec. 128-50.101  Inventory records.

    Each bureau shall be responsible for establishing and maintaining 
inventory records of its seized personal property to ensure that:
    (a) The date the property was seized is recorded;
    (b) All of the property associated with a case is recorded together 
under the case name and number;
    (c) The location of storage of the property is recorded;
    (d) A well documented chain of custody is kept; and
    (e) All information in the inventory records is accurate and 
current.


<R05>
Sec. 128-50.102  Periodic reviews.

    Each bureau shall be responsible for performing an independent 
accountability review at least once a year to ensure compliance with 
this subpart and with the bureau's procedures for the handling, storage, 
and disposal of its seized personal property. In particular, a bureau 
conducting a review shall verify that the inventory records are 
accurate, current, and are being kept in accordance with established 
inventory procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 128-50.103  Investigation of any discrepancy.

    (a) Upon discovery of any discrepancy between the inventory records 
and the bureau's actual amount of seized personal property, a board of 
survey shall conduct an investigation in accordance with 41 CFR 128-
51.1.
    (b) If the discrepancy cannot be eliminated and involves a shortage, 
the bureau shall notify the U.S. attorney in charge of the litigation 
involving the missing property of the shortage as soon as possible.
    (c) If the discrepancy cannot be eliminated and involves an overage, 
the bureau shall determine if the property has any evidentiary value. If 
the property does have evidentiary value, the property shall be properly 
stored and inventoried. If the property does not have any evidentiary 
value, the bureau shall determine whether the property is forfeitable to 
the United States, voluntarily abandoned, or abandoned. Proper 
proceedings shall be commenced as soon as possible to vest title of the 
forfeitable property in the United States. The voluntarily abandoned and 
abandoned property shall be kept in custody in accordance with 41 CFR 
101-48 and any applicable Justice property management 
          regulations.  CHAPTERS 129-200 [RESERVED]
